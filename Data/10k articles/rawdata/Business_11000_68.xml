{{for|ads that follow you around|behavioral retargeting}}

'''Ad tracking''', also known as post-testing or ad effectiveness tracking, is in-market research that [[Copy testing|monitors a brand’s performance]] including [[brand awareness|brand]] and [[advertising]] awareness, product trial and usage, and attitudes about the brand versus their competition.

Depending on the speed of the [[purchase cycle]] in the category, tracking can be done continuously (a few interviews every week) or it can  be “pulsed,” with interviews conducted in widely spaced waves (ex. every three or six months). Interviews can either be conducted with separate, matched samples of consumers, or with a single ([[longitudinal study|longitudinal]]) panel that is interviewed over time.

Since the researcher has information on when the ads launched, the length of each advertising flight, the money spent, and when the interviews were conducted, the results of ad tracking can provide information on the effects of advertising.

==Purpose==
The purpose of ad tracking is generally to provide a measure of the combined effect of the [[media weight]] or spending level, the effectiveness of the media buy or targeting, and the quality of the advertising executions or creative.

Advertisers use the results of ad tracking to estimate the [[return on investment]] (ROI) of advertising, and to refine advertising plans. Sometimes, tracking data are used to provide inputs to Marketing Mix Models which marketing science statisticians build to estimate the role of advertising, as compared to [[pricing]], distribution and other marketplace variables on sales of the brand.

==Methodology==
Today, most ad tracking studies are conducted via the [[Internet]]. Some ad tracking studies are conducted continuously and others are conducted at specific points in time (typically before the advertising appears in market, and then again after the advertising has been running for some period of time). The two approaches use different types of analyses, although both start by measuring advertising awareness. Typically, the respondent is either shown a brief portion of a commercial or a few memorable still images from the TV ad. Other media typically are cued using either branded or de-branded visual of the ad. Then, respondents answer three significant questions.
# Do you recognize this ad? (recognition measure)
# Please type in the sponsor of this ad. ([[Wiktionary: unaided awareness|unaided awareness]] measure)
# Please choose from the following list, the sponsor of this ad. ([[Wiktionary: aided awareness|aided awareness]] measure)

The continuous tracking design analyzes advertising awareness over time, in relation to ad spending; separately, this design tracks brand awareness, and then develops indices of effectiveness based on the strength of the correlations between ad spending and brand awareness.

The most popular alternate approach to the continuous tracking design is the [[Communicants]] System longitudinal design, in which the same people are interviewed at two points in time. Changes in brand measures (for example, brand purchasing and future [[purchase intention]]s) exhibited among those who have seen the advertising are compared to the changes in brand measures that occurred among those unaware of advertising. By means of this method, the researchers can isolate those marketplace changes that were produced by advertising versus those that would have occurred without advertising.

==Internet tracking==
There are several different tools to track [[online ad]]s: [[banner ad]]s, [[Pay per click|ppc]] ads, [[pop-up ad]]s, and other types.  Several online advertising companies such as [[Google]] offer their own ad [[internet tracking|tracking]] service ([[Google Analytics]]) in order to effectively use their service to generate a positive ROI.  Third-party ad tracking services are commonly used by affiliate marketers.  Affiliate marketers are frequently unable to have access to the order page and therefore are unable to use a 3rd-party tool.  Many different companies have created tools to effectively track their commissions in order to optimize their profit potential.  The information provided will show the marketer which advertising methods are generating income and which are not and allows him to effectively allocate his budget.

==Measures==
Here is a list of some of the data a post-test might provide:

The '''310 West Church Street Apartments''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Duval/state.html Duval County listings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=duval Duval County listings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216141414/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=Duval |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Ambassador Hotel''', is a historic building located at 420 North Julia Street in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. On April 7, 1983, it was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
The structure is a brick, six-story building designed in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] architectural style containing [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] elements. It opened as the upscale 310 West Church Street Apartments in 1924. Designed by [[Hentz, Reid and Adler]] architects, the building was designed in an "H"-shape to provide windows in all of the units. The main entrance is fronted by large rusticated ashlar stonework, set with a scroll keystone.&lt;ref name=MYFL&gt;[http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=duval State of Florida, Division of Historical Resources, Florida's History Through Its Places/Duval County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216141414/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/index.cfm?fuseaction=ListAreas&amp;county=Duval |date=2007-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After twenty years of use, it was converted into a hotel. Its name subsequently changed several times: it was the Three-Ten Hotel in 1944, the Hotel Southland in 1947, the Griner Hotel in 1949 and in 1955, the Ambassador Hotel.&lt;ref name=FTU&gt;Turner, Kevin (July 17, 2009) [http://www.jacksonville.com/business/2009-07-16/story/historic_downtown_hotel_eyed_for_renovation "Historic downtown hotel eyed for renovation"] ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]''. Retrieved July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the building was purchased by Sam Easton, now a principal in the Jacksonville real estate firm Easton Sanderson &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escresults.com/people.html Easton, Sanderson &amp; Co. website], Sam Easton/Ambassador Hotel&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the hotel fell into disrepair as Jacksonville's downtown went into decline. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983, but this did not significantly improve its fortunes. It was converted into a low-rent [[single room occupancy]], with rooms rented by the week. It closed in 1998.&lt;ref name=FTU/&gt;

==Renovation==
In 2005, Jacksonville businessman Lamonte Carter initiated plans to purchase and restore 310 West Church Street. He had encountered the building when he happened to park in front of it on his way to an appointment. He contacted Easton, who had halted a plan to renovate the surrounding block after construction stalled on the [[Duval County Courthouse]], located nearby. Carter's plan for 310 West Church, which would cost an estimated $8 million in private equity, government grants, and low-interest loans, involved converting the ground floor to commercial space and turning the top five floors into 50 unit apartments. Carter hoped the renovation will lead to a further collaboration with Easton to renovate the block.&lt;ref name=FTU /&gt;

Subsequently, the historic property was acquired by Axis Hotels LLC, which announced plans in 2018 to turn the building into a 4- or 5-star boutique hotel with 100 rooms and a rooftop bar. Axis also purchased the adjacent former Marine National Bank building at 404 North Julia Street, which the company plans to demolish to construct a 200-unit apartment building with 15,000 square feet of retail space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ambassador Hotel coming back to life? |url=https://www.thejaxsonmag.com/article/the-ambassador-hotel-coming-back-to-life/ |website=The Jaxson Mag |publisher=Modern Cities, in association with WJCT |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was born in [[Monkton, Ayrshire|Monkton]], [[South Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]]. He was the only son and eldest child of [[Thomas Burns (minister)|Thomas Burns]] and Clementina Grant and the great-nephew of the poet [[Robert Burns]]. He came to Otago with his father in the ''[[Philip Laing]]'' arriving in [[Port Chalmers]] on 15 April 1848.&lt;ref name="NZETC Burns"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Otago &amp; Southland Provincial Districts |year=1905 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc04Cycl-t1-body1-d2-d6-d2.html#name-427765-mention |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate= 8 July 2010 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Ex-Members}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a prominent part in provincial affairs and was a member of the Provincial Council from 1855 to 1859 and again from 1863 to 1870. On three occasions, he served on the Executive Council of the [[Otago Province]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=217}} He was also a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives on three occasions; [[Bruce (New Zealand electorate)|Bruce]] 1865–1866, [[Caversham (New Zealand electorate)|Caversham]] 1866–1870 when he resigned, and [[Roslyn (New Zealand electorate)|Roslyn]] 1875–1878 when he resigned.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=187}} He vigorously opposed the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] in 1876.

On 6 April 1861 he married Sarah Scott Dickson, with whom he had 11 children.

He founded the Mosgiel Woollen Company in 1871 in an area on the western outskirts of Dunedin. Burns named the town Mosgiel after his great-uncle Robert Burns's Mossgiel farm in [[Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampantscotland.com/placenames/placename_dunedin.htm Scottish Place Names - Dunedin, New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; He imported skilled labour and specialised equipment from [[Great Britain]] to begin large scale [[clothmaking]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz/wehavegotitmade/Timeline.aspx Manufacturing in New Zealand Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324134458/http://www.buykiwimade.govt.nz/wehavegotitmade/Timeline.aspx |date=24 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mill formed the backbone of the Mosgiel economy for decades.

Burns died on 15 September 1901 and is memorialised in the names of two schools - Arthur Burns School in Mosgiel and the Arthur Burns Early Learning Centre. Arthur Burns School in Mosgiel has since been amalgamated with two other primary schools in the region.

'''Buck passing''', or '''passing the buck''', is the act of attributing to another person or group, one's own responsibility. It is often used to refer to a strategy in [[power politics]] whereby a state tries to get another state to deter or possibly fight an aggressor state while it remains on the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Mearsheimer|title=The Tragedy of Great Power Politics|year=2001|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393076240|pages=157–58|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Tragedy_of_Great_Power_Politics.html?id=lDzCD_C_ipoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The expression is said to have originated from [[poker]], in which a marker or counter (such as a knife with a buckhorn handle during the [[American Frontier]] era) was used to indicate the person whose turn it was to [[poker dealer|deal]]. If the player did not wish to deal he could pass the responsibility by passing the "[[button (poker)|buck]]", as the counter came to be called, to the next player.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford M. Mathews, ed., ''A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1951), I, pp. 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another less common but arguably less fanciful attribution is to the French expression ''[[:fr:bouc émissaire|bouc émissaire]]'', meaning "scapegoat", whereby passing the ''bouc'' is equivalent to passing the blame or onus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Chapel-Sermons-Lectures/innocent.pdf|format=PDF|title=Sermon preached by Professor Paul Gifford, in Christ’s College, Cambridge|date=17 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322082138/http://www3.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Chapel-Sermons-Lectures/innocent.pdf|archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''bouc émissaire'' and ''[[scapegoat]]'' both originate from an [[Old Testament]] ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+16%3A6-10 Lev. 16:6–10]) reference to an animal that was ritually made to carry the burden of sins, after which the "buck" was sent or "passed"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} into the wilderness to expiate them.

==In international relations==
Passing the buck in international relations theory involves the tendency of nation-states to refuse to confront a growing threat in the hopes that another state will. The most notable example of this was the refusal of the United Kingdom, United States, France, or the [[Soviet Union]] to effectively confront [[Nazi Germany]] during the 1930s. With the [[Munich Agreement]], France and the United Kingdom successfully avoided armed confrontation with Germany, passing the buck to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union then passed the buck back to the western powers by signing the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Christensen|first = Thomas|author2 = Jack Snyder|title = Chain Gangs and Passed Bucks: Predicting Alliance Patterns in Multipolarity|journal = International Organization|volume = 44|issue = 2|pages = 137–68|year = 1990|url = http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~olau/ir/archive/chr1.pdf|format = PDF|deadurl = yes|accessdate = June 6, 2017|doi = 10.1017/S0020818300035232|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195946/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~olau/ir/archive/chr1.pdf|archivedate = September 7, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[John Mearsheimer]] argues that the delay of the Normandy invasion shows that a buck passing state can shift the balance of power in its favor: "There is no question that the United States benefited greatly from delaying the Normandy invasion until late in the war, when both the German and the Soviet armies were battered and worn down. Not surprisingly, [[Joseph Stalin]] believed that the United Kingdom and the United States were purposely allowing Germany and the Soviet Union to bleed each other white, so that those offshore balancers [the United States and the United Kingdom] could dominate postwar Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Mearsheimer|title=The Tragedy of Great Power Politics|year=2001|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393076240|page=160|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lDzCD_C_ipoC&amp;pg=PT177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="The buck stops here"==
[[Image:Truman pass-the-buck.jpg|thumb|At the recreation of the Truman [[Oval Office]] at the Truman Library in 1959, the former [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]]  poses by his old desk which has the famous "The Buck Stops Here" sign.]]

'''"The buck stops here"''' is a phrase that was popularized by [[U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], who kept a sign with that phrase on his desk in the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref name="trumanlibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/buckstop.htm|title=Truman: The Buck Stops Here|work=trumanlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase refers to the notion that the President has to make the decisions and accept the ultimate responsibility for those decisions. Truman received the sign as a gift from a prison warden who was also an avid poker player. It is also the motto of the [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy|U.S. Naval Aircraft Carrier]] [[USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)|USS ''Harry S. Truman'' (CVN-75)]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan R. Van Meter, ''[[Tippecanoe and Tyler Too]]: Famous Slogans and Catchphrases in American History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Jimmy Carter]] arranged to borrow the sign from the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Buck Stops Here’ To Be Sign of Carter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/06/archives/buck-stops-here-to-be-sign-of-carter.html|accessdate=30 August 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 February 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage from Carter's "Address to the Nation on Energy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tPePpMxJaA|title=President Jimmy Carter – Address to the Nation on Energy|date=28 March 2008|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the sign on the desk during his administration.

The reverse of the sign reads, "I'm from Missouri."&lt;ref name="trumanlibrary" /&gt; This is a reference to Truman's home state, as well as [[Willard Duncan Vandiver]]'s statement, "I'm from Missouri. You've got to show me".

'''CMD Group''', formerly Reed Construction Data and Construction Market Data, is a provider of [[business information]] for the [[North America]]n construction industry. CMD is owned by [[Warburg Pincus]] (51%) and [[Reed Business Information]] (49%). Its historical roots lie in Construction Market Data, founded in 1982 to publish construction leads and market data. In 2000, London-based [[Reed Elsevier]] purchased this original CMD Group, transitioning the company to Reed Construction Data.

In October 2014 [[private equity firm]] Warburg Pincus in New York purchased a majority stake in the company, and Reed Construction Data changed its name to CMD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt; The Norcross, Ga.-based provider of North American construction data said the new name is a nod to the company’s original name: Construction Market Data. The new brand includes an updated logo and website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2014/10/01/reed-construction-data-rebrands-itself-as-cmd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The company tracks data on hundreds of thousands of projects per year, providing coverage of construction projects in both the United States and Canada. The company provides monthly analysis and data for all aspects of the construction industry. CMD also provides a detailed view of construction activity, including historical data, current-year projections and a five-year forecast. Their research helps customers forecast to find those market segments experiencing the greatest growth and plan tactical marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In October 2009, Reed Construction Data (which is now Construction Market Data a division of ConstructCONNECT) filed suit in [[United States district court|federal court]] against [[McGraw-Hill Construction]], charging that the company's Dodge Report had unlawfully accessed confidential and trade secret information from Reed since 2002 by using a series of fake companies to pose as Reed customers.
The lawsuit, filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], seeks an unspecified amount in lost profits and punitive damages, trial by jury, and injunctive relief as a result of Dodge’s misuse of proprietary construction project information, and that Dodge allegedly manipulated the information to create misleading comparisons between Dodge’s and Reed’s products and services in an effort to mislead the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/corporate/press-releases/2009/10/reed-construction-data-files-corporate-espionage-lawsuit-against-mcgraw-hil |title=Reed Construction Data Files Corporate Espionage Lawsuit Against McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge |publisher=Reedconstructiondata.com |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5795">'''Customer knowledge''' ('''CK''') is the combination of experience, value and insight information which is needed, created and absorbed during the transaction and exchange between the [[customer]]s and enterprise.&lt;ref name=gebert2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gebert|first1=Henning|last2=Geib|first2=Malte|last3=Kolbe|first3=Lutz|last4=Riempp|first4=Gerold|url=http://iceb.nccu.edu.tw/proceedings/2002/PDF/f262.pdf|title=Towards customer knowledge management: Integrating customer relationship management and knowledge management concepts|journal=The Second International Conference on Electronic Business (ICEB 2002)|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell (2003) defines customer knowledge as: "organized and structured information about the customer as a result of systematic processing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Campbell, A. J.|year=2003|title=Creating customer knowledge competence: Managing customer relationship management programs strategically|journal=Industrial marketing management|volume=32|pages=375–383|doi=10.1016/S0019-8501(03)00011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitussis et al. (2006), customer knowledge is identified as one of the more complex types of knowledge, since customer knowledge can be captured from different sources and channels.&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khosravi|first1=Arash|last2=Che Hussin|first2=Ab Razak|title=A Review of Customer Knowledge Management Importance|journal=Journal of Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=45–52 |url=http://www.jscdss.com/index.php/files/article/view/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darryn Mitussis|author2=Lisa O'Malley|author3=Maurice Patterson|title=Mapping the re-engagement of CRM with relationship marketing|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=40|issue=5/6|pages=572–589|doi=10.1108/03090560610657840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Various classifications exist:
Gebert et al. (2002), classified customer knowledge from an organization's perspective into three types:&lt;ref  name=gebert2002/&gt;
#knowledge about customers: is gained mainly by [[service management]], offer management, [[complaint management]] and, if available, contract management. The main user processes of knowledge regarding the customer are campaign management and service management, because both processes personalize their services based on user criteria. Knowledge about the customer must be transparent within the company; although its distribution beyond the border of the company must be controlled, as this type of knowledge can often be directly transformed into competitive advantages. The development of such knowledge is also expensive, because knowledge revelation is quite time-consuming.
#knowledge for customers: is mainly developed in processes within the company, for example, the research and development section or a production department. Collecting this knowledge is the responsibility of campaign management. It should be refined according to the customer requirements. It is then disseminated to the other [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) processes, mainly: contract management, offer management, and service management. CRM manages knowledge, transparency and dissemination of knowledge for customers. Maintaining the balance between comprehensibility and precision is the main challenge when managing this kind of knowledge.
#knowledge from customers: can be obtained in the same ways as knowledge about customers. Capturing knowledge from customers is based on the important fact that customers who obtain  their own expertise when utilizing a service or product can be seen as equal partners. This concept is not regularly understood in the business world and its effects have been poorly researched in academia (Garcia-Murillo and Annabi, 2002).&lt;ref name="jscdss.com"/&gt;

The same categorization of customer knowledge has been made by others such as Bueren et al. (2005) and Feng and Tian (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bueren,  A., Schierholz, R., Kolbe, L., and Brenner, W.|year=2005|title=Improving performance  of  customer  processes  with knowledge management|url=https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/a080b16584a378f06199ade7ec9c25e0-en.pdf/Improving_performance_of_customer-processes_with_knowledge_management.pdf|journal=Business Process Management Journal|volume=11|issue=5|pages=573–588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feng, T., Tian, J. (2005), "Customer knowledge management and condition analysis of successful  CKM  implementation", Proceedings  of  the  fourth  international Conference on machine learning and cybernetics, Guanghou, August 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In another categorization, Crié and Micheaux (2006) divide customer knowledge into two types, namely: "Behavioural" (or Quantitative) and "Attitudinal" (or Qualitative). Behavioral knowledge is easy to acquire and is basically quantitative by nature; that is, containing a customer transactional relations with the company. On the other hand, attitudinal knowledge is difficult to acquire because it deals with a customer's [[wikt:state of mind|state of mind]]; but meanwhile it is an important factor for enhancement of customer knowledge because they are directly related to a customer's thoughts and insights.

In 1988, when he was part of Funes, Straschnoy &amp; Dreyfus agency, he partnered with the multinational agency [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] and assumed the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apertura.com/target/Dario-Straschnoy-Una-usina-creativa-exige-ser-coherente-todos-los-dias-20130322-0005.html Carla Quiroga, 'Darío Straschnoy: 'Una usina creativa exige ser coherente todos los días'', ''Apertura Magazine'', 03/22/2013] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, in 2000, the company was bought and absorbed by [[WPP plc|WPP]], one of the largest groups of communication services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/17854-young-rubicam-numero-uno-en-el-pais-y-en-el-mundo Alberto Borrini, 'Young &amp; Rubicam, número uno en el país y en el mundo', ''La Nación newspaper'', 05/23/2000] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliana Benador''' (also '''Eleana Benador''') is a Swiss-American public relations consultant, global strategist, and a publicist for American and Middle Eastern [[neo-conservatives]].&lt;ref name=lobe&gt;Lobe, Jim, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/EH15Aa01.html ''The Andean Condor among the Hawks’'], Asian Times, August 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Through the development of Benador Associates, Benador was promoted national security policies advocated by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] concerning Iraqi regime change, the [[Iraq War]], and [[hard-line]] attitudes toward Iran.&lt;ref name=lobe /&gt;&lt;ref name="cohler-esses"&gt;Cohler-Esses, Larry [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060703/cohleresses ''Bunkum From Benador’'], The Nation, July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Benador had closed Benador Associates and opened a new firm, Benador Public Relations.

==Career==
Benador studied linguistics, psychology and political science at the [[Sorbonne]] and the [[Université Catholique de Lille]]{{when|date=September 2012}}.  Following university, she worked as an editor for the Peruvian Times and as a translator at the United Nations in Vienna.&lt;ref name=hagan&gt;Hagan, Joe, [http://www.observer.com/node/47358 ''She's Richard Perle's Oyster''], The New York Observer, April 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Benador joined the [[Middle East Forum]], an American conservative&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14cair.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin ''Scrutiny Increases for a Group Advocating for Muslims in U.S.''] The New York Times, March 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[think tank]], to work as the associate director of, and in charge of the expansion of, the Middle East Forum in New York, and she also was the media liaison of its founder [[Daniel Pipes]]. Benador left the MEF after eighteen months because of conflicts with Pipes.&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt; According to Pipes, they came to a mutual and amicable "understanding that she would do better on her own."&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt;

In October 2001, Benador began her own public relations firm, Benador &amp; Associates. After signing former C.I.A. director [[James Woolsey]] and ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' columnist [[A.M. Rosenthal]], Benador's firm built a clientele of  American neo-conservatives. Benador was criticized for "acting as a kind of public-relations firm for the war."&lt;ref name=hagan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Brian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/24/worlddispatch.usa ''Conflict and catchphrases''], The Guardian, February 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Benador was appointed Goodwill Ambassador of the Shomron (Samaria) Liaison Office in the U.S. and Europe. In that capacity, she addressed the Rally in Support of Israel across the Israel Consulate in New York City, offering proportional comparison by population of the United States to the numbers of Israeli victims of terrorist attacks; according to Benador the 1,200 Israelis victimized from 2000 to 2010 would correspond to 50,297 Americans, while the 8,342 wounded would compare to 350,000.&lt;ref&gt;Domnitch, Larry, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/143189 ''New York rally: Israel has rights too ''], Arutz Sheva, March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''FSN analysis''', items are classified according to their rate of consumption. The items are classified broadly into three groups: F – means Fast moving, S – means Slow moving, N – means Non-moving. The FSN analysis is conducted generally on the following basis:
*The last date of [[receipt]] of the items or the last date of the issue of items, whichever is later, is taken into account.
*The time period is usually calculated in terms of months or number of days and it pertains to the time elapsed seems the last movement was recorded.
 
FSN analysis helps a company in identification of the following
*The items considered to be “active” may be reviewed regularly on more frequent basis.
*Items whose [[stocks]] at hand are higher as compared to their rates of consumption.
*Non-moving items whose consumption is “nil” or almost insignificant.

A '''fishing license''' (US), '''fishing licence''' or '''fishing permit''' is a regulatory or legal mechanism to control [[fishing]]. Licensing is one mechanism of [[fisheries management]] and may be required for either [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[recreational fishing]].

==Historical licensing==
[[File:Chinese fishing license from the Qing era in the Baojiashu jiyao (1838).jpg|thumb|Chinese fishing license from the Qing era in the ''Baojiashu jiyao'' (1838)]]

In 1765, the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]] government required all fishing boat operators to obtain a fishing license under the ''aojia'' system that regulated coastal populations. The [[Tanka people|Dan]] boat people of [[Guangdong]] had to acquire a fishing license as early as 1729. The wooden license issued by the government was to be displayed on the bow or stern of a boat. The information on the license consisted of the name and age of the boat's owner, the ship's status as either a fishing or commercial vessel, the home port of the boat, crew and family members on board, the date the license was issued, and the registration number of the license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antony|first1=Robert J.|title=Elusive Pirates, Pervasive Smugglers Violence and Clandestine Trade in the Greater China Seas|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888028115|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types by country==
Depending on the jurisdiction, licenses or permits may be required by a government, a property owner, or both.

===United Kingdom===
The  government requires a [[fishing rod|rod]] licence for anyone over the age of 12 who fishes in [[England]], [[Wales]] or the [[River Esk, Dumfries and Galloway|Border Esk]] area in [[Scotland]] for [[salmon]], [[trout]], freshwater fish, [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] or [[eel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/recreation/fishing/38081.aspx |title=Rod Fishing Licence - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Environment Agency |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, anyone who fishes in a non-[[estuarine]] [[stream]], [[lake]], or [[canal]] needs a permit from the owner of the fishing rights to the water body, which might be a local [[angling club]], a landowner with [[riparian right]]s, or an organization such as the [[Canal &amp; River Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/contact-us/faqs/fishing |title=FAQs about fishing at the Canal &amp; River Trust|publisher=Canal &amp; River Trust |location=UK |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], rights to fish in non-tidal freshwater also are owned either by the government or by private entities such as angling club. The ownership of fishing rights in Ireland derives from the [[Plantations of Ireland|confiscation of lands]] by the [[British Crown]] in the 17th century; the boundaries of fishing rights areas typically follow the boundaries of estates granted by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheriesireland.ie/State-Fisheries/history-of-fishing-rights-in-ireland.html |title=History of fishing rights in Ireland |publisher=Inland Fisheries Ireland |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The U.S. state of [[Oregon]] instituted a requirement for commercial fishing licenses in 1899, the same year that the state's [[sturgeon]] fishery had collapsed due to over-harvesting. Oregon began requiring recreational fishing licenses in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfw.state.or.us/agency/history.asp |title=ODFW History, 1792 - 2000 |publisher=Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Indiana]] began issuing [[hunting license]]s in 1901 and added fishing privileges to its hunting license in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/5446.htm |title=History of Fish &amp; Wildlife |publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Pennsylvania]] first issued recreational fishing licenses in 1919. Licenses were required only for nonresidents, and only 50 licenses were issued that first year. In 1922, when the state first required licenses for state residents, over 2,700 nonresident licenses and over 200,000 resident licenses were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishandboat.com/licsal2.htm |title=Pennsylvania Fishing License Sales, 1919 to Present |publisher=Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== License free fishing ==
Some countries don't require a license for recreational sea fishing, provided that certain rules in regard to fish size, numbers and total catch are followed.

=== Belgium ===
Recreational fishing in the sea does not require a license in certain spots. Size limits need to be followed. Also need to have a freshwater permit when fishing on certain seadocks&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/files/sportsfishing-c2362.pdf|title=EU contract FISH/2004/011 on "Sport Fisheries" (or Marine Recreational Fisheries) in the EU|last=Pawson|first=M.

=== Cyprus ===
Sea angling and spear fishing without diving equipment is allowed with no licence. Multiple species including seals, dolphins and turtles are protected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Estonia ===
Estonians have a life-long right to fish with one simple hand line in waters owned by the state and local governments, provided that regulations about species, sizes and seasons are followed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
No license is necessary for recreational sea fishing. There are many detailed regulations about fish species, size limits, fishing methods and prohibited areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nzfishing.com/AboutFishingInNZ/SaltWaterFishinginNZ.htm|title=New Zealand Saltwater Fly Fishing-Sea and saltwater fly fishing in New Zealand-nzfishing|website=nzfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blueseafishing.co.nz/faq.htm|title=FAQ's about New Zealand Fishing Holidays in the Bay of Islands with Blue Sea Charters|website=www.blueseafishing.co.nz|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Sea fishing from the coast and from the boat is free for both residents and visitors, although there are minimum fish rules and other regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/great-outdoors/fishing/sea-fishing/|title=Sea fishing|last=|first=|date=|website=Official travel guide to Norway|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
For fishing in public waters no license is necessary. Foreign citizens are allowed to fish without license only with hand gear. License free fishing is legal along the sea coast (in many cases also on private land along the coast) and in Sweden's five largest lakes – [[Vänern]], [[Vättern]], [[Hjälmaren]], [[Mälaren]] and [[Storsjön]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedenfishing.com/fishing_nature/fishing_rules|title=Fishing rules &amp; ecological angling {{!}} SwedenFishing|website=www.swedenfishing.com|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://relaxfishingsweden.com/en/sport-fishing/sea/|title=The Sea - Relax Fishing Sweden|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swedishepa.se/Enjoying-nature/The-Right-of-Public-Access/This-is-allowed/Hunting-and-fishing/|title=Hunting and fishing|website=Swedish Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Fishing licence for sea fishing is not required in most of the places in the United Kingdom. For salmon and sea trout game licence is required regardless of location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/sea-angling|title=Sea angling|date=2015-11-16|website=Northern Ireland direct - government services|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/fishing-licences|title=Buy a fishing rod licence - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In places where saltwater and freshwater cross over the regulations are complicated and licence may be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://britishseafishing.co.uk/do-i-need-a-fishing-licence-for-sea-fishing/|title=Do I Need A Fishing Licence for Sea Fishing? {{!}} Britishseafishing.co.uk|website=britishseafishing.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. | last2 = Adler | first2 = S. | year = 2015 | title = Defining Commercial Speech in the Context of Food Marketing | url = | journal = Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 40–43 | doi = 10.1111/jlme.12213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to be a complicated procedure, as there are many processes that are used prior to the sale the food product. These include [[food processing]], wholesaling, retailing, food service and transport.&lt;ref name="hawkes2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = C | year = 2007 | title = Regulating and litigating in the public interest: Regulating food marketing to young people worldwide: trends and policy drivers | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 11| pages = 1962–1973 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.101162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these many processes, a multitude of organisations have to be involved in the sale of one food product.&lt;ref name="chandon2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chandon | first1 = P. | last2 = Wansink | first2 = B. | year = 2012 | title = Does food marketing need to make us fat?

For Schaffner &amp; Schroder, 1998, food marketing is the act of communicating to the consumer through a range of marketing techniques in order to add value to a food product and persuade the consumer to purchase. This includes all activities that occur in between the completion of a product through to the purchasing process of consumers.&lt;ref name=schaffner1998&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food marketing management: an international perspective|last=Schaffner|first=D|last2=Schroder|first2=W|last3=Earle|first3=M|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food marketing systems differ worldwide due to the level of development in the particular country, economically and technologically (Kaynak, 1999).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cross-national and cross-cultural issues in food marketing|last=Kaynak|first=E|publisher=International Business Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and interpreting a particular countries food marketing techniques also requires taking into account the socio-economic, cultural, legal-political and technological environment of that country (Kaynak, 1999&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).

== History ==
There are three historical phases of food marketing: the fragmentation phase (before 1870–1880), the unification phase (1880–1950), and the segmentation phase (1950 and later).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tedlow, ''New and Improved: The Story of Mass Marketing in America'', Basic Books, N.Y. 1990 pp 4-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Fragmentation phase (pre-1870–1880) ====
In the fragmentation phase, the United States was divided into numerous geographic fragments because transporting food was expensive, leaving most production, distribution, and selling locally based.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murata | first1 = Y | year = 2007 | title = Taste heterogeneity and the scale of production: Fragmentation, unification, and segmentation | url = | journal = Journal of Urban Economics | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 135–160 | doi = 10.1016/j.jue.2006.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unification phase (1880–1950) ====
In the unification phase, distribution was made possible by [[railroads]], coordination of sales forces was made possible by the [[telegraph]] and telephone, and [[product consistency]] was made possible by advances in manufacturing. This new distribution system was led by meat processors such as [[Armour and Company|Armour]] and Swift in midwestern cities and by companies such as [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Quaker Oats]], [[Campbell Soup]], and [[Coca-Cola]], which sold their brands nationally. [[Advertising]] in print media and [[direct marketing]] through demonstrations at stores and public venues were among the prime marketing tools. The initial [[Crisco]] campaign, in 1911, was an example.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007/&gt;

==== Segmentation phase (1950 to current) ====

In the segmentation phase (1950 and later) radio, television and [[internet advertising]] made it possible for a wider range of competing products to focus on different benefits and images and thus appeal to different [[demographic]] and [[psychographic]] markets. Distribution via the new national road system strengthened national brands.&lt;ref name=son2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=murata2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Food Industry: Lifeline of America. 2nd ed. (1990) E. C. Hampe, E. C., and M. Wittenbery, New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing mix ==
The four components of food marketing are often called the "four Ps" of the [[marketing mix]] because they relate to product, price, promotion, and place.&lt;ref name=wongleedee&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wongleedee | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Marketing Mix and Purchasing Behavior for Community Products at Traditional Markets | url = | journal = Procedia - Social And Behavioral Sciences, 197(7th World Conference on Educational Sciences) | volume = 197| issue = | pages = 2080–2085 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.07.323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marketing Nutrition]]:  Soy Functional Foods, Biotechnology, and [[Obesity]]'', (2007), Brian Wansink, Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason food manufacturers receive the largest percentage of the retail food dollar is that they provide the most differentiating, [[value-added]] service. The money that manufacturers invest in developing, [[pricing]], promotion, and placing their products helps differentiate a food product on the basis of both quality and [[brand-name recognition]].&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; Overall, the marketing mix can add value to a food organisation's product.&lt;ref&gt;Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product ===
In deciding what type of new food products a consumer would most prefer, a manufacturer can either try to develop a new food product or try to modify or extend an existing food. For example, a sweet, flavored yogurt drink would be a new product, but milk in a new flavor (such as chocolate strawberry) would be an extension of an existing product. There are three steps to both developing and extending: generate ideas, screen ideas for feasibility, and test ideas for appeal. Only after these steps will a food product make it to national market. Of one hundred new food product ideas that are considered, only six make it to a [[supermarket]] shelf.

The [[food industry]] faces numerous marketing decisions.  Money can be invested in [[brand building]] (through advertising and other forms of promotion) to increase either quantity demanded or the price consumers are willing to pay for a product. [[Coca-Cola]], for example, spends a great deal of money both on perfecting its formula and on promoting the brand.  This allows Coke to charge more for its product than can makers of regional and smaller brands.
Manufacturers may be able to leverage their existing brand names by developing new product lines.  For example, [[Heinz]] started out as a brand for pickles but branched out into ketchup.  Some brand extensions may involve a risk of damage to the original brand if the quality is not good enough.  Coca Cola, for example, refused to apply the Coke name to a diet drink back when artificial sweeteners had a significantly less attractive taste.  Coke created Tab Cola, but only when aspartame (NutraSweet) was approved for use in soft drinks did Coca Cola come out with a Diet Coke.
Manufacturers that have invested a great deal of money in brands may have developed a certain level of consumer brand loyalty—that is, a tendency for consumers to continue to buy a preferred brand even when an attractive offer is made by competitors.  For loyalty to be present, it is not enough to merely observe that the consumer buys the same brand consistently.  The consumer, to be brand loyal, must be able to actively resist promotional efforts by competitors.  A brand loyal consumer will continue to buy the preferred brand even if a competing product is improved, offers a price promotion or premium, or receives preferred display space.  Some consumers have multi-brand loyalty.  Here, a consumer switches between a few preferred brands.  The consumer may either alternate for variety or may, as a rule of thumb, buy whichever one of the preferred brands is on sale.  This consumer, however, would not switch to other brands on sale.  Brand loyalty is, of course, a matter of degree.  Some consumers will not switch for a moderate discount, but would switch for a large one or will occasionally buy another brand for convenience or variety.

The product of the marketing mix refers to the goods and/or services that the organisation will offer to the consumer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; An organisation can achieve this by either creating a new food product, or by modifying or improving an existing food product.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; For example, an organic almond yoghurt drink would be considered a new product, whereas a chocolate flavoured milk drink would be an extension of an existing product (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014). The three steps to develop and extend a food product include generating ideas, analysing the ideas for feasibility and testing ideas for demand. Once these steps have successfully been completed, the food product can then be manufactured to the food market.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt;

=== Price ===
In profitably [[food price|pricing]] the [[food]], the manufacturer must keep in mind that the [[retailer]] adds approximately 50 percent to the price of a wholesale product. For example, a frozen food sold in a retail store for $4.50 generates an income of $3.00 for the manufacturer. This money has to pay for the cost of [[food production|producing]], [[food packaging|packaging]], shipping, storing, and selling the product.

Price encompasses the amount of money paid by the consumer in order to purchase the food product.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; When pricing the food products, the manufacturer must bear in mind that the retailer will add a particular percentage to the price on the wholesale product. This percentage amount differs globally.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt; The percentage is used to pay for the cost of producing, packaging, shipping, storing and selling the food product. For example, the purchasing of a food product in a supermarket selling for $3.50 generates an income of $2.20 for the manufacturer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt;

=== Promotion ===
[[Promotion (marketing)|Promoting]] a food to consumers is done out of store, in store, and on package. Advertisements on television and in magazines are attempts to persuade consumers to think favorably about a product, so that they go to the store to purchase the product. In addition to advertising, promotions can also include Sunday [[newspaper ad]]s that offer coupons such as [[cents-off]] and [[Buy one, get one free|buy-one-get-one-free]] offers.

Promotion of the marketing mix is defined as the actions used to communicate a food product's features and benefits; therefore, persuading the consumer to purchase the product.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; There are multiple avenues used to promote a food product to consumers. Some examples are out-of-store, in-store and on the packaging (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014). Food advertisements on television are used to attract the consumer, persuading them to go to the store and purchase that food product. Additionally, promotions in magazines and newspapers may offer coupons for food products (Frechette, 2015).

=== Place ===
Place refers to the [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[warehousing]] efforts necessary to move a food from the manufacturer to a location where a consumer can buy it. It can also refer to where the [[product placement|product is located]] in a retail outlet (e.g., the end of an aisle; the top, bottom, or middle shelf; in a special display case, etc.).

The food marketing system in the United States is an amazingly flexible one. Consumer focus helps marketers anticipate the demands of consumers, and production focus helps them respond to changes in the market. The result is a system that meets and influences the ever-changing demands of consumers.

Place refers to the activities that organisations go about in order to make its food product available to its consumers. This encompasses the distribution necessary to move a food product from the manufacturer to a location where it can be purchased by the consumer.&lt;ref name=wongleedee/&gt; Product location in a store is also a definition of place in the marketing mix. For example, a particular place in an aisle, a shelf or a display in a supermarket (Helm &amp; Gritsch, 2014).

== Segmentation ==
In order to market its food products, an organisation must first understand whether its product will satisfy the consumer's needs better than competitors do (Noori, 2015). In order to achieve this, an organisation must understand the four types of segmentation.&lt;ref name=pomeranz2015/&gt;

=== Geographic ===

An organisation must understand where it is marketing its food products to in a geographical sense (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). Clarifying this will help an organisation to grasp which food products will satisfy the needs of a particular consumer culture (Adeigbe, Baldwin, Gallion, Grier &amp; Ramirez, 2015). For example, researching whether the consumer lives in America or Asia; or, whether the consumer lives in a city or a rural area (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). By understanding these aspects, the organisation will be able to identify that a consumers' food needs differ depending on where they live.

=== Demographic ===

A food organisation must understand the [[demographic]] segment that it will be marketing towards (David, Schramm-Kelin, Rank &amp; Wanger, 2015). Factors that must be considered are a consumer's age, gender, education, social class, income, religion and ethnicity (Quinn &amp; Dibb, 2010). All of these aspects can impact whether the consumer will prefer one food product over another.

=== Psychographic ===

A food organisation must understand its consumer [[psychographic]]. Factors such as lifestyle, personalities, opinions, activities and interests of its potential consumers must considered (Schlanger &amp; Maas, 2013). Identifying these aspects can help an organisation to improve its food products.

=== Behaviour ===

A food organisation must understand how its consumers may behave towards a food product (David, Schramm-Kelin, Rank &amp; Wanger, 2015). For example, information researching the benefits sought, frequency of food purchase, attitude towards the food product and nutritional knowledge of the product are all beneficial (Noori, 2015).

== Criticism ==
In recent years, food marketing has been criticised by professionals as being a major factor in contributing to [[childhood obesity]]. Nestle (2006) suggests that food marketing purposely targets children who are easily influenced at such a young age to eat high-sugar drinks and food with little nutritional benefit.&lt;ref name=nestle2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nestle | first1 = M | year = 2006 | title = Food Marketing and Childhood Obesity — A Matter of Policy | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = 2527–2529 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp068014 | pmid=16775233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that areas of food marketing are linked to obesity is concerning, as well as how easy it is to market to children and affect their food choices. Television and print media still stand as the traditional communication channels for food marketing, but other popular approaches are also more prevalent these days. These include the Internet, toys, packaging, video games, blockbuster films, character licensing of children's toys and celebrity advertising (McGinnis, Appleton Gootman, &amp; Kraak, 2006). The employment of these food marketing strategies are growing, and are said to be partly responsible for swelling rates of childhood obesity (Cartere, 2009).

Product placement in children's films and television shows gives food marketers more power to get children familiar with their brand and to directly interact with this market segment (Cartere, 2009). The power brands have through food marketing on television is significant because television audiences automatically are more enticed in an advertisement as it is playing in front of them, forming stronger predispositions for brands (Kline, 2010). Accusations come into play when this saturation happens as children are not equipped with adequate knowledge to make smart nutritional choices, and food marketing is therefore sometimes blamed for children's unhealthy lifestyles (Kline, 2010). Children are a fast expanding market segment, firstly because they yield influence over their parents buying, but also because they are future consumers themselves (Cartere, 2009). Food marketers capitalize on the fact most children trouble their parents for a product they have seen on television until they receive it, giving children high bargaining power. According to McGinnis et al. (2006), by the time children are two years old, the majority can identify brands in supermarkets and demand them by name. It has been argued that marketers also portray some foods to children as exclusive only to them, implying children know better about their nutrition than their parents. This has in turn seen trends of children disregarding parental advice and taking it upon themselves to pick and choose what they eat.&lt;ref name=nestle2006/&gt;

Food marketers also use appealing packaging to attract children to their product through bright colours, including toys in schemes (McDonald's Happy Meals with a toy included is an example) and utilising famous television or film characters to spark interest (Cartere, 2009). In terms of packaging, brands will also change the size of products to entice children. Large companies have further been criticised of contributing to obesity through supplying schools with branded sponsorships and sports merchandise such as rugby balls that flaunt a company's logo (Cartere, 2009). Food marketers are criticised further than being responsible for child obesity rates, and are said to not have children's long-term physical wellbeing in mind when they aim to rapidly create brand name association among children (Frechette, 2015).

=== Childhood obesity ===

It has been shown through Frechette's (2015) studies that in recent years, as children and teenagers have become more exposed to technological advances, they have become more susceptible to unhealthy food marketing commercial messages from food organisations (Cairns, Angus, Hastings &amp; Caraher, 2013). Harris, Pomeranz, Lobstein, &amp; Brownell (2009) suggest that food marketers have been using child-targeting marketing practices in order to persuade children to eat unhealthy or poorly suitable foods. Organisations achieve this through direct and indirect marketing tactics on television adverts, games, social media and food packaging (Freeman, Kelly, Baur, Chapman, Chapman, Gill &amp; King, 2014). These tactics have an explicit effect on children's consumption patterns, diet-related health, nutritional knowledge, purchase behaviour and preferences (Vandevijvere &amp; Swinburn, 2015). Overall, it has been found that food marketing is one of the leading contributors to an increase in childhood obesity (Schor &amp; Ford, 2007). This is increasingly becoming a global issue.&lt;ref name=chandon2012/&gt;

In order to prevent the current unhealthy food marketing culture, Sacks, Mialon, Vandevijvere, Trevena, Snowdon, Crino &amp; Swinburn (2015) believe that there are methods and policies that should be put into place by governments. Firstly, parents should be informed of the nutritional values of the foods that they are giving to their children (Grier, Mensinger, Huang, Kumanyika &amp; Stettler, 2007). For example, an easy-to-read nutritional label on food packaging that provides the nutrient values and their definitions (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). This will create healthier food environments for families around the world (Sacks et al., 2015). Secondly, parents could restrict which advertisements that their children are exposed to (Newman &amp; Oates, 2014). For example, parents could use ad-blocking applications or limit television watching time (Thaichon &amp; Quach, 2016). Through the implementation of these strategies, governments can contribute in decreasing the rates of childhood obesity through food marketing.&lt;ref name=hawkes2007/&gt;

=== Misleading nutritional information ===

In order to persuade consumers to buy food products, organisations may present misleading nutritional information on its food products (Schermel, Emrich, Arcand, Wong &amp; L'abbé, 2013). It has become more prevalent that food organisations are not entirely transparent in regard to what is contained in its food products. For example, saturated fats, sodium and added sugars (Harris, LoDolce &amp; Schwartz, 2015). Wording such as "less sugar", "fat free" and "all natural" lead consumers to believe that the foods they are consuming are healthy (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). Sacks et al. (2015) discusses that in order to prevent misleading food advertising, governments should implement policies regarding the placement of verified nutritional values on food packaging.

== Purchasing decisions ==
Food marketing not only involves the marketing of products to consumers, but the reasons why consumers purchase these items and the factors influencing such choices (Sahay, Stough, Sohal, &amp; Goyal, 2006). Demographics, values and attitudes, incentives, and price willingness to pay are all elements that drive buyer selection in the marketing of food.

Firstly, food marketers must be aware that the attitudes and values of their target market play a significant role in what they choose to buy. For example, in terms of the green brand market, consumers will first be environmentally conscious and therefore intend to buy such products. Once a product has been marketed to a consumer, they need to feel that they are contributing to the preservation of the environment to purchase something (Kapuge, 2016). Consumers that have concern for the environment tend to alter their behavior to be more environmentally friendly. Values and attitudes have been found to be the driving force of sustainable purchasing behavior (Kapuge, 2016). Marketers need to convey to their consumer market through information that some items have adverse effects on the environment. Brands need to also relay the values of food marketing to customers when communicating with them (Sahay et al., 2006).

In relation to knowledge and beliefs in variables affecting food marketing decisions, it has been suggested that someone's understanding of products helps anticipate their ecologically friendly actions (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015). Because a persons awareness of information can cause them to make more informed or less informed decisions about products shows knowledge is a major factor in consumer buying choices. When strategists are food marketing, it is important to create binding relationships with potential customers through understanding their beliefs and awareness about the marketed product (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015).

Demographics play a large role in determining the background of consumers and how food marketing operates. Such as age allows a brand to market its food towards certain age groups according to their wants. Education also comes into play because often education is associated with people buying better food (Sahay et al., 2006). Income alike sees if people have more disposable income to spend on good products. Gender further allows food marketers to target women especially because women have been found to do the majority of food shopping in families (Sahay et al., 2006).

Signage conveys a lot about a brand, for example what type of food they sell, the ingredients, where it was made and the cost of the products. Signage precisely communicates with the buyer and is an essential way to affect feelings and brain processes of a person (Remar, Campbell, &amp; DiPietro, 2016). Findings show that certain digital signposting of a brand influences consumer perception and behavior towards a product, meaning food marketing strategies like this are very effective in brand positioning (Nikolova &amp; Inman, 2015).

Lastly, consumer price willingness to pay is another tool used in food marketing to track how much a person is prepared to pay for a product. Marketers can take note of people's readiness to pay to see if they would indeed buy their product (Remar et al., 2016). Studies have shown that consumers are prepared to spend more on an item if it is environmentally friendly and portrays them as having sustainable behavior in society (Remar et al., 2016). Additionally, it has been explored that consumers will for example pay substantially more (almost 50%) for food produce that is said to be grown locally as opposed to grown in the wider country or imported (Remar et al., 2016). This is vital information when it comes to food marketing and helps companies make informed decisions about their food marketing strategies.

== Food marketing via sponsorships ==
Corporate spending on sponsorship worldwide grew 5.1% in 2015 reaching $57.5 billion, with the biggest spenders on sponsorships being food and beverage giants [[PepsiCo]] and [[Coca-Cola]], spending $350m and $290m respectively.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sponsorship.com/Resources/Sponsorship-Spending-Report--WhereThe-Dollars-Are.aspx.|title=Sponsorship spending report: Where the dollars are going and trends for 2015|last=International Events Group (IEG)|first=|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional sporting events are primary targets for food companies when utilising sponsorship as a form a marketing communication, however sports organisations are increasingly demanding high prices for access to their exploitable marketing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrillat|first=François Anthony|last2=Colbert|first2=Francois|last3=Feigné|first3=Matthieu|date=2012|title=Weapons of mass intrusion: the leveraging of ambush marketing strategies|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois_Colbert/publication/263245341_Weapons_of_mass_intrusion_The_leveraging_of_ambush_marketing_strategies/links/542d3f090cf27e39fa9421f7/Weapons-of-mass-intrusion-The-leveraging-of-ambush-marketing-strategies.pdf|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=48|pages=314–335|doi=10.1108/ejm-11-2011-0641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food and beverage company [[MillerCoors]] were willing to spend $3.8m for a 30-second commercial during [[Super Bowl XLVII]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Global food brand have also been seen to increase their marketing effort through sponsorships of amateur sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherman|first=M.G|date=2012|title=Corporate sponsorship in high school athletics.|url=|journal=Walton College of business|volume=|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Yum! Brands]] paid $13.5m to name a university basketball stadium the ‘bucket’, creating the [[KFC]] stadium, similarly [[Papa John's Pizza|Papa John’s]] purchased the naming rights of a college stadium for $5M. Food companies are also investing millions into individual athletes in return for accesses to their exploitable commercial potential. [[Peyton Manning]] reportedly earns $10M per year from sponsorship alone, with the highest percentage of sponsorship coming from Papa John’s and [[Gatorade]]; similarly [[Kobe Bryant]]’s sponsorship from [[McDonald's]] was reportedly worth $12M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bragg|first=Marie A.|last2=Yanamadala|first2=Swati|last3=Roberto|first3=Christina A.|last4=Harris|first4=Jennifer L.|last5=Brownell|first5=Kelly D.|date=2015|title=Athlete endorsements in food marketing|url=http://www.peachlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bragg.AthleteEndorse.Pediatrics.pdf|journal=Public health and nutrition|volume=57|issue=5|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics of sponsorship strategies ===
With regards to marketing according to Liaw and Tam (2015), ethics deals with moral principles behind the operation of marketing.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liaw|first=S.T|last2=Tam|first2=C.W.M|date=2015|title=Ethical research or research ethics?|url=|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume=44|issue=7|pages=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main ethical issue surrounding  sponsorship being utilised as a form of marketing communication by food companies is the sponsorship of sport from perceived unhealthy food and beverage companies, such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola’s sponsorship of the [[Olympic Games|Olympics.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;]][[Food marketing#cite%20note-%3A6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Food marketing#cite note-:6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]] [[Food marketing#cite note-:6-19|&lt;span class="mw-reflink-text"&gt;[19]&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.time.com/2012/07/05/olympics.2012.ban_McDonalds&amp;Coke|title=China grabs cut of star athletes Lui Xiang’s gold|last=Sheridan|first=M.|date=2008|work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different in many ways, similarities have been drawn between the marketing practices of tobacco companies and the food industry. At major sporting events, customers are exposed to a multitude of food-related sponsorship, with sponsorship associated with products classed as unhealthy twice as common as those classed as healthy (32.7% versus 15.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grunseit|first=A.C|last2=MacNiven|first2=R|last3=Grassmayr|first3=M|last4=Kelly|first4=B|last5=Davis|first5=D|date=2012|title=Australian athletes?

Other ethical concerns with sponsorship being used as a marketing tactic by food companies include; the specific targeting of youths, sponsorship from alcohol brands and the misconceptions created through sponsorships by energy drink brands such as [[Red Bull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Potential negative outcomes from sponsorship for a sport property|last=Crompton|first=J.L|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Areska|first=J|date=2012|title=The impact of sport sponsorship on brand equity: the analysis of Redbull|url=|journal=Aarhus school of business and social sciences|volume=1|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Via social media and its influences ==
Social media platforms are an effective way for food marketers to enter or attract a market. 'Social media' refers to websites such as Facebook and Twitter, and apps such as Instagram and Facebook. These websites allow users to upload and share content such as information, pictures, opinions and recommendations with the touch of a button. Food companies use unique marketing techniques designed to connect with the consumer such as running competitions, holding free giveaways and creating interactive games and apps. (Freeman et al., 2014)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=B|last2=Kelly|first2=B|last3=Baur|first3=L|last4=Chapman|first4=K|last5=Chapman|first5=S|last6=Gill|first6=T|last7=King|first7=L|date=December 2014|title=Digital Junk: Food and beverage marketing on Facebook|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|doi=10.2105/ajph.2014.302167|volume=104|pages=e56–e64|pmc=4232106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of these techniques are distinctive to social media platforms, as they interact and engage with the consumer on a level that other traditional media platforms are not capable. (Freeman et al., 2014)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studies have shown that adolescents' share food images on Instagram and that many of these contain brand-related details such as logos (Holmberg et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmberg | first1 = C. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = Adolescents' presentation of food in social media: An explorative study | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 121–129 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2016.01.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supermarket catalogues, product placement and their involvement ==
A study of supermarket catalogues distributed globally has also yielded information which supports the claim that food advertising is contributing to rising global obesity levels, especially in countries where the advertising is more prominent, consistent and persuasive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Emma L.|last2=Kähkönen|first2=Laila A.|last3=Sacks|first3=Gary|last4=Cameron|first4=Adrian J.|title=Supermarkets and unhealthy food marketing: An international comparison of the content of supermarket catalogues/circulars|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0091743515002753|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=81|pages=168–173|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.08.023|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded with the findings that supermarket catalogues have a major influence on the purchasing decisions and patterns of consumers. (Charlton et al., 2015)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, countries with the most consistent, regular catalogues filled with unhealthy foods were among those testing highest for obesity as well. The study also noted that India and The Philippines were the only countries analysed that advertised a vast majority of healthy foods over unhealthy options. (Charlton et al., 2015).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Product placement is another food marketing technique that draws the consumer in and encourages them to purchase. Vending machines and pop-up sample booths are model examples of product placement techniques used by food marketers. Vending machines provide convenience to the consumer as they are usually stationed in areas with no larger food options nearby, such as university campuses and gyms. Consumers using vending machines will usually pay a slightly higher price for the item, and will usually not be concerned as the price difference accounts for the convenience provided to them.

== Issues ==
There are no set worldwide food marketing laws or legislation, therefore countries have the option to adopt their own legislation with regards to food marketing standards. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcrf.org/int/policy/nourishing-framework/restrict-food-marketing|title=Restrict food marketing {{!}} World Cancer Research Fund International|website=www.wcrf.org|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are usually based on the values, culture and ethics of the particular country (Kaynak, 1999).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many countries worldwide have created laws in order to limit food marketing towards children with the goal of reducing rising obesity levels. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Obesity has been proven to have increased significantly with a link to the increase of food marketing and advertising in society. (Dibb &amp; Lobstein, 2005).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dibb|first=S|last2=Lobstein|first2=T|date=2005|title=Evidence of a possible link between obesogenic food advertising and child overweight.|url=|journal=Obesity Reviews|volume=6|pages=203–208|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789x.2005.00191.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 'call out' from the Worldwide Health Organisation in 2006, many countries adopted to change marketing laws and legislation in order to protect children from persuasive advertisements directly targeted at them. These advertisements are strategically designed with special techniques in order to attract the children's attention.&lt;ref name="publicinterest"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cspinet.org/nutritionpolicy/foodmarketing_abroad.pdf|title=Food marketing in other countries|last=|first=|date=February 16, 2007|website=Centre for science in the public interest|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean Government has taken some of the most drastic steps in 2012 by approving the 'Law of Nutritional Composition of Food and Advertising'. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This law gives strict guidelines for food marketers, allowing no high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar products to be advertised to under 14 year olds or through television or websites with an audience or more than 20% children. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Iran has also taken similar actions, having banned the advertisement of all soft drinks since 2004. Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education has also prepared a document in 2015 containing 24 items in which they hope to prohibit the advertising of in future. (Restrict Food Marketing, 2016).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Dibb and Lobstein acknowledge that traditional media outlets only account for approximately 20% of a food marketer's budget, therefore children are still highly exposed to influential advertising in shopping malls and grocery stores, vending machines, sponsored toys, contests etc. (Dibb &amp; Lobstein, 2005).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In addition to Iran and Chile's more extensive legislation's, over 30 countries worldwide have all adopted some form of legislation to protect children and reduce their exposure to advertisements. Some of these countries include Australia, Europe, Canada, Malaysia and Korea.&lt;ref name="publicinterest" /&gt; An example of the type of clauses in the legislation's include prohibiting the use of certain marketing techniques such as using cartoon characters, which can be used to access a child's mind and gain their attention.&lt;ref name="publicinterest" /&gt; Using physiological techniques such as this can be ethically wrong as well as illegal in some countries.

Advertising to children at a young age is a well-established food marketing technique designed to encourage brand preference and holds many ethical dilemmas. Previous studies have concluded that children can recognize and mentally picture brand logos at the age of just six months old, and will verbally request brands at the age of 3 years. (As reported by The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood). Marketing professor James McNeal acknowledged "The Drool Factor" – a study which recognized the fact that babies naturally stare down at their bibs while drooling to see where their drool lands.&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10894601|title=Seminar turns spotlight on to selling to our kids|date=2013-07-04|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customizing baby bibs with brand logos has become an effective way for food marketers to imprint their brand into the child's lifestyle, targeting them at a vulnerable young age resulting in brand recognition from the child.&lt;ref name="collins" /&gt; As a result, when the child is older they will continue to reciprocate warm, fond feelings towards the brand when encountering it in society. This is seen as unethical in many countries and is why organisations such as 'The Campaign for a Commercial-free Childhood' exist and what they aim to reduce.

==History== 
In 1959, Don Fisher, a California commercial real estate broker specializing in retail store location, was a social friend of Walter "Wally" Haas Jr, President of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]]  Fisher was inspired by the sudden success of 'The Tower of Shoes' in an old Quonset Hut in a non-retail industrial area of [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name="AMAZON"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Bud|title=Guaranteed to Shrink, Wrinkle, and Fade|date=November 30, 2010|publisher=self-published|location=AMAZON Books|isbn=0615434231|pages=Chapter 11 pps.54-58|edition=First|url=|access date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=The&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/gap/ |title=Gap Profile on Forbes |publisher=forbes.com |accessdate =March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a terrible retail location), that drew crowds by advertising that no matter what brand, style or size of shoes a woman could want it was at The Tower of Shoes. And knowing that even [[Macy's]], the biggest Levi's customer, was constantly running out of the best selling Levi's sizes, and colors, Fisher asked Haas to let him copy The Tower of Shoes' business model and apply it to Levi's products. Haas referred Fisher to Bud Robinson, his Director of Advertising, for what Haas assumed would be a quick refusal; but instead Robinson and Fisher carefully worked out a legal test plan for what was to become The Gap (named by Don's wife Doris Fisher). 

Fisher agreed to stock only Levi's apparel in every style and size, all grouped by size, and Levi's guaranteed The Gap to be never out of stock by overnight replenishment from Levi's [[San Jose, California]] warehouse. And finally, Robinson offered to pay 50% of The Gap's radio advertising upfront and avoided antitrust laws by offering the same marketing package to any store that agreed to sell nothing but Levi's products.
 
Fisher opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in [[San Francisco]] on August 21, 1969; its only merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records to attract teen customers. 

In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in [[Burlingame, California]] with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in [[Voorhees, New Jersey]]. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.

In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of [[Millard Drexler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/in-j-crew-buyout-an-effort-to-gain-a-retail-visionary/?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Evelyn M. | last=Rusli | title=In J. Crew Buyout, an Effort to Gain a Retail Visionary | date=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of [[J. Crew]]. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.&lt;ref&gt;Paumgarten, Nick.

Fisher]] recruited [[Paul Pressler]] as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.

In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J.

==Corporate identity==

===Logo===
Gap Inc. owns a [[trademark]] to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a [[service mark]] for ''retail clothing store services''. The application was filed with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for [[shirt]]s. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.

On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the [[Helvetica]] font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/06/gap-logo-new_n_753009.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Hilary | last=Moss | title=Gap Gets A New Logo (PHOTOS, POLL) | date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/12/gap-gets-rid-of-new-logo_n_759131.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Hilary | last=Moss | title=Gap Gets Rid Of New Logo | date=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/us-gap-idUSTRE71052V20110201?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;rpc=23&amp;sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Head of Gap brand out, outlet executive in line: source | date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.

In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gap-to-close-old-navy-in-japan-withdraws-earnings-forecast-1463689009|title=Gap to Close Old Navy in Japan, Warns of Earnings Shortfall|first1=Maria|last1=Armental|first2=Khadeeja|last2=Safdar|date=May 19, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2017|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product Red===
{{sources|section|date=March 2013}}
In 2006, Gap took part in the [[Product Red]] campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in [[Lesotho]] from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the [[Global Fund]], depending on the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAP INTRODUCES INSPIRATIONAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO CELEBRATE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF GLOBAL LAUNCH OF GAP (PRODUCT) RED|url=http://www.gapinc.com/content/gapinc/html/media/pressrelease/2007/med_pr_REDmarketing100307.html|website=GapInc.com|publisher=Gap Inc.|accessdate=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Achtung, Bono! Activists See Red|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/23175/|website=NYmag.com|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included [[American Express]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], Hallmark, [[Emporio Armani]], and [[Motorola]].

==Labor controversies==
Reports from news outlets of [[sweatshop]] workers in [[Saipan]] not being paid for overtime work, being subjected to forced [[abortion]], and being required to work in unsafe working conditions surfaced in 1999.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/shirts-for-the-fashionable-at-a-price-paid-in-human-misery-on-us-soil-the-gap-workers-are-forced-to-1121362.html

In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western Factory, a supplier in [[Irbid]], [[Jordan]], were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.&lt;ref name="NLCNET"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nlcnet.org/documents/Jordan_PDF_Web/04_Western.pdf|publisher=NLCNET|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309041041/http://www.nlcnet.org/documents/Jordan_PDF_Web/04_Western.pdf|archivedate=March 9, 2008 |title=Do Any of Us Really Want a “Bargain” Based on Trafficking of Young Women into Involuntary Servitude?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Jordan launched an investigation into the supplier and other textile factories and announced actions to prevent future abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flanagan |first1=Mike |title=Jordan accepts abuse claims |journal=The Source |date=2006 |issue=4 |url=https://www.just-style.com/store/samples/clothesource_the_source_sample.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walmart]], who also sources from the supplier, confirmed "serious problems with working conditions" at Western Factory and other Jordanian suppliers. {{Asof|May 2018}}, Gap had ceased their relationship with Western Factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GAP INC.

On October 28, 2007, [[BBC]] footage showed [[child labor]] in Indian Gap factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7066019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gap pulls 'child labour' clothing | date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = Gap accused of child labor | publisher = CBS News | date = October 29, 2007 | url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/whats-hot/gap-accused-of-child-labor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government investment in roads or schools, for example, is part of national saving in the national income accounts. National saving is reduced by the government deficit net of government investment, not by the entire government deficit. The difference between domestic investment and national saving is not affected by this qualification, however, as government investment and the implied adjustment to national saving cancel each other out."&lt;/ref&gt; exceeds desired [[investment]].{{Sfn|Bernanke|Bertaut|DeMarco|Kamin|2011}}  By 2005 [[Ben Bernanke]], chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[central bank]] of the [[United States]], expressed concern about the "significant increase in the global supply of saving" and its implications for monetary policies, particularly in the United States. Although Bernanke's analyses focused on events in 2003 to 2007 that led to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, regarding GSG countries and the United States, excessive saving by the non-financial corporate sector (NFCS) is an ongoing phenomenon, affecting many countries.{{Sfn|OECD|2001}}{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}{{Sfn|Chang|Lemos-Stein|Schulz|Stout|2012}}{{Sfn|Williams|2013}} Bernanke's "celebrated (if sometimes disputed)"{{Sfn|Obstfeld|2012|29}} global saving glut (GSG) hypothesis{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}} argued that increased capital inflows to the United States from GSG countries&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In his 2011 paper Bernanke defined the GSG countries as "all countries of Asia and the Middle East excluding Japan. This group, although not exhaustive, accounts for the lion's share of investment in the United States by emerging market economies."&lt;/ref&gt; were an important reason that U.S. longer-term interest rates from 2003 to 2007 were lower than expected.{{Sfn|Bernanke|Bertaut|DeMarco|Kamin|2011}}

[[Alan Greenspan]] testifying at the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] in 2010 explained, "Whether it was a glut of excess intended saving, or a shortfall of investment intentions, the result was the same: a fall in global real long-term interest rates and their associated capitalization rates. Asset prices, particularly house prices, in nearly two dozen countries accordingly moved dramatically higher. U.S. house price gains were high by historical standards but no more than average compared to other countries."{{Sfn|Greenspan|2010}}

A 2007 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) report noted that the "excess of gross saving over fixed investment (i.e. net lending) in the "aggregate OECD corporate sector" had been unusually large since 2002.{{Sfn|OECD|2001}} In a 2006 [[International Monetary Fund]] report, it was observed that, "since the bursting of the equity market
bubble in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries have moved from their traditional position of borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures to running financial surpluses that they are now lending to other sectors of the economy".{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}} David Wessell in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article observed that, "[c]ompanies, which normally borrow other folks’ savings in order to invest, have turned thrifty. Even companies enjoying strong profits and cash flow are building cash hoards, reducing debt and buying back their own shares—instead of making investment bets."{{Sfn|Wessell|2005}} Although the hypothesis of excess cash holdings or cash hoarding has been used by the OECD, the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the media (''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]), the concept itself has been disputed and criticized as conceptually flawed in articles and reports published by the [[Hoover Institute]], the [[Max-Planck Institute]] and the [[CATO Institute]] among others.{{Sfn|von Weizsäcker|2011}}{{Sfn|Borio|Disyatat|2011}}{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}} [[Ben Bernanke]] used the phrase "global savings glut" in 2005 linking it to the U.S. [[current account]] deficit.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}

In their July 2012 report [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] described the "fragile equilibrium that currently exists in the global corporate credit landscape". U.S. NFCS firms continued to hoard a "record amount of cash" with large profitable investment-grade companies and technology and health care industries (with significant amounts of cash overseas), holding most of the wealth.{{Sfn|Chang|Lemos-Stein|Schulz|Stout|2012}}

By January 2013, NFCS firms in Europe had over 1 trillion euros of cash on their balance sheets, a record high in nominal terms.{{Sfn|Williams|2013}}

==History==
When the equity market bubble burst, in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries cut down on borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures. They began running financial surpluses that they lent to other sectors of the economy.{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}

In 2003–2004 the non-financial corporate sector in member nations of the Group of Seven (G-7) held $US 1.3 trillion of corporate excess saving.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The IMF (2006) report used "cash" to refer refers to "currency and deposits plus short-term securities (including treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposits)."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Cardarelli|Ueda|2006}}

By 2011 Statistics Canada reported that Canadian business were "sitting on more than $583 billion in Canadian currency and deposits, and more than $276 billion in foreign currency".{{Sfn|CBC News|2012}}

During and after the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s levels of economic{{Sfn|The Economist|2012}} and [[policy uncertainty]] rose dramatically contributing to the depth of the recession and the weakness of the following recovery with{{Sfn|Pastor|Veronesi|2012}}{{Sfn|Berg|2012}} many corporations globally and avoiding investments and increasing their cash holdings, in what has been called "liquidity hoarding",{{Sfn|Berrospide|2012}} "cash hoarding" or "dead cash".{{Sfn|Sanchez|Yurdagul|2013}}{{Sfn|Walsh|2012}}{{Sfn|Bloomberg|2012}}

==Cash kings==
In March 2013 Moody's Investors Service published their report entitled ''Cash Pile Grows 10% to $1.45 Trillion; Overseas Holdings Continue to Expand'' in their Global Credit Research series, in which they examined companies they rate in the US non-financial corporate sector (NFCS). According to their report, by the end of 2012 the US NFCS held "$1.45 trillion in cash," 10% more than in 2001. At the end of 2011, US NFCS held $1.32 trillion in cash which was already a record level.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}} "Of the $1.32 trillion for all the rated companies, Moody's estimates that $840 billion, or 58% of the total cash, is held overseas."{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}
 
By the end of 2012 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and Cisco, "cash kings", as Moody's called them, held $347 billion at the end of 2012 compared to $278 billion in 2011.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}

At the end of 2012 [[History of Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company's]] cash balance was $22.9 billion and was listed as ten on the list of U.S. non-financial corporation sector's top ten cash kings by [[Moody's Investors Service]] in their March 2013 annual report on Global Credit Research.{{Sfn|Global Credit Research|2013}}{{Sfn|Fontevecchia|2013}}

==Causes==
In his article in April 2013 Federal Reserve Bank Economist, Kevin Kliesen  investigated some of the causes of the "recent upsurge in hoarding of cash by firms" or "increased accumulation of cash on corporate balance sheets" in the United States. He suggested a number of valid reasons including "increased levels of economic uncertainty", "increased competition, especially in the information technology sector" and "financing of research and development". Kliesen also argued that another reason for cash hoarding in the U.S. is the "relatively high U.S. corporate tax rate on income generated from foreign operations and subsidiaries".{{Sfn|Kleisen|2013}}

In an article published in [[The Economist]] in 2005, it was argued that the consumer boom was built on the unreliable foundation of rising house prices and that corporations were waiting for housing prices to level off or decline before they are willing to invest rather than save.{{Sfn|The Economist|2005}}

==Opportunistic borrowing==

Financial liabilities have increased at U.S. NFCS firms, suggesting they may be taking advantage of low interests rates, and saving this cash as unused financial assets for future use.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

===Pension deficit===
In 2005 Bernanke identified a number of possible causes for the global saving glut that began in 2001, including pension funding to make provision for an impending increase in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}} "Dearth of domestic [[investment]] opportunities", due to slowly growing or declining work forces, and high [[Capital intensity|capital-labor ratios]], which leads to low returns on domestic investment.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}} As a result, the mature industrial economies seek to run current account surpluses and thus to lend abroad.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}}

RBC Global Asset Management's Chief Economist, Eric Lascelles, also argued that NFCS firms were building financial assets as a precautionary measure, claiming that in 2011 "private U.S. defined-benefit pension plans were underfunded by $USD 909 billion", whereas they "were roughly balanced in 2007".{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

===Bank-centred governance and non-financial corporations cash holdings===
At the 1998 International Finance Conference, in their paper entitled ''Bank Power and Cash Holdings: Evidence from Japan'', Pinkowitz and Williamson{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 2}} showed that Japanese firms held more cash than U.S. or German firms. They concluded that the "monopoly power of Japanese banks" persuaded non-financial corporations to hold larger cash balances. "During periods with powerful banks, firms' high cash holdings are consistent with banks extracting rents."{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 2}} When banks weakened, NFCS firms held lower cash levels. Firms might take fewer risks in countries with bank-centered governance but "banks' incentives might not coincide with those of shareholders".{{Sfn|Pinkowitz|1998|page 9, 27}}

===Policy uncertainty: environmental and health public policies===
U.S. NFCS firms' rationale behind increasing cash holdings and restrained capital expenditures is most often linked to policy uncertainty.{{Sfn|Pastor|Veronesi|2012}}{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}} At the end of 2012 NFCS firms faced "uncertainty regarding economic growth, the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the pursuit of a sustainable long-term fiscal trajectory, health-care reform and financial-sector reform". The Policy Uncertainty Index was elevated at that time.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

== Consequences==

===A fall in global real long-term interest rates===
In 2005 J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. observed that the increase in excess saving in the corporate sector contributed to the "relatively low level of global long-term interest rates at a time of a ballooning U.S. current account deficit".{{Sfn|Wessell|2005}}{{Sfn|J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.|2005}} Greenspan argued that the excess saving resulted in a "fall in global real long-term interest rates and their associated capitalization rates. Asset prices, particularly house prices, in nearly two dozen countries accordingly moved dramatically higher. U.S. house price gains were high by historical standards but no more than average compared to other countries."{{Sfn|Greenspan|2010}}

===Rising global imbalances with respect to international current account balances===
The United States was already experiencing a dramatic increase in its [[current account deficit]]&lt;ref group=notes&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/200503102/ Bernanke 10 March 2005] explained the U.S. current account deficit equalled the "excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period." The U.S. current account deficit was c. $635 billion in 2004. The value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports by c. $618 billion.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernanke argued that the GSG caused the rise in current account deficits.  A "current account deficit means that a country is spending more than it is producing".{{Sfn|Cecchetti|2011}}

===Low capital expenditure (capex)===
Low capital expenditure ([[capex]]) is frequently cited as hindering economic recovery although economists are not in agreement on this.{{Sfn|Williams|2013}} Eric Lascelles, explained the rationale behind the surge in corporate saving. He argued that NFCS firms continued to be restrained in terms of capital expenditure for a variety of reasons. Equipment and software prices have dropped since 1992 allowing them to purchase more with less. In the United States, there is an oversupply of capital stock which includes physical capital, office space, plants and equipment in the U.S. Existing capital is not depreciating rapidly and firms are running under capacity.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}} NFCS firms began [[deleveraging]] after the financial crisis as they found that their assets were "worth less than they imagined and discovered that continuous access to debt markets was not guaranteed". They channeled resources to the financial account and asset liquidity, away from capital expenditures.{{Sfn|Lascelles|2012}}

In 2013 Gareth Williams, Director, Sector Economist at [[Standard &amp; Poor]]'s argued that a "large and growing share of European corporate capex was directed to emerging markets" outside of Europe, "up 42% from January 2012 and up from 28% from 2007".{{Sfn|Williams|2013|2}} Williams claims there is "a strong precautionary motive in the amount of cash being held" by NFCS firms, in the eurozone [[European Economic and Monetary Union]] which is "trapped in a quagmire of austerity, high unemployment, and political uncertainty".

===Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets===
Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets. United States and other advanced economies became net borrowers. University of California, Berkeley economist Obstfeld observed, that Bernanke and other proponents of the global saving glut account of the 2007–09 crisis argued that large surpluses by China (and other GSG countries) had adverse effects on richer countries' current accounts and financial markets.{{Sfn|Obstfeld|2012|33}} To avoid the consequences of financial crises, developing countries built up "war chests" of large quantities of foreign-exchange reserves to act as a buffer against potential capital outflows during financial crises.{{Sfn|Council of Economic Advisers|2009|pages=61,63}}

According to Bernanke the US was attractive for foreign investors because of new technologies and rising productivity. Capital flowing into the United States increased the value of the dollar making the imports of the US cheap (in terms of dollars) and exports expensive (in terms of foreign currencies), creating a rising US current account deficit.{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}{{Sfn|Bernanke|2007}} GSG countries accumulated reserves in the "context of foreign exchange interventions intended to promote export-led growth by preventing exchange-rate appreciation".{{Sfn|Bernanke|2005}}(sometimes called [[Bretton Woods II]]).

==The Lucas paradox==

In [[Lucas paradox|Robert Lucas' classical paradox]] described in the article entitled "Why doesn't capital flow from rich to poor countries?" and published in 1990 in the ''[[American Economic Review]]'', Lucas questioned{{Sfn|1990|Lucas|92-96}} the validity of the assumptions of the neoclassical model that gave rise to differences in the marginal product of capital. For example, in 1988 in India, a poorer country at that time, the marginal product of capital should have been 58 greater than in the United States, a richer nation. Lucas did not observe such flows. Lucas argued that the central question of economic development should be to replace these assumptions.{{Sfn|Bonizzi|2013}}{{Sfn|Daly|2010}}{{Sfn|World Bank|2013}}

{{quote|The integration of emerging markets into the global financial system has been characterized by cyclical periods of capital inflows, interrupted by sudden capital outflows and financial crises. Probably the most renowned boom-and-bust cycle was the surge of private capital flows to emerging markets during the 90's that ended with a succession of crises, starting with Mexico in 1995 and then touching East Asian countries in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, Brazil in 1999, Argentina and Turkey in 2001. The following boom to emerging markets during the 2000's was again interrupted by a sudden reversal of capital flows during the global financial crisis following the Lehmann Brothers collapse in 2008. Since 2009 capital flows to emerging markets are again at historical heights. This highly cyclical nature of capital flows and the increased frequency of financial crashes have cast questions about the process of financial globalisation—i.e. the dramatic expansion of international financial transactions over the past twenty-thirty years—and holdings itself.|Bonizzi, 2013, 3}}

In an [[open economy]], a country's spending in any given year need not to equal its output of goods and services. A [[country]] can spend more money than it produces by [[government debt|borrowing]] from abroad, or it can spend less than it produces and lend the difference to [[alien (law)|foreigners]].{{Sfn|Mankiw|2010}} Even though some economies are more open or closed than others, there are no closed economies in the strict sense of the definition in today's world.&lt;ref name="ClosedEconomies"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=closed+economy |title=Closed Economy |website=AmosWEB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Canadian government introduced business incentives along with corporate tax reductions "to compel Canadian corporations to invest some $525 billion of dead cash back into the economy".{{Sfn|Canadian Press|2012}} In their analysis of the 2012 budget the Canadian Labour Congress argued that "non-financial corporations" have used their federal incentives and tax cuts&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Prior to 2007, the federal corporate income tax rate was over 20%. Since 2007 the corporate tax rate was lowered. Bay 2012 it was 15%.&lt;/ref&gt; to "buy up their own shares, to increase dividends, and to increase their cash holdings" which amounted to "close to $500 billion of surplus cash" that they were not investing in job creation.{{Sfn|Canadian Labour Congress|2012}}

In August 2012 then Bank of Canada Governor [[Mark Carney]] "castigated corporations in Canada for their high levels of savings, saying firms should either spend their ample financial reserves or return the value to shareholders through buy-backs". ''[[Financial Post]]'' journalist Philip Cross argued that "It is the job of companies to make money for their shareholders, not to put money to work."{{Sfn|Cross|2012}} Cross also argued that, "If households and governments are net borrowers, inevitably firms must be net lenders, which require savings." From 2002 to 2012, corporations in Germany, the UK and Japan had higher savings rates than corporations in Canada. After the [[Great Recession]] corporations in OECD member nations further increased their savings rates Great Recession.{{Sfn|Cross|2012}}

Don Drummond, who was formerly the chief economist for TD Bank, argued that reluctance of Canadian businesses to invest capital is a problematic, long term pattern.{{Sfn|Walberg|2013}} It is not because of "excessive prudence". By spring 2013 in Canada "the stock of machinery and equipment per worker" in average "was between 50% and 60%" of what it was in the United States. The lack of spending was long term and it continued through 2012 while in the United States spending increased. Drummond argued that this gap would get bigger. According to Drummond, there was a time when Canadian businesses spent less because of "factors such as tax rates and the dollar, but if that were ever true it's certainly not anymore... Canadian businesses are accustomed to operating in an environment that is sheltered from competition, compared to the American business climate. As a result, they don't accurately perceive the risks of being too cautious, and of failing to exploit opportunities and available resources."{{Sfn|Walberg|2013}}

== Concept of cash hoarding disputed ==
This view of a worldwide saving glut responsible for low levels of interest rates is disputed by [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] like the German economist [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], who claims that it was the monetary policy of the US [[Federal Reserve]] in the 1990s which kept interest rates too low for too long. In addition, the policy of the US government encouraged private debt to promote private consumption. This led to a lack of savings in the US which was then provided from foreign countries on a basis which was not sustainable. Carl Christian von Weizsäcker follows Ben Bernanke claiming that aging populations which save more than can be profitably invested lead to a saving glut and negative equilibrium rates of interest which makes public deficits necessary to fill the gap between excess private savings and private investment.{{Sfn|von Weizsäcker|2011}}

From the perspective of [[monetary economics]], the savings glut idea has been criticized as conceptually flawed, ignoring the role of [[credit creation]], and related unsustainable asset price booms.{{Sfn|Borio|Disyatat|2011}} Further, the composition of cross-border financing flows cannot be determined just from the ''net'' capital flows, and analysis on this basis yields flawed conclusions.

In his 2008 article entitled "Competing Explanations: A Global Saving Glut", Senior Fellow in Economics at Stanford University's [[Hoover Institution]], [[John B. Taylor]], stated that there was "no evidence for a global saving glut".{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}} Using an International Monetary Fund 2005 graph,{{Sfn|IMF|2005|p=92}} he argued that "the global saving rate—world saving as a fraction of world GDP—was very low in the 2002–2004 period especially when compared with the 1970s and 1980s".{{Sfn|Taylor|2008|p=4}}

According to Taylor, "[T]here was a gap of saving over investment in the world outside the United States during 2002–2004, and this may be the source of the term "saving glut". But the United States was saving less than it was investing during this period; it was running a current account deficit which implies that saving was less than investment. Thus the positive saving gap outside the United States was offset by an equal sized negative saving gap in the United States. No extra impact on world interest rates would be expected. As implied by simple global accounting, there is no global gap between saving and investment."{{Sfn|Taylor|2007|p=5}}{{Sfn|Taylor|2009}}

Taylor argued that the global ''gross'' savings rate (not necessarily the net savings rate) during the 2000s was slightly higher than savings rate in the 80s or 90s according to IMF data.{{Sfn|EconStats|nd}}

[[Niall Ferguson]] in ''[[The Ascent of Money]]'',  published in 2008, examines the long history of money, credit, and banking. In it he predicted a financial crisis as a result of the world economy and in particular the [[United States]] using too much credit. Specifically he cites the [[China]]–[[United States|America]] dynamic which he refers to as [[Chimerica]] where an Asian "savings glut" helped create the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] with an influx of easy money.{{Sfn|McRae|2008}}{{Sfn|Ferguson|Schularick|2007}}

A '''heat sealer''' is a [[machine]] used to [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] [[product (business)|product]]s, [[packaging]], and other [[thermoplastic]] materials using [[heat]].  This can be with uniform thermoplastic monolayers or with materials having several layers, at least one being thermoplastic. Heat sealing can join two similar materials together or can join dissimilar materials, one of which has a thermoplastic layer.

==Heat sealing process==
'''Heat sealing''' is the process of sealing one [[thermoplastic]] to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives, film media, plastic ports or [[foil sealing]].

===Applications for the heat sealing process===

Heat seal connectors are used to join [[LCD]]s to [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]] in many [[consumer electronics]], as well as in [[medical]] and [[telecommunication]] devices.

Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where [[heat staking]] or [[ultrasonic welding]] are not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations.

Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. [[Laminate]] foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products.

Medical and fluid bags used in the medical, [[bioengineering]] and food industries. Fluid bags are made out of a multitude of varying materials such as foils, filter media, thermoplastics and laminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hishinuma|first1=Kazuo|title=Heat Sealing Technology and Engineering for Packaging|date=1 January 2009|publisher=DEStech Publications, Inc|location=Lancaster, PA|isbn=978-1-932078-85-5|page=267|edition=1st|url=http://www.destechpub.com/index.php?fuseAction=catalogs.viewItem&amp;catalogID=1&amp;catalogLevelID=&amp;catalogItemID=63|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of heat sealing==

*Hot bar sealers- have heated tooling kept at a constant temperature (also known as Direct Contact Thermal Sealing).  They use one or more heated bars, irons, or dies which contact the material to heat the interface and form a bond. The bars, irons and dies have various configurations and can be covered with a release layer or utilize various slick interposer materials (i.e. Teflon films) to prevent sticking to the hot tooling.
*Continuous heat sealers- (also known as Band type heat sealers) utilize [[moving belt]]s over heating elements.
*Impulse heat sealers- have heating elements (one or two) of [[Nichrome]] placed between a resilient [[synthetic rubber]] and a release surface of film or fabric.  The heating elements are not continuously heated; heat is generated only when current flows.  When the materials are placed in the heat sealer, they are held in place by pressure.  An electric current heats the heating element for a specified time to create the required temperature.  the Jaws hold the material in place after the heat is stopped, sometimes with cooling water:  this allows the material to fuse before stress can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*[[Hot melt adhesive]] can be applied in strips or beads at the point of joining.   It can also be applied to one of the surfaces during an earlier manufacturing step and reactivated for bonding.
* Hot wire sealing – involves a heated wire that both cuts the surfaces and joins them with a molten edge bead.  This is not usually employed when barrier properties are critical.
*[[Induction sealing]] is a non-contact type of sealing used for inner seals in bottle caps.
*[[Induction welding]] heat sealing by non-contact induction
* [[Ultrasonic welding]] uses high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a weld.

A type of heat sealer is also used to piece together plastic side panels for light-weight [[agriculture|agricultural]] buildings such as [[greenhouse]]s and [[shed]]s. This version is guided along the floor by four wheels.

==Seal quality==

In addition, [[package testing]] is used to determine the ability of completed packages to withstand specified pressure or vacuum.  Several methods are available to determine the ability of a sealed package to retain its integrity, barrier characteristics, and sterility.

Heat sealing processes can be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], [[ISO 9000]], etc. [[Verification and validation]] protocols are used to ensure that specifications are met and final materials/packages are suited for end-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Seal Strength Testing==
The efficacy of heat seals is often detailed in governing [[specification]]s, [[contract]]s, and [[regulation]]s. [[Quality management system]]s sometimes ask for periodic subjective evaluations:  For example, some seals can be evaluated by a simple pull to determine the existence of a bond and the mechanism of failure.  With some plastic films, observation can be enhanced by using [[polarized light]] which highlights the [[birefringence]] of the heat seal. Some seals for sensitive products require thorough [[verification and validation]] protocols that use quantitative testing. Test methods might include:

===Seal Strength per ASTM F88 and F2824===
Seal Strength testing, also known as Peel Testing, measures the strength of seals within flexible [[wikt:barrier|barrier]] materials. This measurement can then be used to determine consistency within the seal, as well as evaluation of the opening force of the package system. Seal strength is a quantitative measure for use in process validation, process control and capability. Seal strength is not only relevant to opening force and package integrity, but to measuring the packaging processes’ ability to produce consistent seals.

===Burst and Creep per ASTM F1140 and F2054===
The [[wikt:burst|burst]] test is used to determine the packages strength and precession. The burst test is performed by pressurizing the package until it bursts. The results for the burst test include the burst pressure data and a description of where the seal failure occurred. This test method covers the burst test as defined in ASTM F1140.The [[Creep (deformation)|Creep]] test determines the packages ability to hold pressure for an extended period. The creep test is performed by setting the pressure at about 80% of the minimum burst pressure of a previous burst test. The time to seal failure or a pre-set time is measured.

===[[Vacuum]] Dye per ASTM D3078===
Determination of package [[integrity]]. The package is submerged in a transparent container filled with a mixture of water and dye. Vacuum is created inside the container and maintained for a specific length of time. When the vacuum is released, any punctured packages will draw in dye revealing the imperfect seal.

'''I. I. Chundrigar Road''', formerly '''McLeod Road''', is located in the [[Central business district|financial hub]] of [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. It is named after former Pakistani Prime Minister [[I. I. Chundrigar]].

The Karachi financial area is the largest in the country, referred to as "Pakistan's Wall Street".&lt;ref name="nadeemf.paracha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1134284|title=Visual Karachi: From Paris of Asia, to City of Lights, to Hell on Earth|author=Nadeem F.

In 1963, [[Habib Bank Plaza]] was built on this street which remained the tallest building of Pakistan until 2005.&lt;ref name="nadeemf.paracha"/&gt; 

In 2007 Sharjah-based Enshaa Holdings in a joint venture with NLC launched Karachi International Financial center on II Chundrigar road which would comprise a hotel, office towers, serviced apartments and a railway station. The Karachi Financial Towers would include two identical 37-storey towers connected by a three-floor glass skybridge. As of 2012, construction has been abandoned because of financial misappropriation and possible embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/480015/nlc-lost-rs1b-in-glitzy-twin-towers-project-audit/|title=NLC lost Rs1b in glitzy twin towers project: Audit - The Express Tribune|date=15 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''INDEX''', an acronym for Information through Disguised Experimentation is an annual market research fair conducted by the students of [[IIM Lucknow|IIM-Lucknow]]. Students create games and use various other simulated environments to capture consumers’ subconscious thoughts. This innovative method of market research removes the sensitization effect that might bias peoples answers to questions. This ensures that the most truthful answers are captured to research questions. The games are designed in such a way that the observers can elicit all the required information just by observing and noting down the behaviour and the responses of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Here-goes-the-IIM-L-INDEX/Article1-177137.aspx|title=Here goes the IIM-L INDEX|author=Hindustan Times|date= November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INDEX is primarily a fair conducted in [[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], which provides the people of the city an opportunity to experience the elements of a mela. Apart from the market research, the fair also attracts crowds through various innovative and interactive entertainment forums such as song and dance events, games, competitions and the many local vendors displaying their goods and services at the ground. The carnival atmosphere generates enthusiasm among the crowd, which leads to a more comprehensive research opportunity for the students to understand market insights in a live environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.mathrubhumi.com/php/news_events_details.php?nid=14396&amp;slinkid=2|title=IIM Lucknow to hold INDEX|author=Mathrubhumi Education|date= November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and inception ==

The first INDEX was organized in 1994, with students and professors of Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow coming up with a solution to the sensitization effect that affects normal market researches and surveys. Market Research is constantly riddled with issues like the sensitization effect of the survey on the audience making the results of the survey occasionally unreliable. Often, the results of the survey fail to reflect the buying behavior of the consumers. Students and professors of Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow came up with a solution to these issues in the year 1994. INDEX is a marketing event where the information sought through the questionnaires is disguised in the form of games, which the respondents play. The respondents think they are just participating in some elaborate skit, and they subconsciously reveal the true options they would have chosen under natural circumstances. The games are designed in such a way that the observers can elicit all the required information just by observing and noting down the behaviour and the responses of the participants. It began as an in-campus event involving staff and faculty families as respondents but since 2001 it has entered into Lucknow city where a fair is organized for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolavenues.com/bschools/iiml_index_04a.php3|title=INDEX- 2004 Annual Marketing Fair|author=Cool Avenues|date= November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept behind this is called Disguised Experimentation. It is a method of obtaining information from the respondents, where both the respondent and the surveyor have immense take-away from the questioning: the respondent has fun and not a feeling of being interrogated, while the researcher gets data that can be classified as genuine.

== Events ==

Although INDEX is aimed at providing a platform for market research, it is more than a  marketing event. It has provided an opportunity for Lucknow residents to come forward and showcase their talents in various fields. Its popularity has attracted a large footfall which has been consistently increasing annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-16/lucknow/28237431_1_iim-l-science-exhibition-stalls|title=IIM-L launches INDEX 2010|author=Times of India|date= November 16, 2010|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fair is designed to provide avenues of interest for all visitors to the fair. Events that have been conducted over the past years include book fairs and science exhibitions by students from the various schools in Lucknow. For the youth of the city, competitions such as “Fashion Parade” and “Choreo Nite”, with an opportunity for ramp walkers to win the title of Mr. and Miss. Index, have been organized over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow-times/IIMs-high-on-the-popularity-Index/articleshow/561270.cms|title = IIM high on popularity INDEX|author=Times of India|date= November 24, 2006|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events which are open for the public included numerous "Ek Minute" games, kids' dance competitions, "Bollywood quizzes" and "Salsa Performances". Food festivals offering different cuisine at the fair, in association with various outlets, are set up  at INDEX aimed at the participants, students and families who visit. The fair also provides gala entertainment offerings with Star Nite performances by artists in the evening of the two days. Entertainers who have visited INDEX include [[Hariprasad Chaurasia|Pt. Hari Prasad Chaurasia]], Sufi singers "Mehfil-e-Sufiyana", and other artistes from Lucknow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-23/others/28235839_1_chulbul-pandey-iim-lucknow-management-event|title=INDEX 2010 launches in Lucknow|author=Times of India|date= November 23, 2010|work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initiatives ==

Throughout its years of activities INDEX has played host to a variety of social initiatives. IIM Lucknow, through INDEX has associated with NGOs such as Mahila Samkhya, and Prithvi Innovations which organised a puppet show during the fair. Various social awareness programs have also been addressed through its publicity mediums. Public issues which have been handled at the fair and its social initiative activities include Road Safety events and HIV awareness drives in association with UPSACS (Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://upaidscontrol.up.nic.in/index%20UPSACS%20report%202010.pdf|title=UPSACS INDEX report 2010|author=UPSACS|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colleges from across Lucknow participate in the street play competition "Jaagran", organised at locations in the City to promote social awareness.

== Associates and sponsors ==

INDEX is a part of the unique market research initiative which is based on the concept of "Disguised Market Research" - which seeks to gain insights into the consumer's perspectives/needs through intelligently designed games to overcome the 'Sensitization Effect'. As a result, IIML's clients spread across the FMCG, Banking, Services and IT sectors and many Industry heavy weights in various sectors . Prominent market leaders which have associated with the fair and the college include Pepsi, Nokia, Cadbury, Aditya Birla Group, Viacom18, HT Media, Star India, Mahindra Group, Reckitt Benkiser, HUL, ITC, Johnson&amp;Johnson, P&amp;G and TATA Group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Join Hands Day''' is the first Saturday in May. It is a national [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event sponsored by the [[American Fraternal Alliance]].

==Background==

The day was launched by what was then called America's Fraternal Benefit Societies in 2000, in partnership with [[Points of Light Foundation]]. It is meant to have a focus not just on volunteering, but also on developing youth and adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 19, 2000 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org/main.html, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/62e73be8-cfe2-472d-bb2a-3e640ed30171.pdf Join Hands Day 2014 brochure], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thrivent.com/leader-resources/activities-programs/activities/join-hands-day.html Thrivent Financial for Lutherans Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assuredlife.org/natlservcampaigns/natlservcampaigns-join_hands_day.aspx Assured Life Association Join Hands Day page], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first two years of Join Hands Day, organizations were asked to register their Join Hands Day projects via the official web site. In some years, a certain number of groups were chosen to receive a cash award for the beneficiary of their project or another cause and a physical award, and were recognized at the National Fraternal Congress of America (NFCA) annual conference. It was not always on the first Saturday in May; the 2001 day was held on June 16.&lt;ref&gt;Join Hands Day web site, Aug 3, 2001 version, published at www.joinhandsday.org, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers of Join Hands Day offer participants ideas for group volunteering events that can bring adults and youth together in community service, such as repairing bicycles to give disadvantaged children and teaching bicycle maintenance, collecting chairs of various shapes and sizes to paint and then auction for a worthy cause, or repairing gravestones and improve landscaping in a cemetery and documenting historic grave sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/AFRATA/993266a0-2235-4dea-9e54-d38e39dfac85.pdf 50 Great JOIN HANDS DAY Project Ideas that Work], accessed June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juliusz Karol Kunitzer''' ({{lang-de|Julius Kunitzer}}) (1843–1905) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-German industrialist, economic activist, philanthropist, one of the industrial magnates of [[Łódź]] ([[Congress Poland]]/[[Vistula Land]]). He owned a textile and later a joint stock company. His viciousness towards workers and cooperation with Russian authorities gained him notoriety among Łódż citizens. He was assassinated by [[Polish Socialist Party]] activists in the aftermath of the [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905 Łódź insurrection]].

Kunitzer was a polarizing personality and career. Known among Łódź's elites as a shrewd businessman, "cotton king" who became a tycoon due to his personal skills and luck, respected for this and his philanthropy and other public initiatives, for others – particularly radicals and socialists, he was a vicious exploiter of workers and a leader of anti-labor industrialists.&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{pl icon}} ''[http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/panorama/49211,kunitzer-krol-widzewa,id,t.html?cookie=1 Kunitzer – król Widzewa]'', Dziennik Łódzki, 26 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Bronisław Wilkoszewski – Pałac J. Kunitzera.jpg|thumb|Kunitzer's villa, ul. Spacerowa 15, Łódź]]
Kunitzer was born on 19 September 1843 in the [[Przedbórz|Pohulanka]] village, in Russian-controlled [[Congress Poland]] (increasingly known as the [[Vistula Land]]).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.lodz.ap.gov.pl/fab6.html JULIUSZ KAROL KUNITZER]&lt;/ref&gt; His family had roots in German burgher society, and moved to the Polish territories in the 1830s&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Kunitzer described himself as a Pole, including during a public speech to Russian businessmen in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] which caused a brief sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Polacy-Niemcy-Żydzi w Łodzi w XIX-XX w:sąsiedzi dalecy i bliscy Paweł Samuś,page 224 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilustrowana
encyklopedia historii łodzi, Urząd Miasta Łodzi, nr IV / 1, page 198 [http://www.uml.lodz.pl/get.php?id=835]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Jakub, a [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] by profession, died in 1850, after which Juliusz with his mother moved to [[Tyniec]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Young Kunitzer became a weaver, following his father's footsteps.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;

He came to [[Łódź]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He joined the E. Hentschl's factory, quickly advancing to a managerial position.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In 1869 he married Agnieszka Meyer, sister of the industrialist [[Ludwik Meyer]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Using his wife's [[dowry]], he invested in a construction of a new factory, which begun operations in the following year.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In partnership with Ludwik Meyer, in 1874, he bought the Hentschl's factory, damaged by the fire, and operated the "Kunitzer i Meyer" company.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; In 1879 he withdrew from that partnership, built cotton industry in the village of [[Widzew]] near Łódź, and begun a different one with [[Theodor Julius Heinzel]].&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; Over the next few decades his factory complex expanded, with a dedicated railway line, worker's housing (150 homes), a hospital, a school, church, shops, and other buildings, which saw Widzew transformed from rural village to a [[quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of Łódź.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; [[File:Ul. Niciarniana w Łodzi - widok z parku 01.jpg|thumb|Heinzel &amp; Kunitzer factory, Łódź-Widzew (2011)]]
Kunitzer was also involved in setting up an [[electric railway]] (the Koleje Elektryczne Łódzke S.A. and Łódzkie Wąskotorowe Elektryczne Koleje Dojazdowe S.A. stock companies) and in coal import company (Konsorcjum Węglowe "Kunitzer et Co.").&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He was a member of the board of many organizations (such as the [[Bank Handlowy]]).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He also had investments outside Polish territories, for example in Russia, where he was involved in the iron mining and steelworking.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; He was also involved in philanthropy, and presided for many years over the Łódzkie Chrześcijańskie Towarzystwo Dobroczynności (Łódź Christian Society of Goodwill).&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;

He was hated by the workers in Łódż, due to his particularly vicious treatment of employees in his factories, and due to fact that he remained in close contact and cooperated with Russian authorities&lt;ref&gt;Niepodległość, Volume 17, Instytut Badania Najnowszej Historji Polski (Warsaw, Poland), Instytut Józefa Piłsudskiego Poświęcony Badaniu Najnowszej Historii Polski (London, England), page 185,Pilsudski Institute of America, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Kunitzer often denied his workers their salaries in order to "teach them reason" which threatened them with hunger; such threat was also used to break down strike at his factory.&lt;ref&gt;Bolesław Leśmian, ''Recepta na miliony'', Książka i Wiedza, 1967, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in his factory faced financial fines and payments&lt;ref&gt;''Miasta polskie w tysiącleciu'', Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, 1965, Tom 2, page 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 report by Russian authorities pointed out that Kunitzer's factory which employed 860 workers, had no first aid room where a doctor could help or examine an injured worker.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocznik łódzki'', 1977, Volume 22, Polskie Towarzystwo Historyczne. Oddział Łódzki Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; Kunitzer's factories were also among two with lowest wages in Łódż and there was already a failed attempt to assassinate him in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paweł Samuś|title="Bunt łódzki" 1892 roku: studia z dziejów wielkiego konfliktu społecznego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi_tAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=1993|publisher=Wydawn.

On 30 September 1905 he was assassinated by [[Polish Socialist Party]] activists in the aftermath of the [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|1905 Łódź insurrection]] in which he refused any concessions to the workers.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Pytlas, 1994, ''Łódzka burżuazja przemysłowa w latach 1864–1914'', Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; One of the assailants (Adolf Szulc) was captured; the second one escaped.&lt;ref name=lodzapgov/&gt; The assailant confessed that hundreds of poverty stricken workers who were victims of Kunitzer were his motivation for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Wacław Pawlak, ''Na łódzkim bruku, 1901–1918'', 1986, Wydawnictwo Lódzkie, page 68&lt;/ref&gt; His assassination became the topic of the day for Polish and Russian newspapers; the event was condemned by conservative media, and praised by the radical, socialist ones.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; His funeral on 3 October that year gathered thousands of people.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt; He was buried at the [[Stary Cmentarz]] at Ogrodowa street, and his grave was marked by a simple, black tombstone.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt;

'''Laura Betterly''', also known as '''Laura Betterly-Blom''' as the head of '''Data Resource Consulting''', became notorious for sending large quantities of commercial e-mail in the early 21st century when she cracked as a joke, "call me the Spam Queen" to a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter.&lt;ref name="PesteringMillions"&gt;{{Cite web | first = Mylene | last = Mangalindan | title = For Bulk E-Mailer, Pestering Millions Offers Path to Profit | url = http://www.alanluber.com/storiesnolongeronweb/WSJ_com%20-%20For%20Bulk%20E-Mailer,%20Pestering%20Millions%20Offers%20Path%20to%20Profit.htm | work =  | publisher = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = 13 November 2002 | accessdate = 2007-11-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028100501/http://www.alanluber.com/storiesnolongeronweb/WSJ_com%20-%20For%20Bulk%20E-Mailer,%20Pestering%20Millions%20Offers%20Path%20to%20Profit.htm | archivedate = 28 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Betterly was born in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and lived there until 1995. She is now a resident of [[Clearwater, Florida]].  She has been married to Steven Blom, an officer in her corporation, since 2002. She has two children from her first marriage, Chris and Craig.&lt;ref name="savvy"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Bonnie L. |last=Quick |title=Intelligent Online Marketing |url=http://www.savvyexecutiveprofiles.com/xarchivespages/features/0601%20InTouchMedia/0601InTouchMedia2.html |work= |publisher=Savvy Executive |date=January 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930124635/http://www.savvyexecutiveprofiles.com/xarchivespages/features/0601%20InTouchMedia/0601InTouchMedia2.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Before starting Data Resource Consulting, she was president and co-founder of Visiosonic, later known as PCDJ.COM, an mp3 music company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhollywood.com/NYWednesdayFour.html Digital.Hollywood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020151807/http://www.digitalhollywood.com/NYWednesdayFour.html |date=20 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with celebrities such as Ice T,&lt;ref&gt;http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/060309/0112576.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nile Rodgers, Jam Master Jay and Chaka Kahn.&lt;ref name="savvy"/&gt;

==Bulk mail or spam==
At Data Resource Consulting, on a typical day, her firm would send out 8-10 million emails daily, charging clients $600–$1,000 per million emails and about half that amount for a sending a second time. She also charged clients for lead responses to emails.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0322/p12s02-ussc.html You call it spam, they call it a living |csmonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other mailers, Betterly said she did not forge headers, route messages through outside servers without permission, or use any of the other tricks that have drawn criticism of the spamming community. She also refused to send messages advertising adult products or services, or anything she believed to be illegal. She said that she only possessed the addresses of people who had expressed a desire to know more when signing up to other online services, and that she would honor any requests from recipients to unsubscribe from further mail.

Estimates indicate she may have earned at least [[US dollar|US$]]200,000 per year. She said that she was "just trying to make a living like everyone else."&lt;ref name="PesteringMillions"/&gt; Betterly publicly attacked those who were critical of her practices, “I have a beef against what I consider hate groups that are trying to shut down commercial e-mail”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3078650/ In the trenches of the ‘spam wars’ - The Spam Wars - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to what she did as "a win-win situation".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; To those who objected to what she did for a living she said, "I don't really care. As long as I'm not breaking any laws, you don't have to love me or like what I do for a living."&lt;ref name="PesteringMillions"/&gt;

Data Resource Consulting lost a legal case in [[Kansas]] small claims court on 9 September 2003 for failing to follow the spam laws in that state.

==Change of business model==
In September 2005, Betterly and the chairman of her corporation, [[Bob Cefail]], "fired" their radio station in Clearwater, Florida where her program,"The Profit Doctors" aired, because the station management discontinued the toll-free call-in number for their listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the pair "rehired" the same radio station to air a new program called [[Scooopradio]].

Betterly took her company ([[In Touch Media Group]]) public and announced her retirement from the bulk commercial e-mail business on 10 October 2005, referring to spam as "a four-letter word" and stating that bulk emailing had deteriorated into "a bunch of unprofessional, ineffective scams" due to its negative image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aunty-spam.com/email-spam-loses-spam-queen-laura-betterly/ Aunty-spam.com - antispam software 2008 Resources and Information.

==Research and development==
In November 2010, Lehigh expanded its in-house capabilities with the launch of the Application &amp; Development Center (ADC), a dedicated research and development facility staffed by a team of industry professionals. The stated mission of the ADC is to develop new applications for MRP and to accelerate adoption of existing MRP applications by improving understanding of MRP chemistry, providing expert advice for new material formulations that incorporate MRP, and developing new materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehigh Launches its Application &amp; Development Center|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/news_events/press_releases/lehigh_launches_its_application_development_center/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Lehigh announced an expansion of its ADC that includes the hiring of new technical staff and investment in new mixing and analytical equipment. According to Lehigh, this expansion improves the ADC’s ability to develop functional materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lehigh invests in mixing equipment, hires tech manager|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20140121/NEWS/140129981/lehigh-invests-in-mixing-equipment-hires-tech-manager|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Rubber News|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investors==
Since 2008, Lehigh has raised more than $50&amp;nbsp;million from investors that include [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], [[Index Ventures]], Leaf Clean Energy and NGP Energy Technology Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Katie|title=Kleiner, Index Invest $34.5M in Rubber Recycler Lehigh|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/06/23/kleiner-index-invest-345m-in-rubber-recycler-lehigh/|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=GigaOM|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karkaria|first=Urvaksh|title=Lehigh Technologies raised $5M from green tech venture firm|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/blog/atlantech/2012/07/lehigh-technologies-raised-5m-from.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Atlanta Business Chronicle|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{Main|Micronized rubber powder}}

Lehigh has commercialized a proprietary cryogenic turbo mill technology that transforms end-of-life tires and post-industrial rubber materials into micronized rubber powders. Lehigh produces MRP from [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[elastomer]]ic material, most often end-of-life tire material. However, it can also be produced from post-industrial nitrile rubber, [[EPDM rubber|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]], and natural rubber compounds.

===Products===
Lehigh's MRPs are available in two product lines, PolyDyne and MicroDyne. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products. It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt, coatings, and sealants. MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and nylons. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

The particle size distributions of Lehigh's MRP typically range from 830&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] (20 [[mesh (scale)|mesh]]) to 50&amp;nbsp;µm (300 mesh), and its MRP is free of foreign particulates, such as metal and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|title=Tires Are Being Turned Into The Newest Renewable Resource--All It Takes Is Some Freezing And Fine Chopping |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681040/tires-are-being-turned-into-the-newest-renewable-resource-all-it-takes-is-some-freezing-and-|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=Fast Company|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-Generation Technology===
Lehigh claims that its cryogenic turbo mill technology represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most common rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects. A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.

Because of the material's smaller size, Lehigh markets its micrometer-scale MRP as a third-generation rubber processing technology. MRP's size and composition enables it to be incorporated into advanced and higher-value applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/what_is_micronized_rubber_powder|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Lehigh's MRP is used as a compound extender to replace natural rubber and synthetic polymers, as well as to act as a process aid in material production. Lehigh claims that because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, MRP can reduce formulation costs. The company has asserted that MRP can offer up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is derived from end-of-life materials, MRP can also improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used. For example, Lehigh has stated that the smaller particle sizes of MRP increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valk|first=Vincent|title=Lehigh Technologies: Specialty chemicals from scrap |url=http://www.chemweek.com/sections/specialty_chemicals/Lehigh-Technologies-Specialty-chemicals-from-scrap_62315.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=IHS Chemical Week|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39495">This is a '''list of companies founded by [[University of Pennsylvania]] alumni''', including attendees who enrolled in degree-programs at University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) but did not eventually graduate. This list is not exhaustive, as it only includes notable [[Company|companies]] of which the founding and development history is well recorded by reliable sources. In particular, [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] are listed with their owners in parentheses.

University of Pennsylvania is a highly entrepreneurial university and its alumni have founded a variety of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research/university-entrepreneurship-report/|title=The University Entrepreneurship Report – Alumni of Top Universities Rake in $12.6 Billion Across 559 Deals|date=2012-10-29|work=CB Insights Research|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicsprings.com/founders-funding-and-exit-ranking-usa|title=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|work=Founders Funding And Exit Ranking Usa {{!}} GraphicSprings|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[PitchBook Data|PitchBook]], from 2006 to 2017, UPenn produced 788 company founders as alumni or current students, creating 712 companies, fifth most among all universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2017-2018_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2017-2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2016-2017_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2016-2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that had stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Acquisitions|acquired]].

== Top companies by revenues ==

=== Fortune Global 500 (2017) ===
This list shows companies in [[Fortune Global 500|''Fortune Global 500'']] founded or co-founded by UPenn alumni. The cut-off revenue for 2017 ''Fortune Global 500'' companies is $21,609M in 2016.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/list/|title=Fortune Global 500 List 2017: See Who Made It|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lynda Gratton''' (born February 1955) a British [[organizational theorist]], consultant, and Professor of Management Practice at [[London Business School]] and the founder of the Hot Spots Movement, known for her work on [[organisational behaviour]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Liverpool]], England, the oldest of four children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/31f1663c-11fc-11df-b6e3-00144feab49a.html Gratton] at ft.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gratton took a degree in [[psychology]] degree followed by a PhD at [[Liverpool University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/my-way-lynda-gratton-gives-her-tips-on-succeeding-at-work-769318.html Gratton] at independent.co article&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation Gratton started her career at [[British Airways]], where she was Chief [[Psychologist]]. In 1982 she moved to the management consultancy firm [[PA Consulting Group]], where she became Director.

In 1989 she started her academic career as Assistant Professor at [[London Business School]]. In 2004 she was appointed Senior Fellow of the UK's Advanced Institute of Management Practice. In 2006 she became the founding director of the Lehman Centre for Women in Business at the London Business School.

In 2005 she founded the [http://www.hotspotsmovement.com/ Hot Spots Movement], a specialist research and consulting team that bridges academia and business.  In October 2009 the Hot Spots Movement launched the Future of Work Research Consortium, spearheading an experiment in co-creation among management, academics and executives. To date, the Future of Work Research Consortium has brought together executives from more than 110 global companies in Europe, South Africa, Japan, and Australia.

Gratton is a Fellow of the World Economic Forum and has chaired the WEF Council on Leadership. She chairs the Drucker prize panel and is on the governing body of London Business School. She continues to work with many of the world's biggest companies, including [[Vodafone]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Unilever]]. She was for many years the judging panel of the [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cb38737a-8406-11e1-9d54-00144feab49a.html ft.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity'' was shortlisted for the 2016 [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/bloomsbury-get-two-ft-business-book-shortlist-390771 |title=Bloomsbury has two on FT Business Book shortlist |work=The Bookseller |author=Natasha Onwuemezi |date=8 September 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
In 2000 she published ''Living Strategy: Putting People at the Heart of Corporate Purpose'', which has since been translated into more than 15 languages.  It looks at how to place employees in the context of a business with all its competing attractions, and how organisations should understand and empower staff. It includes case studies from [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Motorola]] and Glaxxo Welcome.

In 2002, Gratton's article "Integrating the Enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/2002-fall/4413/integrating-the-enterprise/ sloanreview.mit.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; which examined cooperative strategies, was awarded the [[MIT]] Sloan Management Review best article of the year.

In 2003 she published ''The Democratic Enterprise: Liberating your Business with Freedom, Flexibility and Commitment'', which was described by [[Financial Times]] as a work of important scholarship and has provided a fascinating insight into how companies will change over the coming decades.

Her 2005 case study with S. Ghoshal, of [[BP]]'s peer assist integration practices called "[[BP]]: Organisational Transformation" won the ECCH Best Strategy Case of the year award and went on to win the best case of the year.

In 2007 her book ''Hot Spots: Why Some Companies Buzz with Energy and Innovation – and Others Don't'' was rated by the Financial Times as one of the most important business books of 2007.  It has since been translated into more than 10 languages.

Her 2009 book ''Glow: how to bring energy and innovation to your life'' gave practical exercises to enable people to become more innovative, collaborative and better connected.

In 2009, Lynda Gratton founded the Future of Work Research Consortium, which is a collaborative research project that creates insights into what the future of work will look like, and how organisations can prepare.

In 2011, Gratton published ''The Shift: The Future of Work is Already Here'', which looks at the future of work and was supported by the innovative research carried out in the Future of Work Research Consortium, and in 2014 ''The Key – How Corporations Succeed by Solving the World's Toughest Problems''.

== Awards &amp; Recognition ==
In 2008 [[The Financial Times]] selected her as the business thinker most likely to make a real difference over the next decade. In 2011 she was ranked by [[The Times]] as one of the top 15 Business Thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.economist.com/speaker/lynda-gratton Lynda Gratton] at ''ideas.economist.com''&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2011 she was ranked number one in Human Resources Magazine's "Top 25 HR Most Influential UK Thinkers 2011" poll.

In 2012 The Shift received the business book of the year award in Japan and has been translated into more than 15 languages.

In 2013 she was awarded the Life Time Achievement Award by HR Magazine and equally in 2013 she was amongst the 15 top thought leaders in the Thinkers50 ranking.

In 2015 The Key won the CMI Management Book of the Year. This book looks at the impact of the changing world on corporate practices and processes and on leadership.

In 2016, Lynda Gratton and co-author Professor Andrew Scott, published The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity, which, translated into many languages, continues to generate significant interest across the world, also in Japan, where it quickly became a bestseller. It was shortlisted for the FT Business Book of the Year award.

Lynda’s work has been acknowledged globally – she has won the Tata prize in India; in the US she has been named as the annual Fellow of NAHR and won the CCL prize; whilst in Australia she has won the HR prize. In 2017, Lynda became an Advisor for @GoogleOrg’s initiative to help people prepare for the changing nature of work and was also, as the only foreigner, invited by Prime Minister Abe of Japan to join a new advisory council “Council for designing the 100-year-life society”.

'''May Lucretia Shepard Cheney''' (May 11, 1862 – April 22, 1942) was born during the Civil War in Garden Grove, Iowa, and was named after the month in which she was born, and her maternal grandmother who influenced her childhood. May's early school attendance was in her hometown. She attended high schools in Oakland and Chico, California before enrolling at [[University of California, Berkeley|UCB]] in 1879. With her widowed mother, she settled at ''2020 Hearst Avenue'' (then ''College Way''), in a house with a watermill in the rear yard.&lt;ref name=BH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/cheney.html| title=U.C. offers the American Turgenev’s house for one dollar| work=[[Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residing in the same house was [[Lemuel Warren Cheney]] (1858–1921), a law student.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;

The following year, the Shepards moved to 2316 Allston Way, across the street from the campus. Before long, Cheney had moved there too. The Shepards’ last address before May’s graduation in 1883 was Club House No. 4 on the university grounds, again shared by Cheney, now a journalist. In addition to their shared living quarters, May and Lemuel had a common interest in literature. Both belonged to the Neolaean Literary Society, of which May was vice-president.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucb/studentpubs.html| title=Berkeley: Student Publications| work=[[University of California, Berkeley Libraries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1883, during her senior year, she married Cheney, the Bachelor of Letters degree was granted to her in December of that year. They left for Europe, where he served as [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] correspondent for the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]. Their first son, Charles Henry Cheney, was born in Rome in February 1884. Upon their return she and her husband had a house built close to UCB, on College Avenue in [[Lodi, California|Lodi]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

In 1886, when she was 24 years old, May founded Cheney’s Pacific Coast Bureau of Education in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. It was the first commercial teacher placement agency west of the Rockies, and her husband participated in its management. She decided that UCB owed some obligation to the graduates unable to find proper positions. The English universities had appointment secretaries. Harvard University had a similar official. UCB, she thought, should likewise give such a service to students. After she convinced UCB President [[Martin Kellogg]], her plan was accepted. She opened the UCB placement service in the president's office in South Hall on January 1, 1898, and continued to serve as the university’s Appointment Secretary for 40 years, placing countless university graduates as high-school teachers throughout the state.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

The Cheneys raised four sons, three of whom survived to adulthood. The eldest, Charles Henry Cheney (1884–1943), earned the first architectural degree awarded by UC before continuing his studies in Paris, eventually becoming a notable city planner and zoning expert. His son, Warren DeWitt Cheney (1907-1979), was a well-known sculptor and art teacher who took up psychology in midlife, founding the Transactional Analysis Journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.invaluable.com/artist/cheney-warren-dewitt-e1e1hbp3gx| title=Warren Dewitt Cheney (1907-1979)| work=Invaluable.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheldon Warren Cheney]] (1886–1980), entered his father’s real estate business before moving to Detroit, where he became a notable author and art critic. In 1916 he founded [[Theatre Arts Magazine]]. Marshall Chipman Cheney (1888–1972) became a physician. He did his residency at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] before returning to Berkeley, where he practiced near the campus and at Cowell Memorial Hospital. He lived with his widowed mother at 2241 College Avenue until 1940.&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

At the end of 1939, May Cheney sold her two campus houses to the university, and the family soon moved to 116 Tunnel Road. The two Cheney houses on campus were designated City of Berkeley Landmarks in 1990. Built in 1885, 2241 College Avenue is the second oldest surviving structure in the Berkeley Property Tract.

May L. Cheney was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the [[American College Personnel Association]].&lt;ref name=ACPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=BH/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In choosing a permanent home we seek that place above all others which promises abundance of life, stimulus, interests that postpone as long as possible the inevitable apathy of old age. Where do we find this precious boon more abundantly than in Berkeley?&lt;ref&gt;May L. Cheney, ''Berkeley Reporter'', December 1906&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cheney unhurt in campus shooting==
On August 4, 1919, Cheney was shot at by Roger Sprague, a chemistry assistant who was despondent at not being recommended for further advancement. She escaped unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19190805.2.6| title=Refused Position, Man Attempts Life Of Two Professors| work=[[The Sacramento Union]], Volume 209, Number 36 (Sacramento, California)| date=5 August 1919| page=1| accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale - Paris - 2.jpg|thumb|The head office of the ministry]]
The '''Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche}}), or simply "Ministry of National Education", as the title has changed no small number of times in the course of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] is the French government [[French government ministers|cabinet member]] charged with running France's public educational system and with the supervision of agreements and authorizations for private teaching organizations.

The Ministry's headquarters is located in the 18th century ''Hôtel de Rochechouart'' on the rue de [[Grenelle]] in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid2606/mentions-legales.html à propos du site - mentions légales - crédits]." Ministry of National Education. Retrieved on 6 May 2011. "Ministère de l’éducation nationale, de la jeunesse et de la vie associative Secrétariat général - Délégation à la communication 110 rue de Grenelle 75007 Paris"&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that National Education is France's largest employer, and employs more than half of the [[French Civil Service|French state civil servants]], the position is traditionally a fairly strategic one. The current minister is [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]].

==History==
A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in [[France]] in 1802.  Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of '''Minister of Public Instruction''' was created in 1828.  For much of its history, the position was combined with that of [[Minister of Public Worship]], who dealt with issues related to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].  The position has also occasionally been combined with [[Minister of Sports (France)|Minister of Sports]] and Minister of Youth Affairs.  In 1932, the office's title was changed to '''Minister of National Education''', although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed '''Minister of Education''' during the Presidency of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1974–1981). In 1975, it created the ''[[Comité d'études sur les formations d'ingénieurs]]'' which studies the training and job placement of engineers in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">'''Parchmentising''' is a [[textile finishing]] treatment for [[cellulose]] [[fabric]], mainly [[cotton]] and [[flax]], which stiffens the fabric and imparts a degree of translucency.

== Development ==
The process was described in 1850 by [[John Mercer (scientist)|John Mercer]], who treated cotton with solutions of 110–125{{nbsp}}[[Twaddell scale|°Tw]] [[sulfuric acid]], at room temperature, followed by washing. Mercer observed that the treated fabric was soft like fine wool when treated at 110{{nbsp}}°Tw, shrank and stiffened at 114{{nbsp}}°Tw, or shrank, stiffened, and became semi-transparent from 116–125{{nbsp}}°Tw. 
In general, treating indefinitely with concentrations below 110{{nbsp}}°Tw (64%) only swells and shrinks the fabric, while higher concentrations produce the stiff, translucent parchment-like effect in a few seconds, with some loss of tensile strength.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;{{citation | author=J. T. Marsh | chapter=Dispersion Processes | title=An Introduction To Textile Finishing | year=1948 | pages=121–122 | url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.6810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile makers have combined sulfuric acid treatment with other processes to achieve different effects. For example, [[Mercerising]] cotton fabric before acid treatment appears to make it more susceptible to treatment at lower concentrations of sulfuric acid. At about 106 °Tw the Mercerised lustre is removed and the fabric becomes fuller, softer, and more wool-like, similar to a crêpe. The parchmentising effect is still present at higher concentrations, and may be obtained as low as 107.5 °Tw with somewhat longer treatment, perhaps a few minutes. Acid and alkaline treatments are sometimes applied several times in alternation, and patterns may be created by locally applying a [[resist]] before or between treatments.
At every stage the treatment is stopped by washing and neutralizing the fabric. After acid treatment and washing, a heavy [[calender]], sometimes heated, can be applied to the wet or dried fabric to vary its translucency.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

The '''Petrochemical Heritage Award''' was established in 1997, "to recognize individuals who made outstanding contributions to the [[petrochemical industry|petrochemical community]]."&lt;ref name="Quote"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation to present Petrochemical Heritage Award to Harold Sorgenti|url=http://www3.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/G/20021571.html|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Science Blog|date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is intended to inspire achievement and to promote public understanding. The award winner is chosen annually by the Founders Club and the [[Science History Institute]] (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation). The award is traditionally presented at the [[International Petrochemical Conference]] hosted by the [[American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers]] (AFPM), formerly known as NPRA, the National Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Association.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Petrochemical Heritage Award|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/petrochemical-heritage-award|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmaceutics''' is the discipline of [[pharmacy]] that deals with the process of turning a [[new chemical entity]] (NCE) or old drugs into a medication to be used safely and effectively by patients.  It is also called the science of dosage form design.  There are many chemicals with [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] properties, but need special measures to help them achieve therapeutically relevant amounts at their sites of action. Pharmaceutics helps relate the formulation of drugs to their delivery and disposition in the body.&lt;ref name="washington1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sop.washington.edu/pharmaceutics/about/what-is-pharmaceutics.html |title=What is Pharmaceutics? &amp;amp;#124; Pharmaceutics |publisher=Sop.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pharmaceutics deals with the formulation of a pure drug substance into a [[dosage form]].
Branches of pharmaceutics include:
*[[Pharmaceutical formulation]]
*
*[[Pharmaceutical manufacturing]]
*Dispensing pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical technology
*Physical pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical jurisprudence
Pure drug substances are usually white [[crystalline]] or [[amorphous]] powders. Historically before the advent of medicine as a science it was common for pharmacists to dispense drugs ''as is'', most drugs today are administered as parts of a dosage form. The clinical performance of drugs depends on their form of presentation to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=edited by Gilbert S.

'''Shaping processes in crystal growth''' are a collection of techniques for growing bulk [[crystals]] of a defined shape from a melt, usually by constraining the shape of the liquid [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] by means of a mechanical shaper. Crystals are commonly grown as fibers, solid cylinders, hollow cylinders (or tubes), and sheets (or plates). More complex shapes such as tubes with a complex cross section, and domes have also been produced.&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;Dobrovinskaya, Elena R., Leonid A. Lytvynov, and Valerian Pishchik. Sapphire: material, manufacturing, applications. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009. {{ISBN|0387856943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a shaping process can produce a [[near net shape]] crystal and reduce the manufacturing cost for crystals which are composed of very expensive or difficult to machine materials.

== List of shaping processes ==
* Edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG)
* Horizontal ribbon growth (HRG)
* [[Micro-pulling-down]] (µ-PD)
* Stepanov technique
* [[String ribbon]]

== Edge-defined film-fed growth ==
'''Edge-defined film-fed growth''' or '''EFG''' was developed for [[sapphire#synthetic sapphire|sapphire]] growth in the late 1960s by Harold LaBelle and A. Mlavsky at Tyco Industries.&lt;ref name="RobichaudHarris2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robichaud|first1=Joseph L.|last2=Harris|first2=Daniel C.|last3=Goodman|first3=William A.|title=A century of sapphire crystal growth: origin of the EFG method|volume=7425|year=2009|pages=74250P|issn=0277786X|doi=10.1117/12.824452}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A shaper (also referred to as a die) having dimensions approximately equal to the crystal to be grown rests above the surface of the melt which is contained in a [[crucible]]. [[Capillary action]] feeds liquid material to a slit at the center of the shaper. When a [[seed crystal]] is touched to the liquid film and raised upwards, a [[single crystal]] forms at the [[interface (matter)|interface]] between the solid seed and the liquid film. By continuing to pull the seed upwards, the crystal expands as a liquid film forms between the crystal and the top surface of the shaper. When the film reaches the edges of the shaper, the final crystal shape matches that of the shaper.

The exact dimensions of the crystal will deviate from the dimensions of the shaper because every material has a characteristic '''growth angle''', the angle formed at the triple interface between the solid crystal, liquid film, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Duffar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffar|first1=Thierry|editor1-last=Rudolph|editor1-first=Peter|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth Vol. IIB|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|pages=758-789|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63303-3.00019-5|chapter=Capillarity and Shape Stability in Crystal Growth from the Melt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the growth angle, varying the height of the meniscus (i.e. the thickness of the liquid film) will change the dimensions of the crystal. The meniscus height is affected by pulling speed and crystallization rate. The crystallization rate depends on the temperature gradient above the shaper, which is determined by the configuration of the hot-zone of the crystal growth [[vacuum furnace|furnace]], and the [[electric power|power]] applied to the heating elements during growth.  The difference in [[thermal expansion]] coefficients between the shaper material and the crystal material can also cause appreciable size differences between the shaper and the crystal at room temperature for crystals grown at high temperatures.  

The shaper material should be non-reactive with both the melt and growth atmosphere, and should be [[wetting|wet]] by the melt.&lt;ref name="Surek"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Surek|first1=T.|last2=Coriell|first2=S.R.|last3=Chalmers|first3=B.|title=The growth of shaped crystals from the melt|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=50|issue=1|year=1980|pages=21–32|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90227-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to grow multiple crystals from a single crucible using the EFG technique, for example by growing many parallel sheets. 

=== Applications ===

'''Sapphire''': EFG is used to grow large plates of [[sapphire]], primarily for use as robust [[infrared]] windows for [[arms industry|defense]] and other applications. Windows about 7&amp;nbsp;mm thick x 300 &amp;nbsp;mm wide x 500&amp;nbsp;mm long are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLASS Sapphire Sheets|url=https://www.crystals.saint-gobain.com/products/sapphire-large-sheets-class|website=Saint-Gobain|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaper is typically made from [[molybdenum]].

'''Silicon:''' EFG was used in the 2000s by [[Schott AG#Schott Solar|Schott Solar]] to produce [[silicon]] sheets for [[solar photovoltaic]] panels, by pulling a thin-walled (~250-300&amp;nbsp;μm) octagon with faces 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm on a side and diameter about 38&amp;nbsp;cm, about 5-6&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref name="MackintoshSeidl2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackintosh|first1=B|last2=Seidl|first2=A|last3=Ouellette|first3=M|last4=Bathey|first4=B|last5=Yates|first5=D|last6=Kelejs|first6=J|title=Large silicon crystal hollow-tube growth by the edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) method|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|date=25 January 2006|volume=287|issue=2|pages=428-432|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.11.058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaper is typically made from [[graphite]].

'''Other oxides''': Many high melting-point oxides have been grown by EFG, among them [[Gallium(III) oxide|Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium niobate|LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:(Lu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Gd&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (Nd:LGGG).&lt;ref name="MuJia2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mu|first1=Wenxiang|last2=Jia|first2=Zhitai|last3=Yin|first3=Yanru|last4=Hu|first4=Qiangqiang|last5=Li|first5=Yang|last6=Tao|first6=Xutang|title=Growth of homogeneous Nd:LGGG single crystal plates by edge-defined film-fed growth method|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=478|year=2017|pages=17–21|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2017.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often an [[iridium]] shaper is used.

== Horizontal ribbon growth ==
'''Horizontal ribbon growth''' or '''HRG''' is a method developed for [[silicon]] by which a thin crystalline sheet is pulled horizontally from the top of a crucible. The melt level must be constantly replenished in order to keep the surface of the melt at the same height as the edge of the crucible from which the sheet is being pulled. By blowing a cooling gas at the surface of the growing sheet, very high growth rates (&gt;400 mm/min) can be achieved. &lt;ref name="Kudo1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kudo|first1=B.|title=Improvements in the Horizontal Ribbon Growth technique for single crystal silicon|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|date=1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=247-259|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method relies on the solid crystal floating on the surface of the melt, which works because solid silicon is less dense than liquid silicon.

== Micro-pulling-down ==
:{{main|Micro-pulling-down}}

The '''micro-pulling-down''' or '''µ-PD''' technique uses a small round opening in the bottom of the crucible to pull a crystalline fiber downward. Hundreds of different crystalline materials have been grown by this technique.

A variation called '''pendant drop growth''' or '''PDG''' uses a slot in the bottom of the crucible to produce crystalline sheets in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Duffar" /&gt;

== Stepanov technique ==
The '''Stepanov technique''' was developed  by A.V. Stepanov in the Soviet Union after 1950.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The method involves pulling a crystal vertically through a shaper located at the surface of the melt. The shaper is not necessarily fed by a capillary channel as in EFG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tatartchenko|first1=Vitali|editor1-last=Dhanaraj|editor1-first=Govindhan|editor2-last=et. al.|title=Springer Handbook of Crystal Growth|date=2010|publisher=Springer|pages=537-541|chapter=Shaped Crystal Growth: TPS Brief History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaper material may be [[wetting|wetted]] or non-wetted by the melt, as opposed to EFG where the shaper material is wetted.&lt;ref name="Surek" /&gt; The technique has been used to grow metal, semiconductor, and oxide crystals.

[[Czochralski]] growth using a floating shaper known as a "coracle" was done for some [[III-V semiconductors]] prior to the development of advanced control-systems for diameter control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Jan|last2=Neubert|first2=Michael|editor1-last=Rudolph|editor1-first=Peter|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|page=1153|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63303-3.00028-6|chapter=Automation of Crystal Growth from Melt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== String ribbon ==
:{{main|String ribbon}}

The '''string ribbon''' method, also known as '''dendritic web''' or '''edge-supported pulling''', has been used to grow semiconductor sheets including [[indium antimonide]], [[gallium arsenide]], [[germanium]], and silicon.&lt;ref name="SeidenstickerHopkins1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seidensticker|first1=R.G.|last2=Hopkins|first2=R.H.|title=Silicon ribbon growth by the dendritic web process|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=50|issue=1|year=1980|pages=221–235|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A seed crystal with the width and thickness matching the sheet to be grown is dipped into the top surface of the melt. Strings of a suitable material are fixed to the vertical edges of the seed and extend down through holes in the bottom of the crucible to a spool. As the seed is raised, string is continuously fed through the melt and a liquid film forms between the seed, the strings, and the melt. The film crystallizes to the seed, forming a sheet or ribbon.

{{nihongo|'''Shitagau Noguchi'''|野口 遵|Noguchi Shitagau|extra=July 26, 1873-January 15, 1944}} was a [[Japan]]ese entrepreneur who founded the Nichitsu ''[[zaibatsu]]''. Known as the father of electrochemical engineering in Japan, he invested heavily in the development of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and [[Manchukou]] in cooperation with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Shimbun, Aug. 9, 1999, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His company was dissolved under the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation]] after [[World War II]], and its successor companies include the [[Chisso]] Corporation, and portions of [[Asahi Kasei]], Sekisui Chemical Company, and [[Shin-Etsu Chemical]].

==Biography==
Noguchi was born to a [[samurai]] class family in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], Japan. He studied [[electrical engineering]] at the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] and was hired by [[Siemens]] in 1898. He designed Japan's first commercial production plant for [[Calcium carbide]] in [[Sendai]] in 1903. In 1906, two Germans, A.Frank and N. Caro, invented a new method to produce [[calcium cyanamide]] to be used a fertilizer. Noguchi learnt of this invention in a newspaper and realized that the method could be used to utilize the calcium carbide that his plant produced. He went to Germany, and with the support of an acquaintance at Siemens obtained the patent rights, beating other, larger and better-known Japanese trading firms like [[Mitsui]] and [[Furukawa Group|Furukawa]].{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}}

In 1906, he formed the company Kiso Electric, to develop a [[hydroelectric power]] in [[Kagoshima prefecture]] under contract by local mine owners in [[Kyūshū]]. Since the capacity of the plant he built - 800&amp;nbsp;kW - was in excess of the demand, he established another company, Nippon Carbide Shokai, located in [[Minamata, Kumamoto]], to produce calcium carbide with the surplus electricity in 1907.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}}

With financial help from [[Mitsubishi]], Noguchi merged his two companies into ''Nihon Chisso Hiryo'' (lit. "Japan Nitrogenous Fertilizer") in 1908. The name was frequently abbreviated to "Nichitsu". Then, with his collaborator, Fujiyama Tsuneichi, he developed a 'continuous method' of production to replace the 'alternate method' of Frank-Caro's technology. He also produced [[ammonium sulphate]] out of the calcium cyanamide, because it was safer and better known.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=78}} In 1914, he formed "Hiroshima Electric", the forerunner of [[Chugoku Electric Power]] to develop the hydroelectric power potential of the [[Chugoku region]] of Japan.

In 1921 Noguchi bought a new technology for synthetic [[ammonia]] from an Italian, [[Luigi Casale]]. It was still at the stage of a tiny pilot plant when he purchased the license. Again, by their own effort, Nichitsu succeeded in developing a commercially viable plant and selling ammonium sulphate cheaper than the rivals could, thereby dominating the market.  Nichitsu also diversified into the production of [[synthetic fiber]] and [[dynamite]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
In 1922 the German rayon manufacturer [[Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken]] (VGF) invested in a new Japanese firm in partnership with Noguchi and Asahi Chemicals. The technology was licensed under conditions that prevented competition in VGF's home market, and ensured that VGF would receive the rights to any technical advances made in Japan.{{sfn|Donzé|Nishimura|2013|p=89}}

In 1926, with the collaboration of the Imperial Japanese Army, Noguchi established "Chosen Electric Power" and "Chosen Chisso Hiryo". The former developed Pujon and Chagjin branches of the [[Yalu River]] in northern Korea with a number of huge hudraulic power plants, which supplied a number of huge electrochemical plants, producing a diverse range of products, from fertilizer and explosives to soda and metals.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=79}}

Noguchi suffered from an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] while at [[Seoul]] in 1940, and began to withdraw from active involvement in his conglomerate, which by 1941 had invested 659 million [[Yen]], 66 percent of the fixed capital in the Nichitsu Group, in Korea. Within Korea, 34 percent of all the industrial production in 1939 was made by the Nichisu group.{{sfn|Odagiri|1996|p=79}}  In 1941, Noguchi donated his personal fortune to [[The Korean Scholarship Foundation]], dedicated to building schools, funding scholarships, and raising educational standards in Korea. In 1942, he was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasures]], 1st class. He died in 1944.

'''Stephen Roland Lee, Sr.''', known as '''Swords R. Lee''' (February 8, 1859 – February 13, 1929), was a wealthy [[lumber]]man from [[Pollock, Louisiana|Pollock]] and then [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], [[Louisiana]], who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] for his adopted [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]] from 1904 to 1908. His term corresponded with the administration of [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Newton C. Blanchard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembership_History_CURRENT.pdf|title=Membership in the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2016: Grant Parish|publisher=house.louisiana.gov|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

One of eight children of Stephen Lee, Sr., and the former Rebecca Grantham, Lee was born two years before the start of the [[American Civil War]] in [[Perry County, Mississippi|Perry County]] in southeastern [[Mississippi]]. He was a lineal descendant of [[Light Horse Harry Lee]] of [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], the father of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General]] [[Robert E. Lee]]. His grandfather, Elijah Lee of [[North Carolina]], fought in the 1815 [[Battle of New Orleans]] under General [[Andrew Jackson]]. Lee's middle was derived from his paternal grandmother, Martha Roland. The Lees left Perry County when he was twelve years of age. He was educated in the [[State school|public schools]] of Grant Parish; after reaching adulthood, he taught school for a number of years.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/winn/obits/l/leesr229.txt|title=Col. Stephen R. Lee of Alexandria Dies at His Home Feb. 13: Industrial and Political Leader, Descendant of Famous Lees|date=February 22, 1929|work=Winnfield News-American |location=[[Winnfield, Louisiana]]|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee was the president and general manager of the Lee Lumber Company, which operated a large [[sawmill]] at [[Tioga, Louisiana|Tioga]] in northwestern [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides Parish]]. The company closed c. 1917 after the nearby timber was exhausted. He was the Grant Parish [[Assessor (property)|assessor]] during the 1890s, having been appointed to the since elected position by then Governor [[Murphy J. Foster, Sr.]] After his legislative term ended, he relocated to Alexandria. He had a large political following and worked in 1928 for the successful election of [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]er [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]], as the Louisiana governor. Lee was a cousin by marriage of Huey Long.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0CKVuAldzEC&amp;pg=PA284|title=Kingfish: The Reign of Huey P.

On November 12, 1884, Lee married Martha Cornelia Nugent (1862-1933), a daughter of Matthew and Julie Ann Mackie Nugent, pioneer Grant Parish settlers. Lee died of an illness of several months at his Alexandria home at the intersection of Fourth and St. James streets five days after his seventieth birthday. He was survived by his widow and four children, Maude Lee Eubank (1885-1958) and husband Benjamin Franklin Eubank (1882-1962), J. H. Lee, and Ethel Lee Jarrell (1896-1967) and husband Marion Fahy Jarrell (1897-1977), all of Alexandria, and Mrs. S. J. Rogers of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] in [[Ouachita Parish, Louisiana|Ouachita Parish]] in northeast Louisiana. Three other Lee children had died prior to their father, Florence, Lucille, and Samuel Patterson Lee. He had two surviving grandsons,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  one of whom, [[James Eubank]] served briefly in the Louisiana House in 1952, during which time he was a floor leader for Governor [[Robert F. Kennon]]. Representative Eubank died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Alexandria at the age of thirty-seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Rowland Eubank|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]|date=November 10, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee is interred with other family members at Greenwood Memorial Park in [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. Both [[Methodist]] and [[Southern Baptist]] pastors officiated at his funeral, with [[Masonic lodge]] graveside rites following.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

The '''Sydney central business district''' (also '''Sydney CBD''', and often referred to simply as "'''Town'''" or "'''the City'''") is the main [[Central business district|commercial centre]] of [[Sydney]], the state capital of [[New South Wales]] and the most populous city in [[Australia]]. It extends southwards for about {{convert|3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from [[Sydney Cove]], the point of first European settlement in which the [[Regions of Sydney|Sydney region]] was initially established. Due to its pivotal role in Australia's early history, it is one of the oldest established areas in the country.

Geographically, its north–south axis runs from [[Circular Quay]] in the north to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]] in the south. Its east–west axis runs from a chain of parkland that includes [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]] on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] in the east; to [[Darling Harbour]] and the [[Western Distributor (Sydney)|Western Distributor]] in the west. At the 2016 Australian Census, the CBD recorded a population of 17,252.&lt;ref name="census16"/&gt; "Sydney CBD" is very occasionally used to refer not only to the CBD proper, but also its nearby inner suburbs such as [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]], [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]], [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] and [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]].

The Sydney CBD is Australia's main financial and economic centre, as well as a leading hub of economic activity for the Asia-Pacific region. The city centre employs approximately 13% of the Sydney region's workforce. Based on industry mix and relative occupational wage levels it is estimated that economic activity ( GDP ) generated in the city in 2015/16 was approximately $118 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxpayer.com.au/News/28447/Australia’s_economic_activity_heavily_concentrated_in_Sydney_and_Melbourne|title=Australia's economic activity heavily concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne|publisher=taxpayer.com.au|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=31 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401184658/http://www.taxpayer.com.au/News/28447/Australia%E2%80%99s_economic_activity_heavily_concentrated_in_Sydney_and_Melbourne#|archive-date=1 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the city centre is Sydney's focal point for [[nightlife]] and entertainment. It is also home to some of the city's most significant [[List of tallest buildings in Sydney|buildings and structures]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Sydney}}
The Sydney CBD is an area of very densely concentrated skyscrapers and other buildings, interspersed by several parks such as [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], [[The Domain, Sydney|The Domain]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and [[Wynyard Park, Sydney|Wynyard Park]]. [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] is the Sydney CBD's main north–south thoroughfare. The streets run on a slightly warped grid pattern in the southern CBD, but in the older northern CBD the streets form several intersecting grids, reflecting their placement in relation to the prevailing breeze and orientation to Circular Quay in early settlement.

The CBD runs along two ridge lines below Macquarie Street and York Streets. Between these ridges is Pitt Street, running close to the course of the original [[Tank Stream]] (now tunnelled). [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge Street]], took its name from the bridge running east–west that once crossed this stream. [[Pitt Street, Sydney|Pitt Street]] is the retail heart of the city which includes the [[Pitt Street Mall]] and the [[Sydney Tower]]. [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] is a historic precinct that houses such buildings as the State [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliament House]] and the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].

== History ==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
In the midst of World War 1, on Valentine's day, riots racked the CBD, in what has come to be known as the Central Station Riots of 1916. A substantial segment of the violence was concentrated in the Central area. These riots involved five thousand military recruits who refused to comply with extraneous parade orders. During the riots they caused significant damage to buildings. People with "foreign" names were especially targeted. The recruits clashed with soldiers, resulting in the death of Private Ernest William Keefe. A number of eight people sustained injuries. Because this incident occurred in the middle of the Great War the state discouraged media coverage. Only a fifth of the rioters were court-marshalled. These riots spurred the introduction of lockout laws for pubs after 6pm. This law was only lifted in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Central Station Riots of 1916 |url=http://www.historyofsydney.com.au/the-central-station-riots-of-1916/ |website=History of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritage listings ==
Sydney CBD has many heritage-listed buildings including:

== Governance ==
Administratively, the Sydney CBD falls under the authority of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/|title=Home|publisher=City of Sydney|accessdate=6 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219055647/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/#|archive-date=19 February 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales state government]] also has authority over some aspects of the CBD, in particular through the [[Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority]]. [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] [[Alex Greenwich]] has represented the Sydney seat since the [[Sydney state by-election, 2012|2012 by-election]], triggered by the resignation of previous independent [[Clover Moore]], who was the [[Lord Mayor of Sydney]], due to introduced state laws preventing dual membership of state parliament and local council.

== Commercial area ==

The Sydney CBD is home to some of the largest Australian companies, as well as serving as an Asia-Pacific headquarters for many large international companies. The financial services industry in particular occupies much of the available office space, with companies such as the [[Westpac]], [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]], [[Citibank]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Macquarie Bank]], [[AMP Limited]], [[Insurance Australia Group]], AON, Marsh, Allianz, [[HSBC]], [[AXA]], [[ABN Amro]],&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.abnamro.com/en/careers/international/australia/index.html Australia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216141914/https://www.abnamro.com/en/careers/international/australia/index.html# |date=16 February 2017 }}."

=== Church Hill ===

''Church Hill'' is a northerly district in the Central Business district of [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html|title=Church Hill|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042202/http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so named because the earliest churches in Australia were formed on this site, including St Patrick's (Roman Catholic),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stpatschurchhill.org/about-st-patricks-church-hill-sydney/|title=About St Patrick's Church Hill|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810072550/http://stpatschurchhill.org/about-st-patricks-church-hill-sydney/#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Philip's (Anglican)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchhillanglican.com/|title=St Philip's / Church Hill|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042319/http://www.churchhillanglican.com/#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scots Church, Sydney|Scots Church]] (Presbyterian)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scotschurchsydney.org/|title=Scots Church Sydney|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809101446/http://scotschurchsydney.org/#|archive-date=9 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of Church Hill dates back to the time of Governor [[Arthur Phillip]], who mandated compulsory Sunday church attendance for all convicts, until they rebelled and burned down the area’s first church in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html|title=Church Hill|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042202/http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area gained greater prominence as Church Hill on Wednesday 1 October 1800, when incoming Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] had the foundation stone laid for St Philip’s Church, which subsequently he proclaimed one of Australia’s first two parishes in 1802 (the other being St John’s in [[Parramatta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html|title=Church Hill|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810042202/http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/church-hill.html#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site where St Patrick’s Church currently stands is where the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Eucharist]] was first preserved in Australia, in May 1818. Celebrations for the bicentenary of this occasion were held in St Patrick’s Church on Sunday 6 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicweekly.com.au/200-years-blessed-sacrament-celebrated-birthplace-church-australia/|title=200 years of the Blessed Sacrament celebrated at the “birthplace” of the Church in Australia|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810061119/https://www.catholicweekly.com.au/200-years-blessed-sacrament-celebrated-birthplace-church-australia/#|archive-date=10 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed stop on the tram network under construction on George Street may be named Church Hill.

Sydney's CBD is serviced by [[commuter rail]], [[light rail]], [[buses]] and [[Sydney Ferries|ferry]] transport.

Commuter rail's main hub is [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Railway Station]] ("Central"), located in the southern part of the CBD in [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]]: it connects services for almost all of the lines in the [[Sydney Trains]] network, as well as being the terminus for [[NSW TrainLink]] country and inter-urban rail services. There is a largely-underground CBD rail loop, accessed in both directions via Central, which services five additional CBD stations, plus an underground spur line to Bondi Junction which services two. This is known as the [[City Circle]]. The [[Dulwich Hill Line]], the only currently operating light rail line in Sydney (another is under construction) links the southern part of the CBD and Central to nearby suburbs of Sydney's [[Inner-west]]. Buses, both [[State Transit Authority|government-run]] and privately owned, service the CBD along several dozen routes to both inner and more remote suburbs. [[NightRide]] is an after-hours bus service that operates between midnight and 5:00&amp;nbsp;am, with most services running from George Street outside the Sydney Town Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/tickets/ticket-types/bus.page#nightride NightRide bus tickets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030044712/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/tickets/ticket-types/bus.page#nightride#nightride |date=30 October 2015 }}, Transport NSW Info. Retrieved 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney Ferries]] operate largely from [[Circular Quay]], on the northern edge of the CBD. There are several wharves (directly beneath the elevated Circular Quay commuter rail station), with Wharf 3 operating exclusively to [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]]. There are also ferries at the western edge of the CBD at [[King Street Wharf]], just to the south of [[Barangaroo, New South Wales|Barangaroo]].

Sydney's culture is compacted within its central business district and inner city ring, due to its nightlife, pedestrian traffic and centrality of notable attractions. There is a large concentration of cultural institutions within the CBD including: the [[Museum of Sydney]], the [[State Library of New South Wales]], the [[Customs House, Sydney|Customs House]] branch of the [[City of Sydney Library]], the [[Theatre Royal, Sydney|Theatre Royal]], the [[City Recital Hall]] and the [[Japan Foundation]]. There are a total of 19 churches located in the Sydney city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyorgan.com/Sydneychurches.html|title=Churches|publisher=sydneyorgan.com|accessdate=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622132645/http://www.sydneyorgan.com/Sydneychurches.html#|archive-date=22 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cultural institutions are located at the surrounds of the CBD, such as: the [[Sydney Opera House]] and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney|Museum of Contemporary Art]] to the north, the [[Australian Museum]] and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] to the east, the [[Powerhouse Museum]] to the west, [[White Rabbit Gallery]] and the Haymarket branch of the City of Sydney Library to the south.

Every January during the summer, the city celebrates with the [[Sydney Festival]]. There are art, music and dance exhibitions at indoor and outdoor venues. Australian and International theatre during the month is also featured, including [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]], and Contemporary. Many of these events are free.

The [[Sydney Film Festival]] is an international event organised every year in June at various venues across the CBD. The festival opened on 11 June 1954 and was held over four days, with screenings at Sydney University. Attendance was at full capacity with 1,200 tickets sold at one guinea each.&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{cite journal

==Architecture==

[[File:MLC 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Podium of the MLC Centre.]]
The Sydney CBD contains many of Australia's tallest skyscrapers, including [[Governor Phillip Tower]], [[MLC Centre]] and [[World Tower]], the latter consisting predominantly of apartments. It is also home to Australia's earliest skyscraper, the [[Australia Square]] building on George Street. As of 2017, the tallest structure is [[Centrepoint Tower]] at {{convert|309|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} which has dominated the city skyline since it was topped out in 1981. Recently,{{when|date=March 2017}} height limits for buildings were lifted from {{convert|235|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|310|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Sydney's CBD features a juxtaposition of old and new architecture. The old architecture dates back to Sydney's earliest days as a colony, down to the more grandiose Victorian architecture from the Gold rush era&amp;ndash;the most substantial examples are the Queen Victoria Building and the Sydney Town Hall. Modern architectures take form as high rises and skyscrapers, which are prolific among all of Sydney's city streets.  The earliest skyscraper constructed in Sydney was Culwulla Chambers, which stands at a height of {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and was completed in 1912.  Designed by Spain, Cosh and Minnett, the building consisted of 14 floors and cost £100,000 to build, equivalent of approximately $1&amp;nbsp;million in today's money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/society_art/temples/skyscraper.html|title=Sydney's first skyscraper|work=[[State Library of New South Wales]]|accessdate=11 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111085854/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/society_art/temples/skyscraper.html#|archive-date=11 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ogden''' (originally '''Streamline Tower''') is a 21-story luxury [[condominium]] tower located at 150 North Las Vegas Boulevard in [[downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The Ogden was announced in 2004 as the Streamline Tower condominium project, to be built on the former {{convert|1|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} property of the Golden Inn motel, which was demolished at the end of the year. Work on the property began in 2005, to prepare it for the new project, which began construction the following year. The project was financed by [[Corus Bankshares|Corus Bank]], and was developed by a half-dozen investors, including [[Las Vegas 51s|Las Vegas Stars]] baseball player [[Dusty Allen]].

The tower was [[Topping out|topped off]] in May 2007, and was opened on May 1, 2008. After its opening, Streamline Tower suffered poor sales as the result of a weak local and [[Great Recession in the United States|national economy]]. That year, 48 buyers who had yet to close escrow on their units filed a federal lawsuit against Streamline Tower in an attempt to retrieve their deposit money, after alleging that their units were smaller than expected and that they had been falsely promised the ability to make profits by renting out their units like hotel rooms.

In 2009, Corus Bank foreclosed on the property, which was subsequently acquired by ST Residential later that year after the failure of Corus Bank. In 2010, the tower's units were leased to renters. In January 2011, the property was renamed  The Ogden, after Ogden Avenue, one of the streets that the building faces. DK Las Vegas purchased the building in 2013, and began renovating and selling the units the following year, as the units' leases ended.

==History==

===Opening and operation===
Streamline Tower ultimately opened on May 1, 2008, with 275 units.&lt;ref name=Quiet/&gt; The opening had been delayed because of difficulty obtaining a certificate of occupancy.&lt;ref name=Promises/&gt; Prices for units ranged from $469,000 to $1.35 million. Because of the poor local and [[Great Recession in the United States|national economy]], only 156 of its units {{ndash}} 57 percent {{ndash}} had been sold, which was the lowest percentage of sales among five major condominium projects in the downtown area. Each of the property's street-level retail spaces also remained vacant after opening.&lt;ref name=Quiet&gt;{{cite news|last=Skolnik|first=Sam|title=Quiet on the northern front: Downtown condo tower mostly empty as revitalization efforts limp along|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jun/11/quiet-northern-front/|accessdate=March 22, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=June 11, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053044/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jun/11/quiet-northern-front/|archivedate=March 23, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, 48 buyers who had yet to close escrow on their units filed a federal lawsuit against the property, alleging that their units were smaller than expected and that the property had falsely promised buyers the ability to make profits by renting out their units like hotel rooms. The lawsuit sought the return of each buyer's deposit money. Streamline denied wrongdoing, stating that the claims "are completely refuted by the clear and unambiguous terms" of the purchase agreements.&lt;ref name=Promises/&gt; Susan Allen, the sales director for Streamline Tower and the wife of Dusty Allen,&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt; stated that sales agents were not supposed to guarantee the leasing of units. Allen also stated that no promises of leasing units had been made during the previous 15 months that she had worked for the project. The plaintiffs also had concerns about the retail spaces on the property, which were still vacant.&lt;ref name=Promises&gt;{{cite news|last=Skolnik|first=Sam|title=Promises unkept?

In November 2008, the property was appraised at $60.3 million, significantly less than the amount loaned by Corus:&lt;ref name=BuyersSue/&gt; $104 million.&lt;ref name=Hard/&gt; Streamline Tower LLC and other companies related to the project filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2009, halting any further action in the lawsuit. Corus subsequently received permission to foreclose on the property, and was owed $108 million by Streamline Tower LLC. In June 2009, approximately 40 buyers filed a lawsuit to retrieve their deposit money.&lt;ref name=BuyersSue&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Steve|title=Buyers sue for deposit money on downtown condos|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/01/buyers-sue-deposits-back-downtown-luxury-condos/|accessdate=March 22, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=July 1, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323053956/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/01/buyers-sue-deposits-back-downtown-luxury-condos/|archivedate=March 23, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2009, Corus had begun seeking buyers for the Streamline Tower property, with at least two potential buyers interested, including [[Irwin Molasky|The Molasky Group]].

Other improvements on the rooftop included a desert landscape theme. Condominium improvements included hardwood floors, granite countertops, [[green building]] features, and new lighting.

'''Thomas Cawthron''' (25 May 1833 – 8 October 1915) was a New Zealand businessman and philanthropist responsible for the establishment of the [[Cawthron Institute|Cawthron research institute]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Cawthron"&gt;{{DNZB|Gee|Margareta|2c13|Cawthron, Thomas 1833?–1915|10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Cawthron was born at [[Newington, Surrey]], on 25 May 1833 and was 15 years old when his parents and family set out for [[Nelson, New Zealand]], in the sailing ship ''Mary''. He worked in Wellington, then followed the gold miners to Australia, spending several years as a contractor for miscellaneous goods on the [[Victorian gold rush|goldfields]] of [[Bendigo]] and [[Ballarat]].

Returning to Nelson in the mid-1850s when his father became ill, he won a contract to dig the test drives for copper deposits on the Dun Mountain, going on to contract for the supply of food and stores for the copper-mining project and for the Jenkins Hill coal mine. He delivered supplies to miners in the rough Mineral Belt country, around 20&amp;nbsp;km away by a mountainous track from the Nelson township. Many fortunes were made and lost in New Zealand’s 19th century gold rushes. Cawthron invested in property, shares, local bodies, war loans and mortgages and seemed to have a ‘golden touch’ in all his business transactions. A canny merchant, he amassed his wealth from offices in the beached hulk of a ship at Nelson, but most of his money came through the hunt for coal and copper and from sending supplies to gold miners in [[Golden Bay]] and [[Hokitika]]. By the time of his retirement in the late 1880s, he had amassed a considerable fortune.

After his retirement, he lived quietly and frugally with his sister Mrs Wright. He seemed to have few interests other than the investment and care of his money. However, behind the scenes, he helped out in many individual cases of hardship and distress and contributed to causes such as relief funds, church organisations and educational and recreational schemes. In his later years, he made larger and more public gifts, including the Cathedral steps, the Rocks Road chains, Cawthron Park (in the hills to the east of the city), contributions towards a public hospital and nurses' home, and smaller donations to the Nelson Institute (which used to run the Nelson library), the Nelson School of Music and its pipe organ.

Thomas Cawthron died on 8 October 1915. He bequeathed £231,000, practically the whole of his estate, for the development of an industrial and technical school, institute and museum to be called the Cawthron Institute. This was officially opened in 1921 with [[Thomas Hill Easterfield]], emeritus professor of chemistry at [[Victoria University College]], as its first director.

The '''White House of the Confederacy''' is a historic house located in the [[Court End]] neighborhood of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Built in 1818, it was the main executive residence of the sole [[President of the Confederate States of America]], [[Jefferson Davis]], from August 1861 until April 1865. It was viewed as the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] counterpart to the [[White House]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House of the Confederacy |url=https://acwm.org/calendar-events/white-house-of-the-confederacy |website=[[American Civil War Museum]] |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 19th century, it has been a [[house museum]] operated by the [[American Civil War Museum]] and is known as the White House and Museum of the Confederacy.  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960.

==History==
The [[First White House of the Confederacy]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] was the first official residence of the President and his family. The second White House of the Confederacy is a gray stuccoed neoclassical mansion built in 1818 by [[John Brockenbrough]], who was president of the Bank of Virginia. Designed by [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]], Brockenbrough's private residence was built in early nineteenth century on East Clay Street in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]'s affluent [[Shockoe Hill]] neighborhood (later known as the [[Court End]] District), and was two blocks north of the Virginia State Capitol.  Among his neighbors were [[U.S. Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]], [[Aaron Burr]], defense attorney [[John Wickham (attorney)|John Wickham]], and future U.S. Senator [[Benjamin Watkins Leigh]].
 
Sold by the Brockenbrough family in 1844, the house passed through a succession of wealthy families throughout the [[antebellum South|antebellum]] period, including U.S. Congressman and future Confederate Secretary of War [[James Seddon]]. Just prior to the [[American Civil War]], Lewis Dabney Crenshaw purchased the house and added a third floor.  He sold the home to the City of Richmond, which in turn rented it to the Confederate government as its Executive Mansion.

===Davis family===
[[File:LC-B815-911 Rt side stereoview 1865 LOC.JPG|thumb|left|White House of the Confederacy, 1865, Library of Congress]] [[Jefferson Davis]], his wife [[Varina Howell|Varina]], and their children moved into the house in August 1861, and lived there for the remainder of the war. Davis suffered from recurring bouts with [[malaria]], facial [[neuralgia]], [[cataract]]s (in his left eye), unhealed wounds from the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] (bone spurs in his heel), and insomnia. Consequently, President Davis maintained an at-home office on the second floor of the White House. This was not an unusual practice at that time – the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, was not added until the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] administration. President Davis' personal secretary, Colonel [[Burton Harrison]], also lived in the house.

The Davis family was quite young during their stay at the White House of the Confederacy. When they moved in, the family consisted of the President and First Lady, six-year-old Margaret, four-year-old Jefferson Davis, Jr., and two-year-old Joseph. The two youngest Davis children, William and [[Winnie Davis|Varina Anne ("Winnie")]], were born in the White House, in 1861 and 1864, respectively. Among their neighborhood playmates was [[George S. Patton (attorney)|George Smith Patton, Sr.]], whose [[George S. Patton, Sr.|father]] commanded the [[22nd Virginia Infantry]], and whose [[George S. Patton|son]] commanded the [[U.S. Third Army]] in World War Two. Joseph Davis died in the spring of 1864, after a 15-foot fall from the railing on the White House's east portico. Mrs. Davis' mother and sister were occasional visitors to the Confederate executive mansion.

The house was abandoned during the evacuation of Richmond on April 2, 1865. Within twelve hours, soldiers from Major General [[Godfrey Weitzel]]'s XVIII Corps seized the former Confederate White House, intact. President [[Abraham Lincoln]], who was in nearby City Point (now [[Hopewell, Virginia]]), traveled up the James River to tour the captured city, and visited Davis' former residence for about three hours – although the President only toured the first floor, feeling it would be improper to visit the more private second floor of another man's home. Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] accompanied Lincoln during the visit to the former Confederate executive mansion. They held a number of meetings with local officials in the White House. Among them was Confederate Brigadier General [[Joseph Reid Anderson]], who owned the [[Tredegar Iron Works]].

===After the war===
During [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the White House of the Confederacy served as the headquarters for Military District Number One (Virginia), and was occasionally used as the residence of the commanding officer of the Department of Virginia.  Among those who served there were Major Generals [[Edward O.C. Ord]], [[Alfred Terry]], [[Henry Halleck]], and [[Edward R.S. Canby]].  When Reconstruction ended in Virginia, (October 1870), the City of Richmond retook possession of the house, and subsequently used it as Richmond Central School, one of the first public schools in postwar Richmond.

When the City announced its plans to demolish the building to make way for a more modern school building in 1890, the [[Confederate Memorial Literary Society]] was formed with the sole purpose of saving the White House from destruction.

==Biography==
[[File:William A Clark buying newspaper.jpg|thumb|left|Clark buying a newspaper, c. 1906]]
Clark was born in [[Connellsville]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He moved with his family to [[Iowa]] in 1856 where he taught school and studied law at [[Iowa Wesleyan College]]. In 1862, he traveled west to become a miner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dedman|first1=Bill|title=Empty Mansions|date=2013|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-53453-8|page=22&lt;!--|pages=470--&gt;|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working in quartz mines in Colorado, during 1863 Clark made his way to new gold fields to find his fortune in the [[Montana]] [[gold rush]].

He settled in the capital of [[Montana Territory]], [[Bannack, Montana]], and began [[placer mining]]. Though his claim paid only moderately, Clark invested his earnings in becoming a trader, driving mules back and forth between [[Salt Lake City]] and the [[boomtown]]s of Montana to transport eggs and other basic supplies.

He soon changed careers again and became a banker in [[Deer Lodge, Montana]]. He repossessed mining properties when owners defaulted on their loans, placing him in the mining industry. He made a fortune with copper mining, small [[smelter]]s, electric power companies, newspapers, railroads (trolley lines around Butte and the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]] from [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] to [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]), and other businesses, becoming known as one of three "[[Copper Kings]]" of [[Butte, Montana]], along with [[Marcus Daly]] and [[F. Augustus Heinze]].

Between 1884 and 1888, Clark constructed a 34-room, Tiffany-decorated home on West Granite Street, incorporating the most modern inventions available, in [[Butte, Montana]]. This home is now the [[Copper King Mansion]] bed-and-breakfast, as well as a museum.&lt;ref name=copper3&gt;{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: The Copper Kings|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/copperkings.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Clark built Columbia Gardens for the children of Butte. It included flower gardens, a dance pavilion, amusement park, lake, and picnic areas.

He died on March 2, 1925, and is interred in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.

== Political career ==

Clark served as president of both [[Montana]] state constitutional conventions in 1884 and 1889.

Clark yearned to be a statesman and used his newspaper, the ''Butte Miner'', to push his political ambitions. At this time, Butte was one of the largest cities in the West. He became a hero in [[Helena, Montana]], by campaigning for its selection as the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] instead of [[Anaconda, Montana|Anaconda]]. This battle for the placement of the capital had subtle Irish vs. English, Catholic vs. Protestant, and non-Masonic vs. Masonic elements. Clark's long-standing dream of becoming a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] resulted in scandal in 1899 when it was revealed that he bribed members of the [[Montana State Legislature]] in return for their votes. At the time, U.S. Senators were chosen by their respective state legislatures. The corruption of his election contributed to the passage of the [[17th Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]]. The U.S. Senate refused to seat Clark because of the 1899 bribery scheme, but a later senate campaign was successful, and he served a single term from 1901 until 1907. In responding to criticism of his bribery of the Montana legislature, Clark is reported to have said, "I never bought a man who wasn't for sale."
Clark died at the age of 86 in [[William A. Clark House|his mansion]] at 962 [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]]. His estate at his death was estimated to be worth $300 million, (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|300000000|1925|r=-3}}}} in today's dollars){{Inflation-fn|US}}, making him one of the wealthiest Americans ever.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/huguette-clark-copper-heiress-and-recluse-dies-at-104/2011/05/24/AFxfXrAH_story.html Huguette Clark, copper heiress and recluse, dies at 104], ''The [[Washington Post]]'', Matt Schudel, May 24, 2011.

In a 1907 essay, [[Mark Twain]], who was a close friend of Clark's rival [[Henry H. Rogers]], an organizer of the [[Amalgamated Copper Mining Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dias |first1=Elias |title=Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers: An Odd Couple|date=1984|publisher=Millicent Library |location=Fairhaven, Massachusetts |lccn=84062878}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed Clark as the very embodiment of [[Gilded Age]] excess and corruption:

{{quote|He is as rotten a human being as can be found anywhere under the flag; he is a shame to the American nation, and no one has helped to send him to the Senate who did not know that his proper place was the penitentiary, with a ball and chain on his legs.

In early 1946 Anna commissioned the [[Paganini Quartet]], and acquired the four famous Stradivarius instruments once owned by [[Niccolo Paganini]] for their use.

William Clark donated 135 acres to the [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] in honor of his daughter, Louise Amelia Andrée, who died aged 16 of [[meningitis]] and had been very happy there. The Girl Scout camp in [[Briarcliff Manor]] was named [[Camp Andree Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagegirlscout.com/siteandree.html|title=Camp Andree Clark|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Andrews Clark Jr.===
{{main|William Andrews Clark Jr.}}
Clark's son, William Andrews Clark Jr., founder of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] in 1919, left his library of rare books and manuscripts to the regents of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Today, the [[William Andrews Clark Memorial Library]] specializes in English literature and history from 1641 to 1800, materials related to [[Oscar Wilde]] and his associates, and fine [[printing]].

===Huguette Marcelle Clark===
{{main|Huguette Clark}}
Huguette (pronounced: oo-GETT), born in [[Paris, France]] in June 1906, was known as a [[recluse|reclusive]] heiress and was the youngest child of Clark with his second wife, Anna Eugenia La Chapelle. She married once, but divorced less than a year later. She led a reclusive life thereafter, communicating very little with the public including her extended family. She lived in three magnificent apartments, with a total of 42 rooms, on New York's Fifth Avenue at 72nd Street, overlooking [[Central Park]]. In 1991, she moved out of her apartment in New York and for the remainder of her life, voluntarily lived in various New York City hospitals.

In February 2010, she became the subject of a series of reports on [[msnbc.com]] after it was reported that the caretakers of her three residences (including a $24 million estate in [[Connecticut]], a sprawling seaside estate in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and her Fifth Avenue apartments valued at $100 million) had not seen her in decades. These articles were the basis for the 2013 bestselling book [[Empty Mansions|''Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune.'']] by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]].

Her final residence was [[Beth Israel Medical Center]], where she died on the morning of May 24, 2011, age 104.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/07/2010-09-07_huguette_clarks_lawyer_fires_back_at_relatives_who_want_him_ousted.html|title=Huguette Clark's lawyer fires back at relatives who want him ousted|author=Fanelli, James|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|date=September 7, 2010|accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huguette's extraordinary collection of arts and antiquities were consigned to go on the auction block at Christie's in June 2014, over three years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2014/06/17/312204184/-eccentric-capable-lucid-heiress-belongings-head-to-auction "Eccentric Heiress's Untouched Treasures Head For The Auction Block"], [[National Public Radio]], Margot Adler, June 17, 2014. Retrieved June 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walter Clark===
Clark's nephew, Walter Miller Clark, son of James Ross and Miriam Augusta (Evans) Clark, along with Walter's wife, Virginia (McDowell) Clark, were passengers on the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. He was among the 1,514 who died on April 15, 1912 after the ship struck an iceberg at 2:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. She survived and arrived in New York City a widow. Some of Mr. Clark's personal items were retrieved during an expedition to the site of the sinking in 1994 in the debris field. They were identified by engraved initials. They included shaving soap, toiletry items, cuff links, and gambling chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news3lv.com/news/local/titanic-sank-105-years-ago-this-saturday-taking-a-piece-of-las-vegas-with-it|title=Titanic sank 105 years ago this Saturday, taking a piece of Las Vegas with it|first=Jeff|last=Gillan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter's wife, Virginia, was rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']].

==Legacy==
Clark's art collection was donated to the [[Corcoran Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. after his death, greatly enriching that museum's holdings of European as well as American art. The Clark donation also included the construction of a new wing for the Corcoran, known appropriately as the Clark Wing.

The city of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] was established as a maintenance stop for Clark's [[San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]]. He subdivided 110 acres into 1200 lots, some of which on the corner of Fremont Street in Las Vegas sold for as much as $1750. The Las Vegas area was organized as [[Clark County, Nevada]], in Clark's honor. Clark's involvement in the founding of Las Vegas is recounted in a decidedly negative light by [[Chris Romano]] in the "Las Vegas" episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[Drunk History]], with [[Rich Fulcher]] portraying Clark.

===Clarkdale, Arizona===
[[Clarkdale, Arizona]], named for Clark, was the site of smelting operations for Clark's mines in nearby [[Jerome, Arizona]]. The town includes the historic Clark Mansion, which sustained severe fire damage on June 25, 2010. Clarkdale is home to the Verde Canyon Railroad wilderness train ride which follows the historic route that Clark had constructed in 1911 and home to the Copper Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Hellen Palmer|title=Landscapes of Capital: Culture in an Industrial Western Company Town, Clarkdale, Arizona, 1914-1929|date=May 2008|publisher=Ph.D. dissertation|location=Northern Arizona University|pages=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=REjvaT1DYS4C|accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ye Htoon''', ({{lang-my|ရဲထွန်း}};  {{IPA-my|jɛ́ tʰʊ́ɴ|pron}}) also known as '''Roland Chan Htoon''' {{IPA-my|tɕʰáɴ tʰʊ́ɴ|}}, (1937 – 7 May 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=12a2e147a2aebd47&amp;mt=application/pdf&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Dd3d66f4b00%26view%3Datt%26th%3D12a2e147a2aebd47%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dattd%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbT7-eZ3AQHizsv7zYYccDldll_yoA&amp;pli=1 Roland Obituary]&lt;!--Document locked--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prominent [[Burma|Burmese]] lawyer, sometime-jailed [[political dissident]], and a successful entrepreneur, and one of the notables of the now-extinct [[Scouting and Guiding in Burma|Scouting movement in Burma]].

Ye Htoon was the eldest son of [[Chan Htoon]], former Attorney General and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and the architect of the first [[constitution of Burma]] in 1947, and Khin Khin Thein. He attended [[Basic Education High School No. 2 Dagon|Myoma National High School]], [[Ananda College|Ananda College, Colombo, Sri Lanka]] and [[The Thacher School|Thacher School, Ojai Valley, California]], is a 1961 graduate of [[Bucknell University]], and received a postgraduate [[Bachelor of Law]] degree from the [[Yangon University|Rangoon University]] in 1965. His wife [[Onma Maw]] is the daughter of statesman Dr. [[Ba Maw]], the first Prime Minister and the Head of State of Burma.

Then-Lieutenant Ye Htoon served as the last [[Director General]] of the [[Union of Burma Boy Scouts|Union of Burma Boy Scouts and Girl Guides]], and reported that the [[Tatmadaw|military government]] dissolved the Union of Burma Boy Scouts, on 1 March 1964.

Ye Htoon was under detention for the first time from 1962 to 1963 for alleged participation in the ''7 July Upheaval''. He was arrested again from November 1971 to July 1972 for his connection with Burmese expatriates and foreign firms, and action was taken against him the third time in January 1975 for participation in what has come to be known as the ''[[U Thant]] crisis'', student-led protests over the shabby treatment by the [[Ne Win]] government of the remains of U Thant which were crushed by the military government, when he was given a 10-year prison term. He was freed in July 1980 under the Government's Amnesty Order No. 2180. He was detained in June 1986, accused of involvement in illegal dollar transaction, but was freed two weeks later under a personal surety.&lt;ref name="72.14.253.104"&gt;[http://www.myanmar-information.net/bcp/doc/THE%20CONSPIRACY%20OF%20TREASONOUS%20MINIONS%20WITHIN%20THE%20MYANMAR%20AND%20TRAITOROUS%20COHORTS%20ABROAD.doc The Conspiracy of Treasonous Minions within the Myanmar and Traitorous Cohorts Abroad] from PDF via Google&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a pioneer in bringing digital switching [[telephone exchange]]s to Burma, and has amassed a vast experience with the [[Economy of Burma|country's economic system]]. A business consultant to many international companies, he is now Chairman of Maw Htoon and Partners Co., Ltd., Shambhala Tours Co., Ltd., Shambhala Financial Services and the Myanmar Thai Gypsum Co., Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salonefestival.com/aboutus.htm |title=About Shambhala Company Limited |publisher=Salonefestival.com |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a lengthy press conference&lt;ref name="72.14.253.104"/&gt; on 9 September 1989, [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] First Secretary [[Brigadier General]] [[Khin Nyunt]] stated, "Fifty-two persons including Ye Htoon, who were in charge of the ''underground youth organization'' and who were trying to cause unrest in the country, were interrogated, and consequently documentary and other evidence (was) seized... We received information that a person called Ye Htoon, resident at 5/A Po Sein Road, [[Bahann]] Township, had been in contact with an organization called 'Da Nya Ta' ([[Alliance for Democratic Solidarity, Union of Burma]]) led by [[Thanmani Bo Khin Maung]], and was aiding and abetting that group's work from [[Yangon]] since. Information was also received that he had formed the underground youth organization called FFB ([[National Freedom Fighters of Burma]]) and was striving to cause unrest in the country under his supervision; the [[National Intelligence Bureau]] called in and interrogated 52 persons including Ye Htoon beginning 31 July 1989."

Ye Htoon was picked up, had his teeth kicked out and was sentenced to 19 years hard-labor rigorous imprisonment, for participating in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 democratic uprising]]. The specific crime, according to the [[Tatmadaw|junta]], was that he had met [[Bertil Lintner]] and provided him with information. He is also accused of being a [[ghostwriter]] for ''Outrage'', a book authored by Lintner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2001/vol9.7/journal.html |title=Journalists Beware Vol 9.

Ye Htoon, as the leader of the [[Myanmar Mingala Foundation]], appears to be making preparations for the [[2010 Burmese elections]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burmadigest.info/2009/01/26/preparations-in-burma-for-2010-elections/ |title=Preparations in Burma for 2010 elections |publisher=Burmadigest.info |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
