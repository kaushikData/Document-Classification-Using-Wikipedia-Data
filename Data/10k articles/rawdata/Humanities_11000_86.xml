[[File:NASA High Flyers Alphabet Activity Book.pdf|thumb|Example of an activity book. ]]
An '''activity book''' is a type of [[book]], generally aimed at [[children]], which contains [[interactive]] content such as [[game]]s, [[puzzles]], [[quiz]]zes, pictures to colour and other elements which involve [[writing]] or [[drawing]] in the book itself. The book may, or may not, have a loose [[narrative]] or contain other non-interactive elements structured around the interactive elements. Activity books may be made for [[entertainment]], [[education]] or a mixture of both.

Specific types of activity books include [[colouring book]]s and [[puzzle book]]s. A book is normally referred to as an activity book if it combines a variety of interactive elements and does not fall neatly into one of these more specific categories.

== Examples ==
Activity books are typically centred around a particular theme. This may be a generic theme, e.g. dinosaurs, or based on a toy, television show, book, or game. 

For example, the [[Where's Wally?]] series of books (known as Where's Waldo? in the USA) by [[Martin Handford]] consists of both [[Puzzle book|puzzle books]], wherein the reader must search for characters hidden in pictures, and activity books such as ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book]]'', which include a wider range of games and activities as well as puzzles. In 2018, [[Nintendo]] announced its intention to publish activity books based on its trademarked characters and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-childrens-activity-books-random-house/|title=Who says print is dead? Nintendo turns its attention to kids’ activity books|date=2018-05-04|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other franchises for which a number of activity books are available include:

The '''African Studies Centre''' (Afrika-Studiecentrum) is an independent scientific institute in the Netherlands that undertakes social-science research on [[Africa]] with the aim of promoting a better understanding of historical, current and future social developments in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The present director is Jan-Bart Gewald.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/organization/people/jan-bart-gewald|title=Jan-Bart Gewald|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre, Leiden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is located in the Pieter de la Court Building of [[Leiden University]]’s Faculty of [[Social sciences|Social Sciences]].

==Research==
The main objectives of the African Studies Centre (ASC) are to promote and undertake [[Scientific method|scientific research]] on Sub-Saharan Africa in the social sciences and humanities, to function as the main focal point for [[African studies]] in the [[Netherlands]] and contribute to education and teaching in this field, and to promote the dissemination of knowledge and an understanding of African societies.

The research programme of the African Studies Centre for the period 2012-2016 is entitled ‘African Dynamism amidst Global Restructuring’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/ascls-research-programme-2012-2016|title=The ASCL’s Research Programme 2012-2016|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre Leiden|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will focus on four major fields of inquiry, with flexible and shifting emphasis by its members of staff and members of the ASC Community temporarily present at the ASC.
The four fields of enquiry are:
# African trajectories of improved well-being, and its impact on people and resources
# Mediating identities of Africans in Africa and beyond 
# Constellations of Governance in Africa: historical and contemporary studies
# Africa’s connections to the World: Africa negotiating an increasingly multi-polar world

==Library==
[[Image:ASCLeiden3.JPG|thumb|Library]]

The Centre’s library consists of some 90,000 books and about 2,000 journals (including electronic journals), government reports, brochures, [[List of newspapers in Africa|African newspapers]] and about 1,700 documentaries and feature films on video and DVD. The Centre has also developed a web service, ''Connecting-Africa'', with links to more than 58,000 online articles about Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/collection|title=Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre Leiden|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library also has a collection of archival material including archives of African government publications and a number of personal archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The Centre was founded on 12 August 1947 as the academic division of an Afrika Instituut, which initially also had an economic section, later spun off as the [[Netherlands-African Business Council]]. Over the years, many well-known Dutch Africanists have worked at the African Studies Centre, including the poet Vernie February, the activist Klaas de Jonge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/ASC-community/members/klaas-de-jonge|title=Klaas de Jonge|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre Leiden|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sociologist Robert Buijtenhuijs and the law professor and film director Emile van Rouveroy van Nieuwaal. Legal scholar [[Johan Frederik Holleman|Hans Holleman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/about-ascl|title=About the ASCL|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre Leiden|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/archives|title=Archives|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre, Leiden|publisher=|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; served as a director from 1963 to 1969. [[Barbara Harrell-Bond]] worked at the Centre in the 1970s. [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]], who later became prime minister of [[Ghana]], worked at the African Studies Centre between 1959 and 1962. Former director [[Steven Ellis (historian)|Stephen Ellis]] was [[editor in chief]] of ''[[Africa Confidential]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa-confidential.com/history-of-africa-confidential|title=History of Africa Confidential|last=|first=|date=|website=Africa Confidential|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/history-african-studies-centre-leiden-habari-no-1-2012|title=History of the African Studies Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre Leiden|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petrus Johannes Idenburg]], lector of African constitutional law at Leiden University, was one of the founders of the Centre.

The Centre was one of the founders of [[AEGIS (African Studies)|AEGIS]], a network of African Studies Centres in Europe that was set up in 1991 to build upon the resources and research potential available within Africanist institutions in Europe.

As of 1 January 2016, the African Studies Centre is a part of Leiden University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mareonline.nl/archive/2015/12/10/universiteit-lijft-afrika-studiecentrum-in|title=Universiteit lijft Afrika-Studiecentrum In|last=|first=|date=|website=Leidse Universitair Weekblad: Mare|publisher=|access-date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2017, Jan-Bart Gewald became the new director of the ASC replacing Ton Dietz who had been director since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/organization|title=Organization|last=|first=|date=|website=African Studies Centre, Leiden|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin''' ({{lang-rus|Алекса́ндр Ге́льевич Ду́гин}}; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian philosopher, [[political analyst]], and strategist known for his [[Fascism|fascist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;"Classification of Dugin as a fascist is justified, regardless of the fact that today the MGU professor frequently speaks not as a primitive ethnocentrist or biological racist. ( ... ) By «fascist» we understand the «generic» meaning of the concept, used in comparatory research of contemporary right-wing extremism by such well-known historians-comparativists as Alexandr Galkin (Moscow), Walter Laqueur (Washington), Stanley Payne (Madison), Wolfgang Wippermann (Berlin) or Roger Griffin (Oxford)", {{cite web | url=http://inosmi.ru/politic/20120622/193954633.html | title="Евразийские" проекты Путина и Дугина – сходства и различия |trans-title=Dugin's "Eurasian" projects − similarities and differences | publisher=Geopolitika (Lithuania) | date=22 June 2012 | accessdate=31 August 2015 | author=Андреас Умланд}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 1999 interview for a Polish "Fronda" Dugin explains: "In [[Russian Orthodox]] christianity a person is a part of the Church, part of the collective organism, just like a leg. So how can a person be responsible for himself? Can a leg be responsible for itself? Here is where the idea of state, total state originates from. Also because of this, Russians, since they are Orthodox, can be the true fascists, unlike artificial Italian fascists: of Gentile type or their Hegelians.

He is the author of more than 30 books, among them ''[[Foundations of Geopolitics]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Fourth Political Theory]]'' (2009).

==Early life and education==
Dugin was born in Moscow, into the family of a colonel-general in the [[GRU|Soviet military intelligence]] and [[Candidate of Science|candidate of law]] Geliy Alexandrovich Dugin and his wife Galina, a doctor and candidate of medicine.&lt;ref name=Literaturnaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |script-title=ru:Доктор Дугин |publisher=Литературная Россия |accessdate=18 March 2012 |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031837/http://www.litrossia.ru/2007/15/01412.html |archivedate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he entered the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]], but did not graduate due to his association with thinking contrary to the ongoing regime, which caused him to be expelled from the institute.

A self-taught polyglot, he read avidly in his fields of interest, from Middle Age and Renaissance European authors to Oriental Studies, translating into Russian from English, French, and German, and also the writings of Italian fascist [[Julius Evola]] and French author [[René Guénon]]. [[Traditionalist School|Religious Traditionalism]], Conservatism, [[Hermeticism]] and Poetry were topics followed closely by Dugin and a group of philosophers/thinkers also interested in Traditionalism: [[Geydar Dzhemal]], Evgeniy Golovin, Yuri Mamleev, Vladimir Stepanov, and Sergey Jigalkin.

He graduated in Economics and Management at [[Novocherkassk]] Meliorative State Academy in the [[Rostov Oblast]] in 1999, defending his post-graduate degree in Philosophy at [[Rostov-on-Don]] with the dissertation "The Evolution of Paradigmatic Foundations of Science" in 2000, and the PhD in the Faculty of Sociology at the same University in 2004 with the theme "The Transformation of the Political Structures and Institutions in the Process of Modernization of the Civil Society". In 1998, Dugin, Geydar Dzhemal, and Evgeniy Golovin created a study center based on their long time shared interests called the New University project.

In 1988 he and his friend [[Geydar Dzhemal]] joined the nationalist group [[Pamyat]]. He helped to write the political program for the newly refounded [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] under the leadership of [[Gennady Zyuganov]].&lt;ref name=Dunlop /&gt;

In his 1997 article "Fascism – Borderless and Red", Dugin proclaimed the arrival of a "genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism" in Russia. He believes that it was "by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of [[National Socialism]] that determined the nature of its ideology. The excesses of this ideology in Germany are a matter exclusively of the Germans ... while Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes."&lt;ref name="Andreas"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Andreas Umland]] |title=Will United Russia become a fascist party? |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=will-united-russia-become-a-fascist-party-2008-04-15 |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Waffen-SS]] and especially the scientific sector of this organization, [[Ahnenerbe]]," was "an intellectual oasis in the framework of the National Socialist regime", according to him."&lt;ref name="Andreas" /&gt;

Dugin soon began publishing his own journal entitled ''Elementy'', which initially began by praising Franco-Belgian [[Jean-François Thiriart]], supporter of a Europe "from Dublin to Vladivostok". Consistently glorifying both [[Tsar]]ist and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] Russia, ''Elementy'' also revealed Dugin's admiration for [[Julius Evola]].  Dugin also collaborated with the weekly journal ''Den'' (The Day), a bastion of [[Rootless cosmopolitan|Russian anti-Cosmopolitanism]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} previously directed by [[Alexander Prokhanov]].&lt;ref name="Dunlop" /&gt;

Dugin was amongst the earliest members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]] (NBP) and convinced [[Eduard Limonov]] to enter the political arena in 1994. A part of hard-line nationalist NBP members, supported by Dugin, split off to form the more right-wing, anti-liberal, anti-left, anti-[[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]]{{clarify|date=April 2016}} aggressive nationalist organization, [[National Bolshevik Front]]. After breaking with Limonov, he became close to [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and later to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Mankoff |title=Russian Foreign Policy: The Return of Great Power Politics |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |pages=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugin claims to be disapproving of [[liberalism]] and the West, particularly [[American hegemony]].&lt;ref name="BBC 2014"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин хочет с помощью Путина прояснить свой статус в МГУ|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/russia/2014/06/140630_dugin_msu_university_dismissal|publisher=[[BBC Russian Service]]|date=30 June 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assertions show that he likes [[Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]]: "We are on the side of Stalin and the Soviet Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Иван Зуев|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: Уроки религии – это великая победа над русофобами|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16845|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls himself a conservative and says, "We, conservatives, want a strong, solid State, want order and healthy family, positive values, the reinforcing of the importance of religion and the Church in society". He adds, "We want patriotic radio, TV, patriotic experts, patriotic clubs. We want the media that expresses national interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дугин|script-title=ru:Мы должны забрать у либералов как минимум половину медийного поля!|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/16946/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the Eurasia Movement===
The [[Eurasia Party]], later [[Eurasia Movement]], was officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice on 31 May 2001.&lt;ref name="Dunlop"/&gt; The Eurasia Party claims support by some military circles and by leaders of the Orthodox Christian faith in Russia, and the party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] problem, with the objective of setting the stage for Dugin's dream of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran. Dugin's ideas, particularly those on "a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] alliance in the Eurasian sphere" have recently become popular among certain nationalistic circles in Turkey, most notably among alleged members of the [[Ergenekon network]], which is the subject of a high-profile trial (on charges of conspiracy).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Dugin's Eurasianist ideology has also been linked to his adherence to the doctrines of the [[Traditionalist School]]. (Dugin's Traditionalist beliefs are the subject of a book length study by J. Heiser, ''The American Empire Should Be Destroyed—Aleksandr Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology.''&lt;ref name="Heiser"&gt;{{cite book|author=James D. Heiser|title=The American Empire Should Be Destroyed: Alexander Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology|publisher=Repristination Press|isbn=1891469436}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Dugin also advocates for a Russo-Arab alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Megah Stack |date=4 September 2008 |title=Russian nationalist advocates Eurasian alliance against the U.S. |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fgw-dugin4-2008sep04-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location= California |access-date=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This common civilizational impulse will be the basis of a political and strategic union.|author=''[[The Basics of Geopolitics]]'' (1997)}}

The reborn Russia, according to Dugin's concept, is said by Charles Clover of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to be a slightly remade version of the Soviet Union with echoes of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], where [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] was one of three continent-sized super states including [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] and [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] as the other two and was participating in endless war between them.&lt;ref name="Clover"/&gt;

In the Eurasian public discourse sphere, the totalitarian communist policy deployed in over three decades of works by various international groups that are part of the movement, is "a version of reintegration of the post-Soviet space into a "Eurasian" sphere of influence for Russia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=RAND |date=2017 |title=Russian Views of the International Order |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1826.html |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North-American program "works with a wide range of partners from all sectors of civil society" and "is advanced through grant making, advocacy and research, regional initiatives, and close engagement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=OSF |title=Eurasia Program |url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/eurasia-program |access-date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has criticized the "Euro-Atlantic" involvement in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] as a scheme to create a "[[cordon sanitaire]]" around Russia, much like the [[Border states (Eastern Europe)|French and British attempt]] post-[[World War I]].

In 2005, Dugin founded the [[Eurasian Youth Union]] of Russia as the youth wing of the International Eurasia Movement.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Dugin: The Crazy Ideologue of the New Russian Empire|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/02/alexander-dugin-the-crazy-ideologue-of-the-new-russian-empire.html|work=The Daily Beast|date=4 February 2014}} In Russian: {{cite web|author1=Арсентий Тропаревский|script-title=ru:Дугин: Сумасшедший гений новой Российской империи|url=http://theinternettimes.ru/post/dugin_geniy|work=The Internet Times|language=Russian}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[2008 South Ossetia war|war broke out]] between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Dugin visited South Ossetia and predicted, "Our troops will occupy the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the entire country, and perhaps even Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which is historically part of Russia, anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Road to War in Georgia: The Chronicle of a Caucasian Tragedy|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/road-to-war-in-georgia-the-chronicle-of-a-caucasian-tragedy-a-574812.html|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he said Russia should "not stop at liberating South Ossetia but should move further," and "we have to do something similar in Ukraine."&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Dugin|url=http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/personalno/532383-echo/|title=Interview|publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]]|date=8 August 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dugin stated that Russia should repeat the Georgian scenario in Ukraine, namely attack it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ірина Біла|script-title=uk:Можливість застосування Ющенком силового сценарію; махінації навколо землі.

===Russian Orthodoxy and Rodnovery===

Dugin was [[baptism|baptized]] at the age of six in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church of [[Michurinsk]] by his great-grandmother Elena Mikhailovna Kargaltseva. Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the [[Old Believers]], a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652–1666 [[Old Believers#Reforms of Patriarch Nikon|reforms]] of the official [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}} Dugin's Eurasian philosophy owes much to [[Traditionalist School|Traditional Integralism]] and ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' movements, and as such it resonates with [[Neopaganism]],{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|pp=11–14}} a category which in this context means the movement of [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of [[Anastasianism]] and [[Ynglism]]. Dugin's Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marat Shterin]] (2016). "[https://g2w.eu/zeitschrift/leseprobe/1250-attraktivitaet-und-dilemma-neue-religioese-bewegungen-in-russland Attraktivität und Dilemma: Neue religiöse Bewegungen in Russland]". ''RGOW'', 2. Institut G2W – Ökumenisches Forum für Glauben, Religion und Gesellschaft in Ost und West. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as also having influences from [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Eastern religions|Eastern]] traditions.{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=15}} He himself calls to rely upon "Eastern theology and mystical currents" for the development of the [[The Fourth Political Theory|Fourth Political Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Dugin. ''The Fourth Political Theory''. Arktos, 2012. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marlene Laruelle]], his adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him — in the wake of [[René Guénon]] —, Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an [[esotericism|esoteric]] and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with Neopaganism and may host "Neopaganism's nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions".{{sfnp|Laruelle|2006|p=11}}

===Esotericism, fascism, and integrative geopolitics===

In the early 1990s Dugin's work at the [[National Bolshevik Front]] included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|supporting esoteric groups]] in the first half of the 20th century. Partnering [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref&gt;The Ordo Templi Orientis Phenomenon.

===Stance on Ukraine and role in Russian politics===

Aleksandr Dugin supports Putin and his foreign policies but has opposed Russian governments due to their economic policies. His 2007 quote, "There are no more opponents of Putin's course and, if there are, they are mentally ill and need to be sent off for clinical examination.

Dugin stated he was disappointed in [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]], saying that Putin did not aid the pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine after the [[Ukrainian Army]]'s [[2014 insurgency in Donbass#Post-ceasefire government offensive|early July 2014 offensive]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU/&gt; In August 2014, Dugin called for a "genocide" of Ukrainians.&lt;ref name=FT150128&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a87747de-a713-11e4-b6bd-00144feab7de.html |title= Alarm bells ring over Syriza's Russian links |first= Sam |last= Jones |first2= Kerin |last2= Hope |first3= Courtney |last3= Weaver |work= [[Financial Times]] |date= 28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halya Coynash of the [[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]] said that the influence of Dugin's "Eurasian ideology" on events in eastern Ukraine and on Russia's invasion of the Crimea was beyond any doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Halya Coynash|title=Intrigue over 'dismissal' of Putin's ideologue, Alexander Dugin|url=http://khpg.org.ua/en/index.php?id=1404029911|publisher=[[Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group]]|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vincent Jauvert, Dugin's radical ideology today became the basis for the internal and foreign policy of the Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vincent Jauvert|title=Le Raspoutine de Poutine|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/ukraine-la-revolte/20140503.OBS6009/le-raspoutine-de-poutine.html|work=[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]|date=3 May 2014|language=French}} In Russian: {{cite web|author=Венсан Жовер|script-title=ru:Дугин — путинский Распутин|url=http://inosmi.ru/russia/20140512/220188170.html|publisher=[[inoSMI]]|language=Russian|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Dugin is worth listening to, in order to understand to which fate the Kremlin is leading its country and the whole of Europe.&lt;ref name="Jauvert"/&gt; However, according to [[Alexander Nevzorov]], if we had had [[Sergey Kurginyan|Kurginyan]] and Dugin instead of Putin, there would have been hell for all of us to pay, they would have unleashed a European and World War without a shadow of a doubt, without considering consequences at all.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; But Dugin and Kurginyan do not have the slightest impact on what is going on in the Kremlin and do not even get coaching there.&lt;ref name="Быков"/&gt; In another publication, Nevzorov said, "Beliefs are only proven by being under bullets, another prescription does not exist. I do not understand why [[Vitaly Milonov|Milonov]] and Dugin are not there yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Невзоров: Я не понимаю, почему Милонов и Дугин до сих пор не под пулями|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/piter/2014/06/16/1280845.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2014, Dugin said, "Only after restoring the Greater Russia that is the [[Eurasian Union]], we can become a credible global player. Now these processes slowed down very much. The [[Euromaidan|Ukrainian maidan]] was the response of the West to the advance of the Russian integration."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; He described the [[Euromaidan]] as a coup d'état carried out not by the Ukrainians but by the United States: "America wishes to wage the war against Russia not by its own hands but by the hands of the Ukrainians. Promising to wink at up to 10 thousand victims among the peaceful population of Ukraine and actually demanding the victims, the United States led to this war. The United States carried out the coup d'état during the maidan for the purpose of this war. The United States raised [[neo-Nazis]] [[Russophobes]] to the power for the purpose of this war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Руслан Горевой|script-title=ru:На пороге войны|url=http://versia.ru/articles/2014/jun/30/na_poroge_voyny|work=Газета "Версия"|issue=24|date=30 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin said Russia is the major driving force for the current events in Ukraine, "Russia insists on its sovereignty, its liberty, responds to challenges thrown down to it, for example, in Ukraine. Russia is attempting to integrate the post-Soviet space ..."&lt;ref name="Медведева"/&gt; As Israeli political scientist Vyacheslav Likhachov states, "If one seriously takes the fact that such a person as Alexander Dugin is the ideologist of the imperial dash for the West, then one can establish that Russia is not going to stop as far as the Atlantic Ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Юрій Савицький|script-title=uk:Путін є найбільшим радикалом Росії – ізраїльський експерт|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/26599384.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Ukrainian|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 article by [[Dmitry Bykov]] "Why TV, Alexander Dugin and Galina Pyshnyak crucified a boy", [[Channel One Russia]]'s use of the aired story by Dugin and Pyshnyak about the allegedly crucified boy as a pretext for escalating the conflict was compared to the case of [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Дмитрий Быков|script-title=ru:Зачем ТВ, Александр Дугин и Галина Пышняк распяли мальчика|url=http://sobesednik.ru/dmitriy-bykov/20140715-dmitriy-bykov-zachem-tv-aleksandr-dugin-i-galina-pyshnyak-ra|publisher=Sobesednik.ru|language=Russian|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2014, Dugin on his Facebook account wrote a story that a 6 year old child was allegedly nailed down to an advertisement board and shot to death before his father's eyes.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"&gt;{{cite news|author=Мария Епифанова|script-title=ru:И это — не предел?|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/64440.html|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|issue=77|date=16 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2014, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' provided a videotape of its correspondent Eugen Feldman walking along the main square in [[Sloviansk]], asking local old women if they had heard of the murder of the child. They said such an event did not take place.&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt; The website [[Change.org]] hosted a petition of citizens who demanded "a comprehensive investigation with identification for all persons involved in the fabrication of the plot."&lt;ref name="Епифанова"/&gt;

On 2 October 2014, Dugin described the situation in Donbass: "The [[humanitarian crisis]] has long since been raging on the territory of [[Federal State of Novorossiya|Novorossiya]]. Already up to a million, if not more, refugees are in the Russian Federation. A large part of the inhabitants of the [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] and the [[Lugansk People's Republic|LPR]] simply moved abroad."&lt;ref name="заговор"/&gt; In the end of October 2014, Dugin advised the separatists to establish dictatorship in Novorossiya until they win in the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Новости "Новороссии": для достижения победы Дугин рекомендует террористам диктатуру|url=http://joinfo.ua/politic/1041112_Novosti-Novorossii-dostizheniya-pobedi-Dugin.html|publisher=Joinfo.ua|language=Russian|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric about the fifth column===
The typical rhetoric about the [[fifth column]] as [[foreign agent]]s is used by Dugin for political accusations in many publications. In his 2014 interview published by ''[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]'' and ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', he says, "A huge struggle is being conducted. And, of course, Europe has its own fifth column, its own [[2011–13 Russian protests|Bolotnaya Square]]-minded people. And if we have them sitting idly and doing nasty things on [[Dozhd]], Europe is indeed dominated and ruled by the fifth column in full swing. This is the same American riffraff ..."&lt;ref name="великая война"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Петр Акопов|script-title=ru:Это великая война континентов|url=http://www.vz.ru/politics/2014/2/20/672632.html|work=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]|date=20 February 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KP"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Политолог, философ Александр Дугин: Это великая война континентов|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/26197.4/3084361/|work=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|date=20 February 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees the United States standing behind all the scenes, including the Russian fifth column, according to his statement, "The danger of our fifth column is not that they are strong, they are absolutely paltry, but that they are hired by the greatest 'godfather' of the modern world—by the United States. That is why they are effective, they work, they are listened to, they get away with anything because they have the world power standing behind them."&lt;ref name="великая война"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KP"/&gt; He sees the American embassy as the center for funding and guiding the fifth column and asserts, "We know that the fifth column receives money and instructions from the American embassy."&lt;ref name="заговор"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Против Путина готовится заговор, мы наблюдаем либеральный ответ Русской весне|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/19518/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|date=2 October 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dugin, the fifth column promoted the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] as a land continental construction, seized power under [[Boris Yeltsin]], and headed Russia as the ruling politico-economic and cultural elite until the 2000s; the fifth column is the regime of liberal reformers of the 1990s and includes former [[Russian oligarchs]] [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], former government officials [[Mikhail Kasyanov]], [[Boris Nemtsov]], [[Vladimir Ryzhkov]], artistic, cultural, and media workers,&lt;ref name="Шестая"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:Шестая колонна|url=http://vz.ru/opinions/2014/4/29/684247.html|work=[[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]]|date=29 April 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Echo of Moscow]], the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]], the highest ranks of the [[National Research University Higher School of Economics]], a significant part of teachers of the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]], and a minority part of teachers of the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author1=Александр Дугин|title=Пятая колонна и либеральная идеология: аномалия вседозволенности |trans-title=The fifth column and liberal ideology: an anomaly of permissiveness|url=http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|publisher=Eurasiainform.md|language=Russian|date=24 March 2014|access-date=4 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729212858/http://eurasiainform.md/pyataya-kolonna-i-liberalnaya-ideologiya-anomaliya-vsedozvolennosti-aleksandr-dugin.html|archive-date=29 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugin proposes to deprive the fifth column of Russian citizenship and deport the group from Russia: "I believe it is necessary to deport the fifth column and deprive them of their citizenship."&lt;ref name="Макаревич"&gt;{{cite web|author=Елена Янкелевич|script-title=ru:Андрей Макаревич: "пятая колонна" или жертва травли?|url=http://riafan.ru/56800-andrey-makarevich-pyataya-kolonna-ili-zhertva-travli/|publisher=Riafan.ru|language=Russian|date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, Dugin argued, "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Максим Соколов|script-title=ru:Путин абсолютен|trans-title=Putin is absolute|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/329407|work=[[Izvestia]]|date=5 October 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Григорий Пасько|script-title=ru:Шизофрения, или Будьте здоровы!|trans-title=Schizophrenia, or To your health!|journal=[[Index on Censorship]]|year=2007|issue=27|url=http://index.org.ru/journal/27/pask27.html|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Dugin in an interview to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' confirmed that he considers the opponents of Putin to be mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Neef"/&gt;

In one of his publications, Dugin introduced the term ''the sixth column'' and defined it as "the fifth column which just pretends to be something different",&lt;ref name="Шестая"/&gt; those who are in favor of Putin, but demand that he stand for liberal values (as opposed to the liberal fifth column, which is specifically against Putin). During the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]], Dugin said that all the Russian sixth column stood up staunchly for Ukrainian oligarch [[Rinat Akhmetov]].&lt;ref name="За Ахметова"&gt;{{cite web|author=Александр Дугин|script-title=ru:За Ахметова грудью встала российская шестая колонна|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/news/2014/5/21/22353563/|publisher=Nakanune.ru|language=Russian|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he asserts, "We need to struggle against the fifth and sixth columns."&lt;ref name="Медведева"&gt;{{cite web|author=Татьяна Медведева|script-title=ru:Александр Дугин: "Нужно бороться с "шестой колонной"|url=http://portal-kultura.ru/articles/person/64670-aleksandr-dugin-nuzhno-borotsya-s-shestoy-kolonnoy/|work=Газета "Культура"|issue=35|language=Russian|date=10–16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-American artist [[Mihail Chemiakin]] says Dugin is inventing "the sixth column". "Soon, probably, there would already be the seventh one as well. "The fifth column" is understandable. That is we, intelligentsia, lousy, dirty, who read [[Albert Camus|Camus]]. And "the sixth column", in his opinion, is more dangerous, because that is the personal entourage of Vladimir Putin. But he is naive and understands nothing. And as for Dugin, he can tell him who to shoot to death and who to imprison. Maybe, [[Alexey Kudrin|Kudrin]] and maybe, [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Виктор Резунков|script-title=ru:Попахивает фашизмом|url=http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/26646237.html|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|language=Russian|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

According to Dugin, the whole Internet should be banned: "I think that Internet as such, as a phenomenon is worth prohibiting because it gives nobody anything good."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|74QT-Wcgjbs|God is against Internet (Dugin's speech in Russian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Dugin said in a lecture that chemistry and physics are demonic sciences, and that all Orthodox Russians need to unite around the President of the Russian Federation in the last battle between good and evil, following the example of Iran and North Korea.&lt;ref name="Гольянов"&gt;{{cite web|author=Владислав Гольянов|script-title=ru:Владимир Путин как спаситель от "сатанинского" Запада|url=http://www.baltinfo.ru/2012/06/13/Vladimir-Puti-kak-spasitel-ot-sataninskogo-Zapada-284483|publisher=Baltinfo.ru|language=Russian|date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "If we want to liberate ourselves from the West, it is needed to liberate ourselves from textbooks on physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name="Гольянов"/&gt;

Dugin has characterized his position on the Ukrainian conflict as "firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians" as well as unacceptance of liberalism and American hegemony.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;

During the conflict in Ukraine, Dugin also lost his post as Head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations of [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name=DOUPOU&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ben Hoyle|title=Putin accused of betraying and abandoning Ukraine separatists|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/putin-accused-of-betraying-and-abandoning-ukraine-separatists/story-fnb64oi6-1226976223365|work=[[The Australian]]|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebel leaders in Ukraine feel 'abandoned' by Putin|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/rebel-leaders-in-ukraine-feel-abandoned-by-putin/story-fnb64oi6-1226976988427|work=[[The Australian]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Sonne|title=Russian Nationalists Feel Let Down by Kremlin|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-nationalists-feel-let-down-by-kremlin-again-1404510139|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Catherine A|title=Russia This Week: Dugin Dismissed from Moscow State University?

==Legal cases against Dugin==
At the end of October 2014, [[Sergey Kurginyan]], the leader of all-Russian movement [[Essence of Time (movement)|Essence of Time]], sued Dugin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Дугин: Кургинян подал на меня в суд, а я бы вызвал его на дуэль|url=http://www.rosbalt.ru/moscow/2014/10/28/1332014.html|publisher=Rosbalt.ru|language=Russian|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Dugin called Kurginyan a traitor and accused him of destroying [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] deputy foreign minister Proselkov in the following words: "Possessed supporters of traitor Kurginyan, who as now it turns out is working for [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]], [[Yukos]] and Israel, declared Sasha Proselkov "main enemy" after he along with Gubarev did not allow denigrating Russian hero [[Igor Girkin|Igor Strelkov]] with impunity."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1156">The '''Canadian Institute of Geomatics''' (French: ''Association Canadienne des Sciences Géomatiques''), also known as the CIG by most in the geospatial community, is a not-for-profit scientific association based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] devoted to the development of [[geomatics]] in Canada. It was previously known as Canadian Institute of Surveying and Mapping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cig-acsg.ca/history]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1882, the Canadian Institute of Geomatics evolved into be a non-profit scientific and technical association that represents the largest and most influential geospatial community in Canada. The Canadian Institute of Geomatics are one of the founding members of [[Canadian GeoAlliance]], an umbrella organization started to help address sector-wide strategic priorities in the [[geomatics]] sector.

The site contains a number of settlements and was reserved for the elite of that area during that time.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Cerro de las Minas is the only lowland Mixtec archeological site open to the public.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

==Background==
This site was systematically explored by Dr. John Paddock in the 1960s. He defined the Ñuiñe culture; further extensive works were carried out by Dr. Marcus Winter in 1987.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maldonado A. |first=Benjamín |date= |title=Cerro de las Minas, INAH Web Page |trans-title=|journal=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico, D.F. |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01704.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230152330/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za01704.html |archivedate=2009-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site History==
2500 Years ago, there were many Mixtec communities (Mixteca Alta y Baja) inhabited by mixtec peoples called Ñuu Yata Yata (ancient people). These groups lived in Cerro de las Minas, Diquiyú and Tequixtepec (Mixteca Baja); Huamelulpan, Monte Negro, Yucuita and other (Mixteca Alta). The culture developed for 600 years, up to 250-350 CE, probably due to Teotihuacan influence would later transform into the Ñuiñe culture. Was an important Ñuiñe culture center, founded in the late Preclassic period, its apogee occurred during the early classic period, between 400 and 800 CE, during this period flourished other major cities such as Monte Alban and Teotihuacan, the latter in the Highland Valley Mexico.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The area fell on the trade routes between the Valley of Mexico and the central valleys of Oaxaca, the Valley of [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] and other areas of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. Commerce through here dealt in [[obsidian]], ceramics, textiles, metals, salt, wood, charcoal, plants, fruit, and [[copal]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;

The development of this site from a village to a city is divided into two phases:

=== Ñudee Phase===
The first is called Ñudee (the Mixtec name for Huajuapan, meaning “place of the brave”) and covers the period from 400 BCE to 250 CE.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; The site was founded in the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] by people who originated from the Santa Teresa site, two km to the south.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

=== Ñuiñe Phase===
The second phase is called Ñuiñe and covers the site as a city-state from between 250 CE to about 800 CE. In both these phases, cultural influences from other Mixtec and Mesoamerican areas can be seen.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; It was the economic, political and cultural center of an area with a radius of about 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;km . Population peak of the site itself was between 1,000 and 2,000 people.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

Its apogee was reached in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] with the development of the Ñuiñe culture among the lowland Mixtec in general, which had its own architecture, writing, ceramics, figurines and urns.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

Starting from 800 CE, the city went into decline, possibly due to being subjugated from a neighboring dominion. The area would not grow again until after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]], with the founding of the Spanish city of Huajuapan in the valley area below, next to the river. This settlement was established in 1525.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;

Cerro de las Minas has characteristics similar to cities in the Mixteca Alta. Characterized by a construction of buildings around several squares, the rest of the population distributed around these plazas. (Mixtec urban design differentiation from other cities in which the buildings were organized around a single, large square). The construction areas were modified with terraces, called coo  yuu (Mixtec name for terraces). It can be translated as “clay Dyke”, for this reason it was necessary to build stairs around the town. Cerro de las Minas was decorated with reliefs of inscriptions, using (a not very well known) writing system, called ñuiñe. The writing system is very similar to Monte Alban (Zapotec) inscriptions, which suggests a strong relationship between the valleys and the Mixteca Baja during the classical period.

==Site Description ==
Most of the site covers about fifty hectares on the top and down the sides of the large hill&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; although in 2007, [[INAH]] found a pre-Hispanic tomb at the foot of the Cerro de la Minas.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt; The hill was chosen as it was defensible.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt; The center of the site is dominated by three mounds that measure about eight meters high and forty meters in diameters.  These form a line through the center of the sites and have large platforms built among them, extending for a total of about 180 meters. In addition, there is a [[Mesoamerican ball court]] that measures sixty meters long and fifteen meters wide.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; The sides of the hill have been terraced to create more flat spaces for a market, the palace and some residential areas.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

The residential areas generally contain foundations of stone, with walls of stone or adobe.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Later homes built here  have thinner walls made with [[flagstone]] filling in the gaps from the larger stones.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;  Residential buildings situated in dominant positions have gravesites. This seems to be related to more modern Mixtec burial traditions, especially for those in high or preferred positions in society.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt;

The palace is divided into rooms, a central patio and a large tomb, Number 5.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt; This tomb contains three major burials, probably related to the ruling family. A total of nine tombs were discovered, some had been robbed but in other were found human remains, vessels and gravestones with the names of the deceased. In addition to these, more than 100 ordinary graves were found.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt;

==Findings==
Major investigation and excavation of the site was carried out in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a team of 200 people headed by Marcus Winter.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt;  Much of what little is known of this Mixtec region comes from finds at this site, especially finds related to the Mixtec glyph writing system.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;  Most of the finds were contained in Tomb 5, located south of the main plaza in the palace complex. This tomb contained a large quantity of Mixtec ceramics as well as a multicolored [[urn]] with a representation of the god of wind or fire, with a [[brazier]] on its head, seated on a platform decorated with four glyphs. This piece is now on display at the Museum of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Most of the Ñuiñe writing has been found in this tomb, on gravestones. This kind of Ñuiñe writing contains a central glyph, usually the name of the deceased accompanied by dates. Two gravestones of this type were found in Tomb 5 and were probably of the governors of the city.  It is the same writing system that was found in [[San Pedro y San Pablo Tequixtepec]] about 25&amp;nbsp;km to the north of the site, in the form of inscriptions under painted battle scenes were found.&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt; Tomb three was found to have been already sacked, but it still contained fragments of an urn and a carved stone.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt;

Cultural elements found here show contact and influence from other Mixtec settlements such as [[Diquiyú]], [[Monte Negro, Oaxaca|Monte Negro]], [[San Martín Huamelulpan|Huamelulpan]], [[Yucuita]] and [[Yucuñudahui]].&lt;ref name="Winter"/&gt; Despite six years of excavation, the site is still not completely explored; however, funds have not been secured to continue work at the site.&lt;ref name="Ecuador"/&gt;

==Structures==

===Structure H1A===
Covers the width of the Hill Summit; There was a structure, probably a temple. Access was via a wide staircase.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Mound 1===
Yet to be explored, has a stariway that probably lead to a temple over (on top) the mound.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Mound 2===
It is a large platform with vertical walls and flat surface. Probably had residences at the northeast side, has not been determined what buildings were constructed on the platform.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Main Plaza===
Located between mounds 1 &amp; 2, Tomb 5 Patio is located here, surrounded on three sides by residential structures, there are basement remains of rooms and patios.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

=== Tomb 5===
Contained remains of several people, more than 70 vessels and a beautiful ñuiñe URN. Late walls of the Tomb patio show construction techniques (block – stone slab), and of slope-panel. In the patio is another housing area, designated area C.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Ballgame Court ===
Beside 2 mound, remains of a structure were found, possibly a Ballgame Court (I Shaped). The evidence is unclear, only some indications are preserved and houses were built over these (Ñuiñe late phase); the elongated shape and two small engraved stones suggest its use as a court, before construction of the Houses.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Mound 3===
Yet to be explored, the space between mounds 2 and 3, without residential houses, as the Tomb 5 patio, it is believed to have been a [[Tianguis]] (market).&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

=== Huajuapan Community Museum ===
Pieces found on site are exhibited in this Museum, others in the Oaxaca Cultures Museum and the [[Mitla]] Frissell Museum&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995''' was the fourteenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Meeting]] of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  It was held in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], between 10 November 1995 and 13 November 1995, and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Jim Bolger]].

The [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]] was agreed and announced at the CHOGM. The programme sets out the basic political membership criteria of the Commonwealth and introduces compulsory adherence to the [[Harare Declaration|Harare principles]], providing incentives for members to adhere to democratic principles, good governance and the rule of law with bilateral and multilateral penalties for intransigent members up to and including expulsion from the Commonwealth. The [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] was established to monitor and enforce adherence to the agreement.

[[File:Innozenz VI.gif|thumb|right|[[Pope Innocent VI]], the first Pope to agree to a capitulation, and the first to disregard one]]
A '''conclave capitulation''' was a compact or unilateral contract drawn up by the [[College of Cardinals]] during a [[papal conclave]] to constrain the actions of the [[pope]] elected by the conclave. The legal term ''[[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulation]]'' more frequently refers to the commitment of a sovereign state to relinquish jurisdiction within its borders over the subjects of a foreign state. Before balloting began, all cardinals present at the conclave would swear to be bound by its provisions if elected pope.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitulations were used by the [[College of Cardinals]] to assert its collective authority and limit [[papal supremacy]], to "make the Church an [[oligarchy]] instead of a [[monarchy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyke, 1897, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar [[electoral capitulation]]s were used on occasion from the 14th to the 17th centuries in Northern and Central Europe to constrain an elected king, emperor, prince, or bishop.

The College had made informal attempts to influence the actions of Popes before drafting formal capitulations.&lt;ref name="b68"/&gt; The first capitulation was drafted in the conclave of 1352, which elected [[Pope Innocent VI]],&lt;ref name="jugie"&gt;Jugie, Pierre. Levillain, ed. 2002. "Cardinal." pp. 241-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catholic"/&gt; and most conclaves for the next 300 years produced similar documents.&lt;ref name="baum5253"&gt;Baumgartner, 2003, pp. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1353, Innocent VI declared these first Capitulations invalid with his [[Apostolic Constitution]], ''[[Sollicitudo]]'', citing a Constitution of [[Pope Gregory X]], ''[[Contingit]]'',&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Episcopal and Pontifical Capitulations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited papal conclaves from dealing with issues other than the election of a Pope. This papal response would be repeated for most future Capitulations, which were generally disregarded.&lt;ref name="baum5253"/&gt; For this reason, papal historian Frederic Baumgartner calls capitulations "an exercise in futility."&lt;ref name="b95"/&gt; Another papal historian, Van Dyke, surmises that by the election of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (1471), "all the Popes for forty years had signed and promptly broken" the "Capitulation of the Conclave."&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyke, 1897, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Jugie considers the "regular recourse to capitulation" to be "above all, an admission of weakness."&lt;ref name="jugie"/&gt;  Despite their ineffectiveness, Capitulations still give an insight into the thinking of the Cardinals as they prepared to vote for a pope.

Although not the last Capitulations, that of the conclave of 1513 (which elected [[Pope Leo X]]) was a turning point for [[papal supremacy]] and attempts to control it through formal treaties; never again did the College attempt to [[size of the College of Cardinals|limit its size]] through capitulations; although individual cardinals remained powerful, the College as a whole never regained its power as the "senate" of the Church.&lt;ref name="b94"/&gt;

In 1676, Pope-elect [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] made the College swear to the capitulation that had been drafted by the previous conclave before accepting his election.&lt;ref name="b162"/&gt;

Though the practice was defunct, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1996 Constitution ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' banned conclave capitulations as well as the [[papal veto]], which had already been eliminated by Pius X.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, 2003, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "I likewise forbid the Cardinals before the election to enter into any stipulations, committing themselves of common accord to a certain course of action should one of them be elevated to the Pontificate. These promises too, should any in fact be made, even under oath, I also declare null and void."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html  ''Universi Dominici Gregis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506074146/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_22021996_universi-dominici-gregis_en.html |date=May 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

'''''El Malpensante''''' ({{lang-es|The Misthinker}}) is a Colombian [[literary magazine]] of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, graphic art and poetry founded in 1996. Its founders were Andrés Hoyos Restrepo and Mario Jursich Durán The name of the magazine was extracted from a book of aphorisms written by Gesualdo Bufalino.

Since its foundation in 1996, El Malpensante has become one of the main cultural references of Colombia. Literature, cinema, music, art, architecture, design, politics. The wide variety of paradoxical readings contained in its pages have redefined for a generation of readers what it means to "be malpensante": a brand of literary pleasure; a window to access particular and profound views of culture; an innovative publishing firm, a guarantee of quality and credibility. La editorial de dicha revista realiza además el Festival Malpensante, una serie de encuentros anuales que incluye diversas actividades culturales realizadas en Bogotá.2 Recientemente El Malpensante asumió el mando de la tradicional librería Biblos en Bogotá. Para el año 2011 ya se anunció que no habrá Festival Malpensante..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist list|url=https://www.hayfestival.com/artist.aspx?artistid=2169|work=Hay Festival|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth''' "'''Betty'''" '''Gwyn Caskey''' (20 May 1910 – January 1994) was a Canadian-American [[Classics|classical scholar]], teacher, and archaeologist, known for her work in the excavations at [[Lerna]] and [[Kea (island)|Kea]], which are of importance to Greek prehistory. As an archaeologist she worked with her husband, [[Jack Caskey]], on excavations where she supervised the trenches of every annual dig and their fortifications. She also wrote summaries of the excavations.{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=1–10}}{{Sfn|Wiencke|2000|p=9}} After her marriage ended she excavated at Pylos. She was a Professor of Classics at [[Randolph-Macon College]] who became Professor Emeritus in 1981.{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=1–10}}&lt;ref name="Breaking Ground"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Elizabeth&amp;last=Caskey|title= Elizabeth Caskey|accessdate=17 April 2016|work=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology|publisher= [[Brown University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Elizabeth Caskey was born Clara Elizabeth Conningsby Gwyn on 20 May 1910 at [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. She was the third child of seven children (four girls and three boys) of Stratton Gwyn and Fanny Coningsby. She spent her early years in the [[prairies]] of Canada under difficult conditions. She attended elementary school at [[Dandas]] until 1921. From 1922 her high school education was at the Battleford Collegiate School at [[Battleford]]. She was a good debater in the school, and graduated from the school with distinction, getting the Governor General's Medal for Saskatchewan. From 1926 to 1927 she stayed at home learning piano as her mother thought she was too young to go to college.{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=1–4}}

In 1928, when her family moved to [[Duncan, British Columbia]], she attended Hamilton Central Collegiate, preparatory to joining college. She graduated from Hamilton with honours in English literature, history, Algebra and Geometry, Latin, French and Greek, and was the recipient of the J. M. Buchan Gold Medal and three scholarships to pursue further graduate studies at the [[University of Toronto]]. She studied at the [[Trinity College, Toronto|Trinity College]] of the university and after four years of study in various subjects received her degree in [[Classics]] in 1932 with distinction, topping her class. After receiving her MA degree in 1933 from Toronto College she moved to the [[University of Cincinnati]] with a teaching fellowship to pursue further studies for her doctorate. Her doctoral studies covered Greek history, prose composition, [[elegy]] and [[epigram]], and Greek civilization.{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=1–4}} She also did a course in pre-classical Greece from 1935 to 1936.

At Cincinnati she met [[John Langdon Caskey]], a fellow student  and a [[Yale University]] graduate. They married on 1 August 1936. As John Langdon pursued his archaeological excavations at [[Troy]] where he had been working with since 1932, Elizabeth joined him in the field work for a short spell in 1938 assisting in some elementary work related to field archaeology. During her doctoral studies she also taught in the Classics department under a Taft teaching Fellowship. She received her doctoral degree from the university in June 1939 with her thesis on "Democritus and Plato."{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=1–4}}

==Professional career==
During [[World War II]] Caskey started teaching Classics from 1942, initially as a substitute  teacher in place of those who had opted for war duty and then as an instructor  from 1942 to 1946. In 1948 she moved to Greece with her husband, where he worked as Assistant Director at the [[American School of Classical Studies in Athens]]. She pursued a career as a librarian from 1948 to 1958, and occasionally taught [[numismatics]] and [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient pottery]] to graduate students, drawing on the data of archaeological excavations in [[Athenian Agora]]. She also assisted students to study flora and fauna during their field excavations of the ruins.{{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=5–6}}

In 1952 with the support of the school, Caskey along with her husband started working on the archaeological excavations at [[Lerna]]. In 1952, with the support of the school, along with her husband she started working on the archaeological excavations at Lerna, a pre-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycaeanean]] site in the [[Peloponnese]], south of [[Argos]] on the road to [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolis]]; the work related to the [[Middle Bronze Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[neolithic period]]s. She had the task of supervising digs as "quarter master" in areas that provided information related to Early [[Bronze Age]]. Following completion of the Lerna excavations, and erecting a roof over the "House of Tiles", she took up the task of recording the excavations at the Eutresia at [[Boeatia]] in Southern Greece along with her husband. This work was published in Hesperia with support from the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. {{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=6–7}}

In 1969 they came back to [[Cincinnati]] for a short period and then started another excavation at [[Agia Eirini, Chania|Agia Irini]] on the island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]] off the coast of Attica during 1960, where the students of the college were also trained to establish the link between palace civilization of [[Crete]] and the Mycenanean centres in the Peloponnesos, south of Argos on the road to Tripolis. Following completion of Lerna excavations and erecting a roof over the excavations over the "House of Tiles" she took up the task of recording the excavations at the Eutresis at Boeatia in Southern Greece along with her husband and this work was published in Hesperia with support from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1969 they came back to Cinncinnari for a short period and then started another excavation at Agia Irini on the island of Kea off the coast of Attica during 1960, where the students of the college were also trained. {{Sfn|Wiencke|pp=6–7}}

In the excavation conducted during 1963–64 Caskey not only encouraged new archaeologists but also got involved with deep digging in Late Bronze Age sites, which  exposed the largest building with peeled-out painted plaster in some rooms, pots, graffiti, drains, roads and other features. The publication titled "House A", published by W. Willson Cummer and Elizabeth Schofield, is dedicated to Caskey with the credit: "who excavated most of House A and made preliminary studies of much of the pottery."{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

In 1965, the recording of finds of a temple next to House A site and of pottery, mostly of the Late Bronze Age, animal bones, fragments of frescos, human skeletal and the [[terracotta]] statues were also done by a team under Caskey's supervision; her niece Lynne Radcliffe of [[Vancouver]] had joined this team. However, Caskey did not resume her work at the site as she had divorced her husband. From that point on, she used the nickname of "Betty".{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

After her return to Cincinnati, Caskey initially taught as an instructor at the university. Between 1967 and 1968, she taught at the Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, as assistant professor on a part-time basis.{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

She resumed excavations in Greece during summer 1968. She was a member of a rescue expedition of the American School and the [[University of Colorado]], at [[Pylos]] in [[Elis]]. This excavation was in the submerhence area of a big dam and the excavation was concluded quickly from June 12 and August 17, 1968, supplemented with more work in 1970. The excavations unearthed antiquaries of "[[Helladic period|Middle Helladic]] occupation, wells of the late Geometric and Archaic periods, house foundations of the fifth to the fourth century B.C., house walls and graves of the later Roman period, and some Byzantine occupation." {{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

From fall of 1968 Caskey started working at the [[Randolph College|Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], as associate professor and as professor from 1977. The subjects she taught here covered her special fields such as classical literature and philosophy, Greek, ancient history, art and archaeology. She was active in the [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. She  was a member of the [[American School of Classical Studies]]. She was also associated with the Faculty Senate of Virginia on behalf of the Randolph-Macon. She took part in the activities of the women's initiatives of the "Lynchburg AAUW", the League of Women Voters, and the [[First Unitarian Church (Cincinnati, Ohio)|First Unitarian Church]]. She also pursued  action related to environmental concerns and was a keen bird-watcher. She then devoted her time to publish many research articles, particularly on [[Plato]]'s work, review of archaeological books. She retired in 1981 and was given the status of [[emeritus professor]].{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

Caskey died in January 1994 in Lynchburg, where she had spent her retirement days.{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=8}}

At Caskey's memorial service President emeritus William F. Quillian  extolled her qualities  by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;There are few who combine so well as she did the qualities of meticulous scholarship, devotion to teaching and skill in inspiring her students to a study of and appreciation for the Classics, an interest in and involvement in social and political issues, and with it all a winsomeness and cheery outlook on life.{{Sfn|Wiencke|p=10}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">The '''Free The Army Tour''' (or '''FTA Tour'''), a play on the troop expression "F--- The Army" (which in turn was a play on the army slogan "Fun, Travel and Adventure"), was an [[Opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] road show designed as a response to [[Bob Hope]]'s [[United Service Organizations|USO]] tour.

It was first organized in April 1970 by activist [[Fred Gardner (activist)|Fred Gardner]], and actors [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Donald Sutherland]].

The tour, referred to as "political [[vaudeville]]" by Fonda, visited military towns along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. [[Barbara Garson]] was also a contributor to the show.

The resulting dialogue was turned into a film called ''[[F.T.A.]]'', directed by [[Francine Parker]],&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite news |first=Valerie J.|last=Nelson|title= Francine Parker; |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2007/11/20/francine_parker_directed_controversial_fta|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Boston Globe]] |date=2007-11-20|accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released into theaters in 1972. Footage and discussion of the FTA Tour is included in the 2005 documentary film ''[[Sir! No Sir!]].

Since then, the director of ''Sir! No Sir!'', [[David Zeiger]], has been involved in resurrecting the original documentary film ''F.T.A.''. It was shown publicly in Los Angeles in early 2009 at the [[American Cinematheque]] with a panel that included two of the original performers in the show. ''F.T.A.'' also had its broadcast premiere on the [[SundanceTV|Sundance Channel]] on February 23, 2009. The DVD of ''F.T.A.'' is now sold on the ''Sir! No Sir!'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://webstore.sirnosir.com/FTA/M/B001HBVE7Y.htm | accessdate = 25 Jan 2010 | title = FTA &amp; Sir! No Sir! Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Funk art''' is an American [[art movement]] that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; An [[anti-establishment]] movement, Funk art brought [[figurative art|figuration]] back as subject matter in [[painting]] again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]] were depicting. The movement’s name was derived from the [[jazz]] musical term "[[funk]]y", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The term [[funk]] also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's [[Bay Area]] in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a [[collective]] art style or group.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"&gt;Karlstrom, Paul J. ''Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt;

==History==

===Bay Area===
The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in [[Northern California]]. Some notable cities where the Funk movement was concentrated in consisted of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Marin County]], [[Big Sur]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many Funk artists began as [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"&gt;Engelbach, Barbara ''Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68''. Köln König: Museum Ludwig, Köln, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically [[San Francisco]], was a free and spiritual environment due to its [[beatnik]] art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the [[Vietnam War]] going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"/&gt; A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the "Fetish Finish" sculptures made in [[Southern California]] and the "primary structures" constructed in New York at the time.&lt;ref name="Selz"&gt;Selz, Peter. ''Funk''. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s.  [[Jess Collins|Jess]], [[Wally Hedrick]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Viola Frey]], [[Wallace Berman]] and [[Bruce Conner]] were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; In 1967, [[Peter Selz]], the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; The exhibition featured works from [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Mowry Baden]] and [[Bruce Conner]], and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;Albright, Thomas. ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0520051939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter.

===Self-identification===
Unlike earlier movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], Funk art was not concerned with public [[morality]]. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions and processes and in this way their work had a closer [[nature v culture|relationship to nature rather than to culture]]. The works had creative freedom and demonstrated the artists' lives, personalities and experiences.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Funk artists treated their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality and [[autobiographical]] references.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and [[ironic]].  Although the works are humorous, they sometimes cover a more serious undertone.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Since there was no clear meaning in many pieces, Funk art contains a sense of ambiguity.

===Found objects===
Funk art was inspired by [[popular culture]], contains attitude and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics is that it incorporates found objects from [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. It was a part of the larger movement called [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]], which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; [[Bruce Conner]] was known for his assemblage works, including ''Arachne'', ''Spider Lady'', ''For Marilyn'', ''Cosmic Death Song'', and ''Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron''.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many of the Funk [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; [[Jess Collins|Jess]] and [[Wally Hedrick]] were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the [[Dada]] movement because both art movements use everyday objects and have a sense of freedom.The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay many of the time.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Due to the artists lack of concern with impeccable technique, durability or form, the works each possessed a somewhat sloppy finish.

==Ceramics==
Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina{{Where|date=June 2015}} and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate by artists belonging to other movements.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;  Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;Shields, Scott A. "California Funk." ''Ceramics Monthly 56.9'' (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;

===Robert Arneson===
[[Robert Arneson]] started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area.  Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally.{{cn|date=June 2015}} [[Robert Arneson]] created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by [[pop art]] sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that [[Robert Arneson]] also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; His works were playful and full of color.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;
[[Robert Arneson]], along with other Funk artists, such as [[Roy De Forest]], [[Manuel Neri]], and [[William T. Wiley]] taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], which was a center for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[University of California, Davis]], such as Margaret Dodd, [[David Gilhooly]], [[Victor Cicansky]], Chris Unterseher, and Peter Vandenberge, continued Arneson's ceramics tradition.

In 1967, [[Robert Arneson]] drafted ceramicist [[Clayton Bailey]] to cover his classes at [[University of California, Davis]] while he took a [[sabbatical]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

==Exhibitions==

Founded in [[Folsom, California]], in 1962, the [[Candy Store Gallery]] played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10650">[[File:Lobelia Siphilitica.jpg|thumb|''[[Lobelia siphilitica]]'' is an example of a species with a gynodioecious mating system.]]

'''Gynodioecy''' is a rare breeding system that is found in certain flowering plant species in which female and hermaphroditic plants coexist within a population. Gynodioecy is the evolutionary intermediate stage between [[hermaphroditism]] (exhibiting both female and male parts) and [[dioecy]] (having two distinct morphs: male and female). Gynodioecy is the opposite of [[androdioecy]], which is a breeding system consisting of male and hermaphroditic plants in a population. Gynodioecy occurs as a result of a genetic mutation that inhibits a hermaphroditic plant from producing pollen, while keeping the female reproductive parts intact. Gynodioecy is extremely rare, with fewer than 1% of angiosperm species exhibiting the breeding system. Some notable species that exhibit a gynodioecious mating system include ''[[Beta vulgaris]]'' (wild beet), ''[[Lobelia siphilitica]]'', ''[[Silene]]'', and [[Lamiaceae]].

== Evolution of Gynodioecy ==
Gynodioecy is often referred to as the evolutionary intermediate state between hermaphroditism and dioecy. Gynodioecy has been investigated by biologists dating as far back as to [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt; Gynodioecy can evolve from hermaphroditism due to certain environmental factors. If enough resources in a population are allocated to the female functions in a hermaphroditic species, gynodioecy will ensue. On the other hand, if more of those resources are divvied up to favor a hermaphrodite’s male functions, androdioecy will result. A high rate of [[self-pollination]] in a population facilitates the maintenance of gynodioecy by increasing the inbreeding costs for hermaphrodites.&lt;ref name="Sinclair2016"/&gt; Thus, as the rate of inbreeding increases in a population, the more likely gynodioecy is to occur.

Since hermaphrodites can reproduce on their own, they are referred to as being self-compatible. On the contrary, non-hermaphroditic plants are [[self-incompatible]]. Research has shown that a species can be either gynodioecious or self-incompatible, but very rarely is there a co-occurrence between the two. Therefore, gynodioecy and self-incompatibility tend to prevent each other’s maintenance. Self-incompatibility of plants helps maintain androdioecy in plants, since males are in competition with only hermaphrodites to sire ovules. Self-incompatibility leads to a loss in gynodioecy, since neither hermaphrodites nor females have to deal with [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name="VandePaer2015"/&gt;

Two scenarios have been proposed to explain the evolutionary dynamics of the maintenance of gynodioecy. The first scenario, known as the balancing selection theory, considers the genetic factors that control gynodioecy over long evolutionary time scales. The balancing selection leads to cycles that explain the normal sex ratios in gynodioecious populations. The second scenario, known as epidemic dynamics, involves the arrival and loss of new cytoplasmic male sterility genes in new populations. These are the same genes that invade hermaphrodite populations and eventually result in gynodioecy.&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt;

== Determination of Gynodioecy ==
Gynodioecy is determined as a result of a genetic mutation that stops a plant from producing pollen, but still allows normal female reproductive features.&lt;ref name="Preece2010"/&gt; In plants, nuclear genes are inherited from both parents, but all the cytoplasmic genes come from the mother. This holds true in order to compensate for male gametes being smaller and more motile while female gametes are larger. It makes sense for most plants to be hermaphrodites, since they are sessile and unable to find mates as easily as animals can.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

Cytoplasmic male sterility genes, usually found in the mitochondrial genome, show up and are established when female fertility is just slightly more than the hermaphroditic fertility. The female only needs to make slightly more or better seeds than hermaphrodites since the mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited.&lt;ref name="Delph2007"/&gt; Research done on plants has shown that hermaphroditic plants are in constant battles against organelle genes trying to kill their male parts. In over 140 plant species, these “male killer” genes have been observed. Male sterility genes cause plants to grow anthers that are stunted or withered and as a result, do not produce pollen. In most plants, there are nuclear fertility restoring genes that counteract the work of the male sterility genes, maintaining the hermaphroditic state of the plant. However, in some species of plants, the male sterility genes win the battle over the nuclear fertility restoring genes, and gynodioecy occurs.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

[[Maize]] farmers take advantage of gynodioecy to produce favorable hybrid maize seeds. The farmers deliberately make use of the gynodioecy that develops in the maize, resulting in a population of male-sterile and female-fertile individuals. They then introduce a new strain of male-sterile individuals and the breeders are able to collect the more favorable hybrid seeds.&lt;ref name="Ridley1993"/&gt;

== Rarity ==
Gynodioecy is a rare, but widely distributed sexual system in angiosperm species. Gynodioecy is found in at least 81 different angiosperm families. Of all the angiosperms on Earth, less than 1% of them are gynodioecious species.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; One likely explanation for its rarity is due to its limited evolution. Since females are at a disadvantage when compared to hermaphrodites, they will never be able to evolve as quickly. In addition, gynodioecy is rare because the mechanism that favor females and cause gynodioecy in some populations only operate in some plant lineages, but not others.

The reason for this variation in the rarity of gynodioecy stems from certain phenotypic traits or ecological factors that promote and favor the presence of female plants in a population. For example, a herbaceous growth form is much more highly favored in gynodioecious species of [[Lamiaceae]] as compared to woody lineages.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; Herbaceous growth form is also associated with a reduced pollen limitation and an increased self-fertilization. A reduced pollen limitation may decrease seed quantity and quality. Woody growth form Lamiaceae are more pollen-limited, and thus, produce less seeds and seeds of lower quality, thus favoring the female herbaceous growth form.&lt;ref name="Rivkin2016"/&gt; Gynodioecy is rare because some sexual systems are more evolutionary liable to change in certain lineages as compared to others.

== Maintenance of Gynodioecy ==
The maintenance of gynodioecy at first may seem like a mystery. Theoretically, hermaphrodites should have the evolutionary and reproductive advantage over females in a population because they naturally can produce more offspring. Hermaphrodites can transmit their genes through both pollen and ovules, whereas females can only transmit genes via ovules. Thus, in order for females to remain viable in a population, they would have to be twice as successful as hermaphrodites.

It would appear that gynodioecy should not persist. In order for it to be maintained, the females need to have some sort of a reproductive advantage over the hermaphroditic population, known as female compensation or female advantage.&lt;ref name="Touzet2012"/&gt; Female advantage includes an increase in saved energy from not producing pollen and making seedlings of higher quality, since hermaphrodite seedlings are susceptible to homozygous deleterious alleles. Additional advantages include more flowers, higher fruit set, higher total seed production, heavier seeds, and better germination rates.

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], an '''honorific''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''hon'''}}) is a [[grammar|grammatical]] or [[morphosyntactic]] form that encodes the relative social status of the participants of the conversation. Distinct from [[honorific|honorific titles]], linguistic honorifics convey formality {{sc|'''form'''}}, social distance, politeness {{sc|'''pol'''}}, humility {{sc|'''hbl'''}}, deference, or respect through the choice of an alternate form such as an [[affix]], [[clitic]], [[grammatical case]], change in person or number, or an entirely different [[lexical item]]. A key feature of an honorific system is that one can convey the same message in both honorific and familiar forms—i.e., it is possible to say something like (as in an oft-cited example from Brown and Levinson) "The soup is hot" in a way that confers honor or deference on one of the participants of the conversation.

Honorific speech is a type of social [[deixis]], as an understanding of the context—in this case, the social status of the speaker relative to the other participants or bystanders—is crucial to its use.

There are three main types of honorifics, categorized according to the individual whose status is being expressed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|date=1976|title=Linguistic politeness axes: Speaker-addressee, speaker-referent, speaker-bystander.|url=|journal=Pragmatics Microfiche|volume=1.7|pages=A3-B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Addressee (or speaker/hearer)
* Referent (or speaker/referent)
* Bystander (or speaker/bystander)

Addressee honorifics express the social status of the person being spoken to (the hearer), regardless of what is being talked about. For example, [[#Javanese|Javanese]] has three different words for "house" depending on the status level of the person spoken to. Referent honorifics express the status of the person being spoken about. In this type of honorific, both the referent (the person being spoken about) and the target (the person whose status is being expressed) of the honorific expression are the same. This is exemplified by the T–V distinction present in many [[Indo-European languages]], in which a different 2nd person pronoun (such as ''tu'' or ''vous'' in French) is chosen based on the relative social status of the speaker and the hearer (the hearer, in this case, also being the referent).&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Yan. 2007. ''Pragmatics'', Oxford University Press. p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Bystander honorifics express the status of someone who is nearby, but not a participant in the conversation (the overhearer). These are the least common, and are found primarily in [[#Avoidance speech|avoidance speech]] such as the "mother-in-law languages" of aboriginal Australia, where one changes one's speech in the presence of an in-law or other tabooed relative.

A fourth type, the Speaker/Situation honorific, does not concern the status of any participant or bystander, but the circumstances and environment in which the conversation is occurring. The classic example of this is [[diglossia]], in which an elevated or "high form" of a language is used in situations where more formality is called for, and a vernacular or "low form" of a language is used in more casual situations.

==T–V distinction in Indo-European languages==

{{main|T–V distinction}}

One common system of honorific speech is T–V distinction. The terms ''T-form'' and ''V-form'' to describe the second person pronouns ''tu'' and ''vos'', respectively, were introduced by Brown and Gilman, whose 1960 study of them introduced the idea that the use of these forms was governed by "power and solidarity." The Latin ''tu'' refers to the singular T-form, while the Latin ''vos'' refers to the V-form, which is usually plural-marked.  ''Tu'' is used to express informality, and in contrast, ''vos'' is used to express politeness and formality. T–V distinction is characteristic of many Indo-European languages, including Persian, Portuguese, Polish, and Russian, as detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, William (1997). “Language and Social Position.” ''Anthropological Linguistics: An Introduction'': 305–333. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazilian Portuguese===
The pronouns ''tu'' (informal) and ''você'' (more formal) fit the T–V pattern nicely, except that their use varies a great deal from region to region. For instance, in most parts of Brazil, ''tu'' is not used; whereas in the northern state of Maranhão and southern regions, it is. A third lexical option is added to the honorific scheme: ''o senhor'' and ''a senhora'' (literally meaning “sir” and “madam”, which are third-person references that are used in direct address (that would "normally" require the second person ''tu'' or ''você''). These forms are highly formal and used when speaking “upward” and always used in formal correspondence, such as in governmental letters, to authorities, customers and elders. See more discussion at [[Portuguese personal pronouns#Tu vs. voc.C3.AA|Portuguese personal pronouns]].

===Persian===
As an Indo-European language the pronouns ''tu'' (informal) and ''Shoma'' (more formal form of second-person single and also used alone for second-person plural) fit the T–V pattern except that the Name ''Shoma'' is actually a modern Persian word originating from the old Avestan Persian words  ''shê-Va'' where ''Va'' or ''Ve'' used as more formal form of second-person single and also used alone for second-person plural and ''shê'' which means for him or his. Therefore the words ''shê-Va'' together, had been used to refer to formal form of second-male person single and also used alone for second-male person plural.

===Polish===
{{see also|T-V distinction#Polish|l1=T-V distinction in Polish|Polish name#Formal and informal use}}
[[Polish language|Polish]] has a simpler grammatical and lexical politeness incorporated into its language, in comparison to Japanese and Korean. It uses grammatical category of honorifics within certain verbs and personal pronouns; this honorific system is namely split into two basic levels – the familiar (T) and the polite (V):
:*''ty'': second-person singular, informal
:*''on'' (masculine) / ''ona'' (feminine): third-person singular, informal (note that there's also neuter ''ono'', but it's not used when referring to people except small children)
:*''wy'': second-person plural, informal
:*''oni'' (used when referring to a group of men or people of mixed gender)/''one'' (when referring to a group of women): third-person plural
:*''pan'' (male-marked) / ''pani'' (female-marked): second- and third-person singular, formal
:*''panowie'' (male-marked) / ''panie'' (female-marked) / ''państwo'' (mixed gender): second- and third-person plural, formal
Sometimes ''panna'' is used for an unmarried woman, along with using different suffixes for last name, although it's mostly obsolete and can be considered condescending. Using first name alone is familiar (but not necessarily intimate, as in Japanese—it's commonly used among colleagues, for example). Using the last name alone is extremely rare and when it's employed, it's usually very rude.
These can be used as a prefix to a first or last name, as in the example:
:*''Pan Karol'': Mr. Karol
:*''Pani Kowalska'': Mrs./Ms. Kowalska
:*''Pani Anna'': Mrs./Ms. Anna
Which are more formal than using the typical familiar ''ty''/''on''/''ona'', but they may imply familiarity, especially in second person. Using a prefix with the first name is almost always considered familiar and possibly rude. Using the last name with a prefix in second person can still be considered impolite. Using the set phrase ''proszę pana'', ''proszę pani'' is preferred (and polite) when drawing attention (in a way akin to using ''sir'' in English).

In addition, there are two different V forms within the honorific usage – the more formal and the less formal form. The less formal form is more colloquial and used in daily speech more frequently. The higher honorific level includes “compound” pronouns consisting of prefixal ''pan'' or ''pani'' in conjunction with professional titles. Here are some examples (for males/females resp.):
:*''Pan minister'' / ''Pani minister'': Minister
:*''Pan dyrektor'' / ''Pani dyrektor'': Director
:*''Pan kierowca'' / ''Pani kierowca'': driver
:*''Pan doktor'' / ''Pani doktor'': doctor
These professional titles are more formal as the speaker humbles him/herself and puts the addressee at a higher rank or status. These can also be used along with a name (only last or both names), but that's extremely formal and almost never used in direct conversation.
For some professional titles (e.g. ''doktor'', ''profesor''), the ''pan''/''pani'' can be dropped, resulting in a form which is less formal, but still polite. Unlike the above, this can also precede a name (almost always last), but it's seldom used in second person.
As with ''pan''/''pani'' phrases such as ''proszę pana ministra'' (which can be translated "Minister, sir") can also be used for calling attention, although they are less common. The ''pan''/''pani'' can also be dropped with some titles in the phrase, but it's even less common and can be inappropriate.

Historical factors played a major role in shaping the Polish usage of honorifics. Poland’s history of nobility was the major source for Polish politeness, which explains how the honorific male-marked pronoun ''pan'' (''pani'' is female-marked) was derived from the old word for “lord.” There are separate honorific pronouns used to address a priest (''ksiądz''), a nun or nurse (''siostra''). It is acceptable to replace ''siostra'' with ''pani'' when addressing a nurse, but it is unacceptable when speaking to a nun. Likewise, it is unacceptable to replace ''ksiądz'' with ''pan'' when speaking to a priest. The intimate T form is marked as neutral when used reciprocally between children, relatives, students, soldiers and young people.&lt;ref&gt;Huszcza, Romuald. (2005). “Politeness in Poland: From ‘Titlemania’ to Grammaticalised Honorifics.” Politeness in Europe: 218–233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===

Native [[Russian language|Russian]] speakers usually know when to use the informal second person singular pronoun (''ty'') or the formal form (''vy''). The practice of being informal is known as ''týkan’e'' while the practice of being formal and polite is referred to ''výkan’e''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

It has been suggested that the origin of ''vy''-address came from the Roman Empire and the French due to the influence of their language and culture on the Russian aristocracy. In many other European countries, ''ty'' initially was used to address any one person or object, regardless of age and social ranking. ''Vy'' was then used to address multiple people or objects altogether. Later, after being in contact with foreigners, the second person plural pronoun acquired another function. Displaying respect and formality, it was used for addressing aristocrats – people of higher social status and power.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Another theory suggests that in Russia, the Emperor first adopted the plural ''vy''-form. The Emperor is considered plural because he is the representation of the people. Likewise, the Emperor could refer to himself using ''vos'' (we), to represent "I and my people". From the courts, the middle and lower classes gradually adopted this usage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The younger generation and commoners, with minimal education still address each other using ''ty'' with no connotation of disrespect, however. Certain Russians who are used to ''vy''-address may perceive the ones who don’t differentiate between ''ty'' and ''vy'' forms as uneducated, offensive and uncultured. This leads to the conclusion that this honorific was not a Russian innovation. Instead, the use of ''vy'' in both the singular and plural form is due to the exposure to the Latin historical and political developments. The usage of ''vy'' did not spread throughout the Russian population quickly; as a result, the usage was inconsistent until the eighteenth century, when ''Vy'' became more prominent in secular literature.&lt;ref&gt;Popov, Paul (Autumn 1985). “On the Origin of Russian ''vy'' as a Form of Polite Address.” The Slavic and East European Journal 29 (3): 330–337&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Avoidance speech==

{{main|Avoidance speech}}

Avoidance speech, or "mother-in-law language," is the most common example of a bystander honorific. In this honorific system, a speaker switches to a different variety of speech in the presence of an in-law or other relative for whom an [[Wiktionary:affinal|affinal]] [[taboo]] exists. These languages usually have the same [[phonology]] and grammatical structure as the standard language they derived from, but are characterized by a smaller lexical inventory than the standard language. Avoidance speech of this sort is primarily found in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] such as Dyirbal, but can also be found in some Native American languages, including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], and some [[Bantu languages]], including [[Zulu language|Zulu]].

===Dyirbal===

The [[Dyirbal language]] has a special avoidance speech style called ''Jalnguy'' that is used by a speaker when in the presence of the speaker’s mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Tsunoda, Tasaku. 2005. ''Language Endangerment and Language Revitalization''. Walter de Gruyter. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; This mother-in-law language has the same phonology and grammar as the everyday style, but uses an almost totally distinct set of lexemes when in the presence of the tabooed relative. This special lexicon has fewer lexemes than the everyday style and typically employs only transitive verb roots whereas everyday style uses non-cognate transitive and intransitive roots.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Robert M. W. 1994. ''Ergativity''. Cambridge University Press. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  By using this mother-in-law language a speaker then indicates a deferential social relationship.

===Guugu-Yimidhirr===

In [[Guugu Yimidhirr language|Guugu-Yimidhirr]], a traditional Australian Aboriginal language, special avoidance lexemes are used to express deference when in the presence of tabooed in-law relatives. In other words, speakers will either be completely prohibited from speaking to one’s mother-in-law or must employ “avoidance language” to one’s brother-in-law. The brother-in-law language involves a special set of words to replace regular Guugu-Yimidhirr words and the speaker must avoid words which could suggest reference to genitalia or bodily acts. This brother-in-law language therefore indexes a deferential social relationship of the brother-in-law to the speaker and is reflected in the appropriate social behavior of Guugu-Yimidhirr society. For example, one avoids touching tabooed in-laws, looking at them, joking with them, and cursing in their presence.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, William. 1997. ''Anthropological linguistics: An introduction''. Blackwell. pp. 327–8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortlockese ===
The [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese Language]] uses avoidance speech between genders. In Mortlock culture, there are many restrictions and rules when interacting with people of the opposite gender, such as how only males are allowed to go fishing or how women are supposed to lower their posture in the presence of men. This avoidance speech showcases one of these restrictions/rules. This gender-restrictive vocabulary can only be used when speaking to people of the same gender. For men, this is sometimes referred to as ''kapsen leefalang'' or the speech of the cookhouse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Odango|first=Emerson Lopez|year=2015|title=Affeu fangani 'join together': A morphophonemic analysis  of possessive suffix paradigms and a discourse-based ethnography of the elicitation session in Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese|url=http://search.proquest.com.eres.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/pqdtglobal/docview/1714372047/fulltextPDF/608E22FC791245B5PQ/1?accountid=27140|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples of honorifics==

===English===

Modern English has no grammatical system of honorific speech, with formality and informality being conveyed entirely by register, word choice, tone, rhetorical strategy, etc. [[Middle English]] once exhibited a T–V distinction between the 2nd person singular pronoun ''[[thou]]'' and the 2nd person plural ''[[Ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' and later ''[[you]]'', with the latter being used as an honorific regardless of the number of addressees. ''Thou'' and its associated forms have fallen into disuse and are considered archaic, though it is often used in recreations of archaic-sounding speech.
It has also survived in some dialect forms of English, notably in some regions of Yorkshire, especially amongst the older and more rural populations. ''Ye'' usage can still be found in pockets of the east coast of North America, such as rural Newfoundland.

===[[German language|German]]===
German has 'Sie' as formal 'you', &amp; 'du' as the informal.

===Chinese===

{{main|Chinese honorifics}}

Chinese has '您'(nín) as formal 'you', &amp; '你'(nǐ) as the informal.

===Japanese===

{{main|Honorific speech in Japanese}}

[[Japanese language|Japanese]] honorific speech requires either honorific morphemes to be appended to verbs and some nouns or verbs and pronouns be replaced by words that mean the same but incorporate different honorific connotations.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, P. G. 2008. ''Japanese Respect Language: When, Why, and How to Use it Successfully''. Tuttle. pp. 15–41. {{ISBN|978-4-8053-0976-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Japanese honorific speech is broadly referred to as ''keigo'' (literally "respectful language"), and includes three main categories according to Western linguistic theory: ''sonkeigo'', respectful language; ''kensongo'' or ''kenjōgo'', humble language; and ''teineigo'', polite language.

# ''Sonkeigo''
#* raises the status of the addressee or referent (e.g. third person) in relation to the speaker
#* encodes a feeling of respect
#* example:  ''Sensei ga sochira ni &lt;u&gt;oide ni naru&lt;/u&gt;.''  'The teacher &lt;u&gt;is going&lt;/u&gt; there.'
# ''Kenjōgo''
#* humbles the status of the speaker in relation to the addressee or referent
#* encodes a feeling of humility
#* example: ''Asu sensei no tokoro ni &lt;u&gt;ukagau&lt;/u&gt;.''  'I will &lt;u&gt;go&lt;/u&gt; to the teacher's place tomorrow.'
# ''Teineigo''
#* raises the status of the addressee or referent in relation to the speaker
#* encodes politeness
#* example: ''Sensei ga achira ni iki&lt;u&gt;masu&lt;/u&gt;.''  'The teacher &lt;u&gt;is going&lt;/u&gt; there.'

Another subcategory of ''keigo'' is ''bikago'' or ''bika-hyōgen'', which means "word beautification" and is used to demonstrate the quality of the speaker’s language. Each type of speech has its own vocabulary and verb endings.&lt;ref name='Modern Keigo'&gt;Wetzel, Patricia J. 2004. ''Keigo in Modern Japan''. University of Hawai’I Press. pp.3–4, 23, 29–30, 33, 39–41, 60–65 {{ISBN|0-8248-2602-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese linguist Hatsutarō Ōishi distinguishes four sources of respect as the primary reasons for using ''keigo'':
# respecting those who have a higher social rank, extraordinary ability, or credentials
# respecting those who occupy a dominant position
# respecting those to whom one is indebted
# respect for humanity

Comparatively, a more contemporary linguistic account by functional linguist Yasuto Kikuchi posits that honorific speech is governed by social factors and psychological factors.

:Some examples of what Kikuchi considers social factors include:
:* the location and topic being discussed by the speaker
:* whether the context is written or spoken
:* interpersonal relationships between the speaker, listener, and referent (i.e. positional relationships, relative familiarity, and in-group/out-group relationships).

:Some examples of what Kikuchi considers psychological factors are:
:* the intention of the speaker in using polite speech
:* how relative distance in relationships is understood
:* how skilled the speaker is in expression.&lt;ref name='Modern Keigo'/&gt;

===Javanese===
Speech levels, although not as developed or as complex as honorific speech found in Japanese, are but one of a complex and nuanced aspect of Javanese etiquette: etiquette governs not only speaking but, "sitting, speaking, standing, pointing, composing one's countenance"&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press 1998. pages 84–88"&gt;James Joseph Errington: 1998. ''Shifting languages: interaction and identity in Javanese Indonesia'' in ''
Issue 19 of Studies in the social and cultural foundations of language''. Cambridge University Press: 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-63448-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-63448-9}}. 216 pages 84–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Errington 1988"&gt;Errington, JJ 1988. ''Structure and Style in Javanese: A Semiotic View of Linguistic Etiquette''. University of Pennsylvania Press: 11&lt;/ref&gt; and one could add mastery of English and Western table manners.&lt;ref&gt;Koentjaraningrat. 1985. ''Javanese culture'' Oxford University Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-19-582542-X}}, 550 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wolfowitz, as quoted in:&lt;ref&gt;Tim Ingold editor. 2002. ''Companion encyclopedia of anthropology''Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002.{{ISBN|0415286042}}. 882–883. 9780415286046 [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;dq=javanese+%2Betiquette&amp;q=javanese#v=snippet&amp;q=javanese&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The system is based on sets of precisely ranked or style-coded morphemes that are semantically equivalent but stylistically contrastive"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
important is an honorific vocabulary referring to the possessions, attributes, states and actions of persons, a vocabulary that includes honorific kin terms.

The Javanese perception of this is best summarized as per Errington's anecdote of an old Javanese man explaining:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whenever two people meet they should ask themselves: "Who is this person? Who am I? What is this person to me? Balanced against one another on a scale: this is ''unggah-unggah''- relative value&lt;ref name="Errington 1988"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The understanding of honorifics is heavily emphasized by speakers of [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. High-strata Javanese will bluntly state: "to be human is to be Javanese". Those who are "sampun Jawa" or "already Javanese" are those who have a good grasp of social interaction and stratified Javanese language and applied to foreigners as well. Children, boors, simpletons, the insane, the immoral are ''durung Jawa'': not yet Javanese.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz. 1977. ''Interpretation of Cultures'' Basic Books: 1977. {{ISBN|0-465-09719-7}}. 480 pages. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Javanese speech is stratified. The three levels are:
:*''Ngoko'' is the common "everyday" speech.
:*''Krama'' is known as the polite and formal style.  ''Krama'' is divided into two other categories:
:**''Krama Madya'': semi-polite and semi-formal
:**''Krama Inggil'': fully polite and formal
"Krama" is pronounced as [krɔmɔ]

All these categories are ranked according to age, rank, kinship relations, and “intimacy.”&lt;ref&gt;Ward Keeler: 1984. ''Javanese, a cultural approach'': Issue 69 of Papers in international studies Southeast Asia Series. Ohio University Center for International Studies, 1984. {{ISBN|0-89680-121-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89680-121-9}}. 515 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

If a speaker is uncertain about the addressee’s age or rank, they commence with ''krama inggil'' and adapt their speech strata according to the highest level of formality, moving down to lower levels.  ''Krama'' is usually learned from parents and teachers, and ''Ngoko'' is usually learned from interacting with peers at a younger age.&lt;ref&gt;Dardjowidjojo, Soenjono (1973). “Honorifics in Generative Semantics: A Case in Javanese.” RELC Journal 4: 86–97&lt;/ref&gt;

Javanese women are expected to address their husbands in front of others, including their children in a respectful manner. Such speech pattern is especially more pronounced in areas where arranged marriage are prominent and within households where the husband is considerably older than the wife. Husbands generally address their wives by their first name, pet name, or “younger sibling” (''dhik'' or ''mbak lik'') while wives generally address their husbands as “elder brother” (''mas''), this is often due to actual age differences, and it serves the females' vanity{{according to whom|date=October 2011}} to not be called "older sister" (mbak).

High-strata children are expected to speak in krama inggil to both father and mother. This is less reinforced as the social strata descends, to the point of being near non-existent especially among the modern working class strata who may have the necessity of both parents working.
At this point grandparents take the role of educating the children to correct language usage.

Women are considered the custodians of language and culture within the household.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press 1998. pages 84–88"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Errington, JJ 1988.

===Korean===

{{main|Korean honorifics}}

[[Korean language|Korean]] honorific speech is a mixture of subject honorification, object exaltation, and the various speech styles. Depending on how these three factors are used, the speaker highlights different aspects of the relationship between the speaker, the subject, and the listener (who may also be the subject).&lt;ref name="Korean Language"&gt;Lee, Iksop and S. Robert Ramsey. 2000. ''The Korean Language''. State University of New York Press. pp. 224, 250, 253–263. {{ISBN|0-7914-4831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Korean language incorporates a hierarchy of [[Korean speech levels|speech styles]] divided according to its system of honorifics each with its own set of verb endings.&lt;ref name="Korean Language" /&gt;

:The six speech styles from lowest to highest are:
# [[Korean speech levels#Haera-che|plain style]] (''haerache'' or 해라체)
#* formal
#* signals more social distance between the speaker and addressee than that when using intimate style

These six speech styles are sometimes divided into honorific and non-honorific levels where the formal and polite styles are honorific and the rest are non-honorific. According to Strauss and Eun, the two honorific speech levels are “prototypically used among non-intimate adults of relatively equal rank”. Comparatively, the non-honorific speech levels are typically used between intimates, in-group members, or in “downward directions of address by the speaker to his or her interlocutor."&lt;ref name="Korean"&gt;Stauss, Susan and Jong Oh Eun. 2005. “Indexicality and honorific speech level choice in Korean.” Linguistics. 613–614. ISSN 1613-396X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Nahuatl===

{{main|Nahuatl honorifics}}

The [[Nahuatl language]], spoken in scattered communities in rural areas of Central Mexico, utilizes a system of honorific speech to mark social distance and respect. The honorific speech of the Nahuatl dialects spoken in the Malinche Volcano area of Puebla and Tlaxcala in Mexico is divided into four levels: an “intimate or subordinating” Level I; a “neutral, socially distant” or “respectful between intimates” Level II; “noble” or “reverential” Level III; and the “compadrazgo” or “maximally social distant” Level IV.

Level I is typically used by non-age-mates and non-intimates and is unmarked in terms of [[prefix]]ation or [[suffixation]] of the listener and verbs. Level II is marked by the prefix on- on the verb and is used between intimates. Some Nahuatl speakers have been observed to alternate between Level I and Level II for one listener. The use of both levels is believed to show some respect or to not subordinate the listener. Level III is marked by the prefix ''on-'', the reflexive prefix ''mo-'', and an appropriate transitivizing suffix based on the verb stem. Verbs in Level III may additionally be marked with the reverential suffix ''–tzinōa''. Finally, Level IV is typically used between people who share a ritual kinship relationship (e.g. parent with godparent, godparent with godparent of the same child). Level IV is marked by a [[proclitic]] (i.e. word that depends on the following word and works similarly to an affix, such as the word “a” or “an” in English) ''ma''. Another important aspect of Level IV is that it addresses the listener in 3rd person whereas Level I through III all use 2nd person forms. By using this 3rd person form, maximal social distance is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Jane H. and Kenneth C. Hill. 1978. “Honorific Usage in Modern Nahuatl: The Expression of Social Distance and Respect in the Nahuatl of the Malinche Volcano Area.” https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/413001.pdf Language. Vol. 54, No. 1, pp. 125, 130, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortlockese ===
The [[Mortlockese language|Mortlockese Language]] is an Austronesian language spoken primarily on the Mortlock islands in Micronesia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Mortlock culture, there is a hierarchy with chiefs called ''samwool.'' When speaking to these chiefs or to anyone of higher status, one must use honorifics (in Mortlockese called ''kapas pwéteete'' or ''kapas amáfel'') in order to convey respect. In the Mortlockese Language, there are only two levels of speaking - common language and respectful language(honorifics).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While respectful language is used when speaking to people of higher status, common language is used when speaking to anyone of the same or lesser status. One example showing the difference between respectful and common language can be seen in the word sleep. The word for sleep using common language is ''maúr'' while the word for sleep using respectful language is ''saipash''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Along with the respectful language, there are formal greetings called ''tiirou'' or ''fairo'' that are used in meetings and gatherings. In English, some examples of formal greetings would be "good evening" or "it's a pleasure to meet you" or "how are you." These formal greetings not only use words, but also gestures. It is the combination of the words and gestures that create the ''tiirou'' or ''fairo''(formal greeting).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In English a formal greeting like this would be like saying "nice to meet you" while offering a handshake.

===Pohnpeian===

In [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]], honorific speech is especially important when interacting with chiefs and during Christian church services. Even radio announcements use honorifics, specifically bystander honorifics, because a chief or someone of higher status could potentially be listening. Pohnpeian honorific speech consists of:
:*status-lowering (humiliative) speech
:*status-raising (exaltive) speech
Honorific speech is usually performed through the choice of verbs and possessive classifier. There are only status-raising nouns but none for status lowering; there are only status-lowering pronouns but none for status-raising.

The construction of possessive classifiers depends on ownership, temporality, degrees of control, locative associations, and status. In addition to status-rising and status-lowering possessive classifiers, there are also common (non-status marked) possessive classifiers. Status-rising and status-lowering possessive classifiers have different properties of control and temporality. Common possessive classifiers are divided into three main categories – relatives, personal items, and food/drink.

Given that rank is inherited matrilineally, maternal relatives have specific classifiers, but paternal relatives do not. Personal items that are in close contact with the higher ranks are marked with honorific language. Food is related to social ranking; there is a hierarchy of food distribution. The best share of food is first distributed to the chief and people of higher status. In possessive constructions, food is linked to low-status possession, but not as heavily link to high-status possession. Tungoal (“food/eating”) is used for all categories of low-status possessives; however, the most widely used high-status classifier, sapwelline (“land/hand”) is not semantically connected to food. There are separate terms for food of high-status people – ''koanoat'', ''pwenieu'', and ''sak''. On Pohnpei, it is also important to follow a specific order of serving food. The higher-ranked people eat first, both in casual family settings and community events. The lower-status people receive the “leftovers” or the weaker portion.&lt;ref&gt;Keating, Elizabeth (June 1997). “Honorific Possession: Power and Language in Pohnpei, Micronesia.” Language Society 26 (2): 247–268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wuvulu-Aua===
In [[Wuvulu-Aua language|Wuvulu]] grammar, the honorific dual is used to convey respect, especially towards in-laws. The second person dual pronoun, ''amurua'' literally translates to 'you two', but can also be used as an honorific to address one. This communicates to the individual being spoken to is worth the respect of two individuals. It is undocumented if there are other honorifics greater than this one.

Ex.     Mafufuo, meru. (Good Morning, you two)

Note: ''Meru'' is the shortened version of ''amurua''

This sentence can be used to speak with one or two people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 690''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[Citation|bibliographic referencing]] in different kind of [[documents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Stayton |date=September 2007 |chapter=Customizing bibliography output |chapterurl=http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/CustomBiblio.html |title=DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-9741521-3-4 |publisher=Sagehill Enterprises |location=[[Santa Cruz, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=ISO 690:2010(en). Online Browsing Platform (OBP).|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes [[electronic documents]], and specifies the elements to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which the elements of the reference should be stated. Punctuation and style (output mask) are not part of the standard; it is a standard [[separation of presentation and content|for content more than for presentation]]. Thus, it influences a user's [[XML]] and [[XSL]], although not necessarily the [[CSS]].

ISO 690 covers references to published material in both print and non-print form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=International Standard.

Even though ISO 690:2010(E) generally suggests to place the date of publication after ''place'' and ''publisher'' (referred to as "production information"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard. ISO 690. Reference number ISO 690:2010(E). Information and documentation - Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=ISO 2010|edition=3|location=Geneva (Switzerland)|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it also hints to the [[Parenthetical referencing|Harvard system]] style (name-date system) and provides also various examples of its way of citation in the annex of ISO 690:2010(E).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard. ISO 690. Reference number ISO 690:2010(E). Information and documentation - Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=ISO 2010|edition=3|location=Geneva (Switzerland)|pages=4, 25-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of the document==
Until 2010, ISO 690 appeared in two ISO documents:
* ISO 690:1987 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Content, form and structure'');
* ISO 690-2:1997 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Part 2: Electronic documents or parts thereof'')

==Examples of citation (ISO 690:1987)==

Actual status of standard is ISO 690:2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43320  Information and documentation -- Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources]&lt;/ref&gt; The material is copyrighted and not free for distribution. Basically, the application of older version of ISO standard is not a fault.

The '''International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History''' (abbreviated '''ICEAACH''', simplified Chinese: 东亚考古与文化历史国际研究中心; traditional Chinese: 東亞考古與文化歷史國際研究中心; pinyin: dōng yà kǎo gǔ yǔ wén huà lì shǐ guó jì yán jiū zhōng xīn) is an internationally recognized hub for [[Transdisciplinarity|trans-disciplinary]] research and [[public outreach]] in [[East Asian archaeology]] and [[East Asian culture|cultural]] heritage. As part of [[Boston University]]’s Department of Archaeology, the primary mission of ICEAACH is to advance the field of [[East Asia]]n archaeology and promote knowledge and understanding of East Asia’s rich cultural heritage.

== History ==
The International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History (ICEAACH) was established as part of Boston University’s Department of Archaeology in 1999 with a grant from the [[Henry Luce scholar|Henry Luce Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/about/ |title=About ICEAACH » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, ICEAACH has come to occupy a unique position in our field as a [[research institution]] specifically dedicated to promoting East Asian archaeology and cultural heritage. ICEAACH’s facilities, such as a major East Asian archaeology library, experts staff—paired with the resources of the Department of Archaeology, and home to one of the largest archaeology programs in the US—affords students, researchers, and the public opportunities found nowhere else in the United States. With strong ties to leading research institutions across East and Southeast Asia, ICEAACH has become an important [[collaborative hub]] for Western archaeologists pursuing East Asian research, and for East and Southeast Asian scholars and institutions seeking Western resources and expertise, broadening understanding of Asia’s place in [[history of humanity|human history]]. ICEAACH's unique position helps [[archaeologist]]s from around the globe transcend the cultural, political, and organizational barriers that have traditionally hindered research in East Asian archaeology.

== Programs in ICEAACH ==
With support from Boston University, numerous foundations, and a growing group of dedicated private donors, ICEAACH provides a wide range of important resources and programs, including:
* A publicly accessible research library with over 10,000 volumes on East and Southeast Asian archaeology and related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/ |title=The ICEAACH Library » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] programs on Asian archaeology in Boston University’s Department of Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/academics/ |title=Academics &amp;#124; Archaeology Department |publisher=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* International research programs, ranging from the emergence of [[agriculture in East Asia]], [[climate change]] and its impact on [[hunter-gatherer]] populations in East Asia, [[ethnicity]] and state formation, and the development of [[bronze metallurgy]] to archaeological applications of remote sensing, [[paleoethnobotanical]] research, the Southeast Asian maritime trade, and heritage management and antiquities legislation.
* [[Survey (archaeology)|Archaeological fieldwork]] across eastern Asia. ICEAACH staff have excavated a 20,000-year-old cave in China with the world’s oldest pottery, and are searching for sites on the [[Yangzi River]] of the first [[rice farmer]]s. The ICEAACH is home to a project exploring the roots of the [[Shang Dynasty]] on the great flood plain of the [[Yellow River]], and discovering the lost Bronze Age [[Sanxingdui|city of Song]]. ICEAACH students have done fieldwork in [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/ |title=Research » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ARC/Base bibliographic database project: ICEAACH is advancing research across the field through our development of the international, collaborative ARC/Base, a new comprehensive, web-based, [[multilingual]] [[bibliographic database]] of Asian archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/arcbase/ |title=The ARC/Base Project » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scholarly communication and the broad dissemination of research results through publications, conferences, and lectures, including the East Asian Archaeology Forum seminar series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/news/east-asian-archaeology-forum-eaaf-lecture-series/ |title=East Asian Archaeology Forum (EAAF) Lecture Series » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Visiting Scholar programs: ICEAACH hosts leading researchers and graduate students from across Asia who come to the center for long- and short-term stays. ICEAACH library facilities and the strength of our department in [[cultural heritage]] management are major draws, as are collaborations with ICEAACH staff and other Archaeology Department faculty and students.
* [[Public outreach]] programs serving a wide range of museum educators, K-12 school teachers, members of the media, and other groups to promote education and awareness about East Asia’s archaeology and cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/educational-resources/ |title=Educational Resources » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book and Journal Exchange Program: ICEAACH sends thousands of books and journals on Western archaeology and related fields to academic institutions across Asia who do not have the resources to acquire such items themselves. We also receive in exchange research materials that are difficult to find elsewhere outside of Asia.

'''Jacques Martin Barzun''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑr|z|uː|n}}; November 30, 1907{{snd}}October 25, 2012) was a French-American [[historian]] known for his studies of the [[history of ideas]] and [[cultural history]]. He wrote about a wide range of subjects, including baseball, mystery novels, and classical music, and was also known as a [[philosophy of education|philosopher of education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/arts/jacques-barzun-historian-and-scholar-dies-at-104.html |title=Jacques Barzun Dies at 104; Cultural Critic Saw the Sun Setting on the West |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Edward Rothstein |date=October 25, 2012  |accessdate=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Teacher in America'' (1945), Barzun influenced the training of schoolteachers in the United States.

He published more than forty books, was awarded the American [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], and was dubbed a knight of the [[French Legion of Honor]]. The historical retrospective ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present'' (2000), widely considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', was published when he was 93 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 26, 2012 |title=Jacques Barzun: An Appreciation |first=Joseph |last=Epstein |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204598504578080902026564368?mod=googlenews_wsj }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Jacques Martin Barzun was born in [[Créteil]], France, to Henri-Martin and Anna-Rose Barzun, and spent his childhood in [[Paris]] and [[Grenoble]]. His father was a member of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] group of artists and writers, and also worked in the [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Labor]].&lt;ref name=gathman&gt;{{cite news| first= Roger |last= Gathman| url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=78886 | title= The Man Who Knew Too Much: Jacques Barzun, Idea Man | work= [[The Austin Chronicle]] |date= October 13, 2000 |accessdate= September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents' Paris home was frequented by many [[Modernism|modernist]] artists of ''[[Belle Époque]]'' France, such as the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], the [[Cubist]] painters [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], the composer [[Edgard Varèse]], and the writers [[Richard Aldington]] and [[Stefan Zweig]].&lt;ref name=gathman /&gt;

While on a diplomatic mission to the United States during the [[First World War]] (1914–18), Barzun's father so liked the country he decided that his son should receive an American [[university education]]; thus, the twelve-year-old Jacques Martin attended a [[university-preparatory school]], then [[Columbia University]], where he obtained a [[liberal arts education]].

As an undergraduate at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], Barzun was drama critic for the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', a prize-winning president of the [[Philolexian Society]], the Columbia literary and debate club, and [[valedictorian]] of the class of 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jan06/cover.php |title=COVER STORY, Living Legacies: Jacques Barzun ’27 | author =[[Thomas Vinciguerra]]|work=[[Columbia College Today]] |publisher=College.columbia.edu |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate= October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1932 and taught history there from 1928 to 1955, becoming the [[Seth Low]] Professor of History and a founder of the discipline of [[cultural history]]. For years, he and [[literary criticism|literary critic]] [[Lionel Trilling]] conducted Columbia's famous [[Great Books]] course. He was elected Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B| url= http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf |publisher= [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]| accessdate=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1955 to 1968, he served as Dean of the Graduate School, Dean of Faculties, and [[Provost (education)|Provost]], while also being an Extraordinary Fellow of [[Churchill College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. From 1968 until his 1975 retirement, he was University Professor at Columbia. From 1951 to 1963 Barzun was one of the managing editors of [[The Readers' Subscription Book Club]], and its successor the [[Mid-Century Book Society]] (the other managing editors being [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Lionel Trilling]]), and afterwards was Literary Adviser to [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], 1975 to 1993.

In 1936, Barzun married Mariana Lowell, a violinist from a [[Lowell family|prominent Boston family]]. They had three children: James, Roger, and Isabel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862171-8,00.html | title=Education: Parnassus, Coast to Coast | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=June 11, 1956 | accessdate= November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariana died in 1979. In 1980, Barzun married Marguerite Lee Davenport. From 1996 the Barzuns lived in her hometown, [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. His granddaughter [[Lucy Barzun Donnelly]] was a producer of the award-winning [[HBO]] film ''[[Grey Gardens (HBO film)|Grey Gardens]]''. His grandson, [[Matthew Barzun]], is a businessman who served from 2009-2011 as the [[United States Ambassador to Sweden|U.S. Ambassador to Sweden]], and in 2013 was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. On May 14, 2012 Jacques Barzun attended a symphony performance in his honor at which works by his favorite composer, [[Hector Berlioz]], were performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Deborah | last= Martin | url= http://www.mysanantonio.com/life/article/In-the-Spotlight-Honoring-expert-on-Berlioz-3557449.php | title= In the Spotlight: Honoring expert on Berlioz| work= [[San Antonio Express-News]]| date= May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended in a wheelchair and delivered a brief address to the crowd.

Barzun died peacefully at his home in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]] on October 25, 2012, aged 104. ''[[The New York Times]]'', which compared him with such scholars as [[Sidney Hook]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[Lionel Trilling]], called him a "distinguished historian, essayist, cultural gadfly and educator who helped establish the modern discipline of cultural history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Barzun Dies at 104; Cultural Critic Saw the Sun Setting on the West |newspaper=New York Times |first=Edward |last=Rothstein | authorlink = Edward Rothstein|date=October 25, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/arts/jacques-barzun-historian-and-scholar-dies-at-104.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naming [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] as his intellectual ancestors, and calling him "one of the West's most eminent historians of culture" and "a champion of the liberal arts tradition in higher education," who "deplored what he called the 'gangrene of specialism'", ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' remarked, "The sheer scope of his knowledge was extraordinary. Barzun’s eye roamed over the full spectrum of Western music, art, literature and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Barzun |date=October 26, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9636970/Jacques-Barzun.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist [[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]], remembering him in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "flawless and magisterial" writer who tackled "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[William James]], [[French verse]], [[English literature|English]] [[prose]] composition, university teaching, [[detective fiction]], [and] the state of intellectual life", described Barzun as a tall, handsome man with an understated elegance, thoroughly Americanized, but retaining an air of old-world culture, cosmopolitan in  an elegant way rare for intellectuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Barzun: An Appreciation |first=Joseph |last=Epstein |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204598504578080902026564368 |date=October 26, 2012 }}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Over seven decades, Barzun wrote and edited more than forty books touching on an unusually broad range of subjects, including [[science]] and [[medicine]], [[psychiatry]] from [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] through [[William James]] to modern methods, and [[art]], and [[European classical music|classical music]]; he was one of the all-time authorities on [[Hector Berlioz]]. Some of his books—particularly ''Teacher in America'' and ''The House of Intellect''—enjoyed a substantial lay readership and influenced debate about culture and education far beyond the realm of academic history. Barzun had a strong interest in the tools and mechanics of writing and [[research]]. He undertook the task of completing, from a manuscript almost two-thirds of which was in first draft at the author's death, and editing (with the help of six other people), the first edition (published 1966) of ''[[Follett's Modern American Usage]]''. Barzun was also the author of books on [[literary genre|literary style]] (''Simple and Direct'', 1975), on the crafts of [[editing]] and [[publishing]] (''On Writing, Editing, and Publishing'', 1971), and on [[research methods]] in [[history]] and the other [[humanities]] (''The Modern Researcher'', which has seen at least six editions).

Barzun did not disdain popular culture: his varied interests included [[detective fiction]] and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name="baseball"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/212819-when-baseballs-best-cultural-critic-turned-his-back-on-the-game |title=Jacques Barzun, "Baseball's Best Cultural Critic", Turns His Back on the Game |publisher=bleacherreport.com |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His widely quoted statement, "Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball." was inscribed on a plaque at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jacques Barzun, wide-ranging cultural historian, dies at 104 |first=Joe |last=Holley |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 26, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jacques-barzun-wide-ranging-cultural-historian-dies-at-104/2012/10/26/33a202c4-c5da-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited and wrote the introduction to the 1961 anthology, ''The Delights of Detection'', which included stories by [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Rex Stout]], and others.  In 1971, Barzun co-authored (with Wendell Hertig Taylor), ''[[A Catalogue of Crime]]: Being a Reader's Guide to the Literature of Mystery, Detection, &amp; Related Genres'', for which he and his co-author received a Special [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theedgars.com/awards/ |title=Search the Edgars Database |publisher=[[Mystery Writers of America]] |access-date=2015-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzun was also an advocate
of [[supernatural fiction]], and wrote the introduction to ''[[The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Author and teacher Jacques Barzun has written an authoritative introduction". B. Williams, "A Complete Guide for all lovers
of horror" (Review of ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural''. ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', January 31, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barzun was a proponent of the theatre critic and diarist [[James Agate]], whom he compared in stature to [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref&gt;''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present'', Jacques Barzun, Harper Perennial, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barzun edited Agate's last two diaries into a new edition in 1951 and wrote an informative introductory essay, "Agate and His Nine Egos".&lt;ref&gt;''The Later Ego. Consisting of Ego 8 and Ego 9. Introduction and notes by Jacques Barzun'', Jacques Barzun, Crown Publishers, Inc., New York, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:From Dawn to Decadence.JPG|thumb|right|175px|''From Dawn to Decadence'' by Jacques Barzun]]
Jacques Barzun continued to write on education and cultural history after retiring from Columbia. At 84 years of age, he began writing his [[swan song]], to which he devoted the better part of the 1990s. The resulting book of more than 800 pages, ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present'', revealed a vast erudition and brilliance undimmed by advanced age. Historians, literary critics, and popular reviewers all lauded ''From Dawn to Decadence'' as a sweeping and powerful survey of modern Western history, and it became a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestseller. With this work he gained an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', which said "il a connu un rayonnement international avec la sortie de "From dawn to decadence". L'historien Jacques Barzun, auteur de "From dawn to decandence", est mort
Créé le October 26, 2012 à 07h10, http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/monde/20121026.FAP2051/l-historien-jacques-barzun-auteur-de-from-dawn-to-decandence-est-mort.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The book introduces several novel [[typographic]] devices that aid an unusually rich system of cross-referencing and help keep many strands of thought in the book under organized control. Most pages feature a [[sidebar (publishing)|sidebar]] containing a pithy quotation, usually little known, and often surprising or humorous, from some author or historical figure. In 2007, Barzun commented that "Old age is like learning a new profession. And not one of your own choosing."&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Reason'' by [[Arthur Krystal]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 22, 2007, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; As late as October 2011, one month before his 104th birthday, he reviewed [[Adam Kirsch]]'s ''Why Trilling Matters'' for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, Jacques. [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204777904576651120765955328 "Book Review: Why Trilling Matters" (Review)]. ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', October 29, 2011. Retrieved on July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his philosophy of writing history, Barzun emphasized the role of storytelling over the use of academic jargon and detached analysis. He concluded in ''From Dawn to Decadence'' that "history cannot be a science; it is the very opposite, in that its interest resides in the particulars.".&lt;ref&gt;''From Dawn to Decadence'', pp 654–656&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 1968, Barzun received the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the Saint Louis Literary Award |work= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barzun was appointed a Chevalier of the National Order of the [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;Krystal, Arthur, "Age of Reason: In his hundred years, Jacques Barzun has learned a thing or two." ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[George W. Bush]].

In 1993, his book "An Essay on French Verse: For Readers of English Poetry" won the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s Melville Cane Poetry Award.

On October 18, 2007, he received the 59th Great Teacher Award of the Society of Columbia Graduates ''[[award in absentia|in absentia]]''.

On March 2, 2011, Barzun was awarded the 2010 [[National Humanities Medal]] by President [[Barack Obama]], although he was not expected to be in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/01/president-obama-award-2010-national-medal-arts-and-national-humanities-m |title=President Obama to Award 2010 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20110301.html |title=News Archive &amp;#124; National Endowment for the Humanities |publisher=Neh.gov |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2011, he received the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement ''in absentia''.

The [[American Philosophical Society]] honors Barzun with its Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History, awarded annually since 1993 to the author of a recent distinguished work of cultural history. He also received the Gold Medal for Criticism from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], of which he was twice president.

Epstein's removal as editor of ''The American Scholar'' in 1998 (following a 1996 vote of the Phi Beta Kappa senate) was controversial.&lt;ref name="Grenier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grenier|first1=Cynthia|title=Conservatives on the Move|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58329701.html|website=Highbeam|date=3 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein later said that he was fired "for being insufficiently correct politically".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Joshua|title=Uncle Joe the Exquisite|url=http://forward.com/culture/11682/uncle-joe-the-exquisite/|website=Forward|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some within Phi Beta Kappa attributed the senate's decision to a desire to attract a younger readership for the journal.&lt;ref name="Mahler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahler|first1=Jonathan|title=Fresh Vision for an Intellectual Journal: Diversity, Brevity, Even a Cover Picture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/fresh-vision-for-an-intellectual-journal-diversity-brevity-even-a-cover-picture.html|website=The New York Times|date=28 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epstein's essay "Who Killed Poetry?", published in ''Commentary'' in 1988,&lt;ref name="Poetry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Joseph|title=Who Killed Poetry?|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/who-killed-poetry/|website=Commentary|date=1988-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated discussion in the literary community decades after its publication.&lt;ref name="Novak"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novak|first1=David|title=The Man Who Killed Poetry: Joseph Epstein And His Essays  – Contemporary Poetry Review|url=http://www.cprw.com/the-man-who-killed-poetry-joseph-epstein-and-his-essays|website=www.cprw.com|date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1970, ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' published an article by Epstein called "Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity"&lt;ref&gt;[http://mudcub.com/homophobia/ Joseph Epstein, ''Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity'', Harper’s Magazine, September 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; that was criticized for its perceived [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name="GrossWoods"&gt;Larry P. Gross &amp; James D. Woods, ''The Columbia Reader on Lesbians and Gay Men in Media, Society, and Politics'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 1999), {{ISBN|978-0231104463}}, p. 595.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=me8646aJwGAC&amp;lpg=PT142 Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Gay activists characterized the essay as portraying every gay man the author met, or fantasized about meeting, as predatory, sex-obsessed, and a threat to civilization.&lt;ref name="Ehrenstein"&gt;{{cite news|author=David Ehrenstein|url=http://ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/epstein.html |title=Sexual Snobbery: The Texture of Joseph Epstein|work=LA Weekly|date=August 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, he says that, if possible, "I would wish homosexuality off the face of the earth", a statement that was interpreted by gay writer and editor [[Merle Miller]] as a call to [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=thenewyorker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/merle-miller-and-the-piece-that-launched-a-thousand-it-gets-better-videos|title=Merle Miller and the Piece That Launched a Thousand "It Gets Better" Videos|website=The New Yorker|author=Emily Greenhouse|date=11 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[sit-in]] took place at ''Harper's'' by members of the [[Gay Activists Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry P.

In 2015 Epstein wrote an article for ''The Weekly Standard'' in which he mentioned the ''Harper's'' article from 1970. He wrote, "I am pleased the tolerance for homosexuality has widened in America and elsewhere, that in some respects my own aesthetic sensibility favors much homosexual artistic production... My only hope now is that, on my gravestone, the words Noted Homophobe aren’t carved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Joseph Epstein |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/unassailable-virtue-victims_941011.html?page=3 |title=The Unassailable Virtue of Victims: On the rise of Hillary Clinton and other underdogs |work=The Weekly Standard |date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Claude Summers, "Author Fears 'Noted Homophobe' Will Be Carved on His Gravestone" "The New Civil Rights Movement," 17 July 2016: |url=http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/claude_summers/the_sad_case_of_joseph_epstein?recruiter_id=833168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ideal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Joseph |title=The Ideal of Culture |date=2018 |publisher=Axios Press |location=Edinburg, Virginia |isbn=978-1-60419-123-3 |page=112 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William F. Buckley Jr.]], in his review of ''Snobbery: The American Version'', called Epstein "perhaps the wittiest writer (working in his genre) alive, the funniest since [[Randall Jarrell]]."&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckley|first1=William F.|title=Who's he?|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/snobbery-buckley-1924|website=www.newcriterion.com|date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for ''[[The Forward]]'' called him "perhaps the smartest American alive who also writes well."&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

==Virtucrat==
Epstein invented the word "virtucrat" and first used it in an article for ''The New York Times Magazine''.&lt;ref name="Wind Sprints"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Joseph|title=Wind Sprints|date=2016|publisher=Axios Press|location=Edinburg, VA|isbn=978-160419-100-4|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined a virtucrat as "any man or woman who is certain that his or her political views are not merely correct but deeply, morally righteous in the bargain."&lt;ref name=Snobbery&gt;{{cite book |title=Snobbery: The American Version |author=Joseph Epstein |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2016 essay collection ''Wind Sprints'', he defines it as a person "whose politics lend them the fine sense of elation that only false virtue makes possible."&lt;ref name="Wind Sprints" /&gt;

'''Lauren Berlant''' (born 1957) is the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], where she has been teaching since 1984. Berlant received her PhD from [[Cornell University]]. She writes and teaches on issues of intimacy and belonging in [[popular culture]], in relation to the history and fantasy of [[citizenship]].

She writes on [[public sphere]]s as affect worlds, where [[Affect theory|affect]] and emotion lead the way for belonging ahead of the modes of rational or deliberative thought. These attach strangers to each other and shape the terms of the state-civil society relation.

==Works==
Berlant is the author of a national sentimentality trilogy beginning with ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226043770 The Anatomy of National Fantasy:  Hawthorne, Utopia, and Everyday Life]'' (1991), which looks at the relation between modes of belonging mediated by the state and the law, modes of belonging mediated by the aesthetic, and especially by genre, and modes that grow from within the everyday life of social relations.

''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0822319241 The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and Citizenship]''—the title essay of which won the 1993 Norman Foerster Award for best essay of the year in American Literature—introduced the idea of the “intimate public sphere,”  looks at the production of politics and publicness since the Reagan era by way of the circulation of the personal, the sexual, and the intimate. Her following book, ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0822342022 The Female Complaint: On the Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture]'' was published by Duke University Press in 2008. There, the origin of intimate publics in the mass cultural phenomenon of “women’s culture," which crosses over the everyday institutions of intimacy, mass society, and, more distantly and ambivalently, politics, is pursued through readings especially of remade movies, such as Show Boat, Imitation of Life, and Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

Her newest monograph, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/Cruel-Optimism/ Cruel Optimism]'', was published in October, 2011, by Duke University Press.  This book works across the U.S. and Europe to assess the level of contemporary crisis as [[neoliberalism]] wears away the fantasies of upward mobility associated with the liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berlant|first=Lauren|title=University of Chicago Department of English Language and Literature - Faculty|url=http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/berlant|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cruel optimism manifests as a relational dynamic which individuals create attachment as “clusters of promises” towards desired object-ideas even when they inhibit the conditions for flourishing and fulfilling such promises. Maintaining attachments that sustain the good life fantasy, no matter how injurious or cruel these attachments may be, allows people to make it through day-to-day life when the day-to-day has become unlivable.&lt;ref name="acReview"&gt;http://academicspeak.blogspot.com/2012/07/theory-review-lauren-berlants-cruel.html&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborating on the specific dynamics of cruel optimism, Lauren Berlant emphasizes and maintains that it is not the object itself, but rather the relationship: "A relation of cruel optimism is a double-bind in which your attachment to an object sustains you in life at the same time as that object is actually a threat to your flourishing. So you can’t say that there are objects that have the quality of cruelty or not cruelty, it’s how you have the relationship to them. Like it might be that being in a couple is not a relation of cruel optimism for you, because being in a couple actually makes you feel like you have a grounding in the world, whereas for other people, being in a couple might be, on the one hand, a relief from loneliness, and on the other hand, the overpresence of one person who has to bear the burden of satisfying all your needs. So it’s not the object that’s the problem, but how we learn to be in relation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berlant|first=Lauren|title=Interview With Lauren Berlant|url=http://societyandspace.com/material/interviews/interview-with-lauren-berlant/|publisher=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|accessdate=1 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202210157/http://societyandspace.com/material/interviews/interview-with-lauren-berlant/|archivedate=2 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emphasis on the “present,” which she describes as structured through “crisis ordinariness,” turns to affect and aesthetics as a way of apprehending these crises. She suggests that it becomes possible to recognize that certain “genres” are no longer sustainable in the present and that new emergent aesthetic forms are taking hold, alternative genres that allow us to recognize modes of living not rooted in normative good life fantasies.&lt;ref name="acReview" /&gt; Discussing crisis ordinariness, Berlant describes it as her way "... of talking about traumas
of the social that are lived through collectively and that transform the sensorium to a heightened perceptiveness about the unfolding of the historical, and sometimes historic, moment (and sometimes publics organized around those senses, when experienced collectively)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berlant|first=Lauren|title=Thinking about feeling historical|url=http://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/politicalfeeling/files/2009/01/berlant-thinking-about-feeling.pdf|work=Article|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a member of [[Feel Tank Chicago]] and on the way has edited books on Compassion (2004) and Intimacy (2001), which won an award for being the best special issue among all journals in the same year from the Academy of American Publishers, and which are interlinked with her work in feminist and [[queer theory]] in essays like "Sex in Public" (''Critical Inquiry'' (1999)), ''Our Monica, Ourselves:  Clinton and the Affairs of State'' (with Lisa Duggan, 2001) and ''Venus Inferred'' (with photographer [[Laura Letinsky]], 2001). Berlant works with many journals, including as editor of ''Critical Inquiry'' and [[Public Culture]], and helped to found and has chaired the Center for Gender Studies at the University of Chicago.

A '''law review''' (or '''law journal''') is a [[scholarly journal]] focusing on legal issues. Law reviews are a type of [[legal periodical]].&lt;ref&gt;William H. Putman and Jennifer Albright. "II. Legal periodicals". ''Legal Research''. Third Edition. Cengage Learning. 2015. Pages [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tuXKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 241] to 243 et seq. ''Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing''. Fourth Edition. 2018. Pages 193 and [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gEQqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage 194] et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, law reviews are normally published by an organization of students at a [[law school]] or through a [[bar association]]. Outside North America, law reviews are usually edited by senior academics/faculty.

Law reviews should not be confused with non-scholarly publications such as the ''[[New York Law Journal]]'' or ''[[The American Lawyer]]'', which are independent, professional newspapers and news-magazines that cover the daily practice of law.

==Overview==
The primary function of a law review is to publish scholarship in the field of law. Law reviews publish lengthy, comprehensive treatments of subjects ("articles"), generally written by [[law professor]]s, judges, or legal practitioners, as well as shorter pieces, commonly called "notes" and "comments," written by [[law student]] "members" of the law review.

Law review articles often express the thinking of specialists or experts with regard to problems with current law and potential solutions to those problems. Historically, law review articles have been influential in the development of the law; they have been frequently cited as persuasive authority by the courts in the United States.  For example, Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] of the [[Supreme Court of California]] admitted that he got the idea for [[market share liability]] from the ''[[Fordham Law Review]]'' comment cited extensively in the court's landmark decision in ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Stanley Mosk, Oral History Interview (Berkeley: California State Archives Regional Oral History Office, 1998), 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years, some have claimed that the traditional influence of law reviews is declining.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Liptak]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/us/19bar.html When Rendering Decisions, Judges Are Finding Law Reviews Irrelevant]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 19 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major American law schools publish a law review (or "law journal"), generally dealing with all areas of law and named after the school, and some publish specialized reviews, dealing with a particular area of the law, in addition to or in place of the general law review, such as [[civil rights and civil liberties]], [[international law]], [[environmental law]], or human rights. There are also a small number of journals focusing on statutory, regulatory, and public policy issues. See [[List of law reviews in the United States]] for details.

In recent years, many law reviews have started to publish online-only content in addition to their respective print issues. They offer freely available pieces of short-form legal scholarship, analysis, and commentary. Further, some law journals have abandoned print entirely, instead choosing to publish all of their content only on the Internet.

==Editorial staff==

=== United States ===
{{Main category|American law journals}}
In the United States, law reviews are typically edited by a certain percentage of the top students in the class or students who are selected to join after successfully completing a “write on competition” at the end of their first year of law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/about-us/membership-selection/ |title=Membership Selection, Fordham Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; As law professor [[Erwin N. Griswold]] wrote of the ''Harvard Law Review'': "Some people are concerned that a major legal periodical in the United States is edited and managed by students. It is an unusual situation, but it started that way, and it developed mightily from its own strength".&lt;ref&gt;Erwin N. Griswold, [http://www.harvardlawreview.org/Centennial.shtml "The ''Harvard Law Review''&amp;nbsp;– Glimpses of Its History as Seen by an Aficionado"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301000748/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/Centennial.shtml |date=1 March 2005 }} (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, the [[American Bar Association]] followed suit and began coordinating its own practitioner journals with law schools, courting student editorial bodies for publications including ''[[Administrative Law Review]]'', ''[[The International Lawyer]]'', ''[[Public Contract Law Journal]]'', and ''[[The Urban Lawyer]]''. Despite Griswold's confidence in student editors, criticism of this practice continues. In 2004, Judge [[Richard Posner]] wrote a critical account entitled "Against the Law Reviews" in the magazine ''Legal Affairs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2004/review_posner_novdec04.msp|title=Legal Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Posner also wrote that his own time as president of the ''Harvard Law Review'' represented a "Golden Age ... for student-edited law reviews".&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A., "The Future of the Student-Edited Law Review" in Stan. L. Rev. Vol. 47, No. 6, (1995): 1133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main category|Canadian law journals}}
In Canada, the fully student-run law reviews (without a Faculty editor-in-chief) include, in order of the frequency they are cited by the Supreme Court of Canada: the ''[[McGill Law Journal]]/Revue de droit de McGill'', the ''[[Queen's Law Journal]]'', the ''[[Alberta Law Review]]'', ''[[University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Ottawa Law Review]]'', and the ''[[University of British Columbia Law Review]]''. Membership requires demanding time commitments, and many editors move on to top clerkships, top articling or first year associate positions both inside and outside Canada, or eventually join the legal professoriate in Canada. The country also has several specialized publications run entirely by students.

=== Europe ===
{{Main category|German law journals}}
Outside North America, student-run law reviews are the exception rather than the norm. In Continental Europe law reviews are almost uniformly edited by academics. However, a small number of student-edited law reviews have recently sprung into existence in Germany (''Ad Legendum'', ''Bucerius Law Journal'', ''Freilaw Freiburg Law Students Journal'', ''[[Goettingen Journal of International Law]]'', ''Hanse Law Review'', [[Heidelberg Law Review]], ''Marburg Law Review''), the Netherlands (''[[Groningen Journal of International Law]]'') and the Czech Republic (''Common Law Review''). Two student-run publications have also been established in Italy: ''[[Bocconi Legal Papers]]'', adopting the format of a working paper series, as a way to complement&amp;nbsp;– rather than compete with&amp;nbsp;– peer-reviewed publications and offer scholars an additional round of feedback;&lt;ref&gt;Longobardi, F. &amp; Russi, L. (2009), [http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=11&amp;artID=1152 A Tiny Heart Beating: Student-Edited Legal Periodicals in Good Ol' Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603231151/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/index.php?pageID=11&amp;artID=1152 |date=3 June 2011 }}, ''German Law Journal'' 10:7&lt;/ref&gt; ''University of Bologna Law Review'', a double-blind peer reviewed law journal, run by University of Bologna, School of Law students, which follows The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bolognalawreview.unibo.it|title=University of Bologna Law Review|author=|publisher=Bolognalawreview.unibo.it|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Belgium ====

In Belgium, the oldest and most prominent student-edited law review is ''[[Jura Falconis]]''. It was founded by a group of students from the Law Faculty of the ''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]'' who, in 1964, conceived the idea of producing their own law journal grafted on the famous American law reviews. Since then, ''Jura Falconis'' has grown into a very solid and most unusual value in the Belgian legal literature.

==== France ====
The leading law reviews in France are those of [[Dalloz]] and LexisNexis.

==== United Kingdom ====
{{Main category|British law journals}}
Within the United Kingdom, as in much of the Commonwealth outside North America (a notable exception being Australia), all of the leading law reviews are edited and run by academics. The leading law reviews in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth more generally are the ''[[Law Quarterly Review]]'' (first published 1885),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/Catalogue/ProductDetails.aspx?recordid=473 Official website of LQR]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Modern Law Review]]'' (first published 1937),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernlawreview.org.uk Official website of MLR]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Cambridge Law Journal]]'' (first published 1973),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-law-journal Official website of CLJ]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford Journal of Legal Studies]]'' (first published 1981)&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/ojls Official website of OJLS]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legal Studies (law journal)|Legal Studies]] (first published 1981).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1748-121X Official website of Legal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bracton Law Journal'' (now ''[[Exeter Law Review]]'') was the first student-run law review when it began publishing in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.heinonline.org/titles/Law-Journal-Library/Bracton-Law-Journal/?letter=B|title=Bracton Law Journal {{!}} HeinOnline|website=home.heinonline.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/law/study/exeterlawreview/|title=Exeter Law Review  {{!}} Law School {{!}} University of Exeter|website=socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the ''Birkbeck Law Review'', ''Bristol Law Review'', ''Cambridge International Law Journal'', ''Cambridge Student Law Review'', ''Dundee Student Law Review'', ''Durham Law Review'', ''Edinburgh Student Law Review'', ''Warwick Student Law Review'', ''Southampton Student Law Review'', ''Strathclyde Law Review'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/lawschool/strathclydelawreview/]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''UCL Human Rights Review'' and the ''Student Journal of Law'' have also emerged.

==== Italy ====
The ''[[Trento Student Law Review]]''&lt;ref name="Trento Student Law Review"&gt;[http://hosting.unitn.it/ojs/web2/index.php/TheTSLR/index The Trento Student Law Review]&lt;/ref&gt; is a student-run law review based in Trento, Italy. Established in 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmagazine.unitn.it/news/giurisprudenza/27419/trento-student-law-review-rivista-giuridica-degli-studenti-della-facolt-di]&lt;/ref&gt;, it published its first issue, titled "Number Zero", in January 2018.&lt;ref name="Number Zero"&gt;http://hosting.unitn.it/ojs/web2/index.php/TheTSLR/issue/view/5]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bocconi Legal Papers]]'' is a student-edited law journal in Italy. It is a project sponsored by [[Bocconi School of Law]] and is published by a group of students belonging to the same institution, under the supervision of several faculty advisors.

The ''[[University of Bologna Law Review]]''&lt;ref name="University of Bologna Law Review"&gt;[http://bolognalawreview.unibo.it The University of Bologna Law Review]&lt;/ref&gt;  is a student-run law journal published by the Department of Legal Studies of the [[University of Bologna]], and officially sponsored by [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP]] and the International Chamber of Commerce - Italy. Its editorial board is composed of more than 150 members, including students, scholars, and professionals from all over the world.

The leading student law reviews are the ''Dublin City University Law Review'', the ''[[Trinity College Law Review]]'', the ''[[UCD Law Review]]'', the ''Irish Student Law Review'' and the ''Cork Online Law Review''.

==== Nordic countries ====
In Iceland, ''Úlfljótur Law Review'', has been in publication since 1947. In 2007 it celebrated its 60th anniversary. Since its creation in 1947 it has been edited and run by students at the Department of Law, University of Iceland. ''Úlfljótur Law Review'' is the most senior of all academic journals still in publication at the university and held in great respect by Icelandic jurists and legal scholars.

In Finland, ''Helsinki Law Review'', edited by students at the University of Helsinki, has been active since 2007. Earlier, the University of Turku published ''Turku Law Journal'' from 1999 to 2003.

Sweden's first law review is ''Juridisk Publikation''. The first number of ''Juridisk Publikation'' was published in April 2009. It originated as a review by students from Stockholm University. It is now delivered to Swedish law students from all universities, as well as to most legal libraries in the country. ''Juridisk Publikation'' is edited by top students from the law schools in Lund, Stockholm Uppsala and Goteborg. The publication is anonymously peer reviewed by a board of leading Swedish legal practitioners and academics.

In Norway, the first student edited law review ''Jussens Venner'' was founded in 1952 by students Carsten Smith and Torkel Opsahl (both of whom later became distinguished academics). Occasionally it features peer-reviewed articles, but its editors are composed of one student from the Faculty of Law at the University of Oslo and one student from the Faculty of Law at the University of Bergen. Its articles are mainly related to the curriculum at these universities.

=== Argentina ===
In spite of some few exceptions, in Argentina almost all law reviews are run by publishing houses or law professors. In both cases, the involvement of students in the day to day creation of these reviews is fully narrowed. Among these few exceptions, it should be mentioned the case of ''[[Revista Lecciones y Ensayos]]'', a law review ran by students of the School of Law of the [[University of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=index&gt;[http://www.derecho.uba.ar/publicaciones/lye/index.php Revista Lecciones y Ensayos] ''website of the University of Buenos Aires School of Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{Main category|Australian law journals}}
In Australia, the leading student-edited peer-reviewed academic law reviews are the ''[[Melbourne University Law Review]]'', ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'', ''[[Federal Law Review]]'', ''[[Monash University Law Review]]'' and [[UNSW Faculty of Law#Faculty publications|''UNSW Law Journal'']].

The ''Melbourne University Law Review'' regularly outperforms ''Sydney Law Review'' on impact, citation in journal and cases and combined rankings.&lt;ref name="lawlib" /&gt; These publications are among the most-cited law reviews by the High Court of Australia and among the most cited non-US reviews by US journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx |title=Law Journals: Submissions and Ranking |publisher=Lawlib.wlu.edu |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top international law journal in Australia is the ''[[Melbourne Journal of International Law]]'', also a student-edited peer-reviewed academic law review. ''The Melbourne Journal of International Law'' is also considered to be more influential and prestigious than most generalist law reviews in Australia.&lt;ref name="lawlib" /&gt;

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, law reviews are usually run by academics as well, but there are efforts by students to change this; for example: ''University of Brasilia Law Students Review'' (re-established in 2007), the ''Review of the Academic Center Afonso Pena'' from the [[Federal University of Minas Gerais]] (published since 1996), and the ''Alethes Periodic'' from [[Federal University of Juiz de Fora]]. However, academics and official rankings usually refuse to evaluate student law reviews as "equals".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} To pursue academic recognition by the Brazilian Ministry of Education, review bodies must include post-graduated and ranked academics, which prevents student law reviews to even be recognized or compared to other similar legal periodicals.

=== China ===

In China, there are law reviews run by academics, as well as law reviews run by students.

The ''China Law Journal'' is an attempt to create a legal publication, that is produced from all groups related to law, including lawyers, academics, students, members of the judiciary, procurators and anyone else in related fields with an interest in China.&lt;ref name="lawlib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinalawjournal.org|title=China Law Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Main category|Indian law journals}}
Among academic law journals in India, the ''Journal of Indian Law Institute'' and the ''Delhi Law Review'' published by the Faculty of Law, [[University of Delhi]] since 1972 are most prominent and respected among Indian legal scholars and academicians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} National Law Schools/Universities are now leading the law review publication field,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} with notable reviews{{According to whom|date=April 2011}} being the ''[[Nalsar University of Law|NALSAR Student Law Review]]'' and the ''[[National Law School of India Review]]'' and lawbright, eJournal.

=== Mexico ===
The ''[[Mexican Law Review]]'', the law review of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], Mexico's preeminent university, is edited by professors and is therefore a closer cousin to peer-reviewed social science journals than to typical student-run law journals.

== Online legal research providers ==
Online legal research providers such as [[Westlaw]] and [[LexisNexis]] give users access to the complete text of most law reviews published beginning from the late 1980s. Another such service, [[Heinonline]], provides actual scans of the pages of law reviews going back to the 1850s.

==Student activity==
Membership on the law review staff is highly sought after by some law students, as it often has a significant impact on their subsequent careers as attorneys. Many [[U.S. federal judges]] and partners at the most prestigious [[law firms]] were members or editors of their school's law review. There are a number of reasons why journal membership is desired by some students:
* Some see the intense writing, research and editing experience as invaluable to the student's development as an attorney;
* Others see the selection process as helping differentiate the best and the brightest from an already strong group of law students.
At schools with more than one law review, membership on the main or flagship journal is normally considered more prestigious than membership on a specialty law journal. This is not the case at all schools, however. At many schools, the more prestigious journal is the specialty journal; a low-ranked general journal will rarely attract as much attention as a category-leading specialized journal. Often the best indicator is the age of the journal; a newer journal will rarely have the same clout with employers that the older journal has, even when the older journal is specialized. In any case, membership on any such journal is a valuable credential when searching out employment after law school.

The paths to membership vary from law school to law school, and also from journal to journal, but generally contain a few of the same basic elements. Most law reviews select members after their first year of studies either through a writing competition (often referred to as "writing on" to the law review), their first-year grades (referred to as "grading on" to the law review) or some combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Wes Henricksen, ''[http://www.cap-press.com/books/1826 Making Law Review: The Expert's Guide to Mastering the Write-On Competition]'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Most Canadian law reviews, however, do not take grades into considerations and cannot be submitted with the application. A number of schools will also grant membership to students who independently submit a publishable article. The write-on competition usually requires applicants to compose a written analysis of a specific legal topic, often a recent Supreme Court decision. The written submissions are often of a set length, and applicants are sometimes provided with some or all of the background research. Submissions normally are graded blindly, with submissions identified only by a number which the graders will not be able to connect to a particular applicant. A student who has been selected for law review membership is said to have "made the law review."

Secondary journals vary widely in their membership process. For example, at [[Yale Law School]], the only one of its nine journals that has a competitive membership process is the flagship ''Yale Law Journal''&amp;nbsp;– all others are open to any Yale Law student who wishes to join. By contrast, other secondary journals may have their own separate membership competition, or may hold a joint competition with the main law review.

A law review's membership is normally divided into staff members and editors. On most law reviews, all 2Ls (second-year students) are staff members while some or all 3Ls (third-year students) serve as editors. 3Ls also typically fill the senior editorial staff positions, including senior articles editor, senior note &amp; comment editor, senior managing editor, and, the most prestigious of all, editor-in-chief of the law review. (Upon graduation, the editor-in-chief of the law review can often expect to be highly recruited by the most prestigious law firms.) As members, students are normally expected to:
* Write a note or comment of publishable quality (although it need not actually be published), and to
* Edit and [[case citation|cite-check]] the articles that are being published by the law review, ensuring that references support what the author claims they support and that footnotes are in proper ''[[Bluebook]]'' format, depending on the publication's preference.
The editorial staff is normally responsible for reviewing and selecting articles for publication, managing the editing process, and assisting members in writing their notes and comments. Depending on the law school, students may receive academic credit for their work on the law review, although some journals are entirely extracurricular.

==History of law reviews==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3468">The '''League of Communists''' or '''Communist League''' ({{lang-fi|Kommunistien Liitto}}) is a Finnish [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] political organization. The League of Communists was founded in 14.9.2002 by the Communists who were expelled from the [[For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party]] (KTP). The organization was at first known as, plainly, ''Communists'' (Kommunistit) but the name was changed to its current form during the registration process.

The dispute in the KTP arose as part of its Central Committee wished the party would join a new electoral alliance party ([[Forces for Change in Finland]] [MVS]) in which right-wing organizations were also participating. The majority led by chairman [[Hannu Harju]] did not approve of this and the Central Committee voted (18-9) against the initiative. The minority, including the Helsinki district organization, the main force behind the project, chose not to respect the decision, and it was expelled. The expelled Helsinki district later participated in the founding of the MVS. Some notable persons among the expelled were [[Heikki Männikkö]] (the party secretary), [[Reijo Katajaranta]] (the editor-in-chief of the KTP organ) and [[Pekka Tiainen]] (the 1994 presidential candidate). In 2005, the (former) Turku district organization of the KTP joined the League of Communists.
Both parties adhere to traditional orthodox [[Marxism-Leninism]] and support, for example,  [[North Korea]] as an anti-imperialist bastion. The KTP has, however, chosen not to cooperate with their former comrades who they regard as revisionist traitors. The League of Communists has had to find their allies elsewhere. The MVS was no success and after the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|general elections of 2003]] the league has collaborated with several organizations, like the [[Communist Party of Finland (Unity)|Communist Party of Finland]] (SKP) on whose list the League of Communists candidates stood in the elections to European Parliament in 2004. The only elected local councillor of the league, [[Antti Siika-Aho]], stood (in 2004) as a [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] candidate.

As the new organization was set in motion, a newspaper, called ''[[Kansan Ääni]]'', was also founded. The  [[bimonthly]] paper, the editor-in-chief of which is Reijo Katajaranta, looks very similar to KTP's ''[[Työkansan Sanomat]]''. ''Kansan Ääni'' is also published by two other organizations controlled by members of the League of Communists. These are the [[People's Front Against European Union]] (EUVKr) and [[Work Against War and Fascism]] (SFT), the latter of which was founded after [[World War II]] by former Communist resistance fighters.

Since its beginning the League of Communists has been led by [[Kalevi Wahrman]] whose board includes only men. The organization acts like a political party although it is not officially registered as one, an option which, however, has not been excluded.

[[Russia]] is home to the most inscribed sites with 17 sites, two of which are transborder properties. Seven sites are shared between several countries with some of them located partially in Northern or Western Europe: the [[Curonian Spit]] ([[Lithuania]] and [[Russia]]), [[Caves of Aggtelek Karst and Slovak Karst]] (Slovakia and Hungary), [[Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe]] (Germany, Slovakia, Ukraine, Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain), [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha / Białowieża Forest]] (Poland and Belarus), [[Fertö / Neusiedlersee Cultural Landscape]] (Austria and Hungary), [[Muskauer Park / Park Mużakowski]] (Germany and Poland) and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (ten countries in Northern and Eastern Europe). Moldova has only part of the Struve Geodetic Arc transborder site.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list |title=World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sites from the region were inscribed in 1978, when [[Kraków Old Town|Kraków's Historic Centre]] and the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]], both in Poland were chosen during the list's conception.&lt;ref name="SitebyYear"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;action=stat&amp;mode=table#s4 |title=Number of World Heritage properties inscribed each Year |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origlist"&gt;{{Cite report |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000347/034793eb.pdf |format=PDF |title=Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, Second Session, Final Report |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=5–8 September 1978 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |pp=7&amp;ndash;8 |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, UNESCO's [[World Heritage Committee]] may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage Site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for [[cultural heritage]] (i&amp;ndash;vi) and four for [[natural heritage]] (vii&amp;ndash;x).&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Criteria for Selection |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sites, designated "mixed sites," represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Eastern Europe, there are 69 cultural, 8 natural, and no mixed sites.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/ |title=World Heritage List Nominations |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is [[World Heritage in Danger|endangered]], citing "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List." None of the sites in Eastern Europe is currently listed as endangered; two sites, Wieliczka Salt Mine and the [[Srebarna Nature Reserve]], have formerly been listed as endangered but lost this status subsequently; possible danger listing has been considered by UNESCO in a number of cases.&lt;ref name="dangerlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/ |title=World Heritage in Danger |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/247 |title=Decision – 28COM 15B.75 |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| This is a fine example of a working Orthodox monastery, with military features that are typical of the 15th to the 18th century, the period during which it developed. The main church of the Lavra, the Cathedral of the Assumption (echoing the Kremlin Cathedral of the same name), contains the tomb of Boris Godunov. Among the treasures of the Lavra is the famous icon, The Trinity, by Andrei Rublev.

|The Assumption Cathedral is located in the town-island of Sviyazhsk and is part of the monastery of the same name. Situated at the confluence of the [[Volga]], the [[Sviyaga River|Sviyaga]] and the Shchuka rivers, at the crossroads of the [[Silk road|Silk]] and [[Volga trade route|Volga]] routes, Sviyazhsk was founded by [[Ivan the Terrible]] in 1551.

| The Church of the Ascension was built in 1532 on the imperial estate of Kolomenskoye, near Moscow, to celebrate the birth of the prince who was to become Tsar Ivan IV ('the Terrible'). One of the earliest examples of a traditional wooden tent-roofed church on a stone and brick substructure, it had a great influence on the development of Russian ecclesiastical architecture.

| The Citadel, Ancient City and Fortress Buildings of Derbent were part of the northern lines of the Sasanian Persian Empire, which extended east and west of the Caspian Sea. The fortification was built in stone. It consisted of two parallel walls that formed a barrier from the seashore up to the mountain. The town of Derbent was built between these two walls, and has retained part of its medieval fabric. The site continued to be of great strategic importance until the 19th century.

| The Novodevichy Convent, in south-western Moscow, built in the 16th and 17th centuries in the so-called Moscow Baroque style, was part of a chain of monastic ensembles that were integrated into the defence system of the city. The convent was directly associated with the political, cultural and religious history of Russia, and closely linked to the Moscow Kremlin. It was used by women of the Tsar’s family and the aristocracy. Members of the Tsar’s family and entourage were also buried in its cemetery. The convent provides an example of the highest accomplishments of Russian architecture with rich interiors and an important collection of paintings and artefacts.

|   Situated at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl Rivers some 250&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Moscow, the historic city of Yaroslavl developed into a major commercial centre from the 11th century. It is renowned for its numerous 17th-century churches and is an outstanding example of the urban planning reform Empress Catherine the Great ordered for the whole of Russia in 1763. While keeping some of its significant historic structures, the town was renovated in the neoclassical style on a radial urban master plan. It has also kept elements from the 16th century in the Spassky Monastery, one of the oldest in the Upper Volga region, built on the site of a pagan temple in the late 12th century but reconstructed over time.

Two 18th-century wooden churches, and an octagonal clock tower, also in wood and built in 1862, can be seen there. These unusual constructions, in which carpenters created a bold visionary architecture, perpetuate an ancient model of parish space and are in harmony with the surrounding landscape.

| Toruń has many monuments of architecture beginning from the [[Middle Ages]], including 200 military structures. The city is famous for having preserved almost intact its medieval spatial layout and many Gothic buildings, all built from [[brick]], including monumental churches, the Town Hall and many burgher houses. In 1236, due to frequent flooding, the city was relocated to the present site of the Old Town. In 1264 the nearby New Town was founded. In 1280, the city (or as it was then, both cities) joined the mercantile [[Hanseatic League]], and thus became an important medieval trade centre.

|   The Struve Arc is a chain of survey triangulations stretching from Hammerfest in Norway to the Black Sea, through 10 countries and over 2,820&amp;nbsp;km. These are points of a survey, carried out between 1816 and 1855 by the astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve, which represented the first accurate measuring of a long segment of a meridian. This helped to establish the exact size and shape of the planet and marked an important step in the development of earth sciences and topographic mapping. It is an extraordinary example of scientific collaboration among scientists from different countries, and of collaboration between monarchs for a scientific cause. The original arc consisted of 258 main triangles with 265 main station points. The listed site includes 34 of the original station points, with different markings, i.e. a drilled hole in rock, iron cross, cairns, or built obelisks.

Its subalpine and alpine pastures have only been grazed by wild animals, and its extensive tracts of undisturbed mountain forests, extending from the lowlands to the [[subalpine zone]], are unique in Europe. The site has a great diversity of ecosystems, with important endemic plants and wildlife, and is the place of origin and reintroduction of the mountain subspecies of the European bison.

Her works reflect both her [[Christian]] faith and her strong interest in science.

==Early life==
Madeleine L'Engle Camp was born in [[New York City]] on 29&amp;nbsp;November 1918, and named after her great-grandmother, Madeleine Margaret L'Engle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Saunders-3590 |title=Madeleine Margaret L'Engle |series=genealogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as Mado.&lt;ref name=Summer&gt;{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The Summer of the Great-Grandmother |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1974 |isbn=0-374-27174-7 |pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal grandfather was Florida banker [[Bion Barnett]], co-founder of [[Barnett Bank]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Her mother, a pianist, was also named Madeleine/Madeleine Hall Barnett. Her father, Charles Wadsworth Camp, was a writer, critic, and foreign correspondent who, according to his daughter, suffered lung damage from [[mustard gas]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In a 2004 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of the writer, relatives of L'Engle disputed the mustard gas story, stating instead that Camp's illness was caused by [[alcoholism]]. {{cite magazine |last=Zarin |first=Cynthia |title=The Storyteller |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/12/040412fa_fact_zarin?currentPage=all |accessdate=14 February 2012 |magazine=The New Yorker |date=12 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Engle wrote her first story at age five and began keeping a [[personal journal|journal]] at age eight.&lt;ref name= "Suncatcher"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1972 |pages=30–31 |isbn=1-880913-31-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early literary attempts did not translate into academic success at the New York City private school where she was enrolled. A shy, clumsy child, she was branded as stupid by some of her teachers. Unable to please them, she retreated into her own world of books and writing. Her parents often disagreed about how to raise her, and as a result she attended a number of [[boarding school]]s and had many [[governess]]es.&lt;ref name="Circle"&gt;{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=A Circle of Quiet |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]] |year=1972 |isbn=0-374-12374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=January 2014}} The Camps traveled frequently. At one point, the family moved to a [[château]] near [[Chamonix]] in the [[French Alps]], in what Madeleine described as the hope that the cleaner air would be easier on her father's lungs. Madeleine was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland. However, in 1933, L'Engle's grandmother fell ill, and they moved near [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to be close to her. L'Engle attended another boarding school, [[Ashley Hall (school)|Ashley Hall]], in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. When her father died in October&amp;nbsp;1936, Madeleine arrived home too late to say goodbye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The Summer of the Great-Grandmother |publisher=Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux |year=1974 |isbn=0-374-27174-7 |pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adulthood==
L'Engle attended [[Smith College]] from 1937 to 1941. After graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' from Smith,&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Franklin (actor) |title=Madeleine L'Engle |journal=[[Horn Book Magazine]] |date=August 1963 |url=http://www.hbook.com/magazine/articles/1960s/aug63_franklin.asp |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529221101/http://www.hbook.com/magazine/articles/1960s/aug63_franklin.asp |archivedate=May 29, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she moved to an apartment in New York City. L'Engle published her novels ''The Small Rain'' and ''Ilsa'' prior to meeting her husband in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madeleinelengle.com/madeleine-lengle/|title=Learn About Madeleine L'Engle, Beloved Author of A Wrinkle in Time|work=Madeleine L'Engle|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met actor [[Hugh Franklin (actor)|Hugh Franklin]] when she appeared in the play ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' by [[Anton Chekhov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{iBDB name|472125}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Engle married Franklin on January 26, 1946.  Later she wrote of their meeting and marriage, "We met in ''The Cherry Orchard'' and were married in ''The Joyous Season''."&lt;ref name= Horn /&gt; The couple's first daughter, Josephine, was born in 1947.

The family moved to a 200-year-old farmhouse called Crosswicks in [[Goshen, Connecticut]] in 1952. To replace Franklin's lost acting income, they purchased and operated a small general store, while L'Engle continued with her writing. Their son Bion was born that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1972 |isbn=1-880913-31-3 |pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, seven-year-old Maria, the daughter of family friends who had died, came to live with the Franklins, and they adopted her shortly thereafter.  During this period, L'Engle also served as [[choir]] director of the local [[Congregational Church]].&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1972 |pages=169–73 |chapter=A Chronology of Madeleine L'Engle's Life and Books |isbn=1-880913-31-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
L'Engle determined to give up writing on her 40th birthday (November 1958) when she received yet another rejection notice. "With all the hours I spent writing, I was still not pulling my own weight financially."  Soon she discovered both that she could not give it up and that she had continued to work on fiction subconsciously.&lt;ref name = NEH /&gt;

The family returned to New York City in 1959 so that Hugh could resume his acting career. The move was immediately preceded by a ten-week cross-country camping trip, during which L'Engle first had the idea for her most famous novel, ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'', which she completed by 1960. It was rejected more than thirty times before she handed it to [[John C. Farrar]];&lt;ref name=NEH/&gt; it was finally published by [[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt;

In 1960 the Franklins moved to an apartment (sold by the estate for $4 million in 2008),  in the [[Cleburne Building]] on [[West End Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West End Home of A Wrinkle in Time Author Sells for $4 M |first=Lysandra |last=Ohrstrom |date=March 7, 2008 |newspaper=Observer |url=http://www.observer.com/2008/west-end-avenue-home-late-childrens-author-madeleine-lengle-franklin-sold |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505085331/http://www.observer.com/2008/west-end-avenue-home-late-childrens-author-madeleine-lengle-franklin-sold |archivedate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1960 to 1966 (and again in 1986, 1989 and 1990), L'Engle taught at St. Hilda's &amp; St. Hugh's School in New York. In 1965 she became a volunteer librarian at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], also in New York. She later served for many years as writer-in-residence at the Cathedral, generally spending her winters in New York and her summers at Crosswicks.

During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, L'Engle wrote dozens of books for children and adults. Four of the books for adults formed the ''Crosswicks Journals'' series of autobiographical memoirs. Of these, ''The Summer of the Great-grandmother'' (1974) discusses L'Engle's personal experience caring for her aged mother, and ''Two-Part Invention'' (1988) is a memoir of her marriage, completed after her husband's death from [[cancer]] on September 26, 1986.

===Later years===
L'Engle was seriously injured in an automobile accident in 1991 but recovered well enough to visit [[Antarctica]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Chronology"/&gt; Her son, Bion Franklin, died on December 17, 1999, from the effects of extended alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/04/12/the-storyteller-cynthia-zarin |title=The storyteller: fact, fiction, and the books of Madeleine L'Engle |last=Zarin |first=Cynthia |date=April 12, 2004 |website=The New Yorker|access-date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forty-seven years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.pbs.org/video/2193535071 |newspaper=Religion &amp; Ethics News Weekly |title=Madeleine L'Engle |date=November 17, 2000 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her final years, L'Engle became unable to teach or travel due to reduced mobility from [[osteoporosis]], especially after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 2002.  She also abandoned her former schedule of speaking engagements and seminars. A few compilations of older work, some of it previously unpublished, appeared after 2001.

L'Engle died of natural causes at Rose Haven, a [[nursing home|nursing facility]] close to her home in Litchfield, Connecticut, on September 6, 2007, according to a statement by her publicist the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |type=obituaries |title=Esther Mitgang; Madeleine L'Engle |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=September 7, 2007 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6476596.html |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113151649/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6476596.html |archivedate=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She is interred in the [[Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="Episcopal Church"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/madeleine-lengle-writer-and-episcopalian-dies-88 |title=Madeleine L'Engle, writer and Episcopalian, dies at 88 |last= |first= |date= |website=EpiscopalChurch.org |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, her granddaughters published ''Becoming Madeleine: A Biography of the Author of A Wrinkle in Time by Her Granddaughters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madeleinelengle.com/becoming-madeleine-book-launch-information/|title=Becoming Madeleine Book Launch Information|date=2018-01-19|work=Madeleine L'Engle|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in Time'' was adapted to a film twice by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. A [[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|television film]], directed by [[John Kent Harrison]], premiered on May 10, 2004. When asked in an interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' if the film "met her expectations", L'Engle said, "I have glimpsed it. . . . I expected it to be bad, and it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/i-dare-you-127959 |magazine=Newsweek |title=Madeleine L'Engle |date=May 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|theatrical film]], directed by [[Ava DuVernay]], premiered March 9, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/wrinkle-in-time/|title=Why A Wrinkle in Time Will Change Hollywood|website=TIME.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
L'Engle was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] and believed in [[universal salvation]], writing that "All will be redeemed in God's fullness of time, all, not just the small portion of the population who have been given the grace to know and accept Christ. All the strayed and stolen sheep. All the little lost ones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Wilson |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/september/22.73.html |newspaper=Christianity today |title=A Distorted Predestination |date=September 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her promotion of Christian universalism, many Christian bookstores refused to carry her books, which were also frequently banned from Christian schools and libraries. At the same time, some of her most secular critics attacked her work for being too religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Eccleshare |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2181704,00.html |title=Madeleine L'Engle: Bestselling children's author, renowned for A Wrinkle in Time |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her views on divine punishment were similar to those of [[George MacDonald]], who also had a large influence on her fictional work. She said "I cannot believe that God wants punishment to go on interminably any more than does a loving parent. The entire purpose of loving punishment is to teach, and it lasts only as long as is needed for the lesson. And the lesson is always love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Christopher W |last1=Morgan |first2=Robert A |last2=Peterson |title=Hell Under Fire: Modern Scholarship Reinvents Eternal Punishment |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, L'Engle reflected on how suffering had taught her. She told how suffering a "lonely solitude" as a child taught her about the "world of the imagination" that enabled her to write for children. Later she suffered a "decade of failure" after her first books were published. It was a "bitter" experience, yet she wrote that she had "learned a lot of valuable lessons" that enabled her to persevere as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine L'Engle, ''Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith &amp; Art'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1982), 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On writing for children===
Soon after winning the Newbery Medal for her 1962 "junior novel" ''A Wrinkle in Time'', L'Engle discussed children's books in ''The New York Times Book Review''.&lt;ref name = NYTBR /&gt; The writer of a good children's book, she observed, may need to return to the "intuitive understanding of his own childhood", being ''childlike'' although not ''childish''.  She claimed, "It's often possible to make demands of a child that couldn't be made of an adult... a child will often understand scientific concepts that would baffle an adult. This is because he can understand with a leap of the imagination that [which] is denied the grown-up who has acquired the little knowledge that is a dangerous thing." Of philosophy, etc., as well as science, "the child will come to it with an open mind, whereas many adults come closed to an open book. This is one reason so many writers turn to fantasy (which children claim as their own) when they have something important and difficult to say."&lt;ref name=NYTBR&gt;{{cite news |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |date=May 12, 1963 |title=How's One to Tell? |newspaper=The New York Times |page=BR21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards, honors, and organizations==
In addition to the numerous awards, medals, and prizes won by individual books L'Engle wrote, she personally received many honors over the years.&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt; These included being named an Associate Dame of Justice in the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]] (1972);&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=47369|page=13902|date=November 4, 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the USM Medallion from [[The University of Southern Mississippi]] (1978); the Smith College Medal "for service to community or college which exemplifies the purposes of liberal arts education" (1981); the Sophia Award for distinction in her field (1984); the [[Regina Medal]] (1985); the ALAN Award for outstanding contribution to adolescent literature, presented by the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] (1986);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=One Great Read Programs and Events A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L'Engle |url=http://www.tcpl.lib.in.us/onegreatread |website=www.tcpl.lib.in.us |publisher=Tippecanoe County Public Library |accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Kerlan Award (1990).

In 1985 she was a guest speaker at the [[Library of Congress]], giving a speech entitled "Dare to be Creative!" That same year she began a two-year term as president of the [[Authors Guild]].  In addition she received over a dozen [[honorary degree]]s from as many colleges and universities, such as [[Haverford College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Commencement for the Millennium |work=Haverford News |publisher=Haverford College |year=2002 |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/archives/commencement2000.html |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017003544/http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/archives/commencement2000.html |archivedate=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these name her as a Doctor of Humane Letters, but she was also made a Doctor of Literature and a Doctor of Sacred Theology, the latter at [[Berkeley Divinity School]] in 1984. In 1995 she was writer-in-residence for ''Victoria Magazine''. In 1997 she was recognized for Lifetime Achievement from the [[World Fantasy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Fantasy Convention |year=2010 |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Engle received the annual [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]] in 1998.  The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for a "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature". Four books by L'Engle were cited: ''Meet the Austins'', ''A Wrinkle In Time'', ''A Swiftly Tilting Planet'', and ''A Ring of Endless Light'' (published 1960 to 1980).&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; In 2004 she received the [[National Humanities Medal]]&lt;ref name = NEH&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/national-humanities-medals/madeleine-lengle "Madeleine L'Engle"]. Awards &amp; Honors: 2004 National Humanities Medalist. [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. Retrieved June 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but could not attend the ceremony due to poor health.

L'Engle was inducted into the [[New York Writers Hall of Fame]] in 2011.

In a 2012 survey of ''[[School Library Journal]]'' readers, ''A Wrinkle in Time'' was voted the number two children's novel behind ''[[Charlotte's Web]]''.&lt;ref name = bird&gt;Bird, Elizabeth (June 28, 2012).

===The Madeleine L'Engle Collection===
Since 1976, [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in [[Illinois]] has maintained a special collection of L'Engle's papers, and a variety of other materials, dating back to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheaton.edu/learnres/ARCSC/collects/sc03/content.htm |publisher=Wheaton |title=About the Collection – Madeleine L'Engle |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112215501/http://www.wheaton.edu/learnres/ARCSC/collects/sc03/content.htm |archive-date=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Madeleine L'Engle Collection includes manuscripts for the majority of her published and unpublished works, as well as interviews, photographs, audio and video presentations, and an extensive array of correspondence with both adults and children, including artwork sent to her by children.

==Bibliographic overview==
L'Engle's best-known works are divided between the "Chronos" and "[[Kairos]]" frameworks.&lt;ref name="tree"&gt;{{cite book |last=L'Engle |first=Madeleine |title=The L'Engle Family Tree, in [[Many Waters]] |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1986 |location=New York |isbn=0-374-34796-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the framework in which the stories of the Austin family take place and is presented in a primarily realistic setting, though occasionally with elements that might be regarded as [[science fiction]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The latter is the framework in which the stories of the Murry and O'Keefe families take place and is presented sometimes in a realistic setting and sometimes in a more [[fantasy|fantastic]] or magical milieu.{{citation needed|date= June 2012}} Generally speaking, the more realistic Kairos material is found in the O'Keefe stories,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} which deal with the second-generation characters.  However, the Murry-O'Keefe and Austin families should not be regarded as living in separate worlds, because several characters cross over between them, and historical events are also shared.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to novels and poetry, L'Engle wrote many nonfiction works, including the autobiographical ''[[Crosswicks Journals]]'' and other explorations of the subjects of faith and art. For L'Engle, who wrote repeatedly about "story as truth", the distinction between fiction and memoir was sometimes blurred. Real events from her life and family history made their way into some of her novels, while fictional elements, such as assumed names for people and places, can be found in her published journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chase |first=Carole F |title=Suncatcher: A Study of Madeleine L'Engle And Her Writing |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=1972 |isbn=1-880913-31-3 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Theme (literature)|theme]], often implied and occasionally explicit, in L'Engle's works is that the phenomena that people call religion, science, and magic are simply different aspects of a single seamless reality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Important L'Engle characters==
{{Main |Major characters in the works of Madeleine L'Engle}}
Most of L'Engle's novels from ''A Wrinkle in Time'' onward are centered on a cast of recurring characters, who sometimes reappear decades older than when they were first introduced. The "Kairos" books are about the Murry and O'Keefe families, with [[Meg Murry]] and [[Calvin O'Keefe]] marrying and producing the next generation's protagonist, [[Polly O'Keefe]]. L'Engle wrote about both generations concurrently, with Polly (originally called Poly) first appearing in 1965, well before the second book about her parents as teenagers (''A Wind in the Door'', 1973). The "Chronos" books center on [[Vicky Austin]] and her siblings. Although Vicky's appearances all occur during her childhood and teenage years, her sister Suzy also appears as an adult in ''A Severed Wasp'', with a husband and teenage children. In addition, two of L'Engle's early protagonists, Katherine Forrester and Camilla Dickinson, reappear as elderly women in later novels. Rounding out the cast are several characters "who cross and connect": [[Canon Tallis]], [[Adam Eddington]], and [[Zachary Gray]], who each appear in both the Kairos and Chronos books.&lt;ref name="tree" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], used by [[André Gide|Gide]] to demonstrate the technique of ''mise en abyme'']]
In [[Western art history]], '''''Mise en abyme''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz ɑ̃n‿abim}}; also '''''mise en abîme''''') is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [[heraldry]] and literally means "placed into [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [[André Gide]].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [[mirror]]s, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinhardt|first=Dagmar|title=Youtopia. a Passion for the Dark: Architecture at the Intersection Between Digital Processes and Theatrical Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38_ZvEwnGtQC&amp;pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Freerange Press|isbn=978-0-9808689-1-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Droste effect]], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is named after the 1904 [[Droste]] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:Royal Arms of United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the United Kingdom 1816–37]]
In the terminology of [[heraldry]], the ''abyme'' is the center of a [[coat of arms]]. The term ''mise en abyme'' then meant put in the center. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see [[Droste effect]]).

A complex example of ''mise en abyme'' is seen in the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#After the Acts of Union 1707|for the period 1816–1837]], as used by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The [[crown of Charlemagne]] is placed ''en abyme'' within the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of [[Hanover]], which in turn is ''en abyme'' within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern [[coat of arms of Russia]], which holds a [[sceptre]] topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre.

==Medieval examples==
[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia075.jpg|thumb|300px|Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

While [[art historian]]s working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic "self awareness", medievalists tended not to use it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] dated to the year 944. To the left, [[Justinian I]] offers the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, [[Constantine I]] offers the city of [[Constantinople]] (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles ''Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself'',&lt;ref name='mise'/&gt; in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] in the [[Vatican Museum]], which features Cardinal [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] as the giver of the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical theory and art history==
In [[Western art history]], ''mise en abyme'' is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; "[[recursion|recursive]]" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author [[André Gide]] who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.&lt;ref name='mise'&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf Medieval ''mise-en-abyme'': the object depicted within itself (collection of papers)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] and literary forms such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of the "play within a play" device in ''[[Hamlet]]'', where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase ''mise en abyme'' was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'' by [[Lucien Dällenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Dällenbach, ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'', Paris, Seuil, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
''Mise en abyme'' occurs within a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. ''Mise en abyme'' is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Mise-en-abime" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of [[deconstruction]]. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of ''mise en abyme''. The film being made within the film refers, through its ''[[mise en scène]]'', to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/3265.ctl|Hayward, Susan. ''Cinema Studies Key Concepts''. New York: Routledge, 2006.] Accessed 2009-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' (1973) by [[François Truffaut]].

In [[film]], the meaning of ''mise en abyme'' is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a "dream within a dream". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is [[false awakening|still dreaming]]. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as ''mise en abyme''. This is seen in the film ''[[eXistenZ]]'' where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).  Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s written works (particularly "[[The Purloined Letter]]") in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Band of Outsiders]]'' (1964). 

In [[literary criticism]], ''mise en abyme'' is a type of [[frame story]], in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Chambers |title=Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction |year=1984 |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/story-and-situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7251">'''Multimedia Studies''' is an interdisciplinary field of academic discourse focused on the understanding of technologies and cultural dimensions of linking traditional media sources with ones based on new media to support social systems.

==History==
Multimedia Studies as a discipline came out of the need for media studies to be made relevant to the new world of CD-ROMs and [[hypertext]] in the 1990s. Revolutionary books like Jakob Nielsen's 'Hypertext and Hypermedia' book lay the foundations for understanding multimedia alongside traditional cognitive science and interface design issues.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. (1990). Hypertext and Hypermedia. Saunders College Publishing/Harcourt Brace. {{ISBN|0125184107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software like [[Adobe Authorware|Authorware Attain]], now owned by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], made the design of multimedia systems accessible to those unskilled in programming and became major applications by the end of the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Schifman, R.S. (1999). The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial. Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3540641238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Challenges===
The Internet age that has been growing since the launch of [[Windows 98]] has brought new challenges for the discipline including developing new models and rules for the World Wide Web. Areas such as usability have had to develop specific guidelines for Website design&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. &amp; Tahir, M. (2001). Homepage Usability: 50 Websites Deconstructed. {{ISBN|073571102X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and traditional concepts like genre, narrative theory, and stereotypes have had to be updated to take account of Cyberculture.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, S.C., Scheidt, L.A. ;  Bonus, S. ;  Wright, E. (2004). Bridging the gap: a genre analysis of Weblogs. In: Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.M. (2001). Unsolicited Narratives from the Internet: A Rich Source of Qualitative Data. Qual Health Res 11 (5), 706-714&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural aspects of Multimedia Studies have been conceptualised by authors such as [[Lev Manovich]],&lt;ref name="Manovich 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev |authorlink= Lev Manovich |editor= Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Nick Montfort |title= The New Media Reader |format= PDF |accessdate= 6 May 2007 |year= 2003 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |pages= 13–25 |chapter= New Media from Borges to HTML |chapterurl= http://mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061210054445/http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~noah/nmr/book_samples/nmr-intro-manovich-excerpt.pdf |archivedate= 10 December 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manovich 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Manovich |first= Lev | authorlink= Lev Manovich |title= The Language of a New Media |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-63255-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Fred Forest]].&lt;ref name="Macek 2005"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Forest, Fred| title = Pour un art actuel, l'art à l'heure d'Internet | date = | url = http://www.fredforest.org/artactuel/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolling]] and so-called [[Internet addiction]] has thrown up new problems. Concepts like emotional design &lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A. (2005). Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and affective computing &lt;ref&gt;Picard, R. (2000). Affective Computing. MIT Press. {{ISBN|0262661152}}&lt;/ref&gt; are driving Multimedia Studies research to consider ways of becoming more seductive and able to take account of the different needs of users.

====Media Studies 2.0====
Some academics, such as [[David Gauntlett]], have preferred the neologism, 'Media Studies 2.0' to Multimedia Studies, in order to give it the feel of other fields like [[Web 2.0]] and Classroom 2.0.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;British Film Institute, [http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ Media Studies Conference 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107113722/http://www.bfi.org.uk/education/conferences/mediastudies2007/ |date=2007-11-07 }}, 4–6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;[http://www.transformingaudiences.org.uk Transforming Audiences International Conference], 6–7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AR2"&gt;Andy Ruddock (2008), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00040.x 'Media Studies 2.0? Binge Drinking and Why Audiences Still Matter'], ''Sociology Compass'', Volume 2 Issue 1 Page 1-15, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;[http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt 'Towards a Brave New World? The Media Studies 2.0 Debate'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003185242/http://www.rickinstrell.co.uk/GeoffLealand.ppt |date=2011-10-03 }}, presentation by Geoff Lealand, University of Waikato, at AMES conference, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;[http://twopointzeroforum.blogspot.com/ Blog/forum about Media Studies 2.0] by William Merrin&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Media Studies 2.0 neologism has received strong criticism. Andy Medhurst at Sussex University for instance wrote of the Media Studies 2.0 neologism introduced by David Gauntlett, 'Isn't it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">The '''Neolithic creolisation hypothesis''', first put forward by [[Marek Zvelebil]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Marek Zvelebil. "Indo-European origins and the agricultural transition in Europe." In M. Kuna, N. Venclová (eds.), ''Whither Archeology? Papers in Honour of [[Evžen Neustupný]].'' Institute of Archeology, [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]], Prague: 172–203, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat]] issue and proposes a cultural melting pot in the Neolithic of Northern Europe of foreign [[Neolithic]] farmers and indigenous [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherer communities that resulted in the genesis of the [[Indo-European language]] family.  

The hypothesis holds that the linguistic and cultural influence of the Neolithic farmers was far greater than the persistence of their foreign gene pool. According to Zvelebil, the linguistic influence of indigenous hunter-gatherers predominated, but other archeologists, such as Marek Nowak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf33/nowak33.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002222712/http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf33/nowak33.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }} "Transformations in East-Central Europe from 6000 to 3000 BC: local vs. foreign patterns." Marek Nowak, Institute of Archeology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland, Documenta Praehistorica XXXIII, 2006, Neolithic Studies 13&lt;/ref&gt; favor a scenario compatible to [[Colin Renfrew]]'s [[Anatolian hypothesis]] in attributing the leading linguistic role to the foreign farmers.

==Archaeological evidence==
A study of strontium isotope signatures among the Neolithic farmers in Southwestern Germany indicated that the first [[Linear Pottery culture]] farmers received their partners from a wide catchment, were patrilocal
and intermarried with hunter-gatherer women along the agricultural frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley R.A., Chikhi L. and Price T.D. "The Neolithic transition in Europe: comparing broad scale genetic and local scale isotopic evidence". ''Antiquity'' 77 (295): 63–66, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of Mesolithic motifs on the first [[Funnel Beaker culture]] pottery and of other elements in the material culture has been adduced in support of such results.&lt;ref name=Zvelebil2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf32/32zvelebil.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211180831/http://arheologija.ff.uni-lj.si/documenta/pdf32/32zvelebil.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-11 |df= }} Marek Zvelebil. Homo habitus: agency, structure and the transformation of tradition in the constitution of the TRB foraging farming communities in the North European Plain (ca. 4500–2000 BC), Department of Archeology, University of Sheffield, UK, Documenta Praehistorica XXXII (2005) p. 87–101. © 2005 Oddelek za arheologijo, Filozofska fakulteta – Univerza v Ljubljani, SI&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was theorized the intermarriage between the two communities resulted in the breakdown of the early farming Linear Pottery culture and the [[Lengyel culture]] social and ideological structure as well as a subsequent development of a new foraging-farming community, which was identified archaeologically as the Funnel Beaker culture. That caused the combination of cultural traditions of earlier foraging and farming generations to be accomplished in an act of cultural creolisation. In the Polish Plain, the pattern persisted during some 2500 years, between 4400 and 1800 BC or 2200 BC, until the last hunter-gatherer communities finally became part of the Globular Amphorae/Corded Ware cultural horizon. They led to a cognitive structure that was more familiar to the indigenous hunter-gatherer community but still retained certain earlier routine practices of both the ancestral Neolithic and Mesolithic traditions. The cultural variability of the Funnel Beaker culture horizon and the later [[Globular Amphorae]] and [[Corded Ware]] traditions was proposed to be caused, at least partially, by that process.

==Anthropological evidence==
A more anthropological perspective is proposed to confirm the concept of farmer communities being "acculturated" by neighboring foragers.&lt;ref&gt;Interactions between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Early and Middle Neolithic in the Polish part of the North European Plain – Arkadiusz Marciniak. In D. Papagianni &amp; R. Layton (eds.), Time and Change. Archaeological and Anthropological Perspectives on the Long-Term in Hunter-Gatherer Societies, 115–133. Oxbow: Oxford, 2008 (approved)&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations revealed low paleaodemographic values of Linear Pottery farmers and Corded Ware culture populations with dominant agricultural occupations. The highest values correspond to Corded Ware culture populations, using a husbandry mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural adaptive strategies in the Neolithic in central Europe within the context of palaeodemographic studies. Arkadiusz Marciniak, Journal of European Archaeology (JEA), 1, 1993/1, p. 141–151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic evidence==
[[Frederik Kortlandt]]'s assessment takes into account the typological similarity of Proto-Indo-European to the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]. Assuming that the similarity can be attributed to areal factors, Kortlandt thought of Indo-European as a branch of [[Uralo-Altaic]] that was transformed under the influence of a Caucasian-like substratum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf] Frederik Kortlandt: The spread of the Indo-Europeans, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Kortlandt had in mind areal factors that would be essentially in agreement with the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and an origin in the eastern part of the [[Great European Plain]].

That should be kept distinct from linguist [[Peter Schrijver (linguist)|Peter Schrijver]]'s speculation on the reminiscent lexical and typological features of a family of languages featuring complex verbs, a structural type of which the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] are the sole survivors in the region,&lt;ref name=Schrijver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/homelet/publicaties/lezingenreeks/pdf/Schrijver_Peter_oratie.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926180926/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/homelet/publicaties/lezingenreeks/pdf/Schrijver_Peter_oratie.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }} Peter Schrijver. ''Keltisch en de buren: 9000 jaar taalcontact'', University of Utrecht, March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which he links to the archeological [[Linear Pottery culture]], the first farmers in Europe. Under the Anatolian hypothesis, they are supposed to have been Indo-European-speaking, but Schrijver's proposal, like Kortlandt's, is compatible with the Kurgan paradigm, as Schrijver suggests they spoke languages from a completely different family, which typologically resembled [[Hattic language|Hattic]], [[Minoan language|Minoan]] and Northwest Caucasian. The family did not directly influence Proto-Indo-European in its steppe homeland, but it influenced individual branches in Central and Southeastern Europe (Germanic, Celtic, Italic and Greek) only during the Bronze and the Iron Ages.

The '''Neue Kirche''' ({{lang-en|New Church}}; colloquially ''Deutscher Dom'', i.e., German Church), is located in [[Berlin]] on the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] across from [[Französischer Dom|French Church of Friedrichstadt]]  (''French Church''). Its parish comprised the northern part of the then new quarter of [[Friedrichstadt (Berlin)|Friedrichstadt]], which until then belonged to the parish of the congregations of [[Jerusalem's Church]]. The [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] (in German [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed Church]]) congregants used German as their native language, as opposed to the French-speaking Calvinist congregation owning the [[Französischer Dom|French Church of Friedrichstadt]] on the opposite side of Gendarmenmarkt. The congregants' native language combined with the domed tower earned the church its colloquial naming ''Deutscher Dom''. The church is not a [[cathedral]] in the actual sense of the word.

==Church and congregations==
In 1701-1708 Giovanni Simonetti built the first church after a design of Martin Grünberg. It was the third church in Friedrichstadt, established in 1688, which was a town of princely domination, while the neighbouring [[History of Berlin#15th–17th century|old Berlin]] and [[Cölln]] were cities of [[town privileges]]. The Prince-Elector originally only provided for a Calvinist congregation, since they - the [[Hohenzollern]]s - themselves were Calvinists. But also more and more Lutherans moved in. Therefore, in 1708 the ''New Church'' became a Calvinist and Lutheran [[Simultaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther Kühne and Elisabeth Stephani, ''Evangelische Kirchen in Berlin'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1978), Berlin: CZV-Verlag, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1986, p. 374. {{ISBN|3-7674-0158-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site for the church was disentangled from the so-called ''Swiss Cemetery'', which had been provided for [[Huguenot]]s, who had come to Berlin between 1698 and 1699 from their intermittent refuge in Switzerland. The original building had a pentagonal groundplan with semicircular apses. The interior was characterised by a typical Protestant combined altar and pulpit leaning against the eastern central pillar opposite to the entrance. 
[[File:Delius Berlin Gendarmenmarkt.jpg|thumb|left|The New Church after the collapse of its tower in 1781.]]
In 1780 [[Carl von Gontard]] designed and started the construction of a tower, easterly adjacent to the actual prayer hall. His design of the domed towers, a second one being added to the French Church, followed the [[Palladian]] tradition and received the shape of the [[Paris]]ian Church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]]), then still under construction by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]]. The construction of the domed towers aimed at making the Gendarmenmarkt resemble the [[Piazza del Popolo]] in [[Rome]]. Still under construction the tower of the New Church collapsed. Thus Georg Christian Unger was commissioned to carry out Gontard's plan.

Christian Bernhard Rode created the statues, representing characters from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Covenant]], which are added to the tower. The dome was topped by a statue symbolising the ''victorious virtue'' (now a post-war replica). The gable relief depicts the [[Conversion of Paul|Conversion]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Sha'ul Paul of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Bartmann-Kompa, Horst Büttner, Horst Drescher, Joachim Fait, Marina Flügge, Gerda Herrmann, Ilse Schröder, Helmut Spielmann, Christa Stepansky, and Heinrich Trost, ''Die Bau- und Kunstdenkmale in der DDR: Hauptstadt Berlin'': 2 parts, Institut für Denkmalpflege (ed.) (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1983), Berlin: Henschelverlag Kunst und Gesellschaft, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;1984, part I, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817 the two congregations of the ''German Church'', like most Prussian Reformed and Lutheran congregations joined the common umbrella organisation named [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]] (under this name since 1821), with each congregation maintaining its former denomination or adopting the new united denomination.

[[File:Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel 005.jpg|thumb|250px|The coffins of the casualties of the March Revolution at the German Church with its old prayer hall from 1708, painting by [[Adolph Menzel]].]] The New Church became famous as a place of Prussian history. On 22 March 1848 the coffins of 183 Berliners, who had been killed during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], were shown on the northern side of the church. After an [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical]] service within the prayer hall outside an Evangelical pastor, a Catholic priest and a rabbi, one after the other, shortly addressed the audience, before the throng accompanied the coffins to the graves.

In 1881 the dilapidated prayer hall was torn down and [[Hermann von der Hude]] and Julius Hennicke replaced it with a new one on a pentagonal groundplan, according to the [[neobaroque]] design of [[Johann Wilhelm Schwedler]]. [[Otto Lessing (sculptor)|Otto Lessing]] designed the six statues on the attic of the new prayer hall. On 17 December 1882 the new prayer hall was inaugurated.

In 1934 the congregations of the New Church had united with that of Jerusalem's Church and have become - after further mergers - today's [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Evangelical]] [[Congregation in the Friedrichstadt]] (as of 2001). For services it uses the French Church on the opposite side of Gendarmenmarkt and ''Luke's Church'' in [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]].

In 1943 the New Church was almost completely destroyed in the [[bombing of Berlin in World War II]] and was subsequently rebuilt from 1977 to 1988. Meanwhile, the German government acquired the building and the site. The church building was updated, deconsecrated and reopened in 1996 as the [[Bundestag]]'s museum on German parliamentary history (''Milestones - Setbacks - Sidetracks, The Path to Parliamentary Democracy in Germany'').

[[File:Berlin Deutscher Dom Apel.jpg|thumb|right|The New Church seen at twilight, with the marble monument of [[Friedrich Schiller]] in the foreground.]]
The two congregations of the ''New Church'' maintained cemeteries with the two congregations of the neighbouring [[Jerusalem's Church]] (another simultaneum), three of which are comprised - with cemeteries of other congregations - in a compound of six cemeteries altogether, which are among the most important historical cemeteries of Berlin. They are located in [[Kreuzberg|Berlin-Kreuzberg]] south of [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)]] ([[:de:Friedhöfe vor dem Halleschen Tor|Friedhöfe vor dem Halleschen Tor]]).

==Noteworthy parishioners==
* [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]
* [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], originally also buried in the church, later translated to the cemetery south of Hallesches Tor.
* [[Antoine Pesne]], originally buried within the church, later transferred to the cemetery south of Hallesches Tor.

The '''''Ordinalia''''' are three medieval [[mystery plays]] dating to the late fourteenth century, written primarily in [[Cornish language|Middle Cornish]], with stage directions in Latin.&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"/&gt; The three plays are '''''Origo Mundi''''' (The Origin of the World, also known as ''Ordinale de Origine Mundi'', 2,846 lines), '''''Passio Christi''''' (The Passion of Christ, also known as ''Passio Domini Nostri Jhesu Christi'', 3,242 lines) and '''''Resurrexio Domini''''' (The Resurrection of Our Lord also known as ''Ordinale de Ressurexione Domini'', 2,646 lines).&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kent-CHLC"/&gt; The [[Meter (poetry)|metre]]s of these plays are various arrangements of seven- and four-syllabled lines. ''Ordinalia'' means "prompt" or "service book".&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scherb|2006|pp=74–6}} (in: ''Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kent-CHLC"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kent|2012|pp=623–4}} (in: Koch and Minard edd. ''The Celts'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==First play==
The first play, called ''Origo Mundi'', begins with the Creation of the World, the Fall of Man, and [[Cain and Abel]], followed by the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] and the Flood; the story of the [[Binding of Isaac|temptation of Abraham]] closes the first act. The second act gives us the history of Moses, and the third represents the story of [[David]] and of the building of [[Solomon's Temple]], curiously ending with a description of the martyrdom of [[St Maximilla]] as a Christian by the bishop placed in charge of the temple by Solomon.

An offshoot of the ''Origo Mundi'' is the ''Creation of the World with Noah's Flood'' (''Gwreans an Bys: the Creacon of the World''), written in Cornish with English stage directions, copied by [[William Jordan (writer)|William Jordan]] in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Cawley|editor-first=A. C.|title=Everyman: and Medieval Miracle Plays|edition=2|publisher=Dutton|origyear=1957|year=1959|pages=235–|isbn=0525470360}} (Appendix I, The Cornish Trilogy, The Death of Pilate&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second and third plays==
The second play, ''Passio Domini'', represents the [[Temptation of Christ]] in the desert,&lt;ref name="kent-CHLC"/&gt; and the events from the entry into Jerusalem to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], including the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. This goes on without interruption into the third play, ''Resurrectio Domini'', which gives an account of the [[Harrowing of Hell]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], and the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], with the Legend of [[St Veronica]] and [[Tiberius]], the death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]], the release of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]] from prison, [[The Three Marys]].&lt;ref name="kent-CHLC"/&gt; As in the ''[[Poem of the Passion]]'', the [[Gospel of Nicodemus|pseudo-Gospel of Nicodemus]] and other legendary sources are drawn upon.

== Relationship to the ''Legend of the Cross'' ==
However, running through the whole and interwoven with the [[scriptural]] narrative comes the beautiful and curious [[Legend of the Rood]] (Legend of the Holy Cross). The legend, most of which is in the Ordinalia, is this:

{{quote|When Adam found himself dying, he sent his son [[Seth]] to the Gates of [[Paradise]] to beg of the angel that guarded them the oil of mercy, that his father might live. The angel let him look into Paradise, where he saw many strange and beautiful foreshadowings of things that should be upon the earth; and the angel gave him three seeds from the [[Tree of Life]], and he departed. When he came to where his father was, he found that he was already dead, and he laid the three seeds in his mouth, and buried him therewith on [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]]; and in process of time the three seeds grew into three small trees, and [[Abraham]] took of the wood thereof for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] his son; and afterwards [[Moses]]’ rod, wherewith he smote the rock, was made from one of their branches. And soon the three trees grew together into one tree, whereby was symbolised the mystery of the [[Trinity]]; and under its branches sat [[King David]] when [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan the Prophet]] came to him, and there he bewailed his sin, and made the [[Psalm 51|Miserere Psalm]]. And [[Solomon]], when he would build the Temple on [[Mount Zion|Mount Sion]], cut down the tree, which was then as one of the chiefest of the cedars of Lebanon, and bid men make a beam thereof; but it would in no wise fit into its place, howsoever much they cut it to its shape. Therefore, Solomon was wroth, and bid them cast it over the brook [[Kidron Valley|Cedron]] as a bridge, so that all might tread upon it that went that way. But after a while he buried it, and over where it lay there came the [[Pool of Bethesda]] with its healing powers; and when our Lord came on earth the beam floated up to the surface of the pool, and the Jews found it, and made thereof the Cross whereon Christ died on [[Calvary]].}}

==Extant manuscripts==
There are three manuscripts of this [[trilogy]] in existence:
* '''Bodley 791''', Oxford manuscript of the fifteenth century, given to the [[Bodleian Library]] by James Button on 28 March 1614. This manuscript is the original from which the others were copied, and from which Dr [[Edwin Norris]] edited the plays in 1859.&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"/&gt; 
* ''' Bodleian MSS 28556-28557''',&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"/&gt; another Oxford manuscript, presented to the Bodleian Libraryby Edwin Ley of Bosahan about 1859, with a translation by [[John Keigwin]]. The copy of the text is older by a century than the translation. 
* '''Peniarth MS 428E''',&lt;ref name="Scherb-OEBL"/&gt; a copy which was in the library of [[Sir John Williams, 1st Baronet, of the City of London|Sir John Williams, Bart.]], of [[Llansteffan]], [[Carmarthenshire]], with an autograph translation by Keigwin. On the death of Sir John it went to the National Library of Wales as part of his bequests.

{{linguistics}}
'''Phonetics''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s}}) is a branch of [[linguistics]] that studies the [[sound]]s of [[human]] [[speech]], or—in the case of sign languages—the equivalent aspects of sign.{{sfn|O'Grady|2005|p=15}} It is concerned with the physical properties of speech sounds or signs ([[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]): their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status. [[Phonology]], on the other hand, is concerned with the abstract, [[grammatical]] characterization of systems of sounds or signs.

In the case of oral languages, phonetics has three basic areas of study:

*[[Articulatory phonetics]]: the study of the [[Speech organ|organs of speech]] and their use in producing speech sounds{{sfn|Trask|1996|p=34}} by the speaker.
*[[Acoustic phonetics]]: the study of the physical transmission of speech sounds from the speaker to the listener.
*[[Auditory phonetics]]: the study of the reception and perception of speech sounds by the listener.

==History==
&lt;!--'History of phonetics' redirects here--&gt;
The first known phonetic studies were carried out as early as the 6th century BCE by [[Sanskrit]] grammarians.{{sfn|Caffrey|2017}} The Hindu scholar [[Pāṇini]] is among the most well known of these early investigators, whose four part grammar, written around 350 BCE, is influential in modern linguistics and still represents "the most complete generative grammar of any language yet written".{{sfn|Kiparsky|1993|p=2918}} His grammar formed the basis of modern linguistics and described a number of important phonetic principles. Pāṇini provided an account of the phonetics of voicing, describing resonance as being produced either by tone, when vocal folds are closed, or noise, when vocal folds are open. The phonetic principles in the grammar are considered "primitives" in that they are the basis for his theoretical analysis rather than the objects of theoretical analysis themselves, and the principles can be inferred from his system of phonology.{{sfn|Kiparsky|1993|pp=2922–3}}

Advancements in phonetics after Pāṇini and his contemporaries were limited until the modern era, save some limited investigations by Greek and Roman grammarians. In the millenia between Indic grammarians and modern phonetics the focus of phonetics shifted from the difference between spoken and written language, which was the driving force behind Pāṇini's account, and began to focus on the physical properties of speech alone. Sustained interest in phonetics began again around 1800 CE with the term "phonetics" being first used in the present sense in 1841.{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary|2018}}{{sfn|Caffrey|2017}} With new developments in medicine and the development of audio and visual recording devices, phonetic insights were able to use and review new and more detailed data. This early period of modern phonetics included the development of an influential phonetic alphabet based on articulatory positions by [[Alexander Melville Bell]]. Known as [[visible speech]], it gained prominency as a tool in the [[Oralism|oral education of deaf children]].{{sfn|Caffrey|2017}}

==Anatomy of the vocal system==
&lt;!-- See Language Files 12th ed. --&gt;
&lt;!-- See A Course in Phonetics 4th ed. --&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Phonological anatomy 1.png|thumb|A diagram of anatomical locations in the vocal tract. (A) Nasal cavity; (B) alveolar ridge; (C) lips; (D) teeth; (E) tongue tip; (F) larynx; (G) glottis; (H) palate; (I) tongue body; (J) velum; (K) uvula; (L) trachea; (M) esophagus.|alt=See caption.]]
[[File:Diagram showing the parts of the pharynx CRUK 334.svg|thumb]]--&gt;
Speech sounds are generally produced by the modification of an airstream exhaled from the lungs. The respiratory organs used to create and modify airflow are divided into three regions: the vocal tract (supralaryngeal), the [[larynx]], and the subglottal system. The airstream can be either egressive (out of the vocal tract) or ingressive (into the vocal tract). In pulmonic sounds, the airstream is produced by the lungs in the subglottal system and passes through the larynx and vocal tract. Glottalic sounds use an airstream created by movements of the larynx without airflow from the lungs. Clicks or lingual ingressive sounds create an airstream using the tongue.

===Vocal tract===
{{see|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|Passive and active places of articulation: (1) ''Exo-labial''; (2) ''Endo-labial''; (3) ''Dental''; (4) ''Alveolar''; (5) ''Post-alveolar''; (6) ''Pre-palatal''; (7) ''Palatal''; (8) ''Velar''; (9) ''Uvular''; (10) ''Pharyngeal''; (11) ''Glottal''; (12) ''Epiglottal''; (13) ''Radical''; (14) ''Postero-dorsal''; (15) ''Antero-dorsal''; (16) ''Laminal''; (17) ''Apical''; (18) ''Sub-apical'' or ''sub-laminal''.|alt=A midsagittal view of the mouth with numbers marking places of articulation.]]
Articulations take place in particular parts of the mouth. They are described by the part of the mouth that constricts airflow and by what part of the mouth that constriction occurs. In most languages constrictions are made with the lips and tongue. Constrictions made by the lips are called [[Labialized|labial]]s. The tongue can make constrictions with many different parts, broadly classified into coronal and dorsal places of articulation. [[Coronal consonant|Coronal]] articulations are made with either the tip or blade of the tongue, while [[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] articulations are made with the back of the tongue.{{sfn|Ladefoged|2001|p=5}} These divisions are not sufficient for distinguishing and describing all speech sounds.{{sfn|Ladefoged|2001|p=5}} For example, in English the sounds {{ipa|[s]}} and {{ipa|[ʃ]}} are both voiceless coronal fricatives, but they are produced in different places of the mouth. Additionally, that difference in place can result in a difference of meaning like in "sack" and "shack". To account for this, articulations are further divided based upon the area of the mouth in which the constriction occurs.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=9}}

&lt;!-- Things that should be present for every place of articulation:
-How it is made
-Important generalizations about its patterning
-Basic statistics on its distribution, preferably with some examples.
--&gt;
====Labial consonants====
{{main|Labial consonants}}
Articulations involving the lips can be made in three different ways: with both lips (bilabial), with one lip and the teeth (labiodental), and with the tongue and the upper lip (linguolabial).{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=16}} Depending on the definition used, some or all of these kinds of articulations may be categorized into the class of [[Labial consonant|labial articulation]]s. Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) propose that linguolabial articulations be considered coronals rather than labials, but make clear this grouping, like all groupings of articulations, is equivocable and not cleanly divided.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=43}} Linguolabials are included in this section as labials given their use of the lips as a place of articulation.&lt;!--This decision is based on the intuition that readers looking for linguolabials are more likely to look under labials than coronals--&gt;

[[Bilabial consonant]]s are made with both lips. In producing these sounds the lower lip moves farthest to meet the upper lip, which also moves down slightly,{{sfn|Maddieson|1993}} though in some cases the force from air moving through the aperature (opening between the lips) may cause the lips to separate faster than they can come together.{{sfn|Fujimura|1961}} Unlike most other articulations, both articulators are made from soft tissue, and so bilabial stops are more likely to be produced with incomplete closures than articulations involving hard surfaces like the teeth or palate. Bilabial stops are also unusual in that an articulator in the upper section of the vocal tract actively moves downwards, as the upper lip shows some active downward movement.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=16–17}}

[[Labiodental consonant]]s are made by the lower lip rising to the upper teeth. Labiodental consonants are most often [[fricative]]s while labiodental nasals are also typologically common.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=17–18}} There is debate as to whether true labiodental [[plosive]]s occur in any natural language,{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=17}} though a number of languages are reported to have labiodental plosives including [[Zulu language|Zulu]],{{sfn|Doke|1926}} [[Tonga_language_(Zambia_and_Zimbabwe)|Tonga]],{{sfn|Guthrie|1948|p=61}} and [[Shubi language|Shubi]].{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=17}} Labiodental [[affricate]]s are reported in [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]]{{sfn|Baumbach|1987}} which would require the stop portion of the affricate to be a labiodental stop, though Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) raise the possibility that labiodental affricates involve a bilabial closure like "pf" in German. Unlike plosives and affricates, labiodental nasals are common across languages.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=17–18}}

[[Linguolabial consonant]]s are made with the blade of the tongue approaching or contacting the upper lip. Like in bilabial articulations, the upper lip moves slightly towards the more active articulator. Articulations in this group do not have their own symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet, rather, they are formed by combining an apical symbol with a diacritic implicitly placing them in the coronal category.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|2015}}{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=18}} They exist in a number of languages indigenous to [[Vanuatu]] such as [[Tangoa language|Tangoa]], though early descriptions referred to them as apical-labial consonants. The name "linguolabial" was suggested by [[Floyd Lounsbury]] given that they are produced with the blade rather than the tip of the tongue.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=18}}

====Coronal consonants====
{{main|Coronal consonants}}
Coronal consonants are made with the tip or blade of the tongue and, because of the agility of the front of the tongue, represent a variety not only in place but in the posture of the tongue. The coronal places of articulation represent the areas of the mouth the tongue contacts or makes a constriction, and include dental, alveolar, and post-alveolar locations. Tongue postures using the tip of the tongue can be [[Apical consonant|apical]] if using the top of the tongue tip, [[laminal consonant|laminal]] if made with the blade of the tongue, or [[Retroflex consonant|sub-apical]] if the tongue tip is curled back and the bottom of the tongue is used. Coronals are unique as a group in that every [[manner of articulation]] is attested.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|2015}}{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=19–31}} [[Australian languages]] are well known for the large number of coronal contrasts exhibited within and across languages in the region.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=28}}

[[Dental consonant]]s are made with the tip or blade of the tongue and the upper teeth. They are divided into two groups based upon the part of the tongue used to produce them: apical dental consonants are produced with the tongue tip touching the teeth; interdental consonants are produced with the blade of the tongue as the tip of the tongue sticks out in front of the teeth. No language is known to use both contrastively though they may exist [[allophone|allophonically]].

[[Alveolar consonant]]s are made with the tip or blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge just behind the teeth and can similarly be apical or laminal.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=19–25}} 

Crosslinguistically, dental consonants and alveolar consonants are frequently contrasted leading to a number of generalizations of crosslinguistic patterns. The different places of articulation tend to also be contrasted in the part of the tongue used to produce them: most languages with dental stops have laminal dentals, while languages with apical stops usually have apical stops. Languages rarely have two consonants in the same place with a contrast in laminality, though [[Taa]] (ǃXóõ) is a counterexample to this pattern.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=20, 40–1}} If a language has only one of a dental stop or an alveolar stop, it will usually be laminal if it is a dental stop, and the stop will usually be apical if it is an alveolar stop, though for example [[Temne language|Temne]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]{{sfn|Scatton|1984|p=60}} do not follow this pattern.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=23}} If a language has both an apical and laminal stop, then the laminal stop is more likely to be affricated like in [[Isoko language|Isoko]], though [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] show the opposite pattern with alveolar stops being more affricated.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=23–5}}

[[Retroflex consonant]]s have a number of different definitions depending on whether the position of the tongue or the position on the roof of the mouth is given prominence, though in general they represent a group of articulations in which the tip of the tongue is curled upwards to some degree. In this way, retroflex articulations can occur in a number of different locations on the roof of the mouth including alveolar, post-alveolar, and palatal regions. If the underside of the tongue tip makes contact with the roof of the mouth, it is sub-apical though apical post-alveolar sounds are also described as retroflex.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=25, 27–8}} Typical examples of sub-apical retroflex stops are commonly found in [[Dravidian languages]], and in some [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|languages indigenous to the southwest United States]] the contrastive difference between dental and alveolar stops is a slight retroflexion of the alveolar stop.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=27}} Acoustically, retroflexion tends to affect the higher formants.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=27}}

Articulations taking place just behind the alveolar ridge, known as [[post-alveolar consonant]]s, have been referred to using a number of different terms. Apical post-alveolar consonants are often called retroflex, while laminal articulations are sometimes called palato-alveolar;{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=27–8}} in the Australianist literature, these laminal stops are often described as 'palatal' though they are produced further forward than the palate region typically described as palatal.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=28}} Because of individual anatomical variation, the precise articulation of palato-alveolar stops (and coronals in general) can very widely within a speech community.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=32}}

====Dorsal consonants====
{{main|Dorsal consonants}}
&lt;!-- This requires some more sources to round it out--&gt;
Dorsal consonants are those consonants made using the tongue body rather than the tip or blade.

[[Palatal consonants]] are made using the tongue body against the hard palate on the roof of the mouth. They are frequently contrasted with velar or uvular consonants, though it is rare for a language to contrast all three simultaneously, with [[Jaqaru]] as a possible example of a three way contrast.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=35}} 

[[Velar consonants]] are made using the tongue body against the velum. They are incredibly common crosslinguistically; almost all languages have a velar stop. Because both velars and vowels are made using the tongue body, they are highly affected by [[coarticulation]] with vowels and can be produced as far forward as the hard palate or as far back as the uvula. These variations are typically divided into front, central, and back velars in parallel with the vowel space.{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=33–34}} They can be hard to distinguish phonetically from palatal consonants, though are produced slightly behind the area of prototypical palatal consonants.{{sfn|Keating|Lahiri|1993|p=89}}

[[Uvular consonants]] are made by the tongue body contacting or approaching the uvula. They are rare, occurring in an estimated 19 percent of languages, and large regions of the Americas and Africa have no languages with uvular consonants. In languages with uvular consonants, stops are most frequent followed by [[continuant]]s (including nasals).{{sfn|Maddieson|2013}}

===The larynx===
{{further|Larynx}}
[[File:Larynx (top view).jpg|thumb|alt=An illustration of a top-down view of the larynx.]]
&lt;!--This text previously a part of the voicing section below--&gt;
The larynx, commonly known as the "voice box" is a cartilaginous structure in the [[trachea]] responsible for [[phonation]]. The vocal folds (chords) are held together so that they vibrate, or held apart so that they do not. The positions of the vocal folds are achieved by movement of the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s.{{sfn|Ladefoged|2001|p=123}} The [[Larynx#Intrinsic|intrinsic laryngeal muscles]] are responsible for moving the arytenoid cartilages as well as modulating the tension of the vocal folds.{{sfn|Seikel|Drumright|King|2016|p=222}} If the vocal folds are not close enough or not tense enough, they will vibrate sporadically (described as creaky or breathy voice depending on the degree) or not at all (voiceless sounds). Even if the vocal folds are in the correct position, there must be air flowing across them or they will not vibrate. The difference in pressure across the glottis required for voicing is estimated at 1 – 2 [[Centimetre of water|cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0]] (98.0665 – 196.133 pascals&lt;!--this conversion is based on page 47 of https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf--&gt;).{{sfn|Ohala|1997|p=1}} The pressure differential can fall below levels required for phonation either because of an increase in pressure above the glottis (superglottal pressure) or a decrease in pressure below the glottis (subglottal pressure). The subglottal pressure is maintained by the [[respiratory muscles]]. Supraglottal pressure, with no constrictions or articulations, is about [[atmospheric pressure]]. However, because articulations (especially consonants) represent constrictions of the airflow, the pressure in the cavity behind those constrictions can increase resulting in a higher supraglottal pressure.{{sfn|Chomsky|Halle|1968|pp=300–301}}

===Pulmonary and subglottal system===
{{see|Breathing}}
&lt;!--[[File:Respiratory system.svg|thumb]]--&gt;
The lungs are the engine that drives nearly all speech production, and their importance in phonetics is due to their creation of pressure for pulmonic sounds. The most common kinds of sound across languages are pulmonic egress, where air is exhaled from the lungs.{{sfn|Ladefoged|2001|p=1}} The opposite is possible, though no language is known to have pulmonic ingressive sounds as phonemes.{{sfn|Eklund|2008|p=237}} Many languages such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]] use them for [[paralinguistic]] articulations such as affirmations in a number of genetically and geographically diverse languages.{{sfn|Eklund|2008}} Both egressive and ingressive sounds rely on holding the vocal folds in a particular posture and using the lungs to draw air across the vocal folds so that they either vibrate (voiced) or do not vibrate (voiceless).{{sfn|Ladefoged|2001|p=1}} Pulmonic articulations are restricted by the volume of air able to be exhaled in a given respiratory cycle, known as the [[vital capacity]].

The lungs are used to maintain two kinds of pressure simultaneously in order to produce and modify phonation. In order to produce phonation at all, the lungs must maintain a pressure of 3–5 cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 higher than the pressure above the glottis. However small and fast adjustments are made to the subglottal pressure to modify speech for suprasegmental features like stress. A number of thoracic muscles are used to make these adjustments. Because the lungs and thorax stretch during inhalation, the elastic forces of the lungs alone are able to produce pressure differentials sufficient for phonation at lung volumes above 50 percent of vital capacity.{{sfn|Seikel|Drumright|King|2016|p=176}} Above 50 percent of vital capacity, the [[respiratory muscles]] are used to "check" the elastic forces of the thorax to maintain a stable pressure differential. Below that volume, they are used to increase the subglottal pressure by actively exhaling air.

During speech the respiratory cycle is modified to accommodate both linguistic and biological needs. Exhalation, usually about 60 percent of the respiratory cycle at rest, is increased to about 90 percent of the respiratory cycle. Because metabolic needs are relatively stable, the total volume of air moved in most cases of speech remains about the same as quiet tidal breathing.{{sfn|Seikel|Drumright|King|2016|p=171}} Increases in speech intensity of 18 dB (a loud conversation) has relatively little impact on the volume of air moved. Because their respiritory systems are not as developed as adults, children tend to use a larger proportion of their vital capacity compared to adults, with more deep inhales.{{sfn|Seikel|Drumright|King|2016|pp=168–77}}

==Voicing and phonation types==
&lt;!--{{Further|#Models of phonation|#The larynx}}--&gt;
An important factor in describing the production of most speech sounds is the state of the glottis—the space between the vocal folds. Muscles inside the larynx make adjustments to the vocal folds in order to produce and modify vibration patterns for different sounds. Two canonical examples are modal voiced, where the vocal folds vibrate, and voiceless, where they do not. Modal voiced and voiceless consonants are incredibly common across languages, and all languages use both phonation types to some degree. Consonants can be either voiced or voiceless, though some languages do not make distinctions between them for certain consonants.{{efn|Hawaiian, for example, does not contrast voiced and voiceless plosives.}} No language is known to have a phonemic voicing contrast for vowels, though there are languages, like [[Japanese language|Japanese]], where vowels are produced as voiceless in certain contexts. Other positions of the glottis, such as breathy and creaky voice, are used in a number of languages, like [[Jalapa Mazatec]], to contrast [[phonemes]] while in other languages, like English, they exist allophonically. Phonation types are modelled on a continuum of glottal states from completely open (voiceless) to completely closed (glottal stop). The optimal position for vibration, and the phonation type most used in speech, modal voice, exists in the middle of these two extremes. If the glottis is slightly wider, breathy voice occurs, while bringing the vocal folds closer together results in creaky voice.{{sfn|Gordon|Ladefoged|2001}}

There are a number of ways to determine if a segment is voiced or not, the simplest being to feel the larynx during speech and note when vibrations are felt. More precise measurements can be obtained through acoustic analysis of a spectrogram or spectral slice. In spectrographic analysis, voiced segments show a voicing bar, a region of high acoustic energy, in the low frequencies of voiced segments.{{sfn|Dawson|Phelan|2016}} In examining a spectral splice, the acoustic spectrum at a given point in time a model of the vowel pronounced reverses the filtering of the mouth producing the spectrum of the glottis. A computational model of the unfiltered glottal signal is then fitted to the inverse filtered acoustic signal to determine the characteristics of the glottis.{{sfn|Gobl|Ní Chasaide|2010|pp=388, ''et seq''}} Visual analysis is also available using specialized medical equipment such as ultrasound and endoscopy.{{sfn|Dawson|Phelan|2016}}{{efn|See [[#Articulatory models]] for further information on acoustic modeling.}}
  
For the vocal folds to vibrate, they must be in the proper position and there must be air flowing through the glottis.{{sfn|Ohala|1997|p=1}} The normal phonation pattern used in typical speach is modal voice, where the vocal folds are held close together with moderate tension. The vocal folds vibrate as a single unit periodically and efficiently with a full glottal closure and no aspiration.{{Sfn|Gobl|Ní Chasaide|2010|p=399}} If they are pulled farther apart, they do not vibrate and so produce voiceless phones. If they are held firmly together they produce a glottal stop.{{sfn|Gordon|Ladefoged|2001}}&lt;!--I think, double check--&gt;

If the vocal folds are held slightly further apart than in modal voicing, they produce phonation types like breathy voice (or murmur) and whispery voice. The tension across the vocal ligaments ([[vocal cords]]) is less than in modal voicing allowing for air to flow more freely. Both breathy voice and whispery voice exist on a continuum loosely characterized as going from the more periodic waveform of breathy voice to the more noisy waveform of whispery voice. Acoustically, both tend to dampen the first formant with whispery voice being more extreme deviations. {{sfn|Gobl|Ní Chasaide|2010|p=400-401}}

Holding the vocal folds more tightly together results in creaky voice. The tension in across the vocal folds is less than in modal voice, but they are held tightly together resulting in only the ligaments of the vocal folds vibrating.{{efn|See [[#The larynx]] for further information on anatomy of phonation.}} The pulses are highly irregular, with low pitch and frequency amplitude.{{sfn|Gobl|Ní Chasaide|2010|p=401}}
&lt;!--Gobl and Ní Chasaide has coverage of tense and lax, but I think that might be too much here--&gt;

==Articulatory models==
When producing speech, the articulators move through and contact particular locations in space resulting in changes to the acoustic signal. Some models of speech production take this as the basis for modeling articulation in a coordinate system which may be internal to the body (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic). Intrinsic coordinate systems model the movement of articulators as positions and angles of joints in the body. Intrinsic coordinate models of the jaw often use two to three degrees of freedom representing translation and rotation. These face issues with modeling the tongue which, unlike joints of the jaw and arms, is a [[muscular hydrostat]] like an elephant trunk that lacks joints.{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|p=359}} Because of the different physiological structures, movement paths of the jaw are relatively straight lines during speech and mastication, while movements of the tongue follow curves.{{sfn|Munhall|Ostry|Flanagan|1991|p=299|ps=, ''et seq.''}}

Straight line movements have been used to argue articulations as planned in extrinsic rather than intrinsic space, though extrinsic coordinate systems also include acoustic coordinate spaces, not just physical coordinate spaces.{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|p=359}} Models which assume movements are planned in extrinsic space run into an [[inverse problem]] of explaining the muscle and joint locations which produce the observed path or acoustic signal. The arm, for example, has seven degrees of freedom and 22 muscles, so multiple different joint and muscle configurations can lead to the same final position. For models of planning in extrinsic acoustic space, the same one-to-many mapping problem applies as well, with no unique mapping from physical or acoustic targets to the muscle movements required to achieve them. Concerns about the inverse problem may be exagerated, however, as speech is a highly learned skill using neurological structures which evolved for the purpose.{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|p=360}}

&lt;!-- See Bizzi et al 1992 on equilibrium-point model --&gt;
The equilibrium-point model proposes a resolution to the inverse problem by arguing that movement targets be represented as the position of the musle pairs acting on a joint.{{efn|See {{harvtxt|Feldman|1966}} for the original proposal.}} Importantly, muscles are modeled as springs, and the target is the equilibrium point for the modeled spring-mass system. By using springs, the equilibrium point model is able to easily account for compensation and response when movements are disrupted. They are considered a coordinate model because they assume that these muscle positions are represented as points in space, equilibrium points, where the spring-like action of the muscles converges.{{sfn|Bizzi|Hogan|Mussa-Ivaldi|Giszter|1992}}{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|p=361}}

Gestural approaches to speech production propose that articulations are represented as movement patterns rather than particular coordinates to hit. The minimal unit is a gesture which represents a group of "functionally equivalent articulatory movement patterns that are actively controlled with reference to a given speech-relevant goal (e.g., a bilabial closure)."{{sfn|Saltzman|Munhall|1989}} These groups represent coordinative structures or "synergies" which view movements not as individual muscle movements but as task-dependent groupings of muscles which work together as a single unit.{{sfn|Mattingly|1990}}{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|pp=362–4}} This reduces the degrees of freedom in articulation planning, a problem especially in intrinsic coordinate models, which allows for any movement that achieves the speech goal, rather than encoding the particular movements in the abstract representation. Coarticulation is well described by gestural models as the articulations at faster speech rates can be explained as composites of the independent gestures at slower speech rates.{{sfn|Löfqvist|2010|p=364}}

==Subfields==

Phonetics as a research discipline has three main branches:{{sfn|O'Connor|1973}}
*[[Articulatory phonetics]] is concerned with the articulation of speech: The position, shape, and movement of ''articulators'' or [[speech organ]]s, such as the lips, tongue, and [[vocal folds]].
*[[Acoustic phonetics]] is concerned with [[acoustics]] of speech: The spectro-temporal properties of the [[sound wave]]s produced by speech, such as their [[frequency]], [[amplitude]], and [[harmonic structure]].
*[[Auditory phonetics]] is concerned with [[speech perception]]: the [[perception]], [[categorization]], and [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] of speech sounds and the role of the [[auditory system]] and the [[Human brain|brain]] in the same.

Phonetic insight is used in a number of [[applied linguistic]] fields such as:
*[[Forensic linguistics|Forensic phonetics]]: the use of phonetics (the science of speech) for forensic (legal) purposes.
*[[Speech recognition]]: the analysis and transcription of recorded speech by a computer system.
*[[Speech synthesis]]: the production of human speech by a computer system.
*[[Pronunciation]]: to learn actual pronunciation of words of various languages.

===Relation to phonology===
In contrast to phonetics, [[phonology]] is the study of how sounds and gestures pattern in and across languages, relating such concerns with other levels and aspects of language. Phonetics deals with the articulatory and acoustic properties of speech sounds, how they are produced, and how they are perceived. As part of this investigation, phoneticians may concern themselves with the physical properties of meaningful sound contrasts or the social meaning encoded in the speech signal ([[socio-phonetics]]) (e.g. [[gender]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[ethnicity]], etc.). However, a substantial portion of research in phonetics is not concerned with the meaningful elements in the speech signal.

While it is widely agreed that phonology is grounded in phonetics, phonology is a distinct branch of linguistics, concerned with sounds and gestures as abstract units (e.g., [[distinctive feature]]s, [[phoneme]]s, [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]e, [[syllables]], etc.) and their conditioned variation (via, e.g., [[allophonic rule]]s, constraints, or [[Phonological rule|derivational rules]]).{{sfn|Kingston|2007}} Phonology has been argued to relate to phonetics via the set of [[distinctive feature]]s, which map the abstract representations of speech units to articulatory gestures, acoustic signals or perceptual representations.{{sfn|Halle|1983}}{{sfn|Jakobson, Fant, and Halle|1976}}{{sfn|Hall|2001}}

==Transcription==
{{Main article|Phonetic transcription}}
[[Phonetic transcription]] is a system for transcribing sounds that occur in a language, whether [[oral language|oral]] or [[sign language|sign]].  The most widely known system of phonetic transcription, the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), provides a standardized set of symbols for oral phones.{{sfn|O'Grady|2005|p=17}}{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|1999}} The standardized nature of the IPA enables its users to transcribe accurately and consistently the phones of different languages, [[dialect]]s, and [[idiolect]]s.{{sfn|O'Grady|2005|p=17}}{{sfn|Ladefoged|2005}}{{sfn|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}} The IPA is a useful tool not only for the study of phonetics, but also for language teaching, professional acting, and [[speech pathology]].{{sfn|Ladefoged|2005}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51618">'''Political violence''' is [[violence]] perpetrated by people or [[government]]s to achieve political goals. It can describe violence used by a [[State (polity)|state]] against other states ([[war]]) or against non-state actors (e.g. [[police brutality]], [[counter-insurgency]], [[genocide]]). It can also describe politically-motivated violence by non-state actors against a state (e.g. [[rebellion]], [[rioting]]) or against other non-state actors. Non-action on the part of a government can also be characterized as a form of political violence, such as refusing to alleviate [[famine]] or otherwise denying resources to politically identifiable groups within their territory. 

Due to the imbalances of power between state and non-state actors, political violence often takes the form of [[asynchronous warfare]] where neither side is able to directly assault the other, instead relying on tactics such as [[terrorism]] and [[guerrilla warfare]], and often include attacks on [[civilian]] or otherwise [[non-combatant]] targets that are perceived as a proxy for the opposing faction.

Many groups and individuals believe that their political systems will never respond to their demands and thus believe that violence is not only justified but also necessary in order to achieve their political objectives. Similarly, many governments around the world believe they need to use violence in order to intimidate their populace into acquiescence. At other times, governments use force in order to defend their country from outside invasion or other threats of force and to coerce other governments or conquer territory.&lt;ref name="Nelson Education"&gt;[http://polisci.nelson.com/violence.html Definition of "political violence"], Nelson Education; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Political violence varies widely in form, severity, and practice. In political science, a common organizing framework is to consider types of violence by the relevant actors: violence between non-state actors, one-sided violence perpetrated by a state actor against civilians, and violence between states.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Violence between non-state actors ===
Fighting between non-state actors without state security forces playing a direct role in the conflict.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"&gt;[http://www.hsrgroup.org/docs/Publications/HSR2013/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf Human Security Report Project 2013 Report]; accessed November 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethnic conflict ====
{{Main article|Ethnic conflict}}
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
An '''ethnic conflict''' is fought between [[ethnic group]]s. While at times a specific ethnic group may have the backing (whether formal or informal) of the state (or conversely, a specific ethnic group may be targeted by the state), ethnic conflict can also take place between two groups without the direct intervention of the state, or despite the state's attempts to mediate between groups.

=== One-sided violence by non-state actors ===
==== Terrorism ====
{{Main article|Terrorism}}
'''Terrorism''' can be directed by non-state actors against political targets other than the state (e.g. [[Yishai Schlissel|Stabbing attacks at gay pride parades in Jerusalem]], [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]]). Because terrorism is a tactic often used by the weaker side of a conflict, it may also fall under violence between a state and non-state actor.

While there lacks a concrete [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of terrorism]], the [[United States Department of Defense]] however defines terrorism as, "the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorism-research.com|title=Terrorism Research - What is Terrorism?|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419112023/http://www.terrorism-research.com|archivedate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is and is not considered terrorism is itself a controversial political question, as states have often used the label of terrorism to exclusively demonize the actions of their enemies while obscuring "legal" violence administered by the state (e.g. [[The Troubles]], [[CPP–NPA–NDF rebellion]], [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Political Terrorism: A New Guide To Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, And Literature'' by Albert J. Jongman&lt;!-- publisher, year, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One-sided violence by the state ===
{{further|Mass murder#By states}}
The use of force by an organized armed group, be it a government or non-state group, which results in the deaths of civilians. According to the [[Human Security Report Project]], a campaign of one-sided violence is recorded whenever violence against civilians committed by one group results in at least 25 reported deaths in a calendar year.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Genocide ====
{{Main article|Genocide}}One form of political violence is genocide. '''Genocide''' is commonly defined as "the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]], [[Religious denomination|religious]], or [[nationality|national]] group",&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{cite book |author=Funk, T.

==== Torture ====
{{Main article|Torture}}
Torture is the act of inflicting severe pain (whether physical or psychological) as a means of punishment, revenge, forcing information or confession, or simply as an act of cruelty. Torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries in the 21st century. It is considered a [[human rights violation]] and is declared unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] have officially agreed not to torture prisoners in armed conflicts. National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by military police personnel of the [[United States Army]]. Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] monitor abuses of human rights and reports widespread violations of human torture in by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 Report 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601024732/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 |date=2005-06-01 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Capital punishment ====
{{Main article|Capital punishment}}
Capital punishment is the sentence of death upon a person by the state as a punishment for an offense. This does not include [[extrajudicial killing]], which is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. The [[use of capital punishment by country]] varies, but according to Amnesty International 58 countries still actively use the death penalty, and in 2010, 23 countries carried out executions and 67 imposed death sentences. Methods of execution in 2010 included beheading, electrocution, hanging, lethal injection and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Death Penalty in 2010|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2010|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[UN moratorium on the death penalty]] which called for worldwide abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Penalty in International Law|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/international-law|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police brutality ====
{{Main article|Police brutality}}
Police brutality is another form of political violence. It is most commonly described in juxtaposition with the term excessive force. Police brutality can be defined as "a civil rights violation that occurs when a police officer acts with excessive force by using an amount of force with regards to a civilian that is more than necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/police-brutality/|title=Police Brutality Law &amp; Legal Definitions |publisher=uslegal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police brutality and the use of excessive force are present throughout the world and in the United States alone, 4,861 incidences of police misconduct were reported during 2010 (see also [[Police brutality (United States)]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.injusticeeverywhere.com/?p=4053|title=2010 NPMSRP Police Misconduct Statistical Report -Draft- - PoliceMisconduct.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, there were 6,826 victims involved and 247 fatalities.

==== Famine ====
{{Main article|Famine}}
&lt;!-- Is Bengal famine that occurred during WWII in India an example of famine as violence by state? Various researchers, including Amrtya Sen has shown how British government had diverted resources to war.  --&gt;Famine can be initiated or prolonged in order to deny resources, compel obedience, or to depopulate a region with a recalcitrant or untrusted populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/starvation-is-being-used-as-a-weapon-of-war-in-syria|title=Famine Is Being Used as a Weapon of War in Syria|work=VICE|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/10/zimbabwe.famine|title=Famine becomes Mugabe weapon|author=Peter Beaumont|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2002-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/01/03/war-and-famine-in-ireland-1580-1700/#.VZb94Pmqqko|title=War and Famine in Ireland, 1580-1700|work=The Irish Story|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence between a state and non-state actor ===
At least one of the warring parties involved is the government of a state.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

==== Rebellion ====
{{Main article|Rebellion}} 
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

==== Rioting ====
{{Main article|Riot}} 
A '''riot''' can be described as a violent disturbance by a group of individuals formed to protest perceived wrongs and/or injustice. These can range from poverty and inequality to unemployment and government oppression. They can manifest themselves in a number of ways but most commonly in the form of property damage. [[Riot]]s are characterized by their lack of predictability and the anonymity of their participants. Both make it difficult for authorities to identify those participating.&lt;ref&gt;Wada, George, and James C. Davies. "Riots and Rioters". The Western Political Quarterly 10.4 (1957): 864–874. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots have been analyzed in a number of ways but most recently in the context of the frustration-aggression model theory, expressing that the aggression seen in most riots is a direct result of a groups frustration with a particular aspect of their lives.Widespread and prolonged rioting can lead to and/or produce rebellion or revolution. There are also a number of different types of riots including but not limited to police riots, [[race riots|race riot]], [[prison riots]], and [[sports riots|sport riot]].

==== Revolution ====

==== Civil War ====
{{Main article|Civil war}}
Also known as an intrastate war, a civil war is a war fought within the same state or country between organized groups. Less commonly, it can also be fought between two countries that have been created from one previously unified state. Often these conflicts involve one group wishing to take control of a region or expressing dissatisfaction with the government. There is typically a desire to overthrow the existing power or at least change some of their policies. In many cases, an outside power may intervene on behalf of one side if they share their ideology or condemn the methods/motives of their opponents.

==== Counter-insurgency ====
{{Main article|Counter-insurgency}}
'''Counter-insurgency''', another form of political violence, describes a spectrum of actions taken by the recognized government of a state to contain or quell an [[insurgency]] taken up against it.&lt;ref&gt;An ''insurgency'' is a [[rebellion]] against a constituted authority (for example an authority recognized as such by the [[United Nations]]) when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as [[belligerent]]s ([[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 "insurgent B. n. One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent.")&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different doctrines, theories, and tactics espoused regarding counter-insurgency that aim to protect the authority of the government and to reduce or eliminate the supplanting authority of the insurgents. Because it may be difficult or impossible to distinguish between an insurgent, a supporter of an insurgency who is a [[non-combatant]], and entirely uninvolved members of the population, counter-insurgency operations have often rested on a confused, relativistic, or otherwise [[situational]] distinction between insurgents and non-combatants. Counter-insurgency operations are common during [[war]], [[Military occupation|occupation]] and armed [[rebellion]]s.

=== War between states ===
{{Main article|War}}
'''War''' is a state of organized, armed, and often prolonged conflict carried on between [[State (polity)|states]], [[nation]]s, or other parties&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; typified by extreme aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality.&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century: the death toll of [[World War II]], estimated at more than 60 million, surpasses all other war death tolls by a factor of two. It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Obermeyer Z, Murray CJ, Gakidou E |title=Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1482–6 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18566045 |pmc=2440905 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a137 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Scholarship and data suggests that violence has declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/14/genocide-is-going-out-of-fashion/|title=Genocide is Going Out of Fashion|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?lang=en&amp;id=126956|title=Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide|last=Goldstein|first=Joshua|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=978-0452298590|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recently, scholars have started to question this long-held belief.

=== Long-run trends ===
Since [[World War II]], there has been a decline in battle deaths and since the [[Cold War]], there has been a decline in conflict.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2005, violent conflict around the world dropped by 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, A., 2007, 'Global Political Violence: Explaining the Post-Cold War Decline', Coping with Crisis Working Paper Series, International Peace Academy, New York&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]], [[Steven Pinker]] argues that this decline has not occurred over the past 60 years, but has been going on for over the past millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datasets on political violence have shown similar trends.

For example, the Center for Systemic Peace finds that in the post-World War II era armed conflict was at its peak when the Soviet Union collapsed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html|title=Conflict Trends|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the levels of armed conflict declined. Recently, armed conflict has begun to increase as political violence in the Middle East and Africa begins to increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] (UCDP), another project that collects armed conflict data, has found similar trends as well. UCDP defines armed conflict as conflict that involves the government of a state which "results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/|title=UCDP Definitions|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their overview of armed conflict, UCDP has found that the number of armed conflicts in the world has decreased since the end of the Cold War, yet, there has been some recent upward trends.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2015|title=Armed conflicts, 1946–2014|url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/52/4/536.abstract|journal=Journal of Peace Research|doi=10.1177/0022343315595927|pmid=|access-date=|volume=52|issue=4|pages=536–550|last1=Pettersson|first1=Therése|last2=Wallensteen|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past ten years, the UCDP has found an upward trend in the number of internationalized armed conflicts, "a conflict between a government of a state and internal opposition groups with intervention from other states."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Critique ====
Recently, the conventional wisdom that violent conflict has declined is being challenged. Scholars argue that the current data, focus on the number of battle deaths per country per year, are misleading.

Tanisha Fazal argues that wars have become less fatal because of medical advancements that help keep more people alive during wars. Therefore, the battle death threshold used by the UCDP and other organizations to determine cases of armed conflict is misleading. A conflict "that produced 1,000 battle deaths in 1820 will likely produce many fewer overall casualties (where casualties, properly understood, include the dead and wounded) than a conflict with 1,000 battle deaths today."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/09/04/the-reports-of-wars-demise-have-been-exaggerated/|title=The reports of war's demise have been exaggerated|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current data makes it seem like, war is becoming less frequent, when it is not.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fazal|first=Tanisha|date=Summer 2014|title=Dead Wrong? Battle Deaths, Military Medicine, and Exaggerated Reports of War's Demise|url=|journal=International Security|doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00166|pmid=|volume=39|pages=95–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear F. Braumoeller argues that looking at data on per-capita death is a "misleading and irrelevant statistic" because it does not tell us how wars actually happen.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=2317269|title=Is War Disappearing?|last=Braumoeller|first=Bear|date=August 27, 2013|website=|publisher=APSA Chicago 2013 Meeting|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in battle-related deaths can mean that population growth is outpacing war deaths or that "fewer people are exposed to risk of death from war".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Instead, we should examine the willingness of a state to go to war. Braumoeller creates a new metric for conflicted called the "use of force", which is the number of militarized dispute that reaches at least a level 4 on the 5-point [[Correlates of War]] Militarized Interstate Dispute scale. He finds that use of force has held steady from the 1800s through the [[World War I|First World War]], but after World War I the use of force has steadily increased. Braumoeller creates another metric called "uses of force per relevant dyad", which is the use of force between neighboring states or states with one major power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Using this metric he finds that there is no downward trend in the rates of conflict initiation since the post-World War II period. Additionally, he finds that the rates of conflict have remain steady over the past two hundred years and the slight increases and decreases in use of force are random.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Current trends ===

==== Armed conflicts ====
In 2014, UCDP estimates that 126,059 people were killed in organized violence, which is the highest fatality count in the post-Cold War period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]] had the most violent conflict followed by Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, there were 40 armed conflicts active in 27 locations in the world. This is the largest number of conflicts reported since 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Regionally, Asia had the largest amount of violent conflict at 14, followed by Africa at 12, Europe at six, Middle East at six, and the Americas at two.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During that year, four new conflicts began, all of them in [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|Ukraine]]. Three conflicts were restarted by new actors in &amp;nbsp;Egypt, Lebanon, and Libya. Additionally, six conflicts were restarted by previously registered actors in "[[Armenian–Azerbaijani border conflict|Azerbaijan (Nagorno-Karabakh),]] India ([[Garo Hills|Garoland]]), [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|India–Pakistan]], [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel (Palestine),]] [[Northern Mali conflict|Mali (Azawad)]], and [[2015 Kokang offensive|Myanmar (Kokang)]]".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, seven conflicts in 2013 were no longer active in 2014. The conflicts were in [[Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present)|Central African Republic]], Ethiopia (Oromiya), Malaysia (Sabah), [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Karen)]], [[Internal conflict in Myanmar|Myanmar (Shan)]], Mozambique, and [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Turkey (Kurdistan)]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Out of the 40 conflicts, 11 have been classified at the level of war, which means that there were at least 1,000 deaths in one calendar year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The conflict between India and Pakistan was the only interstate conflict, conflict between two or more states. Out of the remaining 39 conflicts, 13 were internationalized, a conflict between a government and internal opposition group where other states intervene. The percentage of internationalized conflict is 33% (13/39), which is the largest proportion of external actors in intrastate conflicts since the post-World War II era.

==== Terrorism ====
Just like armed conflict, there was an increase in fatalities associated with terrorism. In 2014, the [[United States Department of State|United States State Department]] reported 13,463 terrorist attacks in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/150618_Patterns_in_Global_Terrorism_in_2014.pdf|title=BROAD PATTERNS IN GLOBAL TERRORISM IN 2014|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony|date=June 19, 2015|website=Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks resulted in at least 32,700 deaths and 34,700 injuries.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, more than 9,400 people were kidnapped or taken hostage. Compared to 2013, the number of terrorist attacks increased by 35% and the total fatalities increased by 81%.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2014, the five countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks were Iraq, [[Terrorism in Pakistan|Pakistan]], Afghanistan, [[Terrorism in India|India]], and Nigeria. In 2013, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, and the [[Terrorism in the Philippines|Philippines]] were the countries that experienced the most terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2013 and 2014, the perpetrators responsible for the most terrorist attacks were [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Taliban|the Taliban]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], [[Boko Haram]], and Maoists. Fifty-five percent of the targets were either private citizens, private property, or police. 66% of attacks in Nigeria and 41% of attacks in Iraq targeted private citizens and property.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[Global Terrorism Database]] estimates that &amp;nbsp;that between 2004 and 2013, about 50% of all terrorist attacks, and 60% of fatalities due to terrorist attacks, took place in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Theories==

Theories of political violence can be organized by their [[level of analysis]]:  
* [[Level of analysis|Macro theories]] explain how political, economic, and social processes cause political violence  
* [[Level of analysis|Micro theories]] discuss political violence processes that involve individuals and households, like who participates in violence and what motivates people to participate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balcells|first=Laia|date=December 2014|title=Bridging Micro and Macro Approaches on Civil Wars and Political Violence: Issues, Challenges, and the Way Forward|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/8/1343.abstract|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|doi=10.1177/0022002714547905|pmid=|access-date=|volume=58|issue=8|pages=1343–1359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macro===

====Social conflict theory ====
[[Social conflict theory]] is a [[Marxist]]-based [[social theory]] which states that social systems reflect the vested interests of those who own and control resources. The people in power use the political and economic institutions to exploit groups with less power. This causes the rest of society to become alienated or psychologically separated from the people in power. Revolutions occur to break down the social and economic separation between the people in power and the exploited people and "to achieve equity and social unity".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collective Political Violence: An Introduction to the Theories and Cases of Violent Conflicts|last=Conteh-Morgan|first=Earl|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415947435|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== War's inefficiency puzzle ====
[[War's inefficiency puzzle]] explains why states go to war even though war is costly. In [[James Fearon]]’s ''Rationalist Explanations for War'', he asserts war is costly and that creates an incentive to bargain with the other side. However, states do not bargain and instead go to war because of private information on the capability to fight and the incentives to misrepresent this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|date=Summer 1995|title=Rationalist Explanations for War|jstor=2706903|journal=International Organization|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid=|volume=49|issue=3|pages=379–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Functionalism ====
[[Functionalism (sociology)|Functionalism]] sees society as "an organism whose entire system has to be in good working order for systemic equilibrium to be maintained."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, when there is an unexpected shock to the system, society becomes disorientated allowing for collective violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mass society ====
[[Mass society]] argues that violent social movements come from people who are isolated socially and from political institutions. People who are alienated are easily convinced to join radical or extremist movements.

==== Resource mobilization ====
[[Resource mobilization]] is a theory on social movement that emphasizes the capacity of competing groups to organize and use adequate resources to achieve their goals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The resources can be time, money, organizational skills, and certain social or political opportunities. Political violence occurs when individuals are able to mobilize sufficient resources to take action.

==== Primordialism ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Primordialism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. "Interethnic differences based on racial, language, religious, regional characteristics, and other visible markers produce interethnic conflicts because members of that same group emotionally identify with their in-group, but feel no such identify with those outside their ethnic group."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

==== Instrumentalist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Instrumentalism]] is an explanation of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnicity is not inherent in human nature. Conflict occurs when leaders manipulate ethnicity for the sake of political power or economic gain.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashutoshvarshney.net/wp-content/files_mf/varshneyethnicityandethnicconflict.pdf|title=Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflict|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Constructivist ====
[[Ethnic conflict|Constructivist]] is an explanations of [[ethnic violence]] and [[ethnic conflict]]. Ethnic and national identities are socially constructed and are formed through social, economic and political processes, like colonization and conquest. Ethnic conflict is a product of the factors shaping ethnic identity and not from ethnicity itself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Youth bulge ====
A [[Population pyramid|youth bulge]] occurs when there is disproportionate percentage of a state population being between the ages of 15 and 24 years old. It occurs when infant mortality rates decrease and fertility rate increase. This youth bulge increases the working-age population; however, it does not translate to more jobs being available, which leads to severe unemployment. This will cause the young adult male population to "prolong dependency on parents, diminish self-esteem and fuel frustrations".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/effects-youth-bulge-civil-conflicts/p13093|title=The Effects of 'Youth Bulge' on Civil Conflicts|last=Beehner|first=Lionel|date=April 27, 2007|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads the youth to "seek social and economic advancement by alternative, extralegal means", which means that the [[opportunity cost]]s to join armed movements are low.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Micro===

====Rational choice theory====
[[Rational choice theory]] is a decision-making approach in which the decisions makers compare the expected utility of competing options and select the option that produces the most favorable outcome. Political violence occurs when the benefits in participating in political violence outweighs the costs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Relative deprivation ====
In ''Why Men Rebel'', [[Ted Robert Gurr]] uses [[Relative deprivation|relative deprivation theory]] to explain why men commit acts of violence. As Gurr explains, relative deprivation "is defined as actors' perception of discrepancy between their value expectations and their value capabilities."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why Men Rebel|last=Gurr|first=Ted|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1594519147|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, relative deprivation is the gap between the wants and needs we{{Who|date=August 2016}} feel we deserve versus what we are capable of "getting and keeping."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The collective discontent, the gap between the expected and achieved welfare, leads people to resort to violence.

==== Collective action theory ====
[[Collective action theory]] explains why people participate in rebellions.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Edward N.|last2=Opp|first2=Karl-Dieter|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and Rebellious Collective Action|jstor=1958269|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=80|issue=2|pages=471–488|doi=10.2307/1958269}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person decides to participate or not participate in a rebellion based on the benefits and costs. Generally, people decide to be [[Free rider problem|free riders]] and not to participate in the rebellion. These people will still receive the benefits of the rebellion since the benefits are a [[public good]]. However, if people are expected to receive [[private good]]s, like material rewards or power, then that person is expected to rebel.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Greed versus grievance ====
[[Greed versus grievance]] provides two lines of explanations as to why individuals will fight. Individuals are said to be motivated by greed when they decide to join a conflict in an effort to better their situation and find that benefits of joining a rebellion or any kind of collective violence is greater than not joining.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Paul|last2=Hoeffler|first2=Anke|date=2004-10-01|title=Greed and grievance in civil war|url=http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/563|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|language=en|volume=56|issue=4|pages=563–595|doi=10.1093/oep/gpf064|issn=0030-7653|citeseerx=10.1.1.17.7530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are said to be motivated by grievance when they fight over "high inequality, a lack of political rights or ethnic and religious divisions in society."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In "Greed and Grievance in Civil War", Paul Collier and Anke Hoeffler argue that greed is a better predictor of participating in violence than grievance.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

In the aftermath of political violence, there are many changes that occur within the state, society, and the individual.

=== Macro ===
Social science literature that examines how political violence affects the region, state, nation, and society.

==== State-building ====

Charles Tilly argues that "war making", eliminating rivals outside a territory, "state making", eliminating rivals within a territory, "protection", protecting subjects within a territory, and "extraction", extracting resources to "[carry] out the first three activities", are what defines a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Making and State Making as Organized Crime|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=9780521313131|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four actives depend on the state's ability to use and monopolize violence. In other words, politically and non-politically motivated violence is necessary in state-building and building [[fiscal capacity]].

=== Micro===

There are a growing number of social science studies that examine how political violence affects individuals and households. It is important to keep in mind that what happens at the individual and household level can affect what happens at the macro level. For example, political violence effects an individual's income, health, and education attainment, but these individual consequences combined can effect a state or nation's economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2010-03-01|title=Civil War|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=48|issue=1|pages=3–57|doi=10.1257/jel.48.1.3|issn=0022-0515}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the macro and micro consequences of political violence do not occur in a vacuum.

====Political impacts====

There are empirical studies that link violence with increases in political participation. One [[natural experiment]] examines the effect of being abducted by [[Joseph Kony]]'s [[Lord's Resistance Army|LRA]] on political participation. An abducted male Ugandan youth, or in other words a former child soldier, had a greater probability of voting for [[Ugandan multi-party referendum, 2005|Uganda's 2005 referendum]] and being a community mobilizer/leader than a male Ugandan youth who wasn't abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman|first=Christopher|date=2009-05-01|title=From Violence to Voting: War and Political Participation in Uganda|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0003055409090212|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=103|issue=2|pages=231–247|doi=10.1017/S0003055409090212|issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this effect is not just contained to Uganda. Another natural experiment on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or made refugees, were more likely to register to vote, attend community meetings, and participate in local political and community groups than households that did not experience violence.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bellows|first=John|last2=Miguel|first2=Edward|date=2009-12-01|title=War and local collective action in Sierra Leone|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272709000942|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=93|issue=11–12|pages=1144–1157|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic impacts====

A study on the effects of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone civil war]] found that victimized households, household whose members were killed, injured, maimed, captured, or displaced, did not have long-term impacts on owning assets, child nutrition, consumption expenditures and earnings.&lt;ref name="Bellows 1144–1157"/&gt;

== Datasets ==

===Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) ===
{{Main article|Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project}}

The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) is a project that collates data on political violence and protest in developing states, from 1997 to the present. As of early 2016, ACLED has recorded over 100,000 individual events, with ongoing data collection focused on Africa and ten countries in South and Southeast Asia. The data can be used for medium- and long-term analysis and mapping of political violence across developing countries through use of historical data from 1997, as well as informing humanitarian and development work in crisis and conflict-affected contexts through real time data updates and reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acleddata.com/|title=ACLED - ACLED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACLED defines "political violence" as "the use of force by a group with a political purpose or motivation." The database uses this definition to catalog a number of what it refers to as political events across Africa and South East Asia. Political events are described as "a single altercation where often force is used by one or more groups for a political end. The data project catalogs nine different types of events.&lt;ref name="acleddata.com"&gt;http://www.acleddata.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ACLED_Codebook_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Security Report Project===
{{Main article|Human Security Report Project}}

The [[Human Security Report Project]] or '''HSRP''' catalogs global and regional trends in organized violence, their causes and consequences. Research findings and analyses are published in the Human Security Report, Human Security Brief series, and the miniAtlas of Human Security based in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/about-hsrp/about-us.aspx|title=Human Security Report Project: About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data from the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], the report tracks 5 types of violence 
* '''State-based armed conflict''' are cataloged as international conflicts and civil wars—in which at least
one of the warring parties is the government of a state.
'''Interstate Conflicts''' are conflicts between two states. 
'''Intrastate Conflicts''' happen within a state such as a civil war. 
* '''Non-state armed conflicts''' are conflicts which consist of fighting between two armed groups,
neither of which is the government of a state
* '''One-sided violence''' is thought of as targeted attacks against unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="hsrgroup.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana.

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''red-green-brown alliance''', originating in [[France]], refers to the alleged alliance of [[Left-wing politics|Leftists]] (''red''), ecologically-minded agrarians (''green''), and [[Islamism|Islamists]] (''brown'').&lt;ref name="Judaken 2013 p. 197"&gt;{{cite book | last=Judaken | first=J. | title=Naming Race, Naming Racisms | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-317-99156-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haraAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197 | page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedgwick 2004 p. 258"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sedgwick | first=M. | title=Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-19-974493-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcUFmQ-NF_0C&amp;pg=PA258 | page=258f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood Hutchings Miazhevich Nickels 2012 p. 137"&gt;{{cite book | last=Flood | first=C. | last2=Hutchings | first2=S. | last3=Miazhevich | first3=G. | last4=Nickels | first4=H. | title=Political and Cultural Representations of Muslims: Islam in the Plural | publisher=Brill | series=Muslim Minorities | year=2012 | isbn=978-90-04-23102-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQ6OFETxDWAC&amp;pg=PA137 | page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

French essayist [[Alexandre del Valle]] wrote of "une alliance idéologique ... rouge-brun-vert" (''a red-green brown ... ideological alliance'') in an 22 April 2002 article in the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'',&lt;ref name="Del Valle &amp; Knobel 2002"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Del Valle |first1=Alexandre |last2=Knobel |first2=Marc | title=Le Péril rouge en France ou la convergence des Totalitarismes |trans-title=The Red Peril in France: The convergence of totalitarianisms |work=Le Figaro | date=27 April 2002 &lt;!-- 22 April 2002? --&gt; | url=http://blog.alexandredelvalle.com/archives/12-Le-Peril-rouge-en-France-ou-la-convergence-des-Totalitarismes.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418232132/http://blog.alexandredelvalle.com/archives/12-Le-Peril-rouge-en-France-ou-la-convergence-des-Totalitarismes.html | archive-date=18 April 2012 | dead-url=yes | language=fr}} Also available from [https://harissa.com/D_forum/Judaisme/laconvergence.htm harissa.com].&lt;!-- Unable to locate a copy from Le Figaro --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "Rouges-Bruns-Verts, l'étrange alliance", in a January 2004 article in the magazine ''Politique Internationale''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Del Valle, [http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=24&amp;id=522&amp;content=synopsisin "Rouges-Bruns-Verts : L'étrange alliance"], Politique Internationale, no. 102 (january 2004), [https://www.alexandredelvalle.com/single-post/2004/12/06/The-Reds-The-Browns-and-the-Greens-or-The-Convergence-of-Totalitarianisms official translation]. Retrieved 7 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Valle's conceptual rendering of Islamist ideological trends appears to be based, at least partially, on earlier writings in which he had charged the United States and western Europe with favouring the "war machine" of "armed Islamism" via its funding of the Afghani [[mujahideen]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] during the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Murawiec |first=Laurent |authorlink=Laurent Murawiec |title=The wacky world of French intellectuals |work=Middle East Quarterly |publisher=[[Middle East Forum]] |date=Spring 2000 |volume=8 |p=3-10 |url=https://www.meforum.org/articles/other/the-wacky-world-of-french-intellectuals}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped future enemies of the West.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 2010, Del Valle published in Italy an essay entitled "{{lang|it|Rossi, Neri, Verdi: a convergenza degli Estremi opposti}}" (Red, Black, Green: The meeting of extreme opposites.)&lt;ref&gt;A. Del Valle, [http://www.loccidentale.it/articoli/82697/verdi-rossi-e-neri-chi-sono-i-nemici-delloccidente-e-perche-ci-odiano-cosi "Verdi, rossi e neri: chi sono i nemici dell'Occidente e perché ci odiano così], L'Occidentale (3 December 2009). Retrieved 7 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The later popularity of the ''red-green-brown'' theory (and its various permutations) derives mainly from a speech given by [[Roger Cukierman]], president of the French Jewish organization [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], to a CRIF banquet on 25 January 2003, and given wide circulation by a 27/28 January 2003 article in ''[[Le Monde]]''. Cukierman used the French term "alliance brun-vert-rouge" to describe the antisemitic alignment supposedly shared by "an extreme right nostalgic for racial hierarchies" (symbolized by the color [[Sturmabteilung|brown]]), "an extreme left [which is] anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, anti-American [and] anti-Zionist" (red), and followers of [[José Bové]] (green).

In Great Britain in 2003, politician [[George Galloway]] announced that he was seeking "to unify the [[Socialism|red]], [[Green politics|green]], [[Opposition to the Iraq War|anti-war]], [[Islam in the United Kingdom|Muslim]] and other social constituencies radicalised by [[Iraq War|the war]]".&lt;ref name="Peace 2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=All I'm asking, is for a little respect: Assessing the Performance of Britain's Most Successful Radical Left Party |last=Peace |first=Timothy |year=2013 |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |volume=66 |pages=405–424 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsr064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|407}} Shortly thereafter, led by [[Salma Yaqoob]] and [[George Monbiot]], the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] formed an alliance in the [[Respect Party]], under which Galloway ran for office. Respect initially tried to form an electoral pact with the [[Green Party of England and Wales]],{{r|Peace 2013|pp=407–408}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tempest [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/17/iraq.iraq1 "Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but the Green Party refused to ally with Respect, saying that Respect did not align with their values of openness and democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cohen |first=Nick |date=2004 |title=Saddam's very own party |work=[[New Statesman]] |volume=13 |p=326-328 |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/195042}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Green Party 2004}} and had an under-developed [[political platform]] among other issues.&lt;ref name="Green Party 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/1008/l=7|title=Greens regret attack by Galloway/SWP "Respect" party|accessdate=23 April 2007|year=2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070413142818/http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/1008/l=7 |archivedate = 13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a similar alliance of disparate groups occurred in opposition to the [[World Trade Organization]] in the [[alter-globalization movement]], which joined trade unions, [[neo-Luddite]] environmentalists, and [[paleoconservative]] [[Nationalism|nationalists]] like [[Pat Buchanan]] in common cause.&lt;ref name="The Buchanan Troll Project"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Buchanan Troll Project |work=MetroWest Jewish News |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=13 January 2000 |location=Whippany, NJ, USA |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/364868971 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;!-- fully noted --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many were surprised by leftist [[Lenora Fulani]]'s support for Pat Buchanan, which has been viewed as an example of a red–green–brown alliance.&lt;ref name="Twersky 2000"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Twersky |first=David |date=27 January 2000 |title=Buchanan's voice bodes ill for israel |work=Jewish Exponent |volume=207 |number=4 |p=36 |location=Philadelphia, USA |publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/227249240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard H. Nolte''' (December 27, 1920 &amp;ndash; November 22, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[Middle East]] expert and [[diplomat]]. Nolte was the second director of the [[Institute of Current World Affairs]].&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Holley|title= Middle East Expert Richard H. Nolte |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/27/AR2007112702493.html|work= [[Washington Post]] |publisher= |date=2007-11-28 |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed ambassador to the [[United Arab Republic]], which was the name of [[Egypt]] at the time, but never served due to the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Early life==
Nolte was born on December 27, 1920 in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] to Julius and Mildred Miller Nolte.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|title= Richard Nolte, Three-Week Ambassador During Six-Day War, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/world/middleeast/04nolte.html |work= [[New York Times]] |publisher= |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[European Studies]] at [[Yale University]] in 1943.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

He served as a [[U.S. Navy]] pilot in [[World War II]] from 1943 to 1945&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; following his graduation.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He returned to Yale following his discharge from the Navy and earned a [[master's degree]] in [[international relations]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He earned a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and began studying [[Arabic]], [[Arab history]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]]&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; at [[Oxford University]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Career==
Nolte and his wife lived in [[Beirut, Lebanon]] from 1951 until 1957, thanks to a grant from the [[Institute of Current World Affairs]]. He also taught at [[Dartmouth College]] in the late 1950s before serving as a Middle East specialist for the American Universities Field Staff.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Nolte was appointed as the second [[executive director]] of the Institute of Current World Affairs in 1959, a position he held until 1978. (The ICWA was founded in 1925 by Walter Rogers). He often awarded fellowships not just to the traditional fields of diplomacy and journalism, but also to a wide array of disciplines such as music ([[Roger Reynolds]]) and dieticians ([[Andrew Weil]]). He was best known at the Institute for appointing its first woman fellow, Barbara Bright, a [[journalist]] who studied in Germany.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

[[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] named Nolte as the U.S. [[ambassador]] to Egypt in 1967 because of his expertise in Middle Eastern affairs.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; He arrived in Cairo on May 21, 1967.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; However, the [[Six-Day War]] broke out just two hours before Nolte was due to present his diplomatic [[credentials]] to [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] on June 5, 1967.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; Nolte instead spent his first week in [[Cairo, Egypt]], helping to arrange passage home for Americans stranded in Egypt by the war.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Nasser had refused to meet with Nolte because the United States had allied with [[Israel]] during the war.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was expelled from Egypt on June 10, 1967, just one day before the [[ceasefire]] which halted the war.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' later called Nolte's short three week term as ambassador "one of the shortest and most hectic diplomatic careers on record."&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; Nolte reportedly expected to be offered another [[ambassadorship]] somewhere in the Middle East, but [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] refused to offer Nolte another position because he viewed Nolte as an [[Arabist]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Ironically, Nolte supported Nasser specifically and the Arab side of the conflict with Israel in general, producing diplomatic cables that argued the U.S. should ignore its pledge to Israel that it would not allow Egypt to cut off the Sinai Peninsula via the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels. According to Benjamin Foldy, when Egyptian officials suddenly agreed to meet with the U.S. and opened up an official embassy channel to get their demands to Washington, Nolte held talks with Egyptian government representatives on providing a "pro-Arab" response (providing recognition of the Egypt-Syrian [[United Arab Republic]], declaring Israel to be the aggressor in the conflict, and drafting a UN Security Council resolution to force Israel to withdraw from any territories they'd won in the conflict) to the disastrous results for Cairo as Egyptian forces were routedby Israelis. However, his recommendations to the State Department were completely ignored, as the incompetent work of Arabist diplomats before the war had left LBJ's Administration uninterested in listening to any of their suggestions.

Nolte served as the chairman of the [[American Geographical Society]] from 1988 until 1996. The American Geographical Society, founded in 1851, provides [[geographic]] consulting to American foreign [[policymaker]]s. Nolte led the Society's 1978 negotiations with the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] when the AGS transferred ownership of its [[map]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the school.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

He also served as a member of a number of other organizations concerned with international relations. Nolte served on the [[board of directors]] and as a past president of the [[Near East Foundation]]. He was also a member of the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Arctic Institute of North America]] and the [[Alicia Patterson Foundation]]. He also became an active board member of the National Aphasia Association after his wife, Jeanne McQuarrie Nolte, suffered a stroke and lost her ability to speak.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

Nolte and 16 other former American [[diplomats]] wrote a letter to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2004 urging the President's administration to change its [[foreign policy]] in the Middle East. The letter criticized the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] for placing U.S. [[troops]], diplomats and civilians "in an untenable and even dangerous position."&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

==Death==
Richard Nolte died of complications from a [[stroke]] at his home in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], on November 22, 2007.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was 86 years old and was survived by his wife, Jeanne McQuarrie Nolte, and four sons.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

'''Ronald H. Chilcote''' (born February 20, 1935) is Edward A. Dickson Emeritus Professor of Economics and Political Science at the [[University of California, Riverside]], and has served as Managing Editor of the academic journal ''[[Latin American Perspectives]]'' since its founding in 1974.  Chilcote is known for his scholarship on Brazil, Portugal, and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa as well as for his work on comparative politics and [[political economy]] and [[development theory]].

== Background and education ==
Chilcote came from an upper-middle-class Republican family that owned a small business in Cleveland, Ohio, that manufactured photo mounts. Following family tradition, Chilcote attended [[Dartmouth College]] where he was introduced to progressive thought during his senior year as a member of the English poetry circle, dedicated to encouraging promising writers, led by [[Richard Eberhart]]. Through Eberhart’s seminar, he met [[Richard Wilbur]] (then at Smith College), [[Donald Hall]], and [[Robert Frost]], and later, at Stanford, he attended the literature courses of [[Yvor Winters]] and [[Wallace Stegner]].

After returning from an extended stay in Europe, he enrolled in Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, received an M.B.A., and experienced an unexpectedly radicalizing period when he was funded to conduct a study of U.S. business in Guatemala and Chile, hitchhiked through other countries, and even visited Cuba on the eve of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Exposure to Latin America’s extreme inequality led him to [[Ronald Hilton]]’s M. A. program in at Stanford and then into a Ph.D. program in political economy, including studies with [[Paul Baran]].  His interest in the roots of Latin American poverty shaped his long-term research agenda, beginning with a doctoral dissertation on Spain and continuing with a book on Portugal and the Portuguese colonies in Africa. This work occurred under the fascist regimes of [[Francisco Franco]] in Spain and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in Portugal, and it included a research trip to the then-Portuguese colony of Angola where he was arrested by the Portuguese secret police in Luanda and held prisoner and interrogated for ten days. Denied the possibility of returning to Portugal, he refocused his research on Brazil, especially the high poverty Northeast.

He and Frances Bunker Chilcote have been married since 1961 and they have two sons, Edward and Stephen.

== Career ==

=== Teaching ===
Chilcote taught in the Departments of Economics and Political Science at the University of California Riverside (UCR) from 1964 to 1994 where he was honored with the Distinguished Teaching Award. Since 1994, he has been Professor Emeritus.  With a Ford Foundation grant he headed up the Latin American Research Program at UCR during the 1960s.  He was a founder of the Latin American Studies major, served as Director of the Program on Latin American Studies for over 15 years, and as Professor Emeritus continues to serve on the Latin American Studies Steering Committee.  He also established the UC Brazil Studies Center in Rio de Janeiro and served as its Director from 1992-1994.

His role in graduate education included starting a graduate program in comparative political economy and chairing 40 dissertation committees and serving on an additional 24 for Ph.D. degrees awarded at UCR, UCLA, Rutgers, SUNY, and other universities. He also provided opportunities for graduate students to develop professional writing, editing, and reviewing skills as ''Latin American Perspectives'' interns.

=== Journal Editorship: ''Latin American Perspectives'' ===
Chilcote was a founder of the academic journal ''[[Latin American Perspectives]]''(LAP) which was launched in 1974 as a new scholarly space to bring together academics and other intellectuals, both within and outside Latin America, for critical theoretical and empirical work on cutting-edge topics that had few academic outlets in the United States at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abu-El-Haj|first1=Jawdat|title=A Progressive Collective Intellectual and Its Social Knowledge|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=November 2013|volume=40|issue=6|pages=13–55|doi=10.1177/0094582X13505447}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organized as an independent editorial collective, with Chilcote serving as the elected Managing Editor from its founding to the present.  It emphasized scholarship that analyzes national and transnational systems of power and the movements for structural transformation, social justice and human rights in Latin America.  The founders highlighted the importance of political economy and opened its pages to a range of approaches, including Marxism. They were committed to LAP addressing significant theoretical debates and to bringing the work of Latin American scholars to an English-speaking readership, including translating Spanish and Portuguese manuscripts.

This thrust was evident in LAP’s first issue, which focused on the debates within [[dependency theory]] in Latin America, with a lead article by Chilcote, “Dependency: A Critical Synthesis of the Literature”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilcote|first1=Ronald H.|title=Dependency: a Critical Synthesis of the Literature|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=March 1974|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–29|doi=10.1177/0094582X7400100101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributions from leading Latin American theorists.  Subsequently, (LAP, Summer-Fall 1981), he considered the relationship of dependency and Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Chilcote|editor1-first=Ronald H.|title=Dependency and Marxism|journal=Latin American Perspectives|issue=July 1981|pages=3–4|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A consistent proponent of [[class analysis]], Chilcote critiqued the [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] theoretical currents that developed as approaches to new social movements, as expressed in his lead article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilcote|first1=Ronald H.|title=Post-Marxism: The Retreat from Class in Latin America|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=April 1990|volume=17|issue=2|pages=3–24|doi=10.1177/0094582X9001700201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in LAP’s 1990 thematic issue on  “Post-Marxism, the Left, and Democracy.”  Since the setbacks for Latin American revolutionary movements and the collapse of the Soviet Union, journal content reflected the shift toward critical analysis of the ascendant [[Washington Consensus]] around [[neoliberalism]] and the resistance to it by social movements. LAP approached neoliberal [[globalization]] from the perspective of [[imperialism]] and class analysis as illustrated by Chilcote’s article “Globalization or Imperialism?” in the November 2002 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilcote|first1=Ronald H.|title=Globalization or Imperialism?|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=November 2002|volume=29|issue=6|pages=80–84|doi=10.1177/0094582X0202900607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Chilcote’s leadership, the LAP editorial collective engaged in internal discussion of topics such as the significance of the [[Cuban Revolution]] on its fiftieth anniversary and President Obama’s Latin American policy and published the resulting statements in the journal in January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On Celebrating the Cuban Revolution|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=January 2009|volume=36|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1177/0094582X08328964}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and July 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dangerous Complacencies: Obama, Latin America, and the Misconceptions of Power|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=July 2011|volume=38|issue=4|pages=14–28|doi=10.1177/0094582X11406843}}&lt;/ref&gt;  respectively.  The latter was part of a broader Obama Initiative that included a featured session chaired by Chilcote at the [[Latin American Studies Association]] Congress in Toronto in 2010 and resolutions on Obama’s policy and Cuba submitted by LAP editors.

=== Book editorships ===

==== ''Latin American Perspectives'' Book Series ====

Chilcote currently edits the ''Latin American Perspectives'' in the Classroom and Critical Currents book series for [[Rowman and Littlefield]].  The Classroom series introduces students in the social sciences and Latin American studies to important themes and issues about Latin America that have appeared in the journal. The nine books in the series contain articles edited to be accessible to nonspecialists. Each text includes both general and section introductions to contextualize the concepts and topics that follow.

The Critical Currents series emphasizes examination of the institutional, political, economic, and social forces that are shaping contemporary Latin America, considered in a context of current theoretical issues and debates.  The 13 books in the series are intended for scholars, advanced students, and general readers alike.

Chilcote previously edited Latin American Perspectives Monographs with 24 titles for Westview Press (1980-2000).

=== Scholarly research and writing ===
Chilcote is the author of over 200 academic publications, including books, book chapters, and peer-reviewed journal articles, with emphasis on comparative politics, political economy, and development economics. He was one of the earliest U.S. scholars to assess Latin American [[dependency theory]], as in his lead article in the first issue of ''Latin American Perspectives'', “Dependency: A Critical Synthesis of the Literature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilcote|first1=Ronald H.|title=Dependency: a Critical Synthesis of the Literature|journal=Latin American Perspectives|date=March 1974|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–29|doi=10.1177/0094582X7400100101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also edited and/or contributed to several additional LAP issues on the subject.  His work on dependency includes the book, ''Latin America: The Struggle with Dependency and Beyond'' (1974), edited with his student and colleague Joel Edelstein, which was extensively used as a college text and went through eight printings. His ''Theories of Comparative Politics'' was for two decades a leading book for advanced graduate study in the United States and elsewhere, and he wrote two major books on comparative political economy as well as an anthology of retrospective essays on imperialism.

Chilcote is recognized for his scholarship on Brazil, Portugal, and the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, all of which he has visited extensively in the course of his research. His pioneering work on Lusophone Africa during the 1960s provided a foundation for an African perspective critical of the Portuguese presence in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and Cape Verde. He published a book on the African revolutionary, Amílcar Cabral, who inspired and led the independence movements. He has written four major books on Brazil, three of them translated and appearing in Portuguese. His 2010 book ''The Portuguese Revolution: State and Class in the Transition to Democracy'' culminates decades of research to analyze the 1974–1975 Portuguese revolution and its aftermath through periods of authoritarianism and resistance as well as representative and popular democracy. His 2014 book ''Intellectuals and the Search for National Identity in Twentieth Century Brazil'' likewise draws on his decades of research in Brazil and the relationships he developed with Brazilian intellectuals, more than one hundred of whom were interviewed for the book.

His work has appeared in Brazilian, Malaysian, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Iranian editions.

For his scholarship, Chilcote received three Fulbright awards, two Social Science Research Council grants, Organization of American States and Mellon-SOCCIS Latin American Fellowships, and Rockefeller and Ford Foundation grants.

=== Research archives and fellowship ===

==== Ronald H. Chilcote Collection ====

Chilcote donated more than 12,000 books and other research materials to the UCR library to establish the Ronald H. Chilcote collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald H. Chilcote Ccollection on Latin America, Collection 012, University of California, Riverside Libraries, Special Collections &amp; Archives|website=http://latinamericanperspectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ChilcoteArchiveUCR12.pdf|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the politics, economy, and history of Latin America, Portugal, and Portuguese-speaking Africa. Highlights include rare books and periodicals on Brazilian left movements; approximately four thousand literary pamphlets of social poetry, drawn from the singing and writing of troubadours (Cordel); books, ephemera, and research, including written and audio interviews, on Northeast Brazil, in particular its hinterland or sertão; books and pamphlets on the Portuguese revolution of 1974-1975 and its aftermath, including audio interviews and transcripts with participants; comprehensive writings by and about the revolutionary, Amílcar Cabral; pamphlets, leaflets, films, and newspaper clippings on Central American political and resistance movements as well as covert and overt cases of intervention in Latin America; audio cassettes, videotapes, and books on the Iran-Contra Affair; and materials on the Southern Cone, especially Chile.

==== ''Latin American Perspectives'' archives ====

In 2000, Chilcote placed the complete archives of Latin American Perspectives, including all manuscripts submitted, publication decisions, editorial board minutes, annual reports and other working documents, in the UCR Library and recruited additional donations from other scholars.

==== ''Latin American Perspectives'' Visiting Scholar Fellowship ====

To facilitate use of all these materials and other Latin American resources at the UCR library, Chilcote led the effort to establish an endowment to fund the ''Latin American Perspectives'' Visiting Scholar Fellowship to bring scholars from outside the United States to the library for a research residency of several weeks to two months. Since 2007 there have been six recipients.

=== Photography and environmental activism ===
An active environmentalist, Chilcote has also been deeply involved in conservation and wilderness protection campaigns, especially in California and Wyoming. Since 1974 he has served as a board director of Laguna Greenbelt that was able to preserve twenty-two thousand acres of land in a rapidly urbanizing area of Southern California. He has combined this environmental activism with his work as a landscape and nature photographer.  To use photography to promote the preservation of pristine environments, with the late Jerry Burchfield he founded Laguna Wilderness Press, which since 2003 has published 13 books of photography including three with his own work.  ''Nature's Laguna Wilderness'' includes 80 color photographs of this area he helped to preserve; the book received a five-page review in a Sunday section of the ''Los Angeles Times'', and in 2014 it was published in a completely revised and expanded edition. ''Wind River Wilderness'' features photos and text on Wyoming's Wind River Range, Wyoming Range, Upper Hoback and Gros Ventre Range, and Red Desert with photos by Chilcote and several other photographers.  A third book, ''Wild Wyoming Range Wilderness'', appeared in early 2013.  Book sales helped raise some of the $8.4 million used to save a pristine area from development when the Trust for Public Land announced a buyback of oil and gas leases. Since 1998 Chilcote's photographs have been exhibited at many art galleries in Southern California and Wyoming, including a retrospective of 60 of his photographs of the Laguna Wilderness which were shown at the Founders Gallery of Soka University of America from January to August 2012.

He combined his interest in photography with his love for Latin America by editing and publishing ''At the Hour of Combat: Sabino Osuna's Photographs of the Mexican Revolution''. The book features dramatic black and white previously unpublished photographs of the revolution during the 1908-1922 period.  It was previewed at the 2012 LASA Congress but was formally launched in August, followed by his co-curated  exhibition of 56 prints from the Osuna archive which opened November 10, 2012, at the California Museum of Photography in Riverside.  The exhibit has moved to various university campuses, especially where Latin American studies programs are prominent, has been shown in Mexico, and will ultimately be permanently exhibited at the UC Casa de California in Mexico City.

A '''Santa Special''' is a special [[Christmas]] rail service, common on heritage steam railways (or sometimes on mainline railways, as is done by the [[RPSI]] in Ireland),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Ho Ho Ho...'Santa Specials' 2003|url=http://www.rpsi-online.org/photonews/santapage/| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; where children are given the opportunity to meet "[[Santa Claus]]".

The revenues derived from Santa Specials make an important contribution to the finances of the railways as they attract large numbers of families during the off-peak winter period.

[[File:ПГУ_им._Шолом-Алейхема.jpg|thumb|Sholem Aleichem Amur State University]]
'''Sholem Aleichem Amur State University''' ({{lang-ru|Приамурский государственный университет имени Шолом-Алейхема}}), formerly '''Birobidzhan State Pedagogical Institute''', is a [[university]] in [[Russia]]. This is the only university based in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]. It is named after Jewish-Russian author [[Sholem Aleichem]].

==Overview==
The university works in cooperation with the local Jewish community of [[Birobidzhan]] and the [[Birobidzhan Synagogue]]. It is unique in the [[Russian Far East]]. The basis of the training courses is study of the [[Hebrew language]], history and classic [[Jewish]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Информационно-аналитическое управление правительства ЕАО |url=http://www.eao.ru/eng/?p=365 |title=Еврейская автономная область - официальный портал |publisher=Eao.ru |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] has grown interest in its [[Jewish]] roots. Students study Hebrew and [[Yiddish]] at the Jewish school and Birobidzhan Jewish National University. In 1989, the Jewish Center founded a [[Sunday school]], where children can study Yiddish, learn [[Jewish]] [[folk dance|folk]]  [[dance]], and  [[history of Israel]]. The [[Israeli government]] helps fund this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204084032/http://vn.vladnews.ru/Arch/2000/ISS207/focus.html |archivedate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the first Birobidzhan International Summer Program for Yiddish Language and Culture was launched by Boris Kotlerman, a Yiddish studies professor at [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2all.co.il/web/Sites/yiddishproject/ |title=Yiddish Summer School in Birobidzhan, Home |publisher=2all.co.il |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish is still the region’s second [[official language]] after [[Russian language|Russian]], although it is spoken only by a handful of 4,000 remaining Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liphshiz |first=Cnaan |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/account/new/index |title=Index for a million documents on Polish Jewry to go online &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070621171021/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/article/20070814Yiddishprogram.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program includes a workshop on the village of [[Valdgeym]] and its Yiddish [[Cultural heritage|heritage]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''The Group''' was an informal but highly influential [[Not-for-profit arts organization|art association]] formed in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] in 1927. Initially begun by ex-students from [[Ilam School of Fine Arts|Canterbury College of Art]], its aim was to provide a freer, more experimental alternative to the academic salon painting exhibitions of the [[Canterbury Society of Arts]]. The Group exhibited annually for 50 years, from 1927 to 1977, and was continuously at the forefront of New Zealand art's [[avant-garde]] scene.

Many of the country's best-known artists were associated at some time with The Group, among them [[Colin McCahon]], [[Doris Lusk]], [[Toss Woollaston]], [[Rita Angus]], [[Olivia Spencer Bower]], [[Leo Bensemann]], [[Rata Lovell-Smith]], [[Philip Trusttum]], and [[Douglas MacDiarmid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 15.  – Canterbury region – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-15|website = www.teara.govt.nz|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en|first = New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last = Taonga}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of The Group extended into other areas of New Zealand culture through the collaborations and friendship of members with the likes of writer and editor [[Charles Brasch]] and composer [[Douglas Lilburn]].&lt;ref name="Bensemann"&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/leo-bensemann-friends-portraiture-and-the-group&lt;/ref&gt; Its influence was such that it is occasionally referred to as "[[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] South".&lt;ref name="Bensemann"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">[[file:Pierre de touche.jpg|thumb|Touchstone set]]

A '''touchstone''' is a small tablet of dark stone such as [[fieldstone]], [[slate]], or [[lydite]], used for [[Metallurgical assay|assay]]ing [[precious metal]] [[alloy]]s. It has a finely grained surface on which soft [[metal]]s leave a visible trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/203901 |title=Touchstone |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The touchstone was used by the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] about 3500 BC for testing the purity of soft metals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
It was also used in [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bisht |first=R. S. |year=1982 |chapter=Excavations at Banawali: 1974-77 |editor-last=Possehl |editor-first=Gregory L. |title=Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective |location=New Delhi |publisher=Oxford and IBH Publishing Co. |pages=113–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==

Drawing a line with gold on a touchstone will leave a visible trace. Because different alloys of gold have different colours (see [[gold#Color|gold]]) the unknown sample can be compared to samples of known purity. This method has been used since ancient times. In modern times, additional tests can be done. The trace will react in different ways to specific concentrations of [[nitric acid]] or [[aqua regia]], thereby identifying the quality of the gold. Thus, 24 [[Carat (purity)|carat]] gold is not affected but 14 carat gold will show chemical activity.

[[File:Treehouse of Horror series DVD.jpg|thumb|Cover of a DVD collection of "Treehouse of Horror" episodes]]

'''''Treehouse of Horror''''', also known as '''''The Simpsons'' Halloween specials''', are a series of [[Halloween]] specials within the [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the [[Simpson family]] in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or [[supernatural]] setting. They take place outside the show's normal [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic, being known for their far more violent and much darker nature than an average ''Simpsons'' episode.  The first, entitled "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]", aired on October 25, 1990, as part of the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] and was inspired by [[EC Comics]] horror tales. Since then, there have been 28 other ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes, with one airing every year.

Episodes contain [[parody|parodies]] of horror, science fiction and fantasy films, as well as the alien characters [[Kang and Kodos]], a special version of the opening sequence, and "scary names" in the credits. The show's staff regard the ''Treehouse of Horror'' as being particularly difficult to produce, as the scripts often go through many rewrites, and the animators typically have to design new [[animated character|character]]s and backgrounds.

Many of the episodes are popular among fans and critics of the show and have inspired a whole offshoot of ''Simpsons'' merchandise, including action figures, playsets, video games, books, DVDs, comic books and a special version of ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. Several of the episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing. In 1996, 2013, and 2015, "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XXIII]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror XXV]]" were respectively nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)]]" category.

==Segments==
''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episodes, or old issues of [[EC Comics]]. Although they are sometimes connected by "wraparounds", the three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within the episode. The two exceptions are "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", in which [[Groundskeeper Willie]] is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments, as well as in [[Treehouse of Horror XXVIII]], in which [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] is possessed by the demon Pazuzu in the first segment and is still recovering in the next segment.&lt;ref name="Mirkin5"/&gt; The episodes are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show, since each character appears to be fine afterwards.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt;

From "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" to "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]", all three segments were written by different writers. In some cases there was a fourth writer who wrote the opening and wraparound segments.&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; For the original "Treehouse of Horror", there were three different directors for the episode.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt; Starting with [[The Simpsons (season 15)|season 15's]] "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]", however, only one writer has been credited with writing each ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode.&lt;ref name="XIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XV"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XV|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Odenkirk, Bill; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=2004-11-04 |season=16|number=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XVI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVI|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVI|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=2005-11-06 |season=17 |number=04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XVII"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVII|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVII|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Gaffney, Peter; Silverman, David; Faughnan, Matthew|network=Fox |airdate=2006-11-05 |season=18 |number=04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="XVIII"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Sheetz, Chuck|network=Fox |airdate=2007-11-04 |season=19 |number=05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion, the episodes will be used to showcase special animation, such as the "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" segment "Homer&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;", in which a computer-animated Homer is shown in a non-animated setting. At the time (1995), it was groundbreaking, as it was unusual for a television show to use such animation. The segment was executive producer [[Bill Oakley]]'s idea and included live action directed by [[David Mirkin]].&lt;ref name="Oakley6"/&gt; "[[Treehouse of Horror XX]]" included the segment "There's No Business Like Moe Business", which was the first to be musically-themed.&lt;ref name="SDCC 09"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/100/1007517p1.html|title=SDCC 09: The Simpsons' Treehouse of Comic-Con|author=Pirrello, Phil|date=2009-07-25|accessdate=2009-07-26|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

===Opening sequence===
[[File:Treehouse of Horror Tombstone.png|right|thumb|Three of the tombstones from the opening segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]"]]
Every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode opens with a special introductory segment. The first, second and fifth ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes open with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] standing on a stage and warning parents about the content of the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary.&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''.&lt;ref name="Reiss1"&gt;{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marge's warnings quickly became a burden to write. After "Treehouse of Horror V", they were permanently dropped&lt;ref name="Jean2"/&gt; and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.&lt;ref name="Oakley6"&gt;{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes have opened with parodies; for example, "Treehouse of Horror III" had Homer introduce the episode in a manner similar to [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'',&lt;ref name="III"/&gt; "Treehouse of Horror IV" had Bart introduce the episode and segments in a manner similar to ''[[Night Gallery]]'', and "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" featured a parody of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.&lt;ref name="V"/&gt; The [[Treehouse of Horror VI|sixth]] and [[Treehouse of Horror VII|seventh]] episodes featured short clips with no lines because the episodes had run long and longer segments were cut.&lt;ref name="Oakley6"/&gt; Following "Treehouse of Horror VII", the opening has been upwards of a minute long and sometimes featured an introduction by a character, such as [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] in "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]"&lt;ref name="XVII"/&gt; or included over-the-top violence, such as "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]" (which showed a [[Fox Network]] censor being brutally murdered) and "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" (which showed the Simpson family killing each other).&lt;ref name="XIV"/&gt;

In the opening segment of the first five episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous season, deceased celebrities such as [[Walt Disney]] and [[Jim Morrison]]&lt;ref name="II"/&gt; and a tombstone with an inscription that read "TV violence" that was riddled with bullets as the camera panned on it.&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; They were last used in "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", which included a solitary tombstone with the words "Amusing Tombstones" to signal this.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror V|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror V |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; McGrath, Dan; Cohen, David S.; Kushell, Bob; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-30 |season=6 |number=06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned.&lt;ref name="Reiss1"/&gt; Another reason they were dropped was that the tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled the previous season; after a few years, several of the shows that were canceled were produced by former ''Simpsons'' writers.&lt;ref name="Groening5"&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror V"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; However after two decades, this gag made a brief comeback in [[Treehouse of Horror XXIX]] at the very beginning, this time appearing before the main opening sequence and title. 

While the early ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes featured a Halloween themed opening sequence, the later ones only included the title and the "created by" and "developed by" credits. Every episode between "Treehouse of Horror II" and "[[Treehouse of Horror X]]" featured a [[The Simpsons opening sequence#Couch gag|couch gag]] with a Halloween theme, including the Simpson family dressed as skeletons,&lt;ref name="II"/&gt; zombies&lt;ref name="IV"/&gt; and characters from previous Halloween episodes.&lt;ref name="X"/&gt;

===Wraparounds===
The first four ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes had brief [[interstitial program|wraparounds]] that occurred before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories. "Treehouse of Horror" was the only one that actually included a treehouse as a setting.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt; In that episode, Bart and Lisa sat in it telling stories to each other.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="I"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode) |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam; Archer, Wes; Moore, Rich; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1990-10-25 |season=2 |number=03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]" presented all of the segments as being nightmares of Lisa, Bart and Homer;&lt;ref name="II"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror II|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror II|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Meyer, George; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al; Martin, Jeff; Simon, Sam; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-31 |season=3 |number=07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]" had Lisa, Bart and [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] telling stories at a Halloween party;&lt;ref name="III"/&gt; and "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" is presented by Bart in a parody of [[Rod Serling|Rod Serling's]] ''[[Night Gallery]]''.&lt;ref name="IV"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror IV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror IV|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=O'Brien, Conan; Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill; Daniels, Greg; McGrath, Dan; Canterbury, Bill; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-28 |season=04 |number=05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few years, the amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened, allowing less time to tell a proper story.&lt;ref name="Jean2"&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror II"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no wraparounds for "Treehouse of Horror V" because they had been cut to make more time for the segments. Following that, the writers permanently dropped them.&lt;ref name="Weinstein7"&gt;{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kang and Kodos===
{{main article|Kang and Kodos}}

Two characters that are virtually exclusive to the ''Treehouse of Horror'' series are [[Kang and Kodos]], a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in the "Hungry are the Damned" segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]". Kang and Kodos have since appeared in every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode, sometimes as important parts of a story, but often just for brief cameos. In some episodes, they only appear in the opening segment,&lt;ref name="XIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="X"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror X|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror X |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cary, Donick; Long, Tim; Hauge, Ron; Michels, Pete|network=Fox |airdate=1999-10-31 |season=11 |number=04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but often they will make a cameo appearance in the middle of a different story. For example, a story about zombies attacking the town briefly cuts to them in their space ship, watching the events and laughing maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering. The action then switches back to the actual story.&lt;ref name="III"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror III|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror III |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam and Vitti, Jon|network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-29|season=04|number=05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial rule is that they must be in every episode,&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; although quite often they will be forgotten and are added at the last moment, resulting in only a brief appearance.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt; Their scene in "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]" nearly did not make the final cut of the episode, but [[David X. Cohen]] managed to persuade the producers to leave the scene in.&lt;ref name="Cohen8"&gt;{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X |date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VIII"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kang and Kodos were prominent characters in the 2015 episode "[[The Man Who Came to Be Dinner]]," which was not Halloween themed.

===Scary names===
[[File:Treehouse of Horror Spooky names.png|left|thumb|The "scary names" for the writers in "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]".]]
Beginning with "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]", the producers decided to give the cast and crew of the show "scary names" in the opening and closing credits. Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there have been a wide variety of special credits, from simple names like "[[Matt Groening|Bat Groening]]" to complex ones like "[[David X. Cohen|David²+S.²=Cohen²]]".&lt;ref name="VI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror VI|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror VI |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Cohen, David S.; Tompkins, Steve; Anderson, Bob|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-29 |season=07 |number=06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Simon]], who left the show during the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]] but still receives "developed by" and "executive producer" credits, has ever since been listed in ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes as "Sam 'Sayonara' Simon".  Since his death in 2015 he has been credited simply by his real name.

The idea for "scary names" came from executive producer [[Al Jean]], who was inspired by [[EC Comics]] because some of the issues also used "scary" alternate names.&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; The "scary names" became such a burden to write that they were cut for "Treehouse of Horror XII" and "Treehouse of Horror XIII", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back.&lt;ref name="Jean3"/&gt; [[Matt Groening]]'s rule for the "scary names" is that they cannot be longer than a person's real name, but this is rarely followed by anyone else.&lt;ref name="Groening6"&gt;{{cite video|people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
References to films, novels, plays, television shows and other media are commonly featured, and many segments have been parodies of a specific work in the horror, science fiction or fantasy genre. Many segments are spoofs of episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and entire segments will be based on a single episode.&lt;ref name="Kogen1"&gt;{{cite video | people=Kogen, Jay|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ''Twilight Zone'' episodes parodied include "[[A Kind of a Stopwatch]]", "[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]]",&lt;ref name="BBCI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml|title=The Simpsons Halloween Special|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[A Small Talent for War]]",&lt;ref name="BBCII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page7.shtml|title=The Simpsons Hallowe'en Special II|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Living Doll (The Twilight Zone)|Living Doll]]",&lt;ref name="BBCIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season4/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror III|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]",&lt;ref name="BBCIV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror IV|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone)|Little Girl Lost]]",&lt;ref name="BBCVI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror VI|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Little People]]".&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite video | people=Anderson, Mike B|date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VII"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Bart's Nightmare" segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]" parodies the episode "[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of ''The Twilight Zone''.&lt;ref name="BBCII"/&gt; The Halloween episodes also regularly parody horror and thriller films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCI"/&gt; ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCIII"/&gt; ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season6/page6.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror V|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCVI"/&gt; ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]'',&lt;ref name="BBCVIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page4.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror VIII|accessdate=2007-11-09|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'',&lt;ref name="SDCC 09"/&gt; ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', and ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]''.&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt; [[Robert Englund]], who portrays [[Freddy Krueger]] in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|Nightmare on Elm street]]'' franchise, had a cameo appearance in "[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]" as the character.&lt;ref name="BBCIX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page3.shtml|title=Treehouse of Horror IX|accessdate=2008-10-31|author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror.

==Production==
[[File:David Mirkin by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|[[David Mirkin]] believes the episodes should be both scary and funny and has been responsible for some of the more gruesome moments.|alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed.]]
The first ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode aired in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|the second season]], and its on-screen title was "The Simpsons Halloween Special." It was inspired by [[EC Comics]] Horror tales.&lt;ref name="Jean1"&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although every episode is entitled "Treehouse of Horror", the first one was the only episode that actually used the treehouse motif.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt; During production of the first episode, [[Matt Groening]] was nervous about "The Raven" segment, and felt it would be "the worst, most pretentious thing [they had] ever done."&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt;

The ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators.&lt;ref name="Reiss1"/&gt; The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers, giving the animators more time to work.&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs.&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20–22&amp;nbsp;minute episode.&lt;ref name="Mirkin4"&gt;{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes often go through many last minute changes, with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded.&lt;ref name="Reiss2"&gt;{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror II"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Treehouse of Horror III" in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six-week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode.&lt;ref name="Jean3"&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fourth season, executive producers [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] were less enamored of ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.&lt;ref name="Jean3"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Oakley2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Bill Oakley]] (along with [[Josh Weinstein]]) executive produced two episodes and wrote one segment.|alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer]]

Part of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode.&lt;ref name="Groening1"&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but can be used as a segment in the seasonal special.&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; Several of the writers, former executive producer [[David Mirkin]] among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny.&lt;ref name="Mirkin4"/&gt; "Treehouse of Horror V" has been described by Mirkin as being one of "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules.&lt;ref name="Mirkin5"&gt;{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror VI"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier "Treehouse of Horror" episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow."&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/30/453217087/fxx-celebrates-halloween-with-the-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-marathon|title=FXX Celebrates Halloween With 'The Simpsons' Treehouse Of Horror Marathon|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2015-11-02|date=2015-10-30|author=Blair, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it "a societal thing".

Although gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as "Citizen Kang" in "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", satirize political issues. The opening segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror XIX]]" featured Homer attempting to vote for [[Barack Obama]] but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/doh-bama/|title=D'oh-Bama|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-10-22|date=2008-10-02|author=Stelter, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than taking sides in the election, Al Jean says it is "mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system.''[sic]''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/features/article_1432969.php/The_Simpsons_Al_Jean_interview_new_season_begins_September_28 |title='The Simpsons' Al Jean interview, new season begins September 28 |publisher=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=2008-10-22 |date=2008-09-25 |author=MacIntyre, April |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928104434/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/features/article_1432969.php/The_Simpsons_Al_Jean_interview_new_season_begins_September_28 |archivedate=2008-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]", a segment called "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say "This sure is a lot like Iraq will be." The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the "review" version sent to newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref name="ABCNews_20061023"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=2600380&amp;page=1 | date=October 23, 2006 | title='Simpsons' Halloween 'Horror' Could Hit GOP | last=Redeker | first=Bill | publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al Jean by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|[[Al Jean]] has been executive producer for more ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes than any other EP.|alt=A man with glasses and a red shirt is sitting in front of a microphone.]]

The first ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a [[theremin]], but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.&lt;ref name="Groening1"/&gt; Usually when the producers submit an episode for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series|Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)]]", they submit a Treehouse of Horror episode,&lt;ref name="Jean1"/&gt; and to date, seven episodes have been nominated.&lt;ref name="Emmys"/&gt; The closing of "Treehouse of Horror IV" features a version of the theme that is a combination of the instruments used in ''[[The Munsters]]'' theme song and the harpiscord and clicking from the ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|Addams Family]]'' theme song.&lt;ref name="Mirkin4"/&gt;

Üter Zörker is so far the only human character introduced in a Treehouse of Horror episode to make it into the canon. His debut episode was "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the segment "Terror at {{frac|5|1|2}} Feet". He is an obese German exchange student obsessed with candy and is voiced by Russi Taylor.

Executive producer Al Jean revealed that 2019's ''Treehouse of Horror'' will be the 666th episode of ''The Simpsons ''series. Jean stated that this was planned ever since the show began airing in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-xxx-episode-666/|title=‘The Simpsons': Next Year’s ‘Treehouse of Horror’ Will Be Episode 666|last=Maglio|first=Tony|date=16 October 2018|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling==

Although ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes are Halloween-themed, for several years new episodes premiered in November following the holiday, due to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s coverage of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=2006-11-04|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 12)|Season 12]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror XI]]" was the first episode to air in November. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]" where Kang looks at a ''[[TV Guide]]'' and says, "Pathetic humans. They're showing a Halloween episode... in November!" and Kodos replies "Who's still thinking about Halloween? We've already got our Christmas decoration up." The camera then cuts to a shot of the fireplace with Christmas decorations, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits.&lt;ref name="XIV"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XIV|episodelink=Treehouse of Horror XIV |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=2003-11-02 |season=15 |number=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 21)|Season 21]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror XX]]" aired October 18, before the World Series, but the following year's episode, "[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]", aired in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Simpsons' continues tradition of late Halloween episode |url=http://www2.journalnow.com/entertainment/2010/oct/31/simpsons-continues-tradition-of-late-halloween-epi-ar-494091/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525153318/http://www2.journalnow.com/entertainment/2010/oct/31/simpsons-continues-tradition-of-late-halloween-epi-ar-494091/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |author=Clodfelter, Tim |date=2010-10-31 |accessdate=2010-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 23)|Season 23]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror XXII]] aired on October 30, however, as the World Series (which went the maximum of [[2011 World Series|seven games]]) had concluded on October 28.&lt;ref name="doubledohs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z176z5z8&amp;ID=8092 |title=FOX ORDERS DOUBLE D'OHS OF "THE SIMPSONS" – Longest Running Scripted Series on Television is Renewed Through Season 25 |date=October 7, 2011 |publisher=FOXFlash |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010030451/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z176z5z8&amp;ID=8092 |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes have premiered in the month of October.

==Reception==
The ''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes are often among the top-rated episodes of their seasons&lt;ref name="Jean3"/&gt; and many of the ''Treehouse of Horror''s have generally been well-received by fans. However, like ''The Simpsons'' itself, critics have noted a decline in the quality of the later episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/744/744221p1.html|title=The Simpsons: "Treehouse of Horror XVII" Review|author=Iverson, Dan|date=November 6, 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-29|publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first airing, "Treehouse of Horror" finished with a 15.7 Nielsen rating and a 25% audience share and would lose to ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =Bart vs. Bill, Round 3 | page =D3  | publisher =  [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] | date = October 30, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said that it "set a level of excellence that viewers never expected creator [[Matt Groening]] to repeat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Holloway | first =Diane | title =Be like Bart: Just say 'boo!' | page =7  | publisher =  [[Austin American-Statesman]] | date = October 31, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was also described as "kind of stupid and unsatisfying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Belcher | first =Walt | title ='Simpsons' regain their cynicism in latest episode | work =  | pages =4F  | publisher = [[The Tampa Tribune]] | date = November 1, 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" is considered the best episode by several critics: it finished ninth on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episode list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2007-11-09|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; fifth on AskMen.com's "Top 10: Simpsons Episodes" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment_60/64b_top_10_list.html|title=Top 10: Simpsons Episodes|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Weir, Rich|publisher=Askmen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named best episode of the sixth season by [[IGN.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p2.html|title=The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski |publisher=IGN.com|date=2006-09-08|accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[James Earl Jones]], who guest starred in "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" was named seventh on IGN's "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski |accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[IGN]].com published a list of the top ten ''Treehouse of Horror'' segments, and they placed "The Shinning" from "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]" at the top, saying it was "not only a standout installment of the annual Halloween episode, but of ''The Simpsons'', period."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Rounding out the list were "[[Treehouse of Horror III|Dial "Z" for Zombies]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror IV|The Devil and Homer Simpson]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror V|Time and Punishment]]", "Hungry Are the Damned", "[[Treehouse of Horror III|Clown Without Pity]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror VII|Citizen Kang]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror II|If I Only Had a Brain]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror IV|Bart Simpson's Dracula]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror IX|Starship Poopers]]". The third, fourth and fifth episodes were each represented by two segments. The most recent episode on the list was "[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]", which first aired in 1998.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/742/742680p1.html | title=Top 10 Segments from The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror | date=2008-10-28| accessdate=2008-10-29|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Iverson, Dan |author3=Zoromski, Brian | publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]" is ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]'s seventh favorite episode, and the line he likes best is "We have reached the limit of what rectal probing can teach us."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275114,00.html|title=Springfield of Dreams|accessdate=2007-11-09|date=2000-01-14|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Snierson, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "King Homer" of "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]" is one of Matt Groening's favorite segments.&lt;ref name="Groening3"&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Treehouse of Horror III"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Treehouse of Horror III" is also noted for the moment where Homer shoots [[Ned Flanders]] and Bart says "Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!" only for Homer to reply, "He was a zombie?"&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; It is also one of Groening's favorite lines.&lt;ref name="Groening3"/&gt;

==Founder==
{{main|Charles E. Tuttle}}

The company’s founder, Charles Egbert Tuttle, Jr., was a graduate of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; He enlisted in the U.S. military and was stationed in Japan immediately after World War II, working on General [[Douglas MacArthur]]’s staff. His job, among other things, was to help revive the Japanese publishing industry after the war.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; After his military service was completed, he decided to stay on in Japan and set up his own business importing English-language books and magazines and exporting rare Japanese antiquarian books to U.S. libraries.

Tuttle came from a distinguished New England publishing family.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards2006"&gt;Edwards, B. (2006): [http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS/607200385/1002/NEWS01 Used book shop closes its doors] ''Rutland Herald'' (July 20, 2006). Retrieved on April 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father ran Tuttle Antiquarian Books{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}—one of several Tuttle companies in Rutland, Vermont, that had been involved with printing and publishing since the 1830s. At university, he studied American history and literature.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt; After graduating in 1937, he worked in the library of [[Columbia University]] for a year, then joined the family business.&lt;ref name="Ingleton1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saxon1993"/&gt; His interest in publishing 'quality' books about Japan and Asia, and his keen eye for design and editorial matters as a publisher, grew out of an appreciation for the valuable antiquarian books that he dealt with as a youth.&lt;ref name="TP2008"/&gt;

==Current status==
Tuttle's current publisher and CEO is Singapore resident Eric Oey.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-07/23/content_11038802.htm/ Tuttle's tales of tantalizing literary trials and triumphs ''China Daily'' (July 23, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Oey is a nephew of Charles E.

In 2010, out of the company's top 20 best-selling books, 11 were [[martial arts]] titles.&lt;ref name="TuttleTop20"&gt;[https://peripluspublishinggroup.com/tuttle/shopping/catalog.php?id=26&amp;pag=0 Tuttle Publishing: Top 20 bestsellers] Retrieved on April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuttle Publishing had estimated annual sales of $2.5–$5 million U.S., and a staff of around 40 people.&lt;ref name="Manta2010"/&gt; It had offices in [[Clarendon, Vermont|North Clarendon]] (in [[Vermont]], USA), Singapore, Tokyo, and Jakarta.&lt;ref name="TuttlePublishing"/&gt; Leading officers are in the U.S. are Michael Sargent (General Manager), David Loseby (Finance Executive), and Christopher Johns (Sales &amp; Marketing Director).&lt;ref name="Manta2010"/&gt;

[[File:Vowel triange, cardinal vowels.png|thumb|A schematic of vowel triangle, with vowels arranged by [[formant]].]]

A '''vowel diagram''' or '''vowel chart''' is a schematic arrangement of the [[vowel]]s.  Depending on the particular language being discussed, it can take the form of a triangle or a quadrilateral.  Vertical position on the diagram denotes the [[vowel height|vowel closeness]], with close vowels at the top of the diagram, and horizontal position denotes the [[vowel backness]], with front vowels at the left of the diagram.&lt;ref name=SkanderaBurleigh&gt;{{cite book|title=A Manual of English Phonetics and Phonology|author=Paul Skandera and Peter Burleigh|year=2005|publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag|isbn=3823361252|pages=33&amp;ndash;34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels are unique in that their main features do not contain differences in voicing, manner, or place (articulators). Vowels differ only in the position of the tongue when voiced. The tongue moves vertically and horizontally within the oral cavity. Vowels are produced with at least a part of their [[vocal tract]] obstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cancio|first=Mary Lou|title=Functional Phonetics Workbook|year=2007|publisher=Plural Publishing|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the vowel diagram, convenient reference points are provided for specifying tongue position. The position of the highest point of the arch of the tongue is considered to be the point of articulation of the vowel. The vertical dimension of the vowel diagram is known as vowel high, which includes high, central (mid), or low vowels. The horizontal dimension of the vowel diagram includes tongue advancement and identifies how far forward the tongue is located in the oral cavity during production. Vowels are also categorized by the tenseness or laxness of the tongue. The schwa [ə] is in the center of the chart and is frequently referred to as the neutral vowel. Here, the vocal tract is in its neutral state and creates a near perfect tube. For other vowels, there is a necessary movement of the vocal tract and tongue away from the neutral position, either up/down or backward/forward. The next dimension for vowels are tense/lax; here we can distinguish high/mid/low dimensions and the front/central/back dimensions. In other words, all vowels but schwas. For instance, [i] and [ɪ] or [o] and [ɔ] are very hard to tell apart, but we can categorize them into tense or lax. Tense vowels are [i] and [o] . Lax vowels are [ɪ] and [ɔ]. The next dimension of vowels is rounding. Rounding is important because it continues to help differentiate the vowels of English. For example, for [u], the lips are rounded, but for [i], the lips are spread. Vowels can be categorized as rounded or unrounded. Rounded vowels are [u], [ʊ], [o], [ɔ] and the unrounded vowels are [i], [ɪ], [e], [ɛ], [æ], [ɑ], [ʌ], [ə].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~krussll/phonetics/articulation/describing-vowels.html |title=Describing English vowels |website=Phonetics |first=Kevin |last=Russell |publisher=[[University of Manitoba]] |date=27 November 2005 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vowel systems of most languages can be represented by vowel diagrams. Usually, there is a pattern of even distribution of marks on the chart, a phenomenon that is known as '''vowel dispersion'''. For most languages, the vowel system is triangular. Only 10% of languages, including [[English language|English]], have a vowel diagram that is quadrilateral. Such a diagram is called a '''vowel quadrilateral''' or a '''vowel trapezium'''.&lt;ref name=SkanderaBurleigh /&gt; 

Different vowels vary in pitch. For example, high vowels, such as [i] and [u], tend to have a higher [[fundamental frequency]] than low vowels, such as [a]. Vowels are distinct from one another by their acoustic form or spectral properties. Spectral properties are the speech sound's fundamental frequency and its formants.

Each vowel in the vowel diagram has a unique first and second formant, or F1 and F2. The frequency of the first formant refers to the width of the pharyngeal cavity and the position of the tongue on a vertical axis and ranges from open to close. The frequency of the second formant refers to the length of the oral cavity and the position of the tongue on a horizontal axis. [i], [u], [a] are often referred to as point vowels because they represent the most extreme F1 and F2 frequencies. [a] has a high F1 frequency because of the narrow size of the pharynx and the low position of the tongue. The F2 frequency is higher for  [i] because the oral cavity is short and the tongue is at the front of the mouth. The F2 frequency is low in the production of [u] because the mouth is elongated and the lips are rounded while the pharynx is lowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|author=Eva M. Fernández and Helen Smith Cairns|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405191470|pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] vowel chart has the [[cardinal vowels]] and is displayed in the form of a [[trapezoid|trapezium]]. By definition, no vowel sound can be plotted outside of the IPA trapezium because its four corners represent the extreme points of [[articulatory phonetics|articulation]]. 

The vowel diagrams of most real languages are not so extreme. In English, for example, high vowels are not as high as the corners of the IPA trapezium, and front vowels are not as front.&lt;ref name=SkanderaBurleigh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Phonology: An Introduction|author=Heinz J.

[[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]] (1906–1984) was a twentieth-century English poet, writer and [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]]. Born to a middle-class family in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] [[Hampstead]], he attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], although left without graduating.{{sfn|Amis|Loughlin-Chow|2004}} He turned down a position in the family furniture business,{{sfn|Wilson|2006|p=49}} and instead took a series of jobs before becoming the assistant editor of [[Architectural Review|''The Architectural Review'']] in 1931, which reflected a deeply held affection for buildings and their history. That same year he published his first book, ''Mount Zion'', a collection of poems.{{sfn|Clarke|1983|p=59}}{{sfn|Robinson|1998|pp=6–7}}{{efn|Although some sources put the date he joined ''The Architectural Review'' as 1931,{{sfn|Clarke|1983|p=59}}{{sfn|Robinson|1998|pp=6–7}} others put the date as 1930.{{sfn|Amis|Loughlin-Chow|2004}}}}

In 1932 Betjeman began a career in broadcasting, with a radio programme about the proposed destruction of [[Waterloo Bridge]]; he continued with regular radio work for the rest of his life, appearing in a wide range of genres, from panel and game shows, interviews, news interviews, documentaries and poetry readings.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=329–30}} He published his first non-verse book in 1933, ''Ghastly Good Taste'', which was subtitled "''a Depressing Story of the Rise and Fall of English Architecture''"; it reflected his concern of the destruction of Victorian and Edwardian architecture to make way for "grimmer contemporary developments, shopping arcades, and bogus Tudor bars".{{sfn|Amis|Loughlin-Chow|2004}} In 1937—shortly after the [[BBC]] began regular screen broadcasts—he appeared in his first television programme, ''How to Make a Guidebook'',{{sfn|Peterson|2006|p=359}} and went on to appear in a wide range of programmes until his death. His television appearances increased from the 1950s, and his output was prolific.&lt;ref name="JB: screenonline" /&gt;

In 1960 Betjeman was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (CBE), which was followed in 1968 with his election as a [[Royal Society of Literature|Companion of Literature]]. In 1969 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] and, in 1972, he succeeded [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] as Britain's [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]].&lt;ref name="JB: screenonline" /&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2006|p=294}} In the later years of his life, Betjeman suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]], and he died in May 1984. His obituarist in ''[[The Times]]'' thought him "a true original", and considered that he was "whimsical, imprudent, shrewd, humorous, disarming, always something of an ''[[L'enfant terrible|enfant terrible]]''.&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; The poet [[Philip Larkin]] wrote that Betjeman "was not only the best loved poet, but one of the best loved men of our time",&lt;ref name="Obs: obit" /&gt; while his biographer, the academic John Clarke, described him as a "unique figure in twentieth-century English poetry, enjoying a degree of fame and success unequalled by any poet since [[Lord Byron|Byron]]".{{sfn|Clarke|1983|p=58}}
