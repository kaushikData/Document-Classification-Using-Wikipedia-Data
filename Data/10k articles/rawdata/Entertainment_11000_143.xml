'''''All Grown Up!''''' is an American [[animated]] television series airing from 2003 to 2008 created by [[Arlene Klasky]] and [[Gábor Csupó]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. It is a spinoff of ''[[Rugrats]]'' and takes place about ten years after the original series where the characters are now tweens (10-12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rugrats' spinoff leaves sandbox world behind |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=November 29, 2003|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/29/entertainment/et-mallory29|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Michael | last=Mallory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of ''[[All Growed Up]],'' the ''[[Rugrats]]'' 10th anniversary special, [[Nickelodeon]] commissioned ''All Grown Up!'' as a spin-off series based on the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; Queen of Mean Turns 13: How Unlucky Is That?|work= New York Times|date=August 22, 2004|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/tv/for-young-viewers-queen-of-mean-turns-13-how-unlucky-is-that.html?scp=23&amp;sq=rugrats&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Laurel | last=Graeber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ran from 2003 to 2008 with a total of five seasons and 55 episodes.

==Premise==

==Characters==
{{See also|List of Rugrats characters}}
{{missing information|section|who voices each of the characters|date=July 2018}}
*[[Tommy Pickles|Thomas "Tommy" Pickles]]: Tommy, now an 11-year-old boy with a full head of hair, is the elder brother of Dil Pickles and self-proclaimed leader of the group. Many years ago, he once fell into the river water but his grandpa Lou got him out quickly but this experience affected Tommy, causing him to have a fear of water. He also has an interest in film making and inventing like his father. His friends still look up to him for help and advice whenever the situation gets out of control.
*Dylan "Dil" Pickles: Dil is Tommy's 10-year-old brother and has somewhat inherited his father and brother's interest in inventing. Dil is known for his unconventional habits, style, speech, interests and beliefs (especially in aliens) which are hinted to have been caused by being dropped as a baby by the DeVille twins. Although he is the youngest he is often the most insightful of the group and has really deep moments.
*Charles "Chuckie" Finster, Jr.: Chuckie is Tommy's best friend and Kimi's older stepbrother. At 12 years old, Chuckie is still shy and timid, although he has a "rebellious streak" at times and can be protective of Kimi. He and Tommy are known to cause havoc at school, angering their vice principal. He gets gross tendencies.
*Phillip "Phil" and Lillian "Lil" DeVille: Phil and Lil are good friends of Tommy, Chuckie and Dil. Phil and Lil are 11 years old twins who have remained very close and still have gross tendencies when together. Lil is a tomboy but has matured a bit more than her brother and has picked up interests in fashion and boys. Phil has displayed some talent at cooking. Both of them have an interest in sports and have been on the school soccer team.
*Kimi Watanabe-Finster: Kimi is Chuckie's 11-year-old stepsister. While she lives with her mother Kira and step-father Chas, she has a good relationship with her biological father, Hiro, who lives in Japan. Kimi also has a good relationship with Chuckie even though sometimes he is protective of her. Like Lil she has grown into a little bit of a tomboy, has adopted a punk style, and has started embracing her Japanese heritage more.
*[[Angelica Pickles]]: Angelica is Tommy and Dil's cousin, now 13 years old as a teenager, and is often the most stereotypical character. She is usually seen doing many typical "teen things" like getting a cell phone, pursuing boys, and getting the latest fashion trends. Although she has grown up, Angelica continues to be mean and spoiled in her pursuit of popularity. She also still constantly rivals the rest of the kids with her self-serving and bossy behavior. However, she maintains a close relationship with Susie and has learned to soften up to others, frequently giving help or acting kind when it comes down to it.
*Susie Carmichael: Susie, also 13 years old, is Angelica's best friend and tries to keep her grounded when she can. Susie is still known to be helpful and kind to her younger friends while also keeping her reputation as the responsible one of the group. She is smart and has displayed a considerable talent for singing, a skill that often makes Angelica jealous because of the attention she receives for it.

==Production history==
The idea originated in ''All Growed Up'', a special which aired in 2001 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of ''Rugrats''. Nickelodeon was so impressed by the high ratings it achieved, with more than 12 million viewers tuning into the special,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210203917/http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 December 2004|title=The Tweenage Rugrats|date=10 December 2004|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it commissioned an entire series revolving around the teenage main characters. Production for the series later began in September 2002, under the pilot's name; however, Nickelodeon insisted that the program go with the more grammatically correct title ''All Grown Up'' instead, especially since the characters in the special used more grammatically correct words. During summer 2003, teasers for ''All Grown Up'' aired. However, the scenes shown were not clips from actual episodes of the show.

At the time, this was not the only spinoff of ''Rugrats'' under consideration {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In 2002, Nickelodeon aired the episode ''Pre-School Daze'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/psdaze.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204222651/http://www.rugratonline.com/psdaze.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 December 2004|title=Preschool Daze|date=4 December 2004|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proposed pilot to a series in which characters Angelica and Susie attend pre-school ([[Rugrats Pre-School Daze|the program ultimately aired in the UK in 2005, and then made its North American debut, long after the original series had been cancelled, in 2008]]).

Another proposed spinoff was a series featuring [[Susie Carmichael|Susie and the Carmichael family]], who would've moved from California to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the new series; it was first proposed for the 1999–2000 television season, but with Nick and Klasky-Csupo deciding to concentrate on all the original-aged Rugrats, all together, that concept was shelved. The ''Kwanzaa'' special, which aired in 2001, had served as a pilot for this new series, but some felt that the (ultimately rejected) series would have been contradictory to established continuity .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213184525/http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2004|title=The Tweenage Rugrats|date=13 December 2004|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The show premiered on April 12, 2003, as a preview before starting its regular run in late November 2003. When the series did start its regular run, more than 5.2 million viewers tuned in, enough to put it into the 2nd place slot for the week (behind an [[NFL]] game on [[ESPN]]) and making it the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history at the time. (The April sneak peek did not make the top 15 cable programs for that week, due to the ongoing [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].) The show aired in reruns on "[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]" for six months from March 13, 2004, to September 4, 2004. The original titles for this series were ''All Growed Up!'' and ''Rugrats: All Growed Up!''.

In addition, in its first season, ''All Grown Up!'' had its first of two celebrity guest stars: [[Lil Romeo]] as "Lil Q" (Cupid) in episode 11, "It's Cupid, Stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0999075/|title=Romeo Miller|work=IMDb|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, ''All Grown Up!'' was removed from the Nickelodeon schedule in the United States. Although it later returned to air the remaining episodes in 2008.

Nickelodeon US aired most of the final season of ''All Grown Up!'' from June 15, 2008 through August 17, 2008. Since the series' cancellation, [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] continued to air reruns until October 28, 2013.

[[Image:Astor Mickey.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Astor Mickey, 1946]]
'''Astor Radio Corporation''' is an Australian [[radio]] manufacturer which began operating in 1926, making [[radio receiver]]s in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The firm was innovative in that it offered radios in varying colours compared with the standard wood stains offered by other companies.

During 1933, Astor produced the first of its “[[Mickey Mouse]]” series of radios, and in 1936 introduced its first Bakelite Mickey Mouse radio, with a cartoon of the famous rodent on the dial. Early brochures featured a picture of [[Walt Disney]] and the mouse giving their "seal of approval". However, that was not done with permission from [[the Walt Disney Company]] and Astor became involved in a long-running court battle with Disney over the use of the Mickey Mouse name. The result was that Astor was forbidden to use the name "Mickey Mouse" for its radios, but it continued to produce the “Astor Mickey" radio for the next 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://vintagewireless.byethost12.com/mickey.html|title= Astor Mickey HQ
|publisher=vintagewireless.info|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Astor radio.jpg|thumb|right|Astor BPJ 5 valve, 1959]]

Astor bought its competitors, Eclipse and Essanay. However, it was itself bought by the English electronics company [[Pye Ltd]] in the 1960s, and Pye was later taken over by the giant [[Philips]] electronics company.

== Television ==
The Astor radio corporation was a major manufacturer of early monochrome television sets in Australia, commencing production in 1956 in anticipation of services in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].  

[[File:Astor rotary tuner dial plan.png|thumb]]

Some early Astor television sets featured a rotary dial that located the [[Australasian television frequencies|available channels]] adjacent to each other, rather than in numerical order, especially for the capital cities which were allocated channels 2, 7 and 9.  

Channel 0 was not included, possibly because the tuner mechanism could only accommodate 12 places.  As a result, in Melbourne 1964 (and later in [[Brisbane]]), service technicians were required to convert the place marker for either channel 10 or 8 to receive [[ATV (Australia)|Channel 0]], which is evidence of the significant problems that ATV0 had at its commencement.  Channel 10 could not be used in Melbourne at the time because that would have resulted in interference with the regional station ([[GLV/BCV|GLV10]]). Brisbane had a similar problem a year later with a nearby regional station in [[Toowoomba]] [[RTQ|DDQ10]]. That was not a problem in Sydney or [[Adelaide]], where the channel 10 frequency was used by the [[Network Ten|0/10 Network]]. 

The company sponsored an early Australian television series, ''[[The Astor Show]]'', which aired in Melbourne during 1958, and also sponsored a Sydney television series, ''[[Astor Showcase]]'', from 1957 to 1959.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8543">The '''BBC Programme Catalogue''' is an [[online]] [[archive]] of the entire [[BBC]] back [[Library catalog|catalog]]ue of [[TV]] and [[radio programme]]s. The catalogue is for internal use by the BBC although for a time a beta online version was available to the public. "The catalogue is not a complete record of every BBC programme" since certain categories of programme were not catalogued or no longer exist.

The catalogue does not include entries for programmes where no copies of the programme are known to still exist. Nor does it include entries for [[sport]] because the BBC does not necessarily own the rights. However every individual news item is separately catalogued since these had a high re-use value (e.g. use of archive footage of historical [[news]] items within present-day news programmes or [[documentaries]]).

==History==
===Internal===
====Infax====
Infax was the BBC's programme database, containing 966,244 BBC programmes dating back to 1938,&lt;ref name="prototype is back"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forrester|first1=Ian|title=Infax: Programme Catalogue prototype is back|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcbackstage/2006/12/infax-programme-catalogue-prot.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 March 2016|date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not every programme ever broadcast. Since 1992, Infax has only been used as a stock control system.&lt;ref name="2012 Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Jake|title=Guide To The BBC’s Archives 2012|url=https://lookaside.fbsbx.com/file/BBC%20Archive%20Collections%20Guide%202012.pdf?token=AWzr9ur1zcP9A0_--nnXQFdaorSJyREqWP_hHkVSxtaOUNgmgcnOApdGJS4OcvoDmtmXYfeYvTuug35YhzqB1aGjb-QaRrulPa3X9f8c2Z6Jelh5bxZTNdEy8VY2Cfx83l5hgBf2ZvFa4ZfeALlQpwgz|pages=69,73|publisher=[[BBC Archive Development]]|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infax catalogued all TV and selected radio until 2008 but was only used to catalogue news up until 1994. The Star catalogue was used to catalogue news from 1994-2008.&lt;ref name="2012 Guide"/&gt; In 2004, the Sports Library database took over cataloguing sport until 2008 when sport was taken over by the Digital Library database.&lt;ref name="2012 Guide"/&gt;   

It was reported that Infax was due to be switched off in March 2014 but due to technical issues with Fabric it remains operational at a cost of £780,000 a year to maintain.&lt;ref name="Fabric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conlan|first1=Tara|title=BBC considering keeping 40-year-old system after £100m DMI failure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/05/bbc-digital-media-initiative-dmi-infax-fabric|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=28 March 2016|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strix/Cinegy====
Since 1992 the BBC Northern Ireland Archive used Strix to catalogue factual, sport, current affairs, entertainment programmes and news output until March 2009.&lt;ref name="2012 Guide"/&gt; As of April 2009 all news was catalogued and stored using the Cinegy database. The Cinegy database allows for video material to be viewed on a BBC desktop computer.&lt;ref name="2012 Guide"/&gt;

====Fabric====
In 2012 a new programme archive database was introduced to replace Infax at a cost of £3m a year.&lt;ref name="Fabric"/&gt; In 2013 Fabric failed a number of times and the BBC has identified key limitations with the database.&lt;ref name="Fabric"/&gt; Again in 2014 the BBC internal [[Ariel (newspaper)|Ariel]] newspaper reported that Fabric has had a series of fixes but the feedback was mixed and Infax will continue to operate.&lt;ref name="Ariel"&gt;{{cite web|title=More using Fabric but feedback is mixed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/29044604|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the BBC internal [[Ariel (newspaper)|Ariel]] newspaper - Maggie Lydon (Head of Media Management) insists that only 'a very small amount' of information has not been transferred from Infax to Fabric.&lt;ref name="Ariel"/&gt;

===Public===
====Infax====
A web version of this database was made available to access to the public in April 2006. It ceased operation in December 2007.&lt;ref name="About Infax"&gt;{{cite web|title=About This Prototype|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/cataloguemeta/2005/11/about_this_prototype.html|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613100552/http://open.bbc.co.uk/cataloguemeta/2005/11/about_this_prototype.html|archivedate=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front page of the website is still available to see via the  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060512054648/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax Internet Archive]. After it ceased, a message on the website said that it would be incorporating the information into individual programme pages.&lt;ref name="Prototype End"&gt;{{cite web|title=This experimental prototype trial has now concluded|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/catalogue_offline.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2009 an email reply from the BBC showed the reason for its removal was due to a data protection concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC-HISTORY Archives|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=BBC-HISTORY;94fe1847.0911|publisher=jiscmail.ac.uk|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Infax was also incorporated into the [[BBC Motion Gallery]] website (now [[Getty Images]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC MOTION GALLERY PUTS INFAX ONLINE|url=http://www.focalint.org/member-news/news/623/bbc-motion-gallery-puts-infax-online|publisher=focalint.org|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Motion Gallery puts Infax online|url=http://www.stockphototalk.com/the_stock_photo_industry_/2006/03/bbc_motion_gall.html|publisher=stockphototalk.com|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=13 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2014 a data protection issue was flagged and public access was disabled.

In October 2012, a version of the BBC programme catalogue is available to view exclusively in [[British Library]] in the [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] ([[London]]) and [[Boston Spa]] ([[Yorkshire]]) reading rooms. 2.2 million searchable catalogue records and 225,000 programmes up to June 2012 are available to view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elizabeth|first1=Lawes|title=New services at the British Library|url=https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/library-arts/2012/10/02/new-services-at-the-british-library/|publisher=[[University College London]]|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Other newspaper electronic resources |url=https://www.bl.uk/eresources/newspapers/colindale4.html |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=30 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310201936/http://www.bl.uk/eresources/newspapers/colindale4.html |archive-date=10 March 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=New broadcast media resources at the British Library|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/sound-and-vision/2012/10/new-broadcast-media-resources-at-the-british-library.html|publisher=[[British Library]]|accessdate=12 December 2016|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was directed by Christopher Muir, who said, We will not be presenting the opera as it was originally performed. "We will be doing it in a style that will lend itself to TV, but we have, of course,
treated the work with great respect to the young Mozart's original intention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131724214 |title=TV AND RADIO HIGHLIGHTS |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=37, |issue=10,566 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=19 June 1963 |accessdate=14 February 2017 |page=35 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonar Colleano''' (14 March 1924 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1958) was an American stage and film actor based in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Colleano was born '''Bonar Sullivan''' in New York City.

In 1946, he married actress [[Tamara Lees]], but the couple divorced in 1951. His second wife was actress [[Susan Shaw]], who descended into alcoholism after his death. Their son Mark Colleano is also an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/15/newsid_3245000/3245079.stm|accessdate=January 16, 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=1958: Film stars raise cash for Colleano}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, while living in the U.K., he fathered future [[Average White Band]] drummer, [[Robbie McIntosh (drummer)|Robbie McIntosh]].

The '''Care Bears''' are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist [[Elena Kucharik]] to be used on [[greeting cards]] from [[American Greetings]], but  later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. 

The original development was through American Greetings' "Those Characters From Cleveland" [[research and development]] division, In 1983, [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] turned the Care Bears into plush [[teddy bear]]s. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'' (1984). They then had a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).

Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality.  The movie ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' named them "belly badges". Adding to the Care Bear family are the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] movies: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005) and ''The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom'' (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]''. The premiere of the series utilizes "30 years of caring". It premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, "Care Bears and Cousins", was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures &amp; blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. [[Jack Chojnacki]], the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: "It had a high aaaaaah factor."&lt;ref name=aaah&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rfEPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3720,590789&amp;dq=care+bears+movie&amp;hl=en |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |title=High 'aaah" factor has meant millions |date=April 2, 1985 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muriel Fahrion]], the artist who helped create [[Strawberry Shortcake]]'s look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXBZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears&amp;dq=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears |author1=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |author2=Union française des œuvres laïques d'éducation par l'image et le son |title=La Revue du cinéma |volume=418 |chapter=Les Bisounours (The Care Bears Movie) |language=French |page=26 |year=1986 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |quote=Scn. : Peter Sauder, d'après les personnages créés pour Those Characters from Cleveland par Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Elena Kucharik, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, Clark Willey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator [[Elena Kucharik]] became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of [[General Mills]]).&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite book |last=Pecora |first=Norma Odom |title=The Business of Children's Entertainment |isbn=1-57230-774-9 |year=1998 |publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As they had done with [[Strawberry Shortcake]], once titled "Project I", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development "Project II" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.&lt;ref name=cbsite&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301073233/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |title=History &amp; Facts: More Care Bears Fun Facts |archivedate=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1982 launch ===
On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts.&lt;ref name="cb-pr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=The biggest character launch in the history of retailing ... |date=September 24, 1982 |location=New York City |work=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal.&lt;ref name="cb-pr" /&gt; Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by [[Parker Brothers]] and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as "the biggest character launch in the history of retailing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB294D2283BB84A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=DeWolf |first=Rose |title=Out to launch: Is there shelf life after Holly Hobbie?

In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as "Message Bears". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the "heart-shaped 'touché tags'" used to identify the Care Bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=udoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5386,2660829&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en |author=[[Associated Press]] (AP) |title='Care Bears' makers lose copyright suit |date=December 14, 1983 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'', came out that same year. A [[miniseries]] based on the toys was distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company]].&lt;ref name=guilford /&gt;{{rp|52}} A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', produced by [[Nelvana]] Limited and released by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]]. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] market at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nelvana-25"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Three+men+and+a+bear%3A+Nelvana+at+25-a030533629 |last1=Besen |first1=Ellen |last2=Glassman |first2=Marc |title=Three men and a bear: Nelvana at 25 |date=September 22, 1996 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063946/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Three+men+and+a+bear:+Nelvana+at+25-a030533629 |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that autumn, [[DIC Entertainment]] released an 11-episode television series in syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DIC Directory: 16 years of company's smallscreen creations |date=July 12, 1999 |work=Variety |page=A30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]''. Released by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.

Later that year, a TV series titled ''The Care Bears Family'' (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and Canada's [[Global Television Network|Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new season children's shows |date=September 9, 1986 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard [[List of Care Bear characters#No Heart|No Heart]] and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece [[Shreeky]] was introduced.

The Care Bears' third film, ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', debuted in 1987. A TV special, ''[[Care Bears Nutcracker Suite]]'', premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.

Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70&amp;nbsp;million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2&amp;nbsp;billion during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=agsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |title=About Us: History |accessdate=February 26, 2006 |publisher=[[American Greetings]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210053021/http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=December 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbhistory&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062052/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |title=History &amp; Facts |archivedate=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1991 relaunch ===
In early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&amp;p_theme=ddnb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F504F756A8A1153&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=Moss |first=Meredith |title=She's a living doll |date=March 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |publisher=Cox Ohio Publishing |page=5E |quote=Patriotic bears: Two Ohio companies have joined together to teach children about the environment and patriotism....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing company [[Random House]] released two tie-in books: ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' (1991) by Bobbi Katz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[WorldCat]] |publisher=[[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910173629/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503023757/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670 |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' (1992) by Peggy Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=WorldCat |publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910010416/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=Amazon.com Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605073157/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002 relaunch ===
In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by [[Jay Foreman (businessman)|Jay Foreman]], the president of [[Fort Lauderdale]]-based [[Play Along Toys]], for less than $1&amp;nbsp;million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Kimberly L. |title=Sell It, Baby! Practical How-Tos on Marketing, Branding &amp; Sales |page=3 |isbn=1-59113-394-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Booklocker.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.

In the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kmart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[KB Toys]], and [[Mervyns]].&lt;ref name=cbfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224518/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |archivedate=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new merchandise included the Bears doing [[aerobics]]; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304010508/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |title=New &amp; Now |archivedate=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 million {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Elizabeth |title=Care Bears Receive 'Gentle' Makeover |date=February 9, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=249 |number=33 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and subsidiary [[Family Home Entertainment|FHE Pictures]], in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' in 2004 and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.

New versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13&amp;nbsp;inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.

=== 2007 relaunch ===
In 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' and immediately before with a new TV series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''. The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by [[SD Entertainment]].

As part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear,&lt;ref name="cbcollectlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |title=Care Bears: New Collection |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Play Along Toys]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829092833/http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |archivedate=August 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |title=Care Bears FAQ's |format=Flash |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Play Along Toys |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223132206/http://playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their new theme song is performed by former [[Letters to Cleo]] member, [[Kay Hanley]], and the music video premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In August 2007, they appeared in the film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |last=Strowbridge |first=C.S. |title=Limited Releases Are Very Becoming |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611082352/http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. The series premiered on [[CBS]]' ''[[KEWLopolis]]'' block on September 15, 2007.

The Care Bears franchise was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (''Grizzle-ly Adventures''), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states that in the new version, "they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight".&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

However, the Caring Meter made its return in ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, ''Ups and Downs'', included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, ''Play Day''.

On July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]'') would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/466030--cookie-jar-buys-care-bears-strawberry-shortcake |author=Associated Press (AP) |title=Cookie Jar buys Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise.

In late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, "Care Power Team". This re-imagining re-used the ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'' designs, has the bears sport "enhanced belly badges", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: ''[[Care Bears: Share Bear Shines]]'', ''[[Care Bears: The Giving Festival]]'' and ''Care Bears: To the Rescue''. In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.

=== 2012 relaunch ===
In July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |last=Bond |first=Paul |title=Care Bears to Star in New CGI-Animated TV Show |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[e5 Global Media]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710035247/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'', it premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |author=[[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] |title=The Hub Television Network Unveils 2012-'13 Program Slate With Four New Original Series Joining Eight Returning Original Series |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |work=[[MarketWatch]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418145726/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with [[Sanrio]] for a co-branding with the character franchise ''Little Twin Stars''. An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |title=Care Bears and Little Twin Stars enter co-branding program |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215063349/http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called ''Just Play''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |title=Care Bears count down to new toy line |website=Kidscreen |date=August 12, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029203238/http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.

In October 2014, When [[Hub Network|The Hub]] changed over to [[Discovery Family]], it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.

In January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called ''Care Bears and Cousins'' after The Hub cancelled ''Welcome to Care-a-Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |title=Netflix reviving Care Bears with new series set for 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135123/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |archive-date=May 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.

=== 2018 relaunch ===
In September 2018, a new television series, titled ''Care Bears: Unlock the Magic'', was announced. The series is to premiere on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as "the team"s newest pet and companion". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=ToonBarnTweets|number=999141838022938624|title=Care Bears: Unlock the Magic Licensing Expo 2018 ad.

== Characters and universe ==
{{fanpov|section|date=August 2018}}
{{Main|List of Care Bear characters}}
The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as "the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the [[Easter Bunny]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ashkinaze |first=Carole |title=Editorial: In quest to be Mayor, Lomax's Achilles heel was his own image |date=August 11, 1989 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |page=A23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.

The ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.

For the new 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.

Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.&lt;ref name=cbsite /&gt;

Throughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]] and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim &amp; Dumb in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.

=== Magic spells ===
The Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the "Care Bear Stare" (a.k.a. "Belly Magic"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in ''Oopsy Does It!''. In the new series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.

In the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears...prepare to stare!" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears Countdown!"

During the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the "Care Bear Cousin Call". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.

Although commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode "Tell-Tale belly".

In addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.

=== Caring meter ===
Shown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on "caring missions" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring ''anywhere''), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.

Initially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' and the first season of ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. With the release of ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.

== Merchandise ==
Apart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt; During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt;

When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.&lt;ref name="cbsite" /&gt;

In his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as "highly specialized" toys. "So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality", he stated. "Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit."&lt;ref name=pantheon&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=98 |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}
Many children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include "Meet the Care Bear Cousins" (based on the first movie), "Sweet Dreams for Sally", "The Witch Down the Street", "The Trouble with Timothy", and "A Sister for Sam". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt; As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.

In ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) "were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?"&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=217 |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comics ==
Between November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Retrieved April 16, 2006. [https://www.webcitation.org/66uZzvdc2?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the [[Madballs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |author="Wes" |title=''Care Bears'' No. 13 ... in which the Care Bears meat the Madballs |year=2008 |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |publisher=Scary-Crayon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014222444/http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |archivedate=October 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.

== Music ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}
At the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. These included "Introducing the Care Bears", "The Care Bears Care For You", "Adventures in Care-a-lot", "The Care Bears' Birthday Party", and "The Care Bears' Christmas" (all from 1983), and 1986's "Friends Make Everything Better" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt;

All of the albums from 1983 (except for "Birthday Party") featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]] (who were the lead singers of [[The Turtles]], also known as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]]; former [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] from [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from [[The Care Bears Movie]] featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]], who sang lead for [[The Lovin' Spoonful]].

In the midst of the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album came out, as well as ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' the following year.

The cover of both ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'' and ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' advertises another two CDs, called ''Care Bears Share A Smile'' and ''Care Bears Let's Be Friends''. As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.

== Music videos ==
Approximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single "[[I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer]]" from Swedish rock band [[The Cardigans]]' sixth studio album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'', there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.

== Video games ==
A Care Bears game was planned for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="protoCBGame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |title=Care Bears |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |publisher=Atari Protos |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103164456/http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.

In 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, ''Care-a-lot Jamboree'' for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, ''Let's Have a Ball!'' was released. In the same year they were featured in ''Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring'' for the [[V.Smile]] educational game console.

In 2005, they appeared in ''Catch a Star'' (also for the PC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Entertainment briefs column |date=October 15, 2005 |work=[[Ventura County Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Care Bears: Care Quest'' (for the [[Game Boy Advance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Teachers' Picks: Best New Tech |date=May 1, 2006 |work=Scholastic Parent and Child |publisher=Scholastic Press |volume=13 |number=6 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, ''Care Bears Play Day'', was released for the [[V.Smile]] Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.

them, ''Care Bears Share-A-Story'', was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a [[Teddy Ruxpin]]. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as [[The Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears]], [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and the [[Three Little Pigs]]. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/press/pr_050606_CB.aspx |title=Storytime Has Never Been So Magical!

Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.

Additionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Another Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Lastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called ''Hide 'N Seek Care Bears'', comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Bhutan's film industry is highly influenced by neighboring India's [[Bollywood]], with most Bhutanese films being adaptations of Indian ones or based on the Bollywood format.&lt;ref name="WSJ Bollywood" /&gt; Recently,{{when|date=December 2016}} there have been calls by local filmmakers for a tilt towards originality in Bhutanese cinema. Many films have started to blend Indian cinema with local [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teachings and traditions, and Bollywood films are now rarely seen in Bhutanese cinema halls after more than a decade of domination.&lt;ref name="WSJ Bollywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt Ind" /&gt; Storytelling based on Buddhist oral history and supernatural beliefs are increasingly influencing Bhutanese cinematic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Storytelling in Bhutanese cinema: Research context and case study of a film in development|author1=Chaudhuri, Shohini|author2=Clayton, Sue|journal=Journal of Screenwriting|year=2012|volume=3|issue=2|pages=197–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ''[[Travellers and Magicians]]'' was the first feature film to be entirely shot within Bhutan. {{as of|2011}}, Bhutan's film industry produces an average of thirty films a year.&lt;ref name="BFI report 2011" /&gt;

By 2012, [[Thimpu]] had six cinema halls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=14705 Two new cinema halls in Thimphu – BBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan's film industry is expected to grow and present innovative concepts and new types of internet and social media communication in this highly competitive market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-20111.pdf|title=Bhutan Film Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and media developments==
Conventional film made a fast beginning after a blend of a few systems by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] in France. After first open screening of movie on December 28, 1895 in [[Paris]], film went far and wide. The Lumière siblings are said to have gone travelling with their alleged "cinématographe" in 1896, visiting [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[New York City]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. These days the digitization of accumulations and media and the ascent and development of new advancements for smaller buyer related applications summon central inquiries to the position of media partners and the customary ideal models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011|title=Bhutan film industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little and forthcoming country states and additionally generally prevailing "silver screen" nations such as Germany, France and the United States consider their silver screen, film and media industries as an remarkable chance to create aesthetic and business disclosure. There is a developing enthusiasm for up and coming country states and new film businesses grasping new media to draw in and increase, new markets, groups of onlookers (between) national fame and to build up a national personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.|title=Bhutan film industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutan film industry==
The BBS narrative ''The Cost of Climate Change'' (2009) won the [[United Nations Correspondents Affiliation]] (UNVA) worldwide prize for Climate change. Dorji Wangchuk won a universal grant in 2003 for his film ''School Among Glaciers'' (Bhutan 2003). From that point forward this title has won 15 national and universal honors in radio and TV.&lt;ref&gt;Source: ABU – Asian Pacific Broadcasting Union&lt;/ref&gt; The holder, a short film, coordinated by Jamyang Dorji, debuted at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was screened in [[Brussels]] together with ''Original Photocopy of Joy'' by Dechen Roder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bhutanandpartners.org/.../2011/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-20111.pdf|title=Bhutan Film Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhutan Beskop film celebration (2010, 2011) opens ways to elective expressions movies, and is viewed with extraordinary enthusiasm by outside media.

The business film industry is the fundamental generator of film preparations. Financial specialists and sometimes banks fund business preparations that are screened in one of Bhutan's seven cinemas, of which the Lugar lobby with 880 seats is the biggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/bhutan|title=Bhutan cinemas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's Bhutan film industry creates a great (low spending plan) generation level and has all the earmarks of being a utilization industry, with included esteem from business and imaginative viewpoints. A sum of 152 Bhutanese movies were created in the main decade of the 21st century. Bhutan has two distribution houses. Business movies are periodically in light of an "affection" subject, here and there joined with a social issue (HIV, urbanization) taking after a customary script with exchanges, tunes, dances, complicated relations and a battle. Spending plans change from $15,000 to $50,000. Compensations for performers and vocalists have gone up from $1,000 (2006) to $10,000 per film for top on-screen characters in 2011. Real uses for film preparations are coordinations, gear and compensations.

The brut income for a well known film (up to 90,000 onlookers) may reach up to $140,000, while less well known movies may raise half of it and unpopular movies hazard shortages.

==Main issues==
Market: the market of film buyers may develop, so will the enthusiasm for outside preparations increment when current, agreeable and sumptuous films will show up in huge urban communities. The greater part of the present low spending creations may do well in shoddy lodging; buyers with a higher buy power may lean toward global top creations from the SAARC district and past. Silver screen proprietors may get to be master dynamic software engineers and concentrate on chose customer gatherings to improve their benefits. Advertising powers may after some time dissuade the making of minimal cost residential productions.

Production: Bhutan's film industry has a couple of creation houses, leasing film gear; a couple travel operators encouraged outside movie producers shooting a narrative then again highlight film in Bhutan. A couple sound studios have showed up in Thimphu. A completely prepared film studio that incorporates into entryway shooting potential outcomes with cutting edge gear does not exist in Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.pdf|title=Bhutan film industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quality: Bhutanese group of onlookers incline toward local preparations to Indian (Bollywood) and American ([[Hollywood]]) movies, right now. For the most part since the theaters were appearing obsolete (shoddy) global movies. Local business movies are made with a low financial plan, taking after an arrangement increased in value by the present mass film purchasers. Developments happen in the non-business part. Upgrades are required on the whole parts of generation: script-writing, acting, method, sound, light, and stories.

Dissemination: Films are being circulated by the makers venturing to every part of the nation with the ace tape, a screen and [[DVD]] player to demonstrate the film in semi urban and provincial ranges in schools, metropolitan lobbies or the outside. Proficient merchants don't exist in Bhutan. Fear for robbery of new discharges and need for the makers to keep grasp on wages reject merchants coming in.

Robbery: [[Copyright infringement|Piracy]] has been a worldwide issue and influences the Bhutan film industry. DVDs are effortlessly duplicated in Nepal/India and retailed through shops in the urban areas. Against theft control and security of aesthetic property are not powerful to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldscinema.org/category/bhutan|title=Bhutan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makers are hesitant to share their movies on DVD or with media (BBS, nearby TV stations). Elective deals strategies, as Web deals, pay by view, or deal through daily papers (purchase a paper, get a DVD) are not yet practiced.

The Bhutan film industry and its residential market offer sufficient chances to form into an expert and gainful industry. The expansion of procurement power furthermore, the interest for class stimulation will urge popular silver cinemas to come to Bhutan. Bhutan is increasing global intrigue and ubiquity on account of its image (exclusive, authentic, GNH), area/landscapes, stories and skilled performing artists. Pulling in outside preparations with best in class offices (studio, hardware, staff, coordinations) may create motivation and pay for both the film business and the Royal Government of Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.pdf|title=/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making up for lost time with the Western multi media outlet (books, magazines, web, DVD/CD, web shops, appears, celebrations) opens ways to coordinate movies into an expansive supply of excitement for a developing purchaser showcase in Bhutan and beyond.The non-business segment is going to desert its underground status and may before long be prepared to get a relentless stage at global film celebrations.

Bhutan film industry requires a typical vision on grasping, executing and utilizing new instruments (TV, web, boisterous processing) of cutting edge film and Bhutan's forthcoming film industry. Bhutan's film industry requires pertinent guidelines and controls to oversee (between )national advancements and ventures. Issues like audit (restriction), theft, copyrights and standards and controls with respect to the parts of umbrella associations what's more, experts are to be managed by the media partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutanandpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.pdf|title=Bhutan-Film-Industry-29-12-2011.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dreambox''' is a series of [[Linux]]-powered [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] [[DVB-S|satellite]], [[DVB-T|terrestrial]] and [[DVB-C|cable]] [[digital television]] receivers ([[set-top box|set-top boxes]]), produced by [[Germany|German]] multimedia vendor Dream Multimedia.

== History and description ==
The Linux-based production software originally used by Dreambox was originally developed for [[DBox2]], by the Tuxbox project. The Dbox2 was a proprietary design distributed by [[Kirch Group#KirchMedia|KirchMedia]] for their [[Pay television|pay TV]] services. The [[bankruptcy]] of KirchMedia flooded the market with unsold boxes available for Linux enthusiasts. The Dreambox shares the basic design of the DBox2, including the Ethernet port and the PowerPC processor.

Its [[firmware]] is officially user-upgradable, since it is a Linux-based computer, as opposed to third-party "patching" of alternate receivers. All units support Dream's own [[DreamCrypt]] [[conditional access]] (CA) system, with software-emulated [[Conditional-access module|CA Modules]] (CAMs) available for many alternate CA systems. The built-in [[Ethernet]] interface allows networked computers to access the recordings on the internal hard disks on some Dreambox models. It also enables the receiver to store digital copies of DVB [[MPEG transport stream]]s on [[distributed file system]]s or broadcast the streams as [[IPTV]] to [[VideoLAN]] and [[XBMC|XBMC Media Center]] clients. Unlike many PC based [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] systems that use [[free-to-air]] type of DVB receiver cards, the built-in conditional access allows receiving and storing encrypted content.

In 2007, Dream Multimedia also introduced a non-Linux based Dreambox receiver, the DM100, their sole to date, still featuring an Ethernet port. It has a USB-B port for service instead of the RS232 or mini-USB connectors found on other models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/english/products_flyer.php Dream-Multimedia-Tv GmbH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405202415/http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/english/products_flyer.php |date=April 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other Dreamboxes, it features an [[STMicroelectronics]] CPU instead of PowerPC or MIPS.

== Dreambox models ==
There are a number of different models of Dreambox available. The numbers are suffixed with -S for Satellite, -T for Terrestrial and -C for Cable:

* **[[HDMI]] via [[HDMI#Compatibility with DVI|DVI to HDMI adapter]].
* Remark: The new 7020hd v2 has a new Flash with an other structure, that is why you need a different Linux Image. All new v2 Modells have a new TPM module inside. The rest of the Hardware is identical with the older one.

=== DM 7000 ===
[[Image:Dreambox 7000-S.jpg|thumb|DM 7000-S]]
The DM 7000 is based around the IBM STB04500 controller, featuring a PowerPC processor subsystem and hardware MPEG decoding, has 64 [[mebibyte|MiB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], 8 MiB of [[Flash memory#NOR flash|NOR flash]] memory (directly executable), a [[Common Interface]] slot, a dual [[smart card]] reader, a [[CompactFlash]] card reader, a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 1.1 port, and an [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] (also known as [[Parallel ATA|PATA]]) interface for attaching an internal 3.5 in [[hard disk drive]] to convert the unit into a [[digital video recorder]]. Accepts only 230 V AC power.&lt;ref&gt;In order to use model DM 7000 within North America, a stepup [[transformer]] is needed to run the Dreambox on 230 V. This is the only model Dreambox that requires this when used in North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the boot loader resides in flash memory, this model may require the use of a [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]] in case of bad flashing which destroyed the boot loader. However, a bad flash will occur under rare scenarios, and rarely, almost never, will you need a JTAG.

=== DM 5600, DM 5620 ===

There was a DM 5600 and also a DM 5620 model. The only difference being that the DM 5620 included an Ethernet port.
Otherwise, the DM 56X0 models were a cut down version of the DM 7000 without an IDE interface. They did, however, include an [[RF modulator]] allowing them to be used with older TVs that lack a [[SCART]] connector.

=== DM 500, DM 500+, DM500HD ===

The DM500 is the successor to the DM5620 and is the smallest and cheapest Dreambox. It is based around an IBM [[STBx25xx]] Digital Set-Top Box Integrated Controller, featuring notably a 252&amp;nbsp;MHz [[PowerPC]] processor subsystem, hardware [[MPEG-2]] video and audio decoding and smart card interfaces. The DM500 features 32 MB of RAM and 8 MB of NOR flash memory, of which 5 MB are used for read-only firmware ([[cramfs]] and [[squashfs]] filesystems), 256 kB by the boot loader and the rest by a writable [[jffs2]] filesystem.

It has the standard features of a free-to-air (FTA) satellite receiver, plus extensive [[Fast Ethernet]] networking connectivity and a single smart card reader. It does not feature a 7-segment LED display, normally found in other FTA decoders.

Also has the ability to be used on Digital satellite, cable and terrestrial broadcasts (also known as DVB-S, DVB-C, DVB-T).

The DM500+ model has 96 MB of RAM instead of 32, and 32 MB of NAND flash instead of 8 MB of NOR flash. This makes it similar to the DM600 PVR model. It is only available in DVB-S versions.

The new DM500HD was announced in [[Cologne]] on May 26, 2009. The price will be between {{nowrap|€ 350}} and {{nowrap|€ 400}}.

=== DM 7020 ===
The DM 7020 is essentially an updated DM 7000 with 96 MiB of RAM, 32 MiB of [[Flash memory#NAND flash|NAND flash]] (disk-like) and an RF modulator. Changes were also made on the software side, utilizing Open Embedded for the base Linux operating system.

Because the flash memory of this model is not directly executable, the primary boot loader resides in ROM and can recover corrupted secondary boot loader in flash by loading from the serial port.

There are some [[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2 (beta) images already available for this model.

=== DM 7025, DM 7025+ ===
The DM 7025 is similar to the DM7020 but with the ability to add a second "snap-in" [[TV tuner card|tuner]] that makes it possible to watch one program while recording another. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between any two of Satellite, Terrestrial or Cable versions.

Internally, it features a [[Xilleon]] 226 [[system-on-a-chip]] from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], integrating a 300&amp;nbsp;MHz [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] CPU core instead of the traditional PowerPC found in other models, and has 128 MiB of RAM. It uses [[Enigma (DVB)|Enigma]] 2, this is a complete rewrite of the original Enigma GUI, and is still going through growing pains as features that were present in Enigma are added to Enigma2. Enigma2 is [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-based instead of C code.

The DM 7025 has the ability to decode MPEG-2 HD as well. Unfortunately, it must downconvert this to 480i or 576i to display it.
The DM 7025+ model features an [[Organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display instead of an LCD one, an eject button on the Common Interface slot and improved power supply.

=== DM 600 PVR ===
The DM 600 PVR is the same small size as the DM 500 but includes an IDE interface allowing to add an internal 2.5 in laptop-type hard disk drive, the box will only recognise 5600rpm drives. On the outside it adds an [[S-Video]] output connector and an analog modem port. It is built around the same IBM STBx25xx integrated controller, but features 32 MiB of flash and 96 MiB of RAM, of which 64 MiB are user-accessible. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between Satellite, Terrestrial and Cable versions. There is still just one SCART connector and no 7-segment LED display, just 2 status LEDs. The provided remote control unit is the same one supplied with the 7000, 7020 and 7025 and allows one to control the TV set as well.

=== DM 800HD PVR / DM 800 HD se ===
This is essentially a [[High-definition television|high definition]] version of the DM 600 [[Digital video recorder|PVR]], featuring a single pluggable [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] tuner ([[DVB-S|S]]/[[DVB-S2|S2]], [[DVB-C|C]] or [[DVB-T|T]]), a 300&amp;nbsp;MHz [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processor, 64 MiB of [[Flash memory]], 256 MiB of RAM and room for an internal [[serial ATA|SATA]] 2.5 in [[Hard disk drive|disk]]. It also features one [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI to HDMi Cable]], two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 2.0, one [[Serial ATA#eSATA|eSATA]] and one 10/100 Mbit/s [[Ethernet]] interfaces. It has an [[OLED]] display.

DM 800HD se was introduced in late 2010.  The main differences of the DM800HD se compared to the DM 800HD are a 400&amp;nbsp;MHz [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] processor, a HDMI connector and a color [[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]] display. Another difference is the improved system chip in DM800se providing native DIVX support among other improvements.

=== DM 8000 HD PVR ===
[[File:DM 8000 HD PVR - 021.JPG|thumb|DM 8000 HD PVR]]
This is the [[High-definition television|high definition]] PVR. Like the DM-7025, it supports pluggable tuner modules. In addition to High Definition, it has an upgrade for a DVD drive (slot in). And it has USB 2.0. Physically on the box it has one DVI-port, but with the supplied [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI to HDMi Cable]] you get HDMI video.

Originally announced to become available in the beginning of 2007, its release date was pushed back.
The product then began shipping on 12.12.2008. The planned features were revised as well. Originally, this model was supposed to have 128 MiB of RAM (now 256), 32 MiB of flash (now 256 MiB) and a 300&amp;nbsp;MHz processor (now 400&amp;nbsp;MHz Broadcom 7400).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/dm-8000-hd-pvr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103003448/http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/dm-8000-hd-pvr |archivedate=2012-11-03 |df= }} DM8000 technical data&lt;/ref&gt; Other Linux-based HD receivers became available in the meantime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In June 2012, Dream Multimedia announced the discontinuation of the DM 8000 HD PVR because several electronic components are no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/dm8000-production-shut-down DM8000 Production is shut down&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced, that no direct successor will be developed since Dream Multimedia is already working at "Project Goliath".

=== "Project Goliath" ===
"Project Goliath", announced in June 2012, is supposed to be a possible successor of several Dreambox models. According to Dream Multimedia, it is a "totally new hardware and software product, combining all the features of the successful Dreambox series, and indeed will go beyond that".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/en/goliath-more-just-digital-tv Goliath – more than just digital TV&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative firmware and plug-ins ==
The factory-installed distribution on the Dreambox is mostly available under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) and uses standard Linux [[API]]'s, including ''Linux DVB API'' and ''Linux Infrared Remote Control'' ([[LIRC]]). Several models (7025, 800 and 8000) use [[GStreamer]] as a multimedia framework. This configuration encourages enthusiasts to modify its functions, particularly in the form of so-called images.

=== Plug-ins ===
There are also many third party addons and [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] available that will extend the functionality of the Dreambox. Some plugins are model specific, while others run on all boxes. Plugins such as Jukebox and [[SHOUTcast]] playback, also external [[XMLTV]] guides, a [[web browser]] are available, and a [[VLC media player]] interface for on demand [[streaming media]]. Games are also abundant like [[Pac-Man]] and [[Tetris]].

In addition, unofficial third-party conditional access software modules (CAMs or emulators) are widely circulated on the [[Internet]] that [[Emulator|emulate]] the CA systems developed by [[NDS Group|NDS]] ([[VideoGuard]]), Irdeto, [[Conax]], [[Nagravision]], [[Viaccess]] and other proprietary vendors. Some Dreambox owners use these ''softcams'' in conjunction with [[card sharing]] software to access pay TV services without a subscription card inserted in every connected box. This practice may be illegal in some jurisdictions and third-party software for this purpose is neither officially endorsed nor supported by Dream Multimedia and voids the official warranty.

== Clones ==
Clones of the DM500-S are wide spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/english/dm500_copy_eng.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312002130/http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/english/dm500_copy_eng.php |archivedate=2008-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, Dream Multimedia introduced the DM500+, with changes to try to prevent further counterfeiting.

Clones also exist of DM500, DM800, DM800se and DM800se V2 built around the same commodity IBM SoC chip and hence having identical or slightly superior features they are also sold without the Dreambox brand name (e.g., the Envision 500S, with 48 megabytes of RAM instead of 32, also available in a 500C cable version, the Eagle box or the Linbox 5558, or Sunray DM800se). They have a retail price approaching that of non-Linux receivers, generally a fraction of the Dreambox 500 price. Since they contain a copy of the copyrighted original DM500 bootloader program, the legality of these devices is questionable.

In April 2008, Dream Multimedia allegedly introduced a time bomb into their latest flash to disable the boot loader on counterfeit models. An unofficial firmware group called Gemini who used the latest flash drivers in their firmware, found that flash corruption would be caused on clone DM500-S receivers. Other developers of unofficial firmware groups would find boxes to be affected by this if they use the latest drivers, providing another time bomb is to be introduced.

==Galaxy on Fire==
Fishlabs Entertainment is best known for its flagship sci-fi series [[Galaxy on Fire]], whose second installment Galaxy on Fire 2 got awarded with the German Video Game Award for the "Best Mobile Game" in 2011 (see below). In the game the player takes the role of Keith T. Maxwell, an intergalactic adventurer and space war veteran on a quest to save the universe from space pirates, smugglers, hijackers and a mysterious alien armada known as Voids.

Over the years, Fishlabs has released various versions of Galaxy on Fire 2. The most important ones are the HD version for [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 4S]], [[iPad 2]], the [[New iPad]], [[iPad (4th generation)]] and the [[BlackBerry PlayBook]] as well as the classic SD version for older iOS devices, the THD version for Android smart phones and tablets with an Nvidia Tegra 2 chipset, the Xperia Play version for Sony Ericsson's PlayStation-certified smart phone of the same name and the Full HD version for Mac and PC. The add-ons Galaxy on Fire 2 - Valkyrie and Galaxy on Fire 2 - Supernova, which give the player access to new ships, weapons, missions and storylines, have so far been released for iOS devices and Macs only—with the exception of Valkyrie being available for the Xperia Play as well.

'''''Flipper''''' (also known as '''''Flipper – The New Adventures''''') is an American revival [[television series]] of the original [[Flipper (1964 TV series)|1964 ''Flipper'' television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/tv-54468_1_flipper |title=SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO : Second-generation Flipper makes a splash on KCAL with environmental slant - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1995-10-08 |accessdate=2012-11-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205180516/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/tv-54468_1_flipper |archivedate=2013-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two seasons aired in [[first-run syndication]]; Seasons 3 and 4 aired on the [[ION Television|PAX network]].

The series was set in a town named Bal Harbor that was supposed to be in the [[Florida Keys]] region. (There is an actual town in Florida with a similar name, [[Bal Harbour, Florida]] just north of the City of [[Miami Beach]].) However, it was largely filmed in [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia.  Three episodes during the first season, including the pilot, were filmed in [[Pigeon Key, Florida]] and at the [[Dolphin Research Center]] in [[Grassy Key, Florida]].

The series is unrelated to the [[Flipper (1996 film)|1996 film of the same title]] which was also a remake of the 1960s TV series and films.

==Plot==
Season 1 opens with the adult Dr. Keith "Bud" Ricks ([[Brian Wimmer]]) from the original 1964 ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]'' series leading dolphin research at the Bal Harbour Marine Institute in the [[Florida Keys]].   Dr. Pam Blondell ([[Colleen Flynn]]) is a naval officer, relocated to the Florida Keys to join Dr. Ricks at the institute to perform dolphin research.  Dr. Blondell is accompanied by her son Mike ([[Payton Haas]]), a rebellious teen.  Mike is unhappy about the move until he meets Maya Graham ([[Jessica Alba]]), a free-spirited 14-year-old girl who has a special connection with Flipper and the ocean.

At the beginning of Season 2, Dr. Ricks, Dr. Blondell, and her son Mike are written out of the series by leaving Bal Harbour.   Dr. Jennifer Daulton takes over as the institute's director. Maya becomes an intern at the institute, while two new interns, Dean Gregson ([[Scott Michaelson]]) and Holly Myers ([[Anja Coleby]]), are introduced. Next door to the institute, a new substation for Air Sea Rescue opens, introducing Deputies Tom Hampton ([[Whip Hubley]]) and Quinn Garnett ([[Wren T. Brown]]).  The deputies are responsible for rescuing people in trouble at sea, and perform numerous rescues through the season. Hampton and Dr. Daulton have an on-and-off romance during the season. Edward "Cap" Daulton ([[Gus Mercurio]]), Dr. Daulton's estranged father, also moves to Bal Harbour to try and re-establish a relationship with his daughter. Cap is a charter boat captain and owns his own boat, the Maria D, named after his late wife.

In Season 3, Dr. Daulton and Maya are written out of the series by leaving Bal Harbour to perform research in the Red Sea and San Diego. Lt. Alex Parker ([[Tiffany Lamb]]), a navy marine, becomes the institute's director, and marries Tom Hampton. Hampton and Parker, along with her two kids, Chris ([[Craig Marriott]]) and Jackie ([[Laura Donaldson]]), set up housekeeping, and the series begins to focus more on their family. Deputy Mark Delaney ([[Darrin Klimek]]) also replaces Garnett as Hampton's partner at the substation.  At the marine institute, Holly remains an intern, but Dean leaves. Cap still appears throughout Seasons 3 and 4 but is noticeably absent from many episodes.

In Season 4, Tom's niece Courtney Gordon ([[Skye Patch]]), moves in with the Hampton/Parker family after being unhappy living with her mother in Washington D.C. Season 4 is essentially a continuation of Season 3 with no major changes. Most episodes are self-contained and there is very little in the way of serialized storylines between episodes.
The series ends on a shockingly tragic note as Flipper accidentally becomes beached on a sand dune and is unable to free himself. Upon learning what has happened, the entire cast rushes to the scene but arrives too late; Flipper's heart stops as they are trying to save him. The final scene of the series shows Jackie mourning Flipper's loss, then he's shown to be alive and the show ends with them playing in the water and she says "Everything's gonna be just fine".

Since ''Flipper'' was filmed in Australia, producers had to rely heavily on Australian talent. Several regular cast members and most guest stars spoke their dialogue using non-native American accents. During Seasons 3 and 4, Whip Hubley and Gus Mercurio were the only American actors in the main cast. All other main characters were portrayed by Australian actors.

''Flipper'' had many notable guest stars, including [[Alan Dale]], [[Dwight Schultz]], [[Nicholas Hammond]], [[Jane Badler]], [[Robert Coleby]] (father of Anja Coleby), and [[Season Hubley]] (real life sister of Whip Hubley). In fact, many of these guest stars made more than one appearance, portraying different characters each time. Seasons 3 and 4 regular cast member Darrin Klimek also appeared briefly as a different character in the Season 1 episode "Treasure Hunt".

==Locations==
The primary setting for ''Flipper'' was The Bal Harbor Research Institute, a fictional dolphin research facility funded by the fictional Bal Harbor University.

Between Seasons 1 and 2, The Air Sea Rescue Substation was built next door to the Research Institute when the series began focusing less on ocean and dolphin research based plots. The Air Sea Rescue was located directly on the beach and had access to its own helicopter and hovercraft for rescues.  A speedboat was also added in Season&amp;nbsp;3.

The Shipwreck was a restaurant located between the marine institute and the substation. The restaurant opened in Season 2 and was featured until the end of the series. During Season 1, the Shipwreck's building was the residence of Dr. Keith Ricks.

At the start of Season 3, Tom Hampton married Alex Parker and they moved into a house with Alex's children, Chris and Jackie. The house contained an in-ground swimming pool and large dock.

===Filming locations===
Initial production on ''Flipper'' began in the [[Florida Keys]] with the pilot and two other episodes filmed there in Season 1. Three locations were used for the "Bal Harbor Research Institute" including [[Pigeon Key]] and the Dolphin Research Center on [[Grassy Key]], with a third location used for the beach where Maya first meets Mike. A fourth location, just east of [[Conch Key]] adjacent to Overseas Highway 1, was used when Maya meets Keith in a Jeep to inform him Mike is in trouble. This is the same location used in the movie ''[[True Lies]]''.

Three different filming locations were used to portray the Research Institute. The pool area of the institute was filmed at [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], Gold Coast. The two-story building was notable for being the only set used for the entire run of the series, although it did not appear in every episode. The same set was re-used with little modification for other film and television productions such as [[Sabrina Down Under]]. After filming on Flipper wrapped, the building was demolished in order to accommodate Sea World's Imagine Dolphin Show attraction located nearby.  Although the area is unrecognizable today, an aerial shot in the Season 1 episode "F. Scott" shows the original configuration of the building at Sea World.

During the first two seasons only, indoor office space for the institute also appears. It is believed that this was filmed on a soundstage at either Sea World or [[Warner Bros. Movie World]].

The exterior façade of the institute's building along the waterfront was filmed in park space abutting the [[Gold Coast Broadwater]] located in [[Southport, Queensland]] (a suburb of Gold Coast) near Ephraim Island. The Ephraim Island road bridge is visible in many waterfront shots in the latter half of the series. The same location was used for the Air Sea Rescue Substation and The Shipwreck. All three buildings along the beachfront and park space were demolished in the early 2000s to make way for apartment buildings and a small harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=323+Bayview+Street,+Gold+Coast,+Queensland,+Australia&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=-27.888606,153.405704&amp;sspn=0.013447,0.027487&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=323+Bayview+St,+Gold+Coast+Queensland+4216,+Australia&amp;z=17 |title=323 Bayview Street, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia - Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hampton/Parker family home was filmed at an actual house (now known as McKinnon House) located at 1 Howard St. in the Gold Coast suburb of Runaway Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Gold+Coast,+1+Howard+Street,+Runaway+Bay,+Queensland,+Australia&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=-27.896012,153.401186&amp;sspn=0.006723,0.013744&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=1+Howard+St,+Runaway+Bay+Queensland+4216,+Australia&amp;ll=-27.904647,153.406199&amp;spn=0.00084,0.001718&amp;t=h&amp;z=20 |title=Gold Coast, 1 Howard Street, Runaway Bay, Queensland, Australia - Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house was located just south of the research institute, substation, and shipwreck filming locations. The exterior of the house today is relatively unchanged since filming of Flipper wrapped in 2000.

Numerous scenes were filmed in and under the water.  Many scenes above water were filmed in the channels and islands of the Gold Coast Broadwater while some diving scenes were filmed in giant water tanks located at Warner Bros. Movie World.

The game has received generally favourable reviews, with a [[Metacritic]] score of 79 out of 100 based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt; ''[[TouchArcade]]'' said, "If you could only have one ''Fruit Ninja'' game on your phone, I'd tell you to keep the original. It has a lot more to offer. But ''Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots'' is well worth playing, even if it's more expansion than stand-alone".&lt;ref name="TouchArcade" /&gt; ''AppSmile'' said, "While remaining very similar to its predecessor, the Puss In Boots version brings with it an exciting new game mode that makes the [[sequel]] a worthwhile pick-up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appsmile.com/2011/10/23/fruit-ninja-puss-in-boots-review/|title=Fruit Ninja: Puss In Boots Review|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] said, "Like ''[[Angry Birds Rio]]'', ''Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots'' is a much better game than it needed to be.

Synonymous scales have different names per region of Japan, as well as according to several ethnomusicologists and researchers, which may lead to some confusion. For example, the [[Iwato scale|''Iwato'' scale]] bears the same intervals as Slonimsky's concept of the ''Hirajoshi'' scale, and is also the fourth mode of the [[In scale|''In'' scale]]. The same scale given by Kostka &amp; Payne matches the third mode of the ''In'' scale.

{{nihongo|'''Japan Home Video Co. Ltd. (JHV)'''|ジャパンホームビデオ株式会社|Japanhōmubideo Kabushikigaisha}} is a Japanese media corporation which produces and distributes film and video products and is also involved in TV programming and game software. It uses the label {{nihongo|'''[[Alice Japan]]'''|アリスJAPAN}} for its [[adult video]] production.

==Company history and finances==
JHV was established in May 1984 to take advantage of the explosion of [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCRs) in Japan at that time.&lt;ref name="jhvhist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhv.jp/campany-info/history.html|title=JHV Company History|publisher=JHV|accessdate=2009-04-16|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of commercial VCR Beta recorders in 1975 (and the VHS format in 1976), VCR production in Japan went from one million units in 1978 to 44 million by 1985 fueled largely by the number of movies (including pornography) available on VHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cusumano|first=M. A.|year=1992|title=Strategic Maneuvering and Mass-Market Dynamics: The Triumph of VHS over Beta|jstor=3117053|journal=Business History Review|volume=66|issue=1|pages=51–94|doi=10.2307/3117053|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/2343/1/SWP-3266-23735195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1984, the company had expanded enough to move to new headquarters in the fashionable [[Harajuku]] district of [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="jhvhist"/&gt;

The company originally used the ''Penguin'' ({{nihongo2|ぺんぎん}}) label for its videos but in April 1986, JHV founded [[Alice Japan]] (アリスJAPAN) as a label for their adult videos (AV). The company subsequently expanded into softcore movies, [[anime]] productions, computer games and, in 1996, the satellite broadcasting business. In February 2000, JHV acquired a building in the [[Jinbōchō, Tokyo|Jinbocho]] area of Tokyo and transferred its headquarters there. A further move brought the Production Center to their own building in Tokyo's [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano City]] in March 2005 which also became the company headquarters in April 2007.&lt;ref name="jhvhist"/&gt;

For the 2007 fiscal year, the corporation had sales of 2.25 billion yen (about $22.5 million) and a capital of 27 million yen (about $227,000). The company employed 34 people and had its headquarters in the JHV Building ({{nihongo2|JHV中野ビル}}) in Nakano, Tokyo.&lt;ref name="jhvinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhv.jp/campany-info/index.html

==Products==
The company is involved in the production and distribution of film, video products, music and TV programs.&lt;ref name="jhvinfo"/&gt;

===Film and video===
JHV has produced and/or distributed a number of theatrical movies, including several in the science fiction or horror genre and often with erotic overtones. Some notable film productions include the 1989 cult horror movie ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]'' directed by [[Shinya Tsukamoto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096251/
|title=Tetsuo (1989)|publisher=[[IMdB]]|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yakuza]] [[zombie]] flic [[Junk (film)|''Junk: Shiryô-gari'']] from 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273302/

|script-title=ja:死霊の罠2 ヒデキ|publisher=Japanese Movie Database|accessdate=2009-04-18|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evil Dead Trap'' was later released by JHV on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhv.jp/title/DVD/original/adsl_FV-001.html
|script-title=ja:死霊の罠|publisher=JHV|accessdate=2009-04-18|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JHV also produced the first three live-action videos of the [[manga]] based superheroine series ''[[Kekko Kamen]]'', the 1991 ''Kekko Kamen'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0099925|Keiko Mask}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kekko Kamen 2'' from 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0184639|Kekkô Kamen 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Kekko Kamen 3'', released in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0184640|Kekkô Kamen 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent productions were the 2004 drama {{nihongo|''The Hunter and the Hunted''|油断大敵|Yudan taiteki}}&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0417284|Yudan taiteki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2004/eb000200.htm|script-title=ja:油断大敵|accessdate=2011-03-22|language=Japanese|publisher=Japanese Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won awards at the 2005 [[Yokohama Film Festival]] for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best New Director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Yokohama_Film_Festival/2005|accessdate=2009-04-16|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|title=Yokohama Film Festival: 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2004 comedy ''eiko'' (エイコ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p1082590.htm |script-title=ja:ジャパンホームビデオ|accessdate=2009-05-03|language=Japanese|publisher=Japanese Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
The company has long had an interest in [[anime]] products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10653">'''Korean horror''' ('''K-horror''') [[horror film|film]]s have been around since the early years of [[Cinema of Korea|Korean cinema]], however, it was not until the late 1990s that the genre began to experience a renewal. Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit "blood and guts" aspect of horror. Korean horror features many of the same motifs, themes, and imagery as [[Japanese horror]].

Modern South Korean horror films are typically distinguished by stylish directing, themes of social commentary, and genre blending &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/06/primer-10-essential-films-of-the-korean-new-wave-84413/|title=Primer: 10 Essential Films Of The Korean New Wave|last=Staff|first=The Playlist|date=2014-06-26|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The horror and thriller genres are cited as gaining international attention to South Korean Cinema.

American Hollywood has adapted several Korean horror films such as [[Oldboy (2003 film)]], [[Into the Mirror]] (2003), and [[A Tale of Two Sisters]] (2003). [[Train to Busan]] (2016) and [[The Wailing (film)]] (2016) are rumored to currently have remakes in talks for production. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/groove/2018/09/416055/showbiz-hollywood-treatment-korean-zombie-hit-train-busan|title=#Showbiz: Hollywood treatment for Korean zombie hit 'Train To Busan'?|last=Omar|first=Aref|date=September 29, 2018|website=New Straits Times|archive-url=|archive-date=November 16, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-free-productions-talks-remake-south-korean-film-wailing-967236|title=Scott Free Productions in Talks to Remake South Korean Film 'The Wailing'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The female ghost==
The expression, "When a woman is full of resentment, she will bring frost in May and June" may offer some explanation for the popularity of the female ghost that is often featured in Korean horror films. Her deep feeling of resentment is cold enough to freeze the hot air that occurs during those months. The woman's vengeance is a thing to be feared, thus becoming the object of horror. In the past women have been oppressed and ignored for so long that the horrific rage and vengeance we see in the films have been brought upon by the many years of repression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiancorrespondent.com/korea-beat/-p-5003 "Why Do Korean Horror Movies Have Only Female Ghosts?"] ''Asian Correspondent''. Accessed Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another belief is that when a female dies before she gets to enjoy the pleasures of marriage and having children, she will not be able to move on to the "other side". Instead she becomes trapped between the two worlds and causes horrific phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/attach/6FantasticModeofFilm.pdf "Fantastic Mode of Film"] ''Korean Film Council''. p.8. Accessed Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenge ==
South Korean cinema is known for violent thrillers with themes of revenge like [[Bedevilled (2010 film)]], [[I Saw the Devil]] (2010), and [[The Vengeance Trilogy]]. The desire to create and see films about revenge is often explained as a result of social anger built up in a populace by South Korea's turbulent history. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/mar/31/south-korean-cinema-blood-saw-devil|title=Slash and earn: the blood-soaked rise of South Korean cinema|last=Andrew Lowry|date=2011-03-31|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Park Chan-wook]] director of [[The Vengeance Trilogy]] has said that his revenge motivated movies serve as a reaction to Korean culture's traditional value of peace making and Forgiveness. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://moodle.smith.edu/pluginfile.php/449168/mod_resource/content/1/Mr%20Vengeance%20%28Ian%20Buruma%29.pdf|title=Mr. Vengeance|last=Burama|first=Ian|date=April 9, 2006|work=The New York Times Magazine|access-date=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Korean Horror Film Festival==
The 2010 Korean Horror Film Festival was held in Mandaluyong City in the Philippines at the Shangri-La Plaza Mall from October 27–31 and through November 2–4. It worked together with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, The Korean-Philippine Foundation, Inc. and Shangri-La Plaza. With free admission attendees were treated to some of the best and highly successful Korean horror films. Films such as ''[[Arang (film)|Arang]]'', ''[[The Red Shoes (2005 film)|The Red Shoes]]'', ''[[M (2007 film)|M]]'', ''[[Hansel and Gretel (2007 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', ''Ghost'', ''[[Paradise Murdered]]'', and ''[[Epitaph (2007 film)|Epitaph]]'' were among the films showcased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/artsandbooks/artsandbooks/view/20101025-299543/Shang_Cineplex_hosts_2010_Korean_Horror_Movie_Festival "Shang Cineplex hosts 2010 Korean Horror Movie Festival"]. ''Inquirer LifeStyle'' Archived 25 October 2010, Accessed December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influential Korean horror films==
''[[Whispering Corridors]]'' (1998) is seen as the film to have sparked the explosion of the Korean horror genre. It centers on the theme of school girls and the mysterious "other side", but also offered criticism of the Korean school system. Four more distinct horror films set in all girls schools were made as part of [[Whispering Corridors (film series)]].

''[[A Tale of Two Sisters]]'' (2003) is the highest grossing Korean horror film so far and the first to be screened in America. It was remade in America in 2009 as ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''. Based on a [[Folklore|folk tale]] titled ''Janghwa Hongreyon-jon'', it tells the story of two sisters dealing with a controlling stepmother and a passive father.

[[Save the Green Planet!]] (2003) demonstrates Korean cinema's ability to blend genre in non-traditional ways. The film follows an unstable man who kidnaps and tortures an executive he believes to be an alien. It combines slapstick comedy, psychological thriller and sci fi horror.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2005/04/for-all-mankind-jang-jun-hwans-save-the-green-planet-78286/|title=For All Mankind: Jang Jun-hwan’s “Save the Green Planet”|last=Indiewire|date=2005-04-19|work=IndieWire|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Train to Busan]] (2016) is an action horror take on the Zombie apocalypse. The film is one of the most internationally successful films from South Korea and broke domestic box office records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/asia/korea-box-office-train-to-busan-smashes-records-1201821937/|title=Korea Box Office: Runaway ‘Train to Busan’ Smashes Records|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2016-07-25|work=Variety|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

films such as ''[[Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum]]'' (2018) have brought Korean horror films even more international attention.

'''''Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude''''' is a 2004 [[video game]], part of the ''[[Leisure Suit Larry]]'' series. The game introduces a new main character, Larry Lovage, as Larry Laffer's nephew.

==Gameplay==
Like many other current games, ''Magna Cum Laude'' has a free exploration mode where Larry can walk about campus and interact with students and personnel on the premises. In this mode, Larry can search for hidden money or tokens, strike poses to impress girls, and take photos which can later be sold to collectors. At several locations on campus a [[minigame]] can be entered, usually by "activating" an object or a person (starting a conversation). The player must win most of the minigames in order to advance. Minigames started by a conversation usually increase the affection of one of the girls; other minigames can provide money or increase "confidence".

The game originally received an "Adults Only" rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and was subsequently edited to receive a more commercial "Mature" rating in the United States and Canada. In Europe, the game was released unedited on all three systems and featured a disclaimer on the packaging highlighting that it was "uncut". The unedited version was eventually released in North America under the title ''Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude—Uncut and Uncensored!''. The major difference between the two North American releases is that the uncut and uncensored version contains [[Nudity#Full Nudity|full frontal nudity]] and [[sex scene]]s, although the latter contains very little and is mostly implied. Both versions were refused classification by the OFLC and effectively banned in Australia.

==Plot==
The main protagonist, Larry Lovage, is a student at Walnut Log Community College whose purpose is to get on a dating TV show called "Swingles". Uma Yasmine, the hostess of the show won't allow Larry on the show until he will prove his seductive wits by obtaining "tokens of affection". Sixteen college girls will conveniently be at his disposal. His aging uncle, Larry Laffer, from the original games, provides brief advice and appears at a local bar. Larry also must outsmart a sorority house and a fraternity house, known as [[Dio (band)|Dio]], where they recite lines that are actually modified lyrics of [[Black Sabbath]] songs.

A brief subplot involves the college's arena football team going against a rival team known as the ''Maiming Maggots''. However, the college's team name is a running gag because it is obscured by objects, only revealing it as ''Flaming Fa-''. The final scene shows the team name is actually the ''Flaming Fantasticks'' after the Swingles van leaves the school.

==Development==
In 2003, Sierra Entertainment announced that the ''Leisure Suit Larry'' franchise was being revived with an eighth game, called ''Leisure Suit Larry: [[Latin honors|Magna Cum Laude]]''. This is the first game in which [[Al Lowe]] is not involved in any way, as this game was created by game developer [[High Voltage Software]], Inc. On his website, Lowe talks about how he was in talk with Sierra about working with them on the game, but they stopped contacting him, as they went into downsizing. Later he received a letter from a writer on the game, where it is revealed that the game had long since been written by the time he entered discussions with Sierra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allowe.com/Larry/MCL.htm|title=Magna Cum Laude - Al Lowe's Humor Site|author=|date=|website=www.allowe.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Larry game does not star Larry Laffer, but a new character: his nephew, Larry Lovage.  There are numerous homages to the earlier Larry games: Larry Laffer is the tutorial guide and giver of questionable advice for Larry Lovage; Larry's computer is playing ''[[Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Missing Floppies]]'' ("the best game of its time"); and secret tokens featuring the likeness of the ''Where's Dildo?'' character from ''Larry 7'' can be collected. The loose storyline of the game is that Larry wants to appear on a dating TV show called ''Swingles'', but he must prove his worth before he is allowed on air.

Reviews of the game were mixed, with some praising the game for its humor but panning it for its gameplay. Many critics also took the game to task for its sexual content and humor being too direct and obvious, citing that much of the charm of the series has been in its more subtle handling of the dirty jokes and sexual situations, focusing more on double entendres than actual foul words and hints at nudity rather than full-on bare breasts. Al Lowe denounced ''Magna Cum Laude'' vigorously, emphasizing on his website that he took no part of its creation after being promised a role in its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allowe.com/Larry/MCL.htm|title=Magna Cum Laude - Al Lowe's Humor Site|author=|date=|website=www.allowe.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lipdub - 20 seinale - Altsasu.ogv|300px|thumb|Lip dub made by young [[spanish people|Navarros]] in [[Alsasua]], [[Navarre]], [[Spain]], to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their ''gaztetxe'', or [[Squatter#Spain|"youth house"]]]]

A '''lip dub''' is a type of music video that combines [[lip synch]]ing and [[Dubbing (music)|audio dubbing]] to make a [[music video]]. It is made by filming individuals or a group of people lip synching while listening to a song or any recorded audio then dubbing over it in post editing with the original audio of the song. There is often some form of mobile audio device used such as an [[MP3 player]]. Often they look like simple music videos, although many involve a lot of preparation and production. Lip dubs are usually done in a single unedited shot that often travel through different rooms and situations within a building. They have become popular with the advent of mass participatory video content sites like [[YouTube]].

==Origin==
Although lip dubbing in music videos was not a new concept, [[Jake Lodwick]], the co-founder of [[Vimeo]], coined the term "lip dubbing" on December 14, 2006, in a video entitled ''Lip Dubbing: Endless Dream''.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/123498&lt;/ref&gt; In the video's description, he wrote, "I walked around with a song playing in my headphones, and recorded myself singing. When I got home I opened it in iMovie and added an MP3 of the actual song, and synchronized it with my video. Is there a name for this? If not, I suggest 'lip dubbing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitylipdub.com/join-the-project/what-is-lipdub/|title=What is lipdub?|location=[[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, Germany]]|year=2008|accessdate=2011-02-02|publisher=[[Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Furtwangen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lodwick subsequently directed the "[[Flagpole Sitta]]" "office lip dub" in April 2007 which ''The Washington Post'' covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110802060.html|publisher=''Washington Post''|title=Office Drones, Lip-Sync Your Heart Out|date=2007-11-11|first=Dan|last=Zak|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/173714&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in the Digital Media department at [[Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Furtwangen]] produced the first university lip dub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitylipdub.com/project/|title=Join the project|location=[[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, Germany]]|year=2008|accessdate=2011-02-02|publisher=[[Furtwangen University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Furtwangen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVRrjxtm9Pk|title=University LipDub #1|location=[[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald|Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, Germany]]|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, dozens of lip dubs have been coordinated around the world by students. After L'Université du Québec à Montréal ([[UQAM]]) produced a lip dub to [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' "I Gotta Feeling" in 2009, the viral video phenomenon gained international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uqam.ca/en/interviews/lipdub2009.htm|title=The UQAM Lipdub:behind the scenes|publisher=Journal L'UQAM vol. XXXVI, no 3|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|date=2009-10-05|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphonseha.com/2009/10/japan-i-got-a-feeling-lip-dub-response-uqam/|title= Japan's I Gotta Feeling Lip dub Response|publisher=Alphonse Ha|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|date=2009-10-22|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

Tom Johnson, a technical writer who blogs about Web 2.0's effect on communication, describes a good lip dub as having the characteristics, or at least the appearance, of spontaneity, authenticity, group participation and fun.&lt;ref name="lib dub characteristics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2007/06/05/lip-dub-video-analysis/|title=Lip Dub Video Clip Captures Essence of the Web — Spontaneity, Authenticity, Participation, Fun|date=2007-06-05|first=Tom|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the season première of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' ("[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]") begins with the workers of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company doing a lip dub of [[The Human Beinz]]'s "[[Nobody but Me (The Isley Brothers song)|Nobody but Me]]" through the office.

The record of most people participating at a lip dub is 9,300 on May 31, 2012 in [[Lindsay, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/06/24/lindsay-lipdub_n_1622462.html |title=Lindsay LipDub: Ontario Town Bands Together For World's Largest LipDub (WATCH) |publisher=Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lindsay LipDub surpassed the previous record of 5,771, which was on October 24, 2010 in the town of [[Vic]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnQV4nwBb_Y&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was set to the rhythm of ''La Flama'' by the [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]n band [[Obrint Pas]] and is called Lipdub per la Independència de Catalunya "Lipdub for the Independence of Catalonia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muTMLuGWrp8 |title=Lipdub Independence Of Catalonia - Authentic World Record (Official) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record is not recognised by [[Guinness]].&lt;ref name="el9nou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el9nou.cat/noticies_o_0/14140/guinnes_reconeixera_record_que_volen_fer_vic_amb |title=Guinnes no reconeixerà el rècord que volen fer a Vic amb un 'lipdub' per la independència|date=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2011, director Rob Bliss and producer Scott Erickson made a video called ''Grand Rapids Lip Dub'' in response to a [[Newsweek]] article that listed [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] #10 on a list of "America's Dying Cities."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/21/america-s-dying-cities.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPjjZCO67WI&lt;/ref&gt; The video was labeled by [[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] as "The greatest music video ever made." The nearly nine-minute video used 5,000 citizens of the city lip-synching to [[Don McLean]]'s "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganz |first=Caryn |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/amplifier/89191/5000-residents-of-dying-city-lip-dub-song-about-day-the-music-died/ |title=5,000 Residents of ‘Dying City’ Lip Dub Song About Day the Music Died &amp;#124; Amplifier - Archives - Yahoo!

Since its 2011 release, the video has been viewed over 5 million times.

Similarly, on May 31, 2012, Stratta Creative made a lip dub video called Lindsay LipDub with the goal of becoming Canada's first citywide lip dub, as well as a world record holder for most participants (with 9300 participants), in the community of [[Lindsay, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; The [[City of Kawartha Lakes]], of which Lindsay is a community, was listed as #188 of 190 cities in Canada by ''[[MoneySense]]'', and the community gathered to perform a lip dub, promoted by [[Rick Mercer]], [[George Stroumboulopoulos]], [[Craig Kielburger]], [[Dan Kanter]] and [[Hedley (band)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nurun.com |url=http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3507241 |title=Peterborough slips to 55th out of 190 in more l... &amp;#124; Local &amp;#124; News |publisher=Peterborough Examiner |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Little Nemo'''   is a fictional character created by American cartoonist [[Winsor McCay]]. He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]'', before receiving his own spin-off series, ''Little Nemo in Slumberland''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mccay.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel.  The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.

''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' ran in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' from October 15, 1905, until July 23, 1911; the strip was renamed '''''In the Land of Wonderful Dreams''''' when McCay brought it to [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York American]]'', where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914.  When McCay returned to the ''Herald'' in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from Aug 3, 1924, until December 26, 1926, when McCay returned to Hearst.

==Concept==

A weekly fantasy adventure, ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' featured the young Nemo ("No one" in Latin) who dreamed himself into wondrous predicaments{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}} from which he awoke in bed in the last panel.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}  The first episode{{efn|{{Commons file|Little Nemo 1905-10-15.jpg|this strip (October 15, 1905)}} }} begins with a command from King Morpheus of Slumberland to a minion to collect Nemo.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97, 113}}  Nemo was to be the playmate of Slumberland's Princess, but it took months of adventures before Nemo finally arrived; a green, cigar-chewing clown named Flip was determined to disturb Nemo's sleep with a top hat emblazoned with the words "Wake Up."{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}}  Nemo and Flip eventually become companions, and are joined by an African Imp whom Flip finds in the Candy Islands.  The group travels far and wide, from shanty towns to Mars, to [[Jack Frost]]'s palace, to the bizarre architecture and distorted [[Distorting mirror|funhouse-mirror]] illusions of Befuddle Hall.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|pp=113, 118}}

[[File:Little Nemo 1907-12-01 panels 3 and 4.jpg|thumb|center|500px|alt=]]

The strip shows McCay's understanding of dream psychology, particularly of dream fears—falling, drowning, impalement.  This dream world has its own moral code, perhaps difficult to understand.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=107}} Breaking it has terrible consequences, as when Nemo ignores instructions not to touch Queen Crystalette, who inhabits a cave of glass. Overcome with his infatuation, he causes her and her followers to shatter, and awakens with "the groans of the dying guardsmen still ringing in his ears".{{efn|{{Commons file|Little Nemo 1905-11-19.jpg|this strip (November 11, 1905)}} }}{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=113}}

[[File:Little Nemo 1907-09-29.jpg|thumb|alt=|Nemo and the Little Imp explore the city as giants&lt;br/&gt;September 9, 1907]]

Although the strip began October 15, 1905 with Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, making his first attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm, Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906 and, due to Flip's interfering, did not get to see the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always interrupted by either him falling out of bed, or his parents forcibly waking him up.

On July 12, 1908, McCay made a major change of direction: Flip visits Nemo and tells him that he has had his uncle destroy Slumberland. (Slumberland had been dissolved before, into day, but this time it appeared to be permanent.) After this, Nemo's dreams take place in his home town, though Flip—and a curious-looking boy named the Professor—accompany him. These adventures range from the down-to-earth to [[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend|Rarebit-fiend]] type fantasy; one very commonplace dream had the Professor pelting people with snowballs. The famous "walking bed" story was in this period. Slumberland continued to make sporadic appearances until it returned for good on December 26, 1909.

Story-arcs included Befuddle Hall, a voyage to Mars (with a well-realized Martian civilization), and a trip around the world (including a tour of New York City).

==Style==
McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, and architectural and other detail.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}  From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo.  In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a giant turkey gobbling Nemo's house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=107}}  McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}  Narrative pacing McCay controlled through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}

[[File:Little Nemo 1905-11-26 middle five panels.jpg|center|500px|alt=Five panels of a color comic strip.  The circular center panel overwhelms the others with an image of a giant turkey lifting up and eating a house.  In the other panels, a boy is shaken from the house and falls into a lake of cranberry sauce.|McCay sized and placed panels to conform to the action they contained (November 25, 1905){{efn|{{Commons file|Little Nemo 1905-11-26.jpg|the full version of this strip (November 26, 1905)}} }}]]

In his familiar [[Art Nouveau]]-influenced style McCay outlined his characters in heavy blacks.  Slumberland's ornate architecture was reminiscent of the architecture designed by [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]] for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, as well as [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park]] and [[Dreamland (amusement park)|Dreamland]] in [[Coney Island]], and the Parisian [[Luxembourg Palace]].{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=100}}

McCay made imaginative use of color, sometimes changing the backgrounds' or characters' colors from panel to panel in a [[psychedelic (disambiguation)|psychedelic]] imitation of a dream experience.  The colors were enhanced by the careful attention and advanced [[Ben-Day dots|Ben Day]] lithographic process employed by the ''Herald''{{'}}s printing staff.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|pp=100–101}}  McCay annotated the ''Nemo'' pages for the printers with the precise color schemes he wanted.{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1994|1p=22|2a1=Canemaker|2y=2005|2p=107}}

For the first five months the pages were accompanied with captions beneath them,{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=107}} and at first the captions were numbered.{{sfn|Bukatman|2012|p=27}}  In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility,{{sfnm|1a1=Gutjahr|1a2=Benton|1y=2001|1p=166|2a1=Heller|2y=2007}} and "disfigur{{interp|ing McCay's}} otherwise flawless work", according to critic [[R. C. Harvey]].{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=28}}  The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights{{sfn|Gutjahr|Benton|2001|p=166}} what seems to be the little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition.  They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCay's gift was in the visual and not the verbal.{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=554}}

McCay used traditional ethnic stereotypes prominently in ''Little Nemo'', as in the ill-tempered Irishman Flip, and the nearly-mute African Impie.{{sfn|Winokur|2012|pp=58, 63}}

==Background==
[[Winsor McCay]]&amp;nbsp;({{circa|1867–71}}&amp;nbsp;– 1934){{efn|Different accounts have given McCay's birth year as 1867, 1869, and 1871.  His birth records are not extant.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=22}} }} had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist in carnivals and [[dime museum]]s before he began working for newspapers and magazines in 1898.  In 1903, he joined the staff of the ''[[New York Herald]]'' family of newspapers,{{sfn|Eagan|2010|p=32}} where he had success with comic strips such as ''[[Little Sammy Sneeze]]'' (1904–06){{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=75}} and ''[[Dream of the Rarebit Fiend]]''&amp;nbsp;(1904–11){{efn|''Rarebit Fiend'' was revived between 1911 and 1913 under other titles, such as ''Midsummer Day Dreams'' and ''It Was Only a Dream''.{{sfn|Merkl|2007|p=478}} }}{{sfn|Eagan|2010|p=32}}

In 1905, McCay got "an idea from the ''Rarebit Fiend'' to please the little folk".{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=87}}  In That October, the full-page [[Sunday comics|Sunday strip]] ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' debuted in the ''Herald''.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}}  Considered McCay's masterpiece,{{sfnm|1a1=Harvey|1y=1994|1p=21|2a1=Hubbard|2y=2012|3a1=Sabin|3y=1993|3p=134|4a1=Dover editors|4y=1973|4p=vii|5a1=Canwell|5y=2009|5p=19}} its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert,{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=97}} had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel.  McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}  The ''Herald'' was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time.  Its printing staff used the [[Ben-Day dots|Ben Day process]] for color.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=94}}

==Publication history==
''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' debuted on the last page of the Sunday comics section of ''[[The New York Herald]]'' on October 15, 1905.  The full-page, color comic strip ran until July 23, 1911.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=97}}  In spring 1911, McCay moved to William Randolph Hearst's ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' and took ''Little Nemo''{{'}}s characters with him.  The ''Herald'' held the strip's copyright,{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=164}} but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=168}}  In the ''American'', the strip ran under the title ''In the Land of Wonderful Dreams''.  The ''Herald'' was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=164}}

McCay left Hearst in May 1924{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=228}} and returned to the ''Herald Tribune''.  He began ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'' afresh that August 3.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=229}}  The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid.  Nemo took a more passive role in the stories,{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=226}} and there was no continuity.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=235}}  The strip came to an end in December 1926,{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=229}} as it was not popular with readers.  Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the ''American'', and succeeded in 1927.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=235}}  Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo's success, the ''Herald Tribune'' signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=237}}

In 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving ''Little Nemo''.  Comic book packager [[Harry "A" Chesler]]'s syndicate announced a Sunday and daily ''Nemo'' strip, credited to "Winsor McCay, Jr."  Robert also drew a comic-book version for Chesler called ''Nemo in Adventureland'' featuring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess.  Neither project lasted long.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=253}}  In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original ''Nemo'' strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages.  This revival also did not last.{{sfnm|1a1=Waugh|1y=1947|1pp=20–21|2a1=Canemaker|2y=2005|2p=253}}

In 1966, cartoonist [[Woody Gelman]] discovered the original artwork for many ''Little Nemo'' strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Bob had worked.  In 1973, Gelman published a collection of ''Little Nemo'' strips in Italy.{{sfn|Jamieson|2010|p=126}}  His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] at [[Ohio State University]].{{sfn|Spencer|2005}}

Collector Peter Maresca self-published a {{convert|21|xx|16|in|cm|adj=on}} volume of ''Nemo'' Sundays as ''Little Nemo in Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!''.  The volume was large enough to reproduce the pages at the size they originally appeared in newspapers.  Restoration work took Maresca five to twenty hours per page{{sfn|Boxer|2005}}  A second volume, ''Little Nemo in Slumberland: Many More Splendid Sundays!'', appeared in 2008.{{sfn|Doctorow|2008}}

==Adaptations==

[[File:Master Gabriel Little Nemo.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white photographed of a neatly-dressed young boy in a hat, sitting on a pedestal|Master Gabriel as the star of the 1907 ''Little Nemo'' musical]]

As early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to put ''Little Nemo'' on stage.  In summer 1907, [[Marcus Klaw]] and [[A. L. Erlanger]] announced they would put on an extravagant ''Little Nemo'' show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by [[Victor Herbert]]{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=141}} and lyrics by [[Harry B. Smith]].{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=141}}  It starred dwarf Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, [[Joseph Cawthorn]] as Dr. Pill, and [[Billy B. Van]] as Flip.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=143}}  Reviews were positive, and it played to sold-out houses in New York.  It went on the road for two seasons.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=148}}  McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where ''Little Nemo'' played.  When a [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|Keith]] circuit{{efn|Keith had partnered with Proctor in 1906.}} refused to let McCay perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the [[William Morris Agency|William Morris]] circuit, with a $100-a-week raise.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=149}}  In several cities, McCay brought his son, who sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo as publicity.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=151}}

As part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a "[[Whiffenpoof]]".  The word stuck with the public, and became the name of a [[s:The Whiffenpoof Song|hit song]] and a [[The Whiffenpoofs|singing group]].{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=143}} One reviewer of the 1908 operetta gave a paragraph of praise to the comic hunting tales presented in a scene in which three hunters are trying to outdo each other with hunting stories about the "montimanjack," the "peninsula," and the "whiffenpoof." He calls it "one of the funniest yarns ever spun" and compares it favorably to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[The Hunting of the Snark]].&lt;ref&gt;"Some Dramatic Notes," ''The [Duluth] Sunday News Tribune,'' November 15, 1908, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; One source indicates that the dialogue in fact began as an [[ad lib]] by actor [[Joseph Cawthorn]], covering for some kind of backstage problem during a performance.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Boardman, ''American Musical Theatre, A Chronicle,'' as cited by {{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/jeepers/woof.html|title=Cracker Jack Gobbler|author=Jim Davis|date=February 18, 2006|accessdate=2008-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907023713/http://members.cox.net/jeepers/woof.html|archive-date=September 7, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Word is also referred in one of the Little Nemo comic strips published in 1909 (April 11). After being held down by nine policemen during a hysteria crisis, Nemo’s father tells the doctor: “Just keep those whiffenpoofs away. Will you?”.

Despite the show's success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses,{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=149}} and came to an end in December 1910.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=151}}
In mid-2012 Toronto-based theatre company Frolick performed an adaptation of the strip into ''Adventures in Slumberland'', a multimedia show featuring puppets large and small and a score that included as a refrain "Wake Up Little Nemo", set to the tune of [[The Everly Brothers]]' 1957 hit "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]".{{sfn|Morrow|2012}} [[Talespinner Children's Theatre]] in [[Cleveland]], OH produced a scaled-down, "colorful and high-energy 45-minute"{{sfn|Howey|2013}} adaptation in 2013, ''Adventures In Slumberland'' by [[David Hansen (playwright)|David Hansen]].

In March 2017, a short, one-act adaptation of the "Little Nemo" adventures was staged at Fordham University in New York City. The play, simply entitled ''Little Nemo in Slumberland'', was written by Aladdin Lee Grant Rutledge Collar, and directed by student Peter McNally. The six person cast, as well as creative team, consisted of students and alums at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatre.blog.fordham.edu/studio-season-spring-2017/|title=Studio Season Fall 2017 - Theatre|author=|date=|website=fordham.edu|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

A man bets his colleagues that he can make pictures move.  He wins the bet by animating cartoon characters.|''Little Nemo'' (1911)]]

McCay played an important role in the early history of animation.  In 1911 he completed his first film, ''Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics'' (also known as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]''), first in theatres and then as part of his vaudeville act.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  McCay made the 4,000 [[Rice paper|rice-paper]] drawings for the animated portion of the film.  The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=161}}  Photography was done at the [[Vitagraph Studios]] under the supervision of animation pioneer [[James Stuart Blackton]].{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=160}}  During the live-action portion of the film, McCay bets his colleagues he can make his drawings move.  He wins the bet by animating his ''Little Nemo'' characters, who shapeshift and transform.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=161}}

In 1984, Arnaud Sélignac produced and directed a film called ''Nemo''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087784/ | title = IMDb | contribution = Nemo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dream One'', starring [[Jason Connery]], [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Carole Bouquet]]. It involves a little boy called Nemo, who wears pajamas and travels to a fantasy world, but otherwise the connection to McCay's strip is a loose one. The fantasy world is a dark and dismal beach, and Nemo encounters characters from other works of fiction rather than those from the original strip.  Instead of Flip or the Princess, Nemo meets [[Zorro]], [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] and [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]] (which was led by [[Captain Nemo]]).

A joint American-Japanese feature-length film ''[[Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland]]'' was released in 1989, with contributions by [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]],{{sfn|Grant|2006|p=46}} and music by the [[Sherman Brothers]].  The story tells of a quest by Nemo and friends to rescue King Morpheus from the Nightmare King.  The Princess is given a name, Camille, and Nemo has a pet squirrel named Icarus.{{sfn|Beck|2005|p=149}}

===Opera===

The [[Sarasota Opera]] commissioned composer [[Daron Hagen]] and librettist [[J. D. McClatchy]] to create an opera based on ''Little Nemo''.  Two casts of children alternated performances when it debuted in November 2012.  The dreamlike nonlinear story told of Nemo, the Princess, and their comrades trying to prevent the Emperor of Sol and the Guardian of Dawn from bringing daylight to Slumberland.  Special effects and shifting backgrounds were produced with projections onto a scaffolding of boxes.{{sfn|Williams|2012}} The work was first performed on November 10 and 11, 2012, by members of the Sarasota Opera, Sarasota Youth Opera, Sarasota Prep Chorus, The Sailor Circus and students from Booker High school.

===Other media===

In 1990, [[Capcom]] produced a video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], titled ''[[Little Nemo: The Dream Master]]'' (known as ''Pajama Hero Nemo'' in Japan), a licensed game based on the 1989 film. The film would not see a US release until 1992, two years after the game's Japanese release, so the game is often thought to be a standalone adaptation of ''Little Nemo'', not related to the film. An [[arcade game]] called simply ''Nemo'' was also released in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8843 |title=Nemo – Videogame by Capcom |publisher=Klov |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, various pieces of Little Nemo merchandise have been produced. In 1941, Rand, McNally &amp; Co. published a Little Nemo children's storybook. ''Little Nemo in Slumberland in 3-D'' was released by [[Blackthorne Publishing]] in 1987; this reprinted Little Nemo issues with [[Anaglyph image#Viewing|3-D glasses]]. A set of 30 Little Nemo postcards was available through Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang in 1996. In 1993, as promotion for the 1989 animated film, Hemdale produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. In 2001, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a Little Nemo statue and tin lunchbox.

== Cultural influences ==
Little Nemo itself is influenced by children stories in general, and some French comic pages in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topfferiana.fr/2008/11/le-petit-lucien-au-pays-des-reves/|title=Le Petit Lucien au Pays des Rêves - Töpfferiana|author=|date=|website=www.topfferiana.fr|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topfferiana.fr/2008/12/le-petit-lucien-deuxieme-episode/|title=Le Petit Lucien, deuxième épisode - Töpfferiana|author=|date=|website=www.topfferiana.fr|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its publishing, ''Little Nemo'' has had an influence on other artists, including [[Peter Newell]] (''The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead''), [[Frank King (cartoonist)|Frank King]] (''Bobby Make-Believe''), [[Clare Briggs]] (''Danny Dreamer'') or [[George McManus]] (''Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland''). Through the Paris edition of the [[New York Herald]], his influence reached France and other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nocturnes, le rêve dans la bande dessinée, CNBDI, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Little Nemo, un siècle de rêves, Impressions Nouvelles, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In children's literature, [[Maurice Sendak]] has said that this strip inspired his book ''[[In the Night Kitchen]]'', and [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]] included several elements from Little Nemo in his children's book ''Santa Calls'', including appearances by Flip and the walking bed.

The character and themes from the comic strip ''Little Nemo'' were used in a song "Scenes from a Night's Dream" written by [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and [[Phil Collins]] of the progressive rock group [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] on their 1978 recording, ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Another progressive rock group, from Germany, called Scara Brae also recorded a musical impression of the comic on their rare self-titled disc from 1981 (the track was actually recorded 2 years earlier). Their concept piece was revived on the second album by the Greek band Anger Department, oddly called 'The Strange Dreams of A Rarebit Fiend', again after a McCay-comic. Their 'Little Nemo' was chosen for a theatre play, which was suggested for the cultural program for the Olympic Games in 2004.

In 1984, Italian comic artist [[Vittorio Giardino]] started producing a number of stories under the title ''[[Little Ego]]'', a [[parody|parodic]] adaptation of ''Little Nemo'', in the shape of adult-oriented [[erotic comics]]. [[Brian Bolland]]'s early comic strip ''Little Nympho in Slumberland'' employed a similar technique.

The bar in ''Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'' is called 'Little Nemo's'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093629/trivia?item=tr0659459|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It influenced [[Alan Moore]], in ''Miracleman'' No. 4, when the [[Miracleman]] family end up in a palace called "Sleepy Town", which has imagery similar to Little Nemo's. In Moore (and [[J.H. Williams III]])'s ''[[Promethea]]'', a more direct [[pastiche]] – "Little Margie in Misty Magic Land"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/comics/eroomnala/LM.html |publisher=Angelfire |title=LM}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – showed Moore's inspiration and debt to McCay's landmark 1905 strip. The [[Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]] series occasionally references ''Little Nemo'' as well. Examples include ''[[The Sandman: The Doll's House]]'', where an abused child escapes into dreams styled after McCay's comics and using a similar 'wake-up' mechanism, and ''[[The Sandman: Book of Dreams]]'' (pub. 1996), which features [[George Alec Effinger]]'s short "Seven Nights in Slumberland" (where Nemo interacts with [[Neil Gaiman]]'s characters [[Endless (comics)|The Endless]]).

In 1989, teen comic book [[Power Pack]] ran an issue (#47) which paid direct homage to one of McCay's Nemo storylines, featuring a castle that was drawn sideways and [[Katie Power]] re-enacting a classic Nemo panel with a sideways-drawn hallway that served as a bottomless pit with the line "Don't fall in, y'hear?"

"Little Nemo in Slumberland" is also the inspiration for the video of the 1989 song ''[[Runnin' Down a Dream]]'' by [[Tom Petty]].

In 1994-1995, French artist [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] wrote the story to a sequel comic series "Little Nemo", drawn by [[Bruno Marchand]] in two [[comic album|albums]], 2000-2002, Marchand continued the story with two additional albums.

In 2006, electronic artist [[Daedelus]] used Little Nemo artwork for his album ''[[Denies the Day's Demise]]''.

The comic strip ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' includes a strip-within-the-strip, "Little Neuro", a parody of Little Nemo. Neuro is a little boy who hardly ever leaves his bed.

In 2009, the [[ToonSeum|Pittsburgh ToonSeum]] established its NEMO Award, given to notable individuals "for excellence in the cartoon arts". Recipients to date include veteran comic-book artist [[Ron Frenz]],&lt;ref&gt;Uricchio, Marylynn [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09160/976092-460.stm "ToonSeum cartoon museum holds annual Ka-Blam! fundraiser"] ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' June 9, 2009 Retrieved December 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; editorial and comic-strip artist [[Dick Locher]],&lt;ref&gt;JimHillMedia.com [http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/press_releases/archive/2011/03/30/legendary-cartoonist-dick-locher-receives-toonseum-s-nemo-award.aspx#.USRpex3qlio "Legendary Cartoonist Dick Locher Receives ToonSeum's Nemo Award"] March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; cartoonist and comics historian [[Trina Robbins]],&lt;ref&gt;trinarobbins.wordpress.com [http://trinarobbins.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/fear-of-blogging-gets-around/ "Fear of Blogging Gets Around"] June 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and comics artist, editorial cartoonist and artists' rights advocate [[Jerry Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Riggenberg, Steven [http://www.tcj.com/jerry-robinson-january-1st-1922-december-7th-2011/ "Jerry Robinson: January 1st, 1922 – December 7th, 2011"] ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' December 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2012, celebrating the 107th anniversary of the first ''Little Nemo'' story, Google displayed an interactive animated "[[Google Doodle]]" called "Little Nemo in Google-land" on its homepage.  The doodle showed a typical Little Nemo adventure through a series of panels, each featuring a letter from the word "Google".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh3BdDTFSFo |title=Winsor McCay 's Little Nemo |format=Doodle; HD 1080p |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doodle also ends in the same way as the comic strips, with Nemo falling from his bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |newspaper=Times of India |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-15/internet/34471783_1_colourful-doodle-animated-google-doodle-nemo |title=Google celebrates 107th anniversary of Winsor Zenic McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland |date=October 15, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Universal's [[Islands of Adventure]], at the Toon Lagoon section, Little Nemo can be seen falling out of his bed near a shop.

[[Eric Shanower]] and [[Gabriel Rodriguez (artist)|Gabriel Rodriguez]] revived the characters in 2014 in an IDW comic book series entitled ''Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=44712|title=Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland (2014) – Comic Book DB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Locust Moon Press released a new anthology and [[Taschen]] published the complete series (1905–1926).

Comics historian [[R. C. Harvey]] has called McCay "the first original genius of the comic strip medium".  Harvey claims that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon.{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=21}}  Cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]] called McCay a "genius" and one of his favorite cartoonists.{{sfn|Young|2000}}  [[Art Spiegelman]]'s  ''[[In the Shadow of No Towers]]'' (2004) appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of ''Little Nemo'' in its appendix.{{sfn|Heer|2006}}  [[Federico Fellini]] read ''Little Nemo'' in the children's magazine ''[[Corriere dei Piccoli|Il corriere dei piccoli]]'', and the strip was a "powerful influence" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.{{sfn|Bondanella|2002|p=10}}

McCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved.{{sfn|Heer|2006}}  McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection survived him, but much of it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s.  His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection into his own house.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=253}}  The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash.  Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion.  By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|pp=253–254}}

==Biography==
Miller was born in  [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]]&lt;ref name="pictureaus"/&gt; She first met [[Harry August Jansen|Dante]] (aka Harry Jansen) while still in her late teens when she was appearing in a musical revue in Melbourne. Dante had decided to recruit an Australian girl as an assistant after, in his words, "he saw in Melbourne more beautiful women per square block than he had seen in any other part of the World".&lt;ref name="kingofmagicians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingofmagicians.com/moiyo.htm|title=Australia's Most Beautiful Woman With Dante: Miss Moi-yo Miller|publisher=kingofmagicians|accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Miller dated Dante's son, Bill, and went on to work with Dante, staying with him for the rest of his performing career. She very quickly became his main assistant and an integral part of his show ''Sim Sala Bim''. She was often billed as "Australia's Most Beautiful Woman".&lt;ref name="kingofmagicians"/&gt; She once estimated that she had been sawed in half around 11,800 times during her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxxneon.com/reviews/womeninboxes.htm|title=Reviews...Women in Boxes|publisher=MasterMath|accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller became highly regarded among professional magic performers and is widely cited as one of the all-time great magic assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magictricks.com/library/histwomen.htm|title=Women In Magic|publisher=magictricks.com|accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She features in the 2008 documentary movie, ''Women in Boxes'', which explores the vital role of assistants in magic.&lt;ref name="womeninboxes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninboxes.com/cast.htm|title=''Women in Boxes''|publisher=WIB LLC|accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1268991|title=Women in Boxes|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she received the Dragon Award presented by the J.

[[File:Mundas-et-Infans-frontispiece-1522.png|thumb|The 1522 cover of ''[[The World and the Child|Mundus et Infans]]'', a morality play]]
The '''morality play''' is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Tudor period|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as '''''interludes''''', a broader term for dramas with or without a [[moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).&lt;/ref&gt; Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (English: "Order of the Virtues") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

==Characteristics==
Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in ''Everyman'' are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of ''Everyman'' is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays''. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 36-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes ''Everyman'' one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while ''Everyman'' focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of "morality play" are ''Hickscorner'' and ''The Second Shepherds' Play.'' The characters in ''Hickscorner'' are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 60. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Second Shepherds' Play'', the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice and Equity as characters==
In early English dramas [[Justice]] was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson. "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see [[Justice]] begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge.  The Justice in ''Respublica'' begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"&gt;''Respublica'', ed. by Leonard A. Magnus (London, 1905), Extra Series XCIV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in ''Respublica'' is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"/&gt; An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; [[Equity (law)|Equity]] replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 408.&lt;/ref&gt; This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, ''Liberality and Prodigality'', where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberality and Prodigality'', in ''A Select Collection of Old English Plays''. ed. by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1874), VIII, 329-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently&lt;br /&gt;
The manner of this outrageous robbery:&lt;br /&gt;
And as the same by examination shall appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Due justice may be done in presence here.&lt;br /&gt; (''Liberality and Prodigality'' 377)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”,&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

==Pre-Reformation versus post-Reformation==
Although the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the [[Protestant Reformation]] are of a distinctly different [[didacticism]] than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Morality plays before the Reformation teach a [[Catholic Church |Catholic]] approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and [[Cyprian]] (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, [[Everyman (play)|Everyman]], in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:
&lt;poem&gt; 
Doctor:  This moral men may have in mind;
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,
And remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,
They all at last do Everyman forsake,
Save his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.
But beware, and they be small
Before God, he hath no help at all.
None excuse may be there for Everyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=A. C.|title=Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays |date=1974 |publisher= Dent |location=London |isbn=978-0-460-87280-5 |page =225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled [[Mankind (play)]].  In this play, the [[sacrament of penance]] is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind:  “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God.  Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin.  It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= McDonald |first1= Rick |title= Modern English Translation of Mankind |url= http://research.uvu.edu/mcdonald/3610/mankind.html |publisher =Utah Valley University|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Pre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]] (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Many of the morality tales were [[allegory |allegories]] and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness).  Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.

Frequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil.  For example, in [[The Castle of Perseverance]], a character called Lust-Liking states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee
To seek thee a servant valued and dear!
Whoso will by Folly ruled be, 
He is worthy to be a servant here,
Who slips into the Sins Seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnston |first =Alexandra F.|title=The Castle of Perseverance: A Modernization |url= http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/cascomp.html |website= Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher= University of Toronto|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Even after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing.  Often, these curses were spoken in [[Latin]], which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience.  Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pineas | first = Rainer | title = The English Morality Play as a Weapon of Religious Controversy | journal = Studies in English Literature | volume = 2 | number = 2 | year = 1962 | pages = 157–80 | publisher = JSTOR | format = Web | accessdate = 28 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of [[Protestantism]] which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.&lt;ref name="Muratta Bunsen, Eduardo 2014"&gt;{{Citation | last = Muratta Bunsen | first = Eduardo | title = Leidenschaft des Zweifelns: Skepsis und Probabilismus in den Säkulardramen von Pedro Calderón de la Barca | language = de | publisher = FU | place = Berlin, DE | url = http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we05/forschung/dissertationen/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge.  Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason.  Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the [[New Testament]]. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of [[original sin]], the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

After four months of private [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]], the site launched publicly in March 2007 during the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]], and began distributing member-created animation videos to Internet audiences worldwide. Three weeks after its launch, MyToons had received more than 1.5 million [[unique visitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamingmedia.com/press/view.asp?id=6838 Streamingmedia.com: Limelight Networks Tapped By MyToons.com To Provide Flash Delivery Of Animations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nibblers''''' is a [[Mobile game|mobile]] [[tile-matching]] [[puzzle video game]], developed by [[Rovio Entertainment]]. It was released on September 10, 2015 for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices worldwide.

In the game, fish called "Nibblers" have wandered ashore to eat fruits, such as berries and melons. However, the lizards want to stop them. So, with the player's help, the Nibblers set on to defeat the lizards.

==Gameplay==
Players match up three or more pieces of fruit. Matching three next to a lizard stuns it and then matching three more defeats it. Matching up four or more pieces summons Nibblers, as well as other sea creatures, that will attack lizards directly; a level ends when all lizards are defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamezebo.com/2015/05/01/rovio-soft-launches-nibblers-in-canada-a-game-of-primordial-match-3-fun/ Rovio Soft-launches ‘Nibblers’ in Canada, a Game of Primordial Match-3 Fun]. Retrieved 10 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Android Authority gave the game a 7/10 because, although the game has cute graphics and can prove somewhat addictive, it has no special features that would set it apart from hundreds of other, similar 'match-3 games'. The reviewer also discussed not liking the fact that the life meter limits play due to taking 2.5 hours for each heart to regenerate - or else by paying actual money in order to overcome the waiting time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androidauthority.com/nibblers-review-641535/ Nibblers Review] September 11, 2015. Retrieved October 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Finnish Game Music Awards 2016, Nibblers was awarded best game music; the soundtrack was composed by Salla Hakkola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rovio.com/game-music-awards-2016-rovio-wins-best-game-music-nibblers GAME MUSIC AWARDS 2016: Rovio wins Best Game Music with Nibblers] Retrieved July 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation''''' is a 2012 horror film prequel to the 2006 film,  ''[[Night of the Living Dead 3D]]''. It stars [[Andrew Divoff]] (also a co-producer), [[Jeffrey Combs]], Sarah Lieving and [[Denice Duff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/new-stills-from-night-of-the-living-dead-3d-re-animation-plus-screening-info|work=[[JoBlo.com]]|title=New stills from Night of the Living Dead 3D: Re-Animation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Pyrophobic mortician Gerald Tovar, Jr. inherits the family mortuary and accidentally exposes hundreds of uncremated bodies to toxic [[medical waste]]. As the corpses reanimate, Gerald’s inheritance-seeking younger brother, Harold, unexpectedly shows up and stumbles upon Gerald trying to keep the zombie outbreak under control. Sibling rivalry gives way to madness as Harold discovers Gerald’s dark secret–the freshly exhumed and zombified corpse of their father. The film also features a [[Sarah Palin]] spoof in the character of 'Sister Sara' (who works for a news outlet called 'Fixed News' which is apparently a spoof of ''[[Fox News]]'') and makes references to the original 1968 ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' film with comments such as "They're Romero zombies" and "Pittsburgh is the zombie capital."

A '''production coordinator''' (officially called '''production office coordinator''' and abbreviated '''POC''') is a unionized position in [[stagecraft]] under the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) and is governed in Los Angeles by Local 871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ialocal871.org/|title=Local 871's website|publisher=Local 871|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production coordinator serves under the production manager, producer  or UPM to coordinate the various groups and personnel that come together in [[filmmaking]] to a movie and [[video production]] to make a [[television show]]. It is a supervisory  position to the [[Production assistant]] staff. The position requires adept organizational skills, resourcefulness and the ability to handle a  multitude of tasks simultaneously under often high-pressure situations. The POC serves as the gatekeeper of company policy  and is usually responsible for ensuring the rest of the production [[television crew]] follows the requirements of the Production Company or Studio.

The duties of a POC are often undefined and extremely varied ranging from office manager, to human resources, to controller, to accountant. The POC is one of the only positions with the IATSE (USA and Canada) which no longer has a scale or set wage. The IA bylaws simply state the POC’s wage is “subject to negotiation with the Producer”. Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension &amp; Health Plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpiphp.org/faqs/pension_faqs.htm/|title=Motion Picture Pension Plan FAQ|publisher=Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week, which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an "on-call" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week, no matter how many or few hours they work. Working conditions can vary on the medium (half-hour, hour-long television, reality, live, soap and feature) and daily hours can range from 8 to 16 hour days. The POC is often the first person in the office and the last to leave since they hold the responsibility of tending to the needs of the crew. 

More recent attempts have been made by Local 871 to establish a scale rate for the POCs, but to date all have been unsuccessful.

The union has a relaxed jurisdiction over the position since it does not have an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC, but again since it does not have an official job description in its bylaws, many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.

'''Rebecca Guay''' is an artist known early in her career as an [[illustrator]], commissioned for work on [[role-playing game]]s, [[collectible card game]]s, [[Comics|comic books]], as well as work on [[children's literature]]. Guay subsequently turned primarily toward [[Painting|gallery work]], opening her first solo exhibition in 2013 at the [[Richard Michelson#Sidelight|R.Michelson Gallery]].

==Early life==
Guay received a degree in Illustration from the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York City in 1992.&lt;ref name=KarenFrankel/&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduation, Guay became an illustrator at [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] (''[[Marvel 2099|2099 Unlimited]]'') and landed numerous gigs at [[DC Comics]] and its [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo Imprint]], like becoming the full-time penciller for ''[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]'' and various work with [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' universe.&lt;ref name="sequentialTartLastDragon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=2137|title=The Last Dragon - Rebecca Guay on her latest collaboration with Jane Yolen|publisher=Sequential Tart|author=Suzette Chan|date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After painting the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' CCG tie-in graphic novels ''The Serra Angel'' and ''Magic the Homelands'' in 1995 for [[Valiant Comics]], Guay worked with [[Wizards of the Coast]]/[[Hasbro]] extensively on the card game itself and was commissioned for anywhere from 3 to 12 cards per release, beginning with ''[[Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)|Alliances]]'' in 1996 through the set ''Eventide''  in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Pamela H. (August 22, 2006). "In celebration of women artists", ''[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]'', p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Other TCG/RPG outfits she has been involved with include ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', [[White Wolf Publishing]], [[Bella Sara]] and ''[[World of Warcraft Trading Card Game]]''.&lt;ref name=KarenFrankel&gt;Frankel, Karen (September 2007). "Applying Rembrandt's Portrait Technique", ''[[American Artist]]'' #71(779): 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her other major clients include [[Topps]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], [[MTV Animation]], [[Lucas Film]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Barefoot Books]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]].&lt;ref name="ourberkshire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourberkshiregreen.com/articles--illustration-blog/the-art-of-rebecca-guay|title=The Art of Rebecca Guay|publisher=Our BerkshireGreen Publishing|date=19 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112101352/http://www.ourberkshiregreen.com/articles--illustration-blog/the-art-of-rebecca-guay|archivedate=12 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborations ===
Guay has worked with writers such as [[Jane Yolen]] (on the children's book ''Ballet Stories'' and the graphic novel adaptation of Yolen's ''The Last Dragon''),&lt;ref name="sequentialTartLastDragon" /&gt;  [[Holly Black]], [[Louise Hawes]], [[Alisa Kwitney]], and [[Bill Willingham]] on ''A Flight of Angels''.&lt;ref name="sequentialTartFlightof Angels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=2138|title=A Flight of Angels - Rebecca Guay on her new multi-authored project|publisher=Sequential Tart|author=Suzette Chan|date=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heavenly interest sparks creation of 'A Flight of Angels'|author=Brian Truitt|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2011-11-01/Heavenly-interest-sparks-A-Flight-of-Angels-graphic-novel/51031858/1|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallery work===
After the completion of her last two painted graphic novels in 2011,&lt;ref name="ourberkshire" /&gt; she began focusing primarily on large scale gallery work done in [[Oil painting|oil]].&lt;ref name="paintAndEmotion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paint and Emotion|url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/2014/02/26/paint-and-emotion/|last=Heflin|first=James|publisher=[[Valley Advocate]]|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her gallery work focuses on the figure with the goal being a strong emotional connection to the audience.&lt;ref name="paintAndEmotion"/&gt; She opened her first solo exhibition in September 2013 at the R. Michelson Gallery. Her pieces have since been shown and acquired by private collectors and several museums, including the [[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art]] and the Museum of American Illustration at the [[Society of Illustrators]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="paintAndEmotion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="michelsonFineArt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/Artist_Pages/Guay/Rebecca-Fine-Art.html|title=Rebecca Leveille-Guay Fine Art gallery at R.Michelson|publisher= R.Michelson|accessdate = 11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a crossover between her gallery work and her work in illustration, one of her pieces, ''The Visitor'', was chosen as the cover of ''Spectrum 21''.&lt;ref name="Specrum21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spectrum 21 Cover|url=http://fleskpublications.com/blog/2014/03/07/spectrum-21-cover/|publisher=Flesk Publications|author=John Fleskes|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fandom ==
After the release of ''[[Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)|Onslaught]]'' (2002), it was reported on Magic the Gathering news sites that Guay had been informed that the seven works she created for the set would be her last. In what the sites reported to be her own words: "the new art director, Jeremy Cranford, thinks my work is too feminine for the vision he has for the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WotC Fires Artist Rebecca Guay |url=http://www.mtgnews.com/F/Topic/1078456129399_WotC_Fires_Artist_Rebecca_Guay.html |publisher=MTG News |date=February 4, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928103946/http://www.mtgnews.com/F/Topic/1078456129399_WotC_Fires_Artist_Rebecca_Guay.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid fan outrage, Wizards of the Coast released a statement clarifying their position — that Guay was never fired, but simply not contracted as a freelance artist for ''[[Legions (Magic: The Gathering)|Legions]]'' (2003), and that her work would be used in future sets:

:"&lt;small&gt;To clear up some of the confusion, Rebecca Guay was not fired by Wizards of the Coast; she is a freelance artist who works with us from time to time. In fact, Rebecca is currently working with WotC on other projects in our Dungeons and Dragons line. In the Legions set, the creative team had to think of a way to show what happened to Otaria after Kamahl destroyed the Mirari. We decided we would show the effect of this magic by making really intense exaggerated versions of all of the creatures. We would have 'super versions' and 'hyper versions' of Soldiers, Clerics, Wizards, Zombies, Goblins, Elves, etc. Even the land would evolve over the course of Onslaught block. When selecting artists, the creative team selected artists that we felt would fit precisely within this vision of what Otaria was becoming. Even though Rebecca was not selected for work in the Legions set, Rebecca continues to be a highly valued part of our art team. Rebecca and I have discussed this and I have assured her that her art will appear in future Magic expansions." - Jeremy Cranford|Ask Wizards&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0203 |title=Ask Wizards - February, 2003 |date=February 7, 2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |first=Jeremy |last=Cranford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wizards of the Coast used Guay's work for at least seven Magic sets and a number of other products since then. One of the commissioned works, a tribute to the controversy, appeared in the 2004 joke set ''[[Unhinged (Magic: The Gathering)|Unhinged]]'':

: &lt;small&gt;"Persecute Artist" (1BB Sorcery - Choose an artist other than Rebecca Guay. Target player reveals his or her hand and discards all nonland cards by the chosen artist. ''The torches and pitchforks were no match for Rebecca's fans.'')&lt;/small&gt;

A card satirizing Jeremy Cranford also appeared in Unhinged:

:&lt;small&gt;"Fascist Art Director" (1WW Creature — Human Horror - 2/2 WW: Fascist Art Director gains protection from the artist of your choice until end of turn. ''Dear Mr. and Mrs. Cranford, After careful analysis of Jeremy's vocational testing, I feel that he is best suited for a career in either torture or art direction.'')&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74348 |title=Fascist Art Director |work=Unhinged |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===

In 2014 Guay launched a [[Kickstarter]] project collecting her artworks from 1993 to 2014, ''EVOLUTION''. It was successfully funded by her fans in March of the same year (reaching over three times its intended goal of $36,000 at $124,057)&lt;ref name="muddycolorsEvolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=EVOLUTION: The Art of Rebecca Guay|url=http://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2014/02/evolution-art-of-rebecca-guay.html|publisher=Muddy Colors - A Fantasy Art Collective|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrived from publication in January, 2015.&lt;ref name="evolutionKickstarterBooksHere"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1360132117/evolution-the-art-of-rebecca-guay-1993-2014/posts/1120373|title=The BOOKS ARE HERE!|author=Rebecca Guay|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|date=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Guay has been an instructor at the [[Pratt Institute]] and a guest lecturer at the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], [[University of Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and the [[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art]].&lt;ref name="MastersOfSF"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haber |first=Karen |date=June 1, 2011 |title=Masters of Science Fiction and Fantasy Art: A Collection of the Most Inspiring Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Gaming Illustrators in the World |url=http://karenhaber.com/ |location= |publisher=Rockport Publishers |page=173 |isbn=9781610602341 |accessdate=Jan 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guay is also the creator of two professional mentorship programs, the Illustration Master Class at  [[Amherst College]] and its online sister program, the SmArt School.&lt;ref name="paintAndEmotion"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==

He debuted in ''[[Little Dot]]'' #1, cover-dated September 1953, and was created by [[Alfred Harvey]] and [[Warren Kremer]]. Dubbed "the poor little rich boy," Richie is the only child of fantastically wealthy parents and is the world's richest kid. He is so rich, his middle name is a dollar sign, $.&lt;ref&gt;"The $ Sign", Richie Rich #20, November 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

During Harvey Comics' heyday (1950–1982), Richie was the publisher's most popular character, eventually starring in over fifty separate titles, including such long-running comics as ''Richie Rich'', ''Richie Rich Millions'', ''Richie Rich Dollars and Cents'', and ''Richie Rich Success Stories''.

In 2011 Ape Entertainment began publishing a new licensed Richie Rich comic book series, taking the character in a very different, action-oriented, direction.&lt;ref name="icv2"&gt;[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/18545.html "'Richie Rich' Comics Return,"] ICv2 (Oct. 9, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richie Rich comic No 254.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Richie Rich'' No. 254 (January 1991), the final issue of the flagship series.]]

Although created in 1953, Richie didn't have his own title until 1960. Once he did, however, he quickly became Harvey's most popular character,&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, Don. [http://www.toonopedia.com/richie.htm Richie Rich, the Poor Little Rich Boy] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Accessed May 14, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/6nVy9WN37 Archived] from the original on January 14, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually starring in over fifty separate titles. The flagship, ''Richie Rich'', ran 254 issues from 1960 to 1991 (with a hiatus from 1982–1986), followed by a second volume which ran an additional 28 issues from 1991–1994. Other long-running titles were ''Richie Rich Millions'' (113 issues from 1961–1982), ''Richie Rich Dollars and Cents'' (109 issues from 1963–1982), and ''Richie Rich Success Stories'' (105 issues from 1964–1982). (Harvey ceased publishing in 1982, but started up again in 1986 under new ownership;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Ashes: Charlton and Harvey to Resume Publishing This Spring," ''The Comics Journal'' #97 (April 1985), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; this hiatus resulted in the cancellation of many titles.) Richie (along with many of the Harvey characters) has been published only sporadically since 1994.

Writers for the Richie Rich comic books and syndicated comic strip included [[Sid Jacobson]], Lennie Herman, Stan Kay, and Ralph Newman. Richie Rich's most famous illustrator is [[Warren Kremer]]. Other illustrators included [[Ernie Colón]], [[Sid Couchey]], Dom Sileo, Ben Brown, Steve Muffatti, and Joe Dennett.

==Character==
Despite any [[Tall poppy syndrome|negative stereotypes]] associated with his incredible wealth, Richie Rich is portrayed as kind and charitable. (In fact, his moniker is "the poor little rich boy.") He lives in an expensive mansion and owns at least two of everything money can buy. Richie appears to be around seven to ten years old and wears a waistcoat, a white shirt with an [[Collar (clothing)#Collar styles|Eton collar]] (which is obscured by a giant red bow tie), and blue shorts. He occasionally attends school in his hometown of Harveyville&lt;ref&gt;Upon learning his father transferred all his employees and substituted robots, "You mean they had to leave Harveyville?  This wonderful town?"  "The Revolting Machines," Little Dot 118, August 1968&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other times he's classmates with [[Little Dot]] and [[Little Lotta]] in Bonnie Dell.&lt;ref&gt;"The Talking Dots", Richie Rich Millions #25, October 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ape Entertainment ===
For the Ape Entertainment comic book series debuting in 2011, the character was updated by emphasizing his altruistic side: "A mix of [[James Bond]] and [[Indiana Jones]] with the bank account of [[Donald Trump]], Richie Rich is an altruistic adventurer who travels the world helping the less fortunate!"&lt;ref&gt;Solicitation language from ''Richie Rich Digest Vol. 3: Just Desserts &amp; Other Stories'', published by Ape Entertainment. Accessed Dec. 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Richie was joined by updated versions of his robot maid Irona and his butler Cadbury.&lt;ref name="icv2" /&gt;

== Supporting characters ==

=== Rich family ===
* '''Mr. Richard Rich Sr.''' – Richie's father; an industrialist (first appearance ''Little Dot'' #3)
* '''Mrs. Regina Rich''' (nee '''Van Dough''') – Richie's mother (first appearance ''Little Dot'' #1)
* '''Aunt Noovo Rich''' (a pun on the French term ''[[nouveau riche]]'') – Richie's wealthy but very eccentric aunt who is crazy about posting signs; has a tendency to show off her wealth. While few of Richie's aunts and uncles are clarified to be paternal or maternal, Aunt Noovo is known to be his paternal aunt, Mr. Rich's sister.
* '''Uncle Titus''' - Although just as wealthy as the rest of the family, Uncle Titus is fanatical about saving money; he typically wears the most threadbare of clothes makes every conceivable effort to avoid spending money, to the extent that his house is equipped with an alarm that goes off if he carelessly leaves the house with "too much" money. Some in the family have nicknamed him "Tite-wad"(as in [[wikt:tightwad|tightwad]]), a name he accepts with good humor.
* '''Aunt Mintley''' – Oft-bewildered aristocrat.
* '''Aunt Cleo''' — animal lover.
* '''Uncle Worry''' – Richie's uncle, former coach of a professional football team known for its long losing streak.
* '''Uncle Stormy''' – Another of Richie's uncles, whom Richie initially mistakes for an impostor named Blackie Bludsoe in one issue.
* '''Dollar''' – Rich family dog, a "Dollarmatian" (like a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]], but with dollar signs instead of spots).

=== Van Dough family ===
* '''Reginald "Reggie" Van Dough Jr.''' – Richie's mean maternal cousin, known for playing constant pranks on everyone, most notably Richie and his family, which causes his father to punish him. Treats his servants shabbily (often by calling them "peasant," which causes them to call him "monster", but they swiftly correct themselves and call him Master). (first appearance ''Little Dot'' #2)
* '''Reginald Van Dough Sr.''' – Mrs. Rich's brother and Reggie's father, often angered with Reggie's non-stop pranks, and often punishes him for them (usually by [[Spanking|spanking]]).
* '''Vanessa Van Dough''' – Reggie's mother; not as quick to punish Reggie for his pranks, but she doesn't tolerate Reggie's unabashed cruelty either.
* '''Penny Van Dough''' – Reggie's baby sister, she talks only in "baby talk." The curl on her head is shaped like a dollar sign.

=== Richie's friends ===
* '''Gloria Glad''' – Richie's redheaded girlfriend, notorious for her regular refusal of the many luxurious gifts Richie offers, and for her disdain for the open display of money, diamonds and other forms of wealth in Richie's household, despite his efforts to conceal it from her.  Regardless, she always wins his attention in comparison to Mayda Munny. (first appearance ''Little Dot'' #33) Gloria's last name, for the 1994 live-action movie, was changed to Pazinski.
* '''Mayda Munny''' – (whose name is a play on the phrase "made of money") Richie's snobby ravenette [[wikt:wannabe|wannabe]]-girlfriend, who never wins his attention; like the Riches and Van Doughs, her family is fabulously wealthy.  Immensely jealous of Gloria, and often angry when her plans to snare Richie's attention backfire on her.  Like Reggie, Mayda is snobbish and addresses those beneath her as "peasant".
* '''Freckles''' and '''Pee-Wee Friendly''' – Richie's poor but most-prized friends (first appearance ''Little Dot'' #2), whose blue-jeaned playtime attire sharply contrasts Richie's bow-tied formal suit. Despite his working-class background, Freckles doesn't object to Richie's wealth the way Gloria does, and at times even enjoys it. Pee-Wee plays along with all of Freckles' and Richie's activities without ever saying a word.
* '''Billy Bellhops''' – A redheaded boy who worked as a bellhop at his father's hotel. Premiered in "Richie Rich and Billy Bellhops" in 1977 but was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/billy-bellhops/29-74604/|title=Billy Bellhops|work=Comicvine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Alfred Harvey's son Russel.&lt;ref name="back71"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mark|title=Timmy Time|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71 |pages=56–57|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Timmy Time''' – An extraterrestrial boy who time-travels to present-day Earth with his robot friend Traveler (landing on the Riches' private beach) from the year 2019 in search of tholarine, a substance he needs for spaceship fuel back in 2019. He appeared only in ''Richie Rich Meets Timmy Time'' #1 (September 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timmy Time|website=Toonpedia.com|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/tim-time.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timmy Time was created by [[Ernie Colón]] as Mark Time. Colón's frustration at Mark Time being renamed Timmy Time and presented as a Richie Rich spin-off, when the original agreement had been that the character would debut in his own series, led him to abandon the project.&lt;ref name="back71"/&gt;

=== Rich employees ===
* '''Cadbury C. Cadbury''' – The Riches' [[butler]] who attends to the Rich estate. British born, Cadbury gives the image of propriety and servility. When need demands, however, he becomes a tough, gun-toting man of action. He is also a master [[hypnotist]], [[ventriloquist]] and wood-carver. The 1994 live-action movie gave him a modified (longer, but actually more credible) name: Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury. 
* '''Irona''' – The Riches' [[robot]] maid and Richie's [[bodyguard]]
* '''Bascomb''' – The Riches' [[chauffeur]]
* '''Chef Pierre''' – The Riches' [[chef]] extraordinaire
* '''Mr. Cheepers''' – Mr. Rich's accountant
* '''Mr. Woody''' – The incompetent Rich estate carpenter whose work falls apart with a light touch
* '''Nurse Jenny''' – The Rich family nurse; was Richie's nanny when he was a baby
* '''Professor Keenbean''' – The head of the Rich [[research and development]] department and Richie's personal [[tutor]]
* '''Professor Mindblow''' – A worker at the research and development department.
* '''Chadwick''' – The Riches' assistant butler
* '''Minnie Mintz''' – One of the Riches' cooks
* '''Captain Fuzzby''' – A member of the Riches' estate police

=== Villains ===
* '''The Onion''' – A recurring villain with horrible onion-powered breath capable of knocking victims unconscious with a trademark "hashoo!"
* '''Dr. Robert Blemish''' – A recurring villain, an evil genius scientist and nemesis of Prof. Keenbean.
* '''Dr. N-R-Gee''' – A recurring villain with the distinguishing feature of a huge red light bulb for a head, caused when scientist '''Phil Lament''' (a pun referring to a light bulb's "filament") suffered an electrical accident in his lab.
* '''The Condor''' – A billionaire mastermind with his own terrorist army, and the Rich Family's worst enemy, whose only desire is to take over Mr. Rich's empire.

'''Rollin Howard''' (1840 - June 19, 1879) was an [[United States|American]] [[minstrel show|minstrel]] performer, best known for his female [[blackface]] impersonations.

Howard was born as '''Ebenezer G.B. Holder''' in [[New York City]] around 1840, and appeared in minstrel productions from approximately 1860 to 1870.  He appeared in other dramatic performances both before and after his minstrel period.&lt;ref name="monarchs"&gt;Rice, Edward Le Roy. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvY5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Monarchs of minstrelsy, from "Daddy" Rice to date], p. 127-28 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[American Civil War]], female impersonators became more common in minstrel shows, and Howard was considered one of the leading performers in such roles, along with [[Francis Leon]] and Eugene d'Amelie.&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;Ferris, Lesley. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HsnKh0lTEHEC&amp;pg=PA86 Crossing the stage: controversies on cross-dressing], p. 86 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Howard and Griffin wench.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rollin Howard (in wench costume) and George Griffin]] Among songs that Howard performed, he was credited with "arranging" on one of the first sheet music publications for ''[[Shoo Fly, Don't Bother Me]]'' in 1869.&lt;ref name="shoo1"&gt;Sanjek, Russell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7UbS22L6neQC&amp;pg=PA372 American Popular Music and Its Business: From 1790 to 1909], p. 371-72 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The song was extremely popular, and though the exact authorship is not clear, at times Howard has received some authorship credit.&lt;ref name="howardaut1"&gt;(1 August 1902).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">'''Scopophilia''' or '''scoptophilia''' (from {{lang-grc|σκοπέω}} {{lang|grc-Latn|skopeō}}, "look to, examine" and {{lang|grc|φῐλῐ́ᾱ}} {{lang|grc-Latn|philíā}}, "tendency toward"), is deriving pleasure from looking. As an expression of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], it refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], [[nudity|naked bodies]], etc.

==Psychoanalysis==

The term was introduced to translate [[Freud]]'s {{lang|de|Schaulust}}, or pleasure in looking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the [[Rat Man]] called "a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of [[Otto Fenichel]], with special reference to [[Identification (psychology)|identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk5gPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+collected+papers+of+otto+fenichel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhhhTbTNGc3Oswa3uLW1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ ''The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification''] (1953) {{ISBN|0-393-33741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel maintained that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] subsequently drew on [[Sartre]]'s theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: "the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] image of the other;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (1990) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneiderman|first1=Stuart|title=Returning to Freud: Clinical Psychoanalysis in the School of Lacan|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300039320|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==

[[Voyeurism]] plays a role in the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably in the 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the film, [[Norman Bates]] is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on [[Marion Crane]], while she is in a state of undress.

Scopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)

Building on Lacan's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills,[https://books.google.com/books?id=65HbQfMKmAIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=scopophobia&amp;lr= "The Money Shot"] (2001) {{ISBN|1-86403-142-5}},  p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; scopophilia was used by [[Film|cinema]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]]s of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton Caldwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=59S8pfkFb-IC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=scopophobia#PPA343,M1 ''Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television''] (1995) {{ISBN|0-8135-2164-5}}, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyeurism]] and the [[male gaze]] have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) pp. 316–17&lt;/ref&gt; and are most famously discussed in [[Laura Mulvey]]'s influential 1975 essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=England|isbn=978-1-4039-9246-8|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, have objected to the element of [[scapegoating]] in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklitsch|first1=Robert|title=Roll over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|date=2006|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|isbn=978-0791467336|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Roll_Over_Adorno.html?id=oCprHBiGYoMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==

[[scopophobia]]).

In their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.&lt;ref&gt;Todd W. Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'' (2011) pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
* The ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Gaius Petronius Arbiter]] is pervaded with scopophilia, as when a priestess of [[Priapus]] was "the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''[[The Satyricon]]'' (Penguin 1986) p. 50 and p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Secret Sexualities'', Ian McCormick notes the inter-relationship of public and private, and of the open and the secret, as features that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Ian. ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing''. Routledge, 1997. pp. 1-11; p. 158. See also George E. Haggerty.

'''''Stars on Ice''''' was a weekly television [[ice show]], broadcast from 1976 to 1981 on the [[CTV Television Network]] in [[Canada]]. The series was hosted by [[Alex Trebek]] (1976–1980) and later, Doug Crosley (1980–1981), and featured skaters such as [[Toller Cranston]]. The program was produced on an ice rink set up at Studio 6 of [[CFTO-TV]] in [[Toronto]].

The series was produced and directed by Michael Steele, had a regular cast of 14 world-class ice professionals, most of whom lived and taught skating locally in and around Toronto. The variety show format on ice consisted of a glitzy "show opener" by the regular cast of skaters and a bigger budget production number (usually tributes to Hollywood musicals) with elaborate set pieces in the middle of the half-hour.

Rounding out the half-hour were famous and novelty-act figure skaters, vaudeville-type acts, and "affordable" (on the series' modest budget) non-skating celebrities at the B-list phase of their careers, such as [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] and [[Micky Dolenz]] formerly of [[The Monkees]], [[Eddie Mekka]] (The Big Ragu) of ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley]]'', and 1960s recording artist [[Donovan]].

Due to being only minimally dependent on language, and its unusual ice/variety show format, the series went on to be widely syndicated throughout the world.

This television series is unrelated to the later traveling ice show tour, ''[[Stars on Ice]]''.

[[File:Chinese Teetotum 1893.png|thumb|100px|A six-sided Chinese teetotum]]

A '''teetotum''' (or '''T-totum''') is a form of [[gambling]] [[spinning top]]. It has a polygonal body marked with letters or numbers, which indicate the result of each spin.

==Description==
[[File:Teetotum Bruegel.gif|thumb|A girl holding up a four-sided teetotum on [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel's]] ''Children's Games'' (1560)]]
In its earliest form the body was square (in some cases via a stick through a regular six-sided die &lt;ref&gt;[http://wordsmith.org/words/teetotum.html Teetotum at A.Word.A.Day]&lt;/ref&gt;), marked on the four sides by the letters '''A''' ([[Latin|Lat.]] ''aufer'', take) indicating that the player takes one from the pool, '''D''' (Lat. ''depone'', put down) when a fine has to be paid, '''N''' (Lat. ''nihil'', nothing), and '''T''' (Lat. ''totum'', all), when the whole pool is to be taken.

Other accounts give such letters as '''P''', '''N''', '''D''' (''dimidium'', half), and '''H''' or '''T''' or other combinations of letters. Other combinations of letters that could be found were '''NG''', '''ZS''', '''TA''', '''TG''', '''NH''', '''ND''', '''SL''' and '''M''', which included the Latin terms ''Zona Salve'' ("save all"), ''Tibi Adfer'' ("take all"), ''Nihil Habeas'' ("nothing left"), ''Solve L'' ("save 50") and ''Nihil Dabis'' ("nothing happens").

[[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Joseph Strutt]], who was born in 1749, mentions the teetotum as used in games when he was a boy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When I was a boy, the tee-totum had only four sides, each of them marked with a letter; a T for take all; an H for half, that is of the stake; an N for nothing; and a P for put down, that is, a stake equal to that you put down at first. Toys of this kind are now made with many sides and letters.&lt;ref name="strutt305"&gt;{{cite book| last=Strutt| first=Joseph| author-link=Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)| editor-first=J Charles| editor-last=Cox| title=The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England| orig-year=1801| year=1903| location=London| publisher=Methuen| page=305| url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029932575#page/n441/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The teetotum survives today as [[dreidel]], a Jewish game played on [[Hanukkah]] and as the [[Perinola]], a game played in many Latin American countries.  Some modern teetotums have six or eight sides, and are used in commercial [[board game]]s in place of [[dice]]. The original 1860 version of [[The Game of Life]] used a teetotum in order to avoid the die's association with gambling.

[[File:Teetotum 1881.png|thumb|right|A twelve-sided teetotum]]

==In literature==

A teetotum is mentioned by "[[Martinus Scriblerus]]",&lt;ref name="strutt305" /&gt; the pen name of a club of 18th-century satirical writers.

The 19th-century English poet [[William Ernest Henley]] wrote the ''Double Ballade on the Nothingness of Things'' which opened with the lines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The big teetotum twirls,
And epochs wax and wane
As chance subsides or swirls;
But of the loss and gain
The sum is always plain.
Read on the mighty pall,
The weed of funeral
That covers praise and blame,
The -isms and the -anities,
Magnificence and shame:--
"O Vanity of Vanities!"
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]'s movements about [[the Old Sheep Shop]] provoke its proprietor (the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] transformed into a sheep) to ask, "Are you a child, or a teetotum?"

In [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1845 [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] [[short story]] "[[The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether]]", one of the patients of the asylum is described as believing he had been converted into a "tee-totum":&lt;ref&gt;[http://poestories.com/text.php?file=systemoftarr "The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether" on poestories.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"And then," said the friend who had whispered, "there was Boullard, the tee-totum. I call him the tee-totum because, in fact, he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet, that he had been converted into a tee-totum. You would have roared with laughter to see him spin. He would turn round upon one heel by the hour, in this manner – so-

Here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper, performed an exactly similar office for himself.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The Museum of Classic Chicago Television''' (also known as '''FuzzyMemories.TV''') is an [[online museum]] dedicated to the preservation of [[Chicago]] television broadcasts.  Most of the museum's footage originates from "[[aircheck]]s" of local Chicago channels (and to a lesser extent other cities) that were recorded primarily in the 1970s and 1980s.  The registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation displays on its website more than 4000 clips of [[Television commercials|commercials]], news broadcasts, [[Public service announcement|PSAs]], [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]], obscure specials, moments of technical difficulties and other off-air recording excerpts, as well as occasional master tapes donated by former television employees.

On March 17, 2011, the museum announced that it had discovered lost footage of ''[[Garfield Goose and Friends]]'' and previewed it on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/7559515/take-a-gander-website-crowing-about-rare-garfield-goose-vide/| title = Take a gander: Website crowing about rare Garfield Goose video | accessdate = 2011-04-27| work = Robert Feder Time Out Chicago Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 15, 2011, the museum announced that it had discovered and transferred long-lost footage of the original ''[[Svengoolie]]'' program and subsequently displayed the missing episodes on its website the following Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/14947281/chicago-hooking-up-with-social-media-week/| title = Chicago hooking up with Social Media Week | accessdate = 2011-09-15| work = Robert Feder Time Out Chicago Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On November 27, 2012, [[WGN-TV]] announced that it would air a 1971 tape of ''[[Bozo's Circus]]'' that was recovered with the help of the museum on that year's [[Christmas Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WGN-TV To Air 'Bozo's Circus: The Lost Tape'|url=http://chicagoradioandmedia.com/news/2956-wgn-tv-to-air-bozos-circus-the-lost-tape|publisher=Chicagoland Radio and Media|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Sport in the United Arab Emirates}}
[[United Arab Emirates]], an Islamic and Arabic country in the [[Middle East]], was established in 1971 by the enormous efforts of its leaders. Despite its relatively short existence, it has devolved its own unique traditions and costumes that are distinguished from the nearby countries.

As the case for any country, there must be a few traditional sports that are passed down from a generation to the next and each country must preserve at any cost for it is

One of UAE's oldest tradition is falconry and it dates to past times. It is not known exactly when falconry emerged but some history mentions assume that it dates back to 2000 years. In the old times falconry started as a source for food, to hunt hares and houbara mostly. In addition to that it was considered a way of life for leaders of the tribe and the rest of the tribe, it was done in the broad of day light and then later on it was the topic around the evening get-togethers. Furthermore, there was another companion that went hand to hand with falcons, which was the saluki hunting dogs, but saluki in addition to assisting falcons; it was mainly for hunting down gazelles. 

A few might think that falconry is easy as it sounds, actually it is not. It requires a  deal of patience, skill and courage to tame, capture and train a falcon. To protect this traditional sport and also to make sure that falcons were treated properly, a number of laws were laid down in sake of preserving this goal. The idea of placing trackers under each falcon skin with a unique identification numbers was established by Emirates Bird Society. This will help a great deal in tracking down the patterns of falcon’s migration and will open new possibilities of preserving this unique breed. A few years ago, an idea to issue passports to these birds was undertaken and was aimed at checking the illegal trade of falcons.

Today, falconry is an endangered branch of Dubai’s rich cultural legacy. Rapid urbanization in the UAE over the last few years has adversely affected the natural habitat of the falcons. Moreover, new falconers do not respect the codes of practicing this sport and also indulge in [[Hunting|over-hunting]]. This has posed a threat to these beautiful birds as well as to the cultural offshoot of the game itself.

In order to preserve this sport for posterity’s sake, the UAE government is working in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] for imbuing falconry with the status of a [[cultural heritage]] across the globe and attracting more Dubai holiday makers for this reason.

== Traditional boat-racing ==

In the traditional [[boat]] [[racing]], [[Longboat|long-boat]] races, although the boats are not quite as long as in the past, create an impressive picture as their tightly-packed crews labor at their oars, propelling their svelte boats through calm inshore waters under the appreciative gaze of spectators.

One major sailing event is the Mubarraz Island marine sports festival, held in December and organized under the support of [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan|Sheikh Zayed]] and Sheikh Maktoum as part of their efforts to promote the country's marine sports heritage. Eighty {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} boats from all over the country participated in the Dh 6 million 1998 race held over a {{convert|55|nmi|km|adj=on}} course. It was decided that as from 1998 the number of nationals in each boat would be 50 per cent, to be increased gradually to 100 per cent by 2001. In May 1999, 157 43-foot boats manned by 1,500 crew took part in the Al Dabb’iyya sailing race,Finishing at the [[Abu Dhabi]] Corniche break water.

In accordance with the traditional nature of the event, the race was preceded by the national anthem followed by [[folk dance]] and songs presented by local heritage troupes. Al Sarab owned by Dr H.H  Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan came in first, winning a cash prize OF a gold model of a boat and a vehicle.

== Camel racing ==

Thoroughbred Racing Camels are first put through their paces when they are about two years old. Initially the animals are trained to obey basic commands issued by the jockey. Then, a crucial two-kilometer gallop decides which have the ability for racing. To help build their stamina, the camels are made to run certain distances every day, which varies in proportion to their age. Recently jockeys were banned from racing and instead robots were used it their place according to human right laws.

There are two main breeds being raced, the Omani and Sudania which differ in color - the Omani being very light and the Sudania more of a tan color. Traditionally, a racing camel was fed on dates, honey, alfalfa, milk and seeds. They were never allowed to drink the day before a race and were prevented from feeding for the 12 hours prior to a race. With this type of saddle the jockey sits behind the camel's hump.

Camel-racing, a traditional sport, is extremely popular in the Emirates. 
It was originally staged in an informal setting, at weddings or special festivals, 
but now customized tracks have been built throughout the country where race 
meetings are held in the winter months from October to April, culminating in the 
annual camel race festival at Al Wathba which attracts entrants from all over the world.

Racing camel’s top speed {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Can run at {{convert|18|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for one hour or {{convert|7|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} for up to 18 hours. In the [[Gold Cup (camel)|Gold Cup]] that was recently run at NAD al-Shiba, the winning camel covered the 10 kilometers in 17 minutes and seven seconds (6.21 miles, averaging 21.76&amp;nbsp;mph). Because camels' humps store fat-not water- lean, streamlined racing camels have very small, almost vestigial, humps. Compared to an ordinary, run-of-the-desert camel, a racing camel looks like an enormous over-tall greyhound.

The '''Vinyl revival''' is the renewed interest and increased sales of [[vinyl records]], or gramophone records, that has been taking place in the Western world since about 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/1465/vinyl-lp-sales-in-the-us/|title=Infographic: The LP is Back!|website=Statista Infographics|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analogue format made of [[polyvinyl chloride]] had been the main vehicle for the commercial distribution of [[pop music]] from the 1950s until the 1980s and 1990s when they were largely replaced by the [[Compact Disc]] (CD). Since the turn of the millennium, CDs have been partially replaced by [[Music download|digital downloads]]. However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s it was growing at a very fast rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage (&lt;6%) of overall music sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/Soundscan/nielsen-2014-year-end-music-report-us.pdf |format=PDF |title=2014 Nielsen Music U.S. Report |website=Nielsen.com |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with steadily increasing vinyl sales, the vinyl revival is also evident in the renewed interest in the [[record shop]] (as seen by the creation of the annual worldwide [[Record Store Day]]), the implementation of music charts dedicated solely to vinyl, and an increased output of films (largely independent) dedicated to the vinyl record and culture.

Though many sales in vinyl are of modern artists with modern styles or genres of music, the revival has sometimes been considered to be a part of the greater revival of [[retro style]], since many vinyl buyers are too young to remember vinyl being a primary music format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umusic.co.uk/umusic-blog/meganwhitevinyl|title=Your turntable's not dead|date=13 July 2012|website=Umusic.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, [[Sony Music]] announced that by March 2018 it would be producing vinyl records in-house for the first time since ceasing its production in 1989.&lt;ref name="BBC News 29 June 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40445192|title= Sony Music goes back to vinyl records |author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 29 June 2017|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC | accessdate= 29 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting the decision, the [[BBC]] noted that, "Sony's move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records" but added that "Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records".&lt;ref name="BBC News 29 June 2017"/&gt;

==History==

===In Canada and the United States===
In 1988, the [[Compact Disc]] surpassed the gramophone record in popularity. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991,&lt;ref&gt; Sources vary on the actual dates.&lt;/ref&gt; when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles.

First, the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Entertainment Weekly|title=A Vinyl Farewell|date=4 October 1991|issue=86|last=Browne|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture|last=Souvignier|first=Todd|isbn=978-0-634-05833-2|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2004|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downlode.org/Etext/negativland_shiny.html|title=Shiny, Aluminum, Plastic, and Digital|author=[[Negativland]]|website=Downlode.org|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Romancing the Record: The Vinyl De-Evolution and Subcultural Evolution|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=26|issue=1|page=110,112|last=Plasketes|first=George|year=1992|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1992.00109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But ever since 2007, the popularity of vinyl records has risen again. The largest online retailer of vinyl records in 2014 was Amazon with a 12.3% market share, while the largest physical retailer of vinyl records was [[Urban Outfitters]] with an 8.1% market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6266616/urban-outfitters-doesnt-sell-most-vinyl|title=Urban Outfitters Doesn't Sell the Most Vinyl|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 'Shipment and Revenue Statistics' report for 2016, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] noted that "Shipments of vinyl albums were up 4% to $430 million, and comprised 26% of total physical shipments at retail value – their highest share since 1985".&lt;ref name="RIAA 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RIAA-2016-Year-End-News-Notes.pdf|title= News and Notes on 2016 RIAA Shipment and Revenue Statistics |last= Friedlander| first= Joshua P.|date= |website= riaa.com| publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate= 31 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United Kingdom===
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity in the late 1980s. This started a gradual decline in vinyl record sales throughout the 1990s. But also in the United Kingdom has the number of sold vinyl LP records increased every year between 2007 and 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11529159/Vinyl-revival-LPs-to-get-their-own-official-chart.html|title=Vinyl revival: LPs to get their own official chart|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] began an occasional ''Vinyl Revival'' series in which [[Peter Paphides]] met musicians who revealed, and played selections from, their personal vinyl record collections.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio 6 Music"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Vinyl Revival: Damon Albarn: Series 1 Episode 1 of 8| series= Vinyl Reviva| serieslink= | credits= Presenter: [[Peter Paphides]]| network= [[BBC]]| station= [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017xc8p| airdate= 4 December 2011| accessdate= 13 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, it was reported that over one million vinyl records had been sold in the UK since the beginning of the year. Sales had not reached this level since 1996. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) predicted that Christmas sales would bring the total for the year to around 1.2 million. However, vinyl sales were still a very small proportion of total music sales. [[Pink Floyd]]’s ''[[The Endless River]]'' became the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 – and the fastest-selling since 1997 – despite selling only 6,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Lee |first= Dave |title=Vinyl record sales hit 18-year high|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30216638|accessdate=27 November 2014 |website=BBC News | date=27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, 3.2 million vinyl records were sold in the UK, the best sale for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, January 2017 [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/record-sales-vinyl-hits-25-year-high-and-outstrips-streaming]&lt;/ref&gt;   

As of 2016, the revival continued.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/16/vinyl-sales-record-store-day/|title=Vinyl Sales Are Not Just a Hipster Thing Anymore|first=Chris|last=Morris|website=Fortune|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the BPI's 'Official UK recorded music market report for 2016', using [[Official Charts Company]] data, noted that "Though still niche in terms of its size within the overall recorded music market, vinyl enjoyed another stellar year, with over 3.2 million LPs sold – a 53 per cent rise on last year".&lt;ref name="BPI 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bpi.co.uk/searchresult/bpi-official-uk-recorded-music-market-report-for-2016.aspx|title= BPI official UK recorded music market report for 2016|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 3 January 2017 |website= www.bpi.co.uk |publisher= [[British Phonographic Institute]] | accessdate= 1 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPI also reported that "The biggest-selling vinyl artist was David Bowie, with 5 albums posthumously featuring in the top-30 best-sellers, including his Mercury Prize shortlisted ''Blackstar'', which was 2016’s most popular vinyl recording ahead of Amy Winehouse’s ''Back To Black'', selling more than double the number of copies of 2015’s best seller on vinyl – Adele’s ''25''".&lt;ref name="BPI 2016"/&gt;

BBC Radio 4's ''[[Front Row (radio)|Front Row]]'' discussed the increase in coloured vinyl releases in October 2017 in the wake of recent albums in the format by [[Beck]], [[Liam Gallagher]], and [[St. Vincent (musician)| St. Vincent]].&lt;ref name="BBC Front Row 13 October 2017"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Kit Harington, Kele Okereke, Dynasty, Porridge | series= [[Front Row (radio)|Front Row]] | credits= Presenters: Presenter: [[Stig Abell]]; Producer: Timothy Prosser| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0977v8d | airdate= 13 October 2017| minutes= 24:40| accessdate= 13 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record Store Day is an internationally celebrated day observed the third Saturday of April each year. Its purpose, as conceived by independent record store employee Chris Brown, is to celebrate the art of music.&lt;ref name=RSD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordstoreday.com/CustomPage/614|title=RECORD STORE DAY - ABOUT US|website=Recordstoreday.com|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day brings together fans, artists, and thousands of independent [[record store]]s across the world.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news| last = Passey| first = Brian| title = Vinyl records spin back into vogue| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2011-02-25-vinyl25_ST_N.htm| accessdate = 2 March 2011| work=USA Today| date=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record Store Day was officially founded in 2007&lt;ref name=RSD/&gt; and is celebrated globally&lt;ref name=RSD/&gt; with hundreds of recording and other artists participating in the day by making special appearances, performances, meet and greets with their fans, the holding of art exhibits, and the issuing of special [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] and CD releases along with other promotional products to mark the occasion.

In 1941, [[M-G-M]] made a version entitled ''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'', starring [[Wallace Beery]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] and directed by [[Richard Thorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=4703|title=Detail view of Movies Page|publisher=|accessdate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On a train bound for lawless northern China, businessman Gordon Creed ([[Ricardo Cortez]]) encounters acquaintance Myron Galt ([[Douglas Wood (actor)|Douglas Wood]]) and his attractive daughter Lola ([[Sheila Bromley]]). Galt is on his way to foreclose on a very promising oilfield built up by Jim Hallet ([[Gordon Oliver]]). Creed, on the other hand, wants to offer Hallet enough money to pay off his loan from Galt (for a tidy share of the oilfield).

Creed is annoyed when his reserved compartment is appropriated by General Chow Fu-Shan ([[Vladimir Sokoloff]]). The general is on his way to deal with self-styled General Wu Yen Fang ([[Boris Karloff]]), a warlord who has taken control of a province. However, Chow Fu-Shan is assassinated on the train by one of Fang's men.

After being questioned by military governor General Ma ([[Tetsu Komai]]), the three travel by horse to a remote town, where they find not only Hallet ([[Gordon Oliver]]), but Creed's estranged wife Jane ([[Beverly Roberts]]), who is working for missionary Dr. Abernathy ([[Gordon Hart (actor)|Gordon Hart]]). Then, Fang's subordinate, Captain Kung Nui ([[Chester Gan]]) and his men take over the town. When Kung Nui casts his eyes on Jane, Hallet impulsively punches him. Jane and Hallet have fallen in love, though she does not believe in divorce and has kept their relationship strictly platonic. Hallet is knocked out and imprisoned.

When Fang arrives, he tries to persuade Jane to go with him, promising she would enjoy it (blithely explaining "I am Fang"). Hallet escapes with the help of an associate disguised as one of Fang's soldiers, and sends him to notify General Ma of Fang's whereabouts. Hallet then breaks in on Fang and Jane's private discussion. Fang remembers Hallet, who had once hid a [[coolie]] and dug three bullets out of his shoulder; that was Fang before his meteoric rise. The warlord decides to help his benefactor. Fang robs Creed of $50,000, uses it to pay Galt what Hallet owes, then takes the money and offers it to Dr. Abernathy.

Creed bribes Captain Kung Nui to rebel against Fang. Kung Nui wants to regain [[Face (sociological concept)|face]] by having Hallet executed. Fang pretends to give in, but just before a firing squad shoots the oilman, Fang has his right-hand man, Mr. Cheng ([[Richard Loo]]), kill Kung Nui. Afterward, Fang personally shoots Creed to fix Hallet's romantic problem, but only manages to wound him.

Government troops arrive and force their way into the town. In the confusion, Jane, accompanied by Hallet, goes to attend to her husband's wound. Creed produces a gun and announces that Hallet is going to have a fatal accident, but is killed by Fang.

With the battle lost, Fang decides to surrender rather than risk the lives of his captives by fighting to the end. He is taken out and shot.

== Gameplay ==
''Yakuza 0 '' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The game takes place in December 1988, in Kamurocho and Sōtenbori, fictionalized recreations of [[Tokyo]]'s [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]] and [[Osaka]]'s [[Dōtonbori]] areas respectively. The player controls series protagonist [[Kazuma Kiryu]] and recurring character Goro Majima, alternating between the two at predetermined points during the story.

Players can freely walk around Kamurocho and Sotenbori, interacting with people they meet to trigger [[side-quest]]s, battling enemies who attack them on the street, or playing one of several minigames, including fully playable versions of Sega arcade games such as ''[[Out Run]]'', ''[[Super Hang-On]]'', ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Zone]]''. Completing certain objectives, such as eating every dish at a restaurant or reaching a target score in a minigame, will also grant the player special Completion Point currency; this CP can be spent at a shrine to receive additional bonuses, such as special items or character upgrades.

Character customization and growth is similar to the system from ''Isshin'', with abilities earned by buying them off of a skill tree that is gradually unlocked during the game. Instead of using experience to buy skills, the player uses money acquired from fights or via Kiryu and Majima's side businesses. Money is more liberally awarded in ''Yakuza 0'' than in previous entries, with every heavy attack causing enemies to drop cash. The player can lose their money if they encounter a special enemy called Mr. Shakedown, huge men who are far stronger than normal. If the player is beaten, they will lose all their cash, but can beat the enemy again to earn back their money and extra.

Kiryu and Majima also have side businesses that they run during the game to earn money: Kiryu invests real estate in Kamurocho, while Majima runs a [[Host and hostess clubs|cabaret club]]. Completing side-quests will often result in characters they meet offering to help with side businesses, allowing them to more easily and quickly progress. Progressing in side business sequences or training with specific masters will unlock additional abilities for purchase on the characters' skill trees.

A major innovation of ''Yakuza 0'' is the addition of fighting styles for both Kiryu and Majima that can be switched in the middle of battle. Kiryu utilizes the balanced Brawler style, similar to that of previous entries; the powerful but slow Beast style, which allows him to use heavy weapons; and the fast boxing-based Rush style, which emphasizes mobility. Conversely, Majima uses the balanced Thug style; the weapons-oriented Slugger style, primarily focused around a baseball bat; and the tricky dance-based Breaker style. Completing Kiryu and Majima's side businesses will unlock an additional "Legendary" fighting style for the characters, the "Dragon of Dojima" and "Mad Dog of Shimano" styles, respectively.

== Plot ==
In December, 1988, two unlikely figures from the Yakuza world, [[Kazuma Kiryu]] of the [[Kantō region]] and Goro Majima of the [[Kansai Region]], have suddenly found themselves getting involved in the terrible events of the so-called  "Empty Lot" dispute, which is the centerpiece of power struggle for all the dark organizations across Japan. In order to find out the truth behind such a power struggle, as well as maintain their own innocence and safety, they set out to investigate all the events surrounding the Empty Lot incident.

In Kamurocho, Tokyo, Kiryu is suspected of murder after the man that he has collected money from winds up dead in the Empty Lot. Kiryu's boss, Sohei Dojima, offers a promotion to second-in-command of the Dojima Family to whomever can find the deed to the land, and thus the most ruthless members go after Kiryu. Forced out of the family, Kiryu meets a man named Tetsu Tachibana, who owns a real estate company and promises to help Kiryu clear his name. Kiryu learns that Tachibana was hired by his then-incarcerated foster father, Shintaro Kazama, in order to assist him in preventing the Empty Lot from falling into Dojima's hands. While waiting for Tachibana to gather information about the lot's owner, Kiryu is hired by Tachibana as a real estate agent. Kiryu's involvement with Tachibana Real Estate causes him to be targeted by members of the Dojima Family, particularly his three lieutenants: Daisaku Kuze, Hiroki Awano and Keiji Shibusawa. Kiryu decides to sever ties with his associates, including his oath brother, Akira Nishikiyama, and Kazama Family's captain, Osamu Kashiwagi, in order to protect them from Dojima's wrath. After a brief showdown against Kuze on the streets of Kamurocho, Kiryu is rescued by Tachibana, who later reveals his true identity as a former Chinese mafia member. Tachibana later takes Kiryu to the Tojo Clan's headquarters, where they negotiate with the Acting Second Chairman, Takashi Nihara, and reach an agreement to protect Kiryu from the Dojima Family. Later on, Tachibana reveals to Kiryu the identity of the Empty Lot's owner: a psychologically-induced blind woman named Makoto Makimura, who resides in Sōtenbori, Osaka.

In Sōtenbori, Majima runs a cabaret club after being exiled from the Tojo Clan due to the botched Ueno-Seiwa hit years earlier, involving his oath brother, Taiga Saejima. Despite the success of his club, he realizes it's nothing more than a cage as he's under constant surveillance. One day, Majima's supervisor, Tsukasa Sagawa of the Omi Alliance, offers him a chance to rejoin the Shimano Family by assassinating a target named Makoto Makimura. Majima's search takes him to a chiropractic clinic, where he learns that Makoto is a receptionist and under the protection of the clinic's owner, Wen Hai Lee. Majima kidnaps Makoto, taking her to an abandoned warehouse, where he keeps her as he sets out to find answers as to why Makoto is being hunted. Lee suggests murdering a look-alike of Makoto and using the body to trick Majima's bosses, but he refuses to do it; however, a yakuza patriarch named Homare Nishitani carries out the deed in his place, forcing Majima to lie to Sagawa about Makoto's murder. Later on, Sagawa's men discover Majima's secret warehouse where he keeps Makoto, forcing both of them and Lee to flee. They make it back to Lee's clinic to take his car, but it is rigged to explode, killing Lee in the process. Sagawa attempts to kill Majima and Makoto, but is stopped by a mysterious assailant, who carries Makoto away. Sagawa and Majima work together to find the identity of Makoto's new captor. Majima visits Homare Nishitani of the Omi Alliance in prison, and learns from him that the man is Masaru Sera, president of the Nikkyo Consortium, a secret organization within the Tojo Clan. After Nishitani is betrayed and killed by one of the police officers in the station, Majima makes his escape and returns to Sagawa, and both of them head to the Consortium's headquarters. Majima storms through the base and confronts Sera, who reveals to him that Makoto had already been taken away by Tachibana Real Estate's men prior to Majima's arrival. Sera is then shot in the back by Sagawa, who pulls Kiryu's business card from Sera's pocket.

Eight hours before Majima's arrival at the Consortium HQ, Kiryu and Tachibana's right-hand man, Jun Oda, met with Sera and escorted Makoto back to Kamurocho. On the way back, they are pursued by Shibusawa and his men. They narrowly escape Shibusawa and hide at a construction site, but Oda attempts to betray them. Upon being subdued by Kiryu, Oda reveals that Makoto is Tachibana's biological sister, and that he was the person who sold Makoto to Korean mafia many years ago, when she moved from China to Sōtenbori in search of Tachibana. Kiryu and Makoto are forced to leave Oda behind as they return to Kamurocho, and Oda is killed by Shibusawa for failing to deliver Makoto to him as promised. Upon returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu meets up with Tachibana and prepares to take him to see Makoto, but is stopped by Dojima Family members, as well as Lao Gui, a Chinese assassin who was hired by Dojima to set up the Empty Lot murder and frame Kiryu. Tachibana willfully surrenders and goes with Lao Gui, in order to spare Kiryu. After recovering, Kiryu encounters Nishikiyama and reconciles with him. The two of them track down Tachibana, who is tortured by Kuze and his men in a basement. They successfully defeat Kuze, but Tachibana succumbs to his injuries and dies.

Majima and Sagawa travel to Kamurocho, in search of Makoto. The two learn from the head of the Shimano Family, Futoshi Shimano, that he never intended to kill Makoto, and that he knew Majima wouldn't be able to follow the order; he hoped for Majima to be able to gain Makoto's trust, and convince her to give the Empty Lot's deed to Shimano himself without trouble. Majima later wanders Kamurocho in search of Kiryu, and battles against both Kashiwagi and Nishikiyama; he learns from the latter about Makoto's disappearance, and goes to the Empty Lot, where he finds Makoto. Majima learns that Makoto has partially regained her vision following Tachibana's death, and that she wishes to avenge her brother by demanding Dojima's three lieutenants' heads in exchange for the Empty Lot deed. In a moment, she escapes Majima's sight and goes to meet Dojima in an attempt to negotiate a deal. Dojima, however, refuses to accept the deal, and has Lao Gui shoot her instead, just as Majima arrives at the scene. After clearing out Dojima's men, Majima and Sera, who survived Sagawa's gunshot, rush Makoto to the hospital.

Shibusawa later learns of Makoto's survival and sets out to track her down at all costs, forcing Kiryu to attempt to stop him. He and Nishikiyama travel to the docks, where the Nikkyo have put Makoto on one of their ships. A fight breaks out between Shibusawa's men and the Nikkyo, as well as members of the Kazama Family, led by Kashiwagi. Kiryu confronts Shibusawa and duels against him, and emerges victorious. Nishikiyama, however, stops Kiryu from killing Shibusawa, not wanting him to cross the line. Meanwhile, Majima arrives at Dojima Family's headquarters, taking down every one of its members along the way, including Awano. Awano is killed while trying to defend Majima from Lao Gui. Dojima then commands the assassin to kill Majima, but the latter prevails and prepares to murder both of them. Sera arrives and stops Majima, announcing his new ownership of the Empty Lot, and convincing him to stand down. He instructs Majima to kill Shimano for betraying the Tojo Clan to the Omi Alliance, but Majima spares him instead, as he wants to learn the truth behind Saejima's fate. Shimano kills an Omi Alliance envoy in return to deny his involvement with them, and reinstates Majima into his family.

A month following the incident, Sera is promoted to Third Chairman of the Tojo Clan for his acquisition of the Empty Lot. Kiryu sets out to find his own path as a yakuza by rejoining the Dojima Family. As punishment for his failure to secure a deal with the Shimano Family, Sagawa is killed by members of the Omi Alliance. Majima, inspired by Lee and Nishitani, decides to adopt a more crazy, carefree personality. He encounters Makoto, who does not recognize him, as well as her doctor, who has feelings for her. Majima encourages the doctor to take care of Makoto, then leaves the scene. In a post-credit scene, Makoto visits the Empty Lot to pay respects to her brother, and finds her stopwatch, repaired by Majima, buried in the ground. Majima finally meets Kiryu for the first time in Kamurocho, and greets him gleefully.

== Development ==
The game was first announced in a special ''Yakuza'' event on August 24, 2014, together with a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=『龍が如く0 誓いの場所』が発表された"龍が如く特別番組"レポ！ 激戦を制したセクシー女優の目に涙が!?|url=http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/914/914637/|website=電撃Online|accessdate=26 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104064624/http://dengekionline.com/elem/000/000/914/914637/|archivedate=4 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese-language localization of the game was announced in 2014 and eventually released in Asia in May 2015. [[Shonan no Kaze]] performed the game's main theme and ending theme, "Bubble" and "Kurenai" respectively; these songs were not licensed for the English release and were instead replaced by original instrumental tracks.

The Chinese localization of the game replaces late-game character Lao Gui, Chinese hired assassin of the Dojima Family, with a face model of Hong Kong actor [[Sam Lee (actor)|Sam Lee]].&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://michibiku.com/interview-localizing-yakuza-scott-strichart/|title=Interview: Localizing Yakuza with Scott Strichart|website=Michibiku|access-date=September 28, 2018|date=January 23, 2017|first=Graham|last=Russell|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2015, at [[PlayStation Experience]] in San Francisco, Sony Computer Entertainment's Gio Corsi announced that ''Yakuza 0'' would be coming to the Americas for the PlayStation 4. Initially, no official confirmation was made of a European release. In July 2016, it was announced that the game would release in North America and Europe for the PlayStation 4 in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/07/27/yakuza-0-launches-january-24-2017-exclusively-on-ps4/|title=Yakuza 0 Launches January 24, 2017, Exclusively on PS4|website=PlayStation.Blog|access-date=2016-07-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728141910/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/07/27/yakuza-0-launches-january-24-2017-exclusively-on-ps4/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western localization of the game was led by Scott Strichart, associate producer of [[Atlus USA]], who has localized ''[[Yakuza Kiwami]]'', ''[[Yakuza Kiwami 2]]'', and ''[[Yakuza 6]]''.&lt;ref name="Wawro"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/314068/QA_Translating_the_humor__tone_of_Yakuza_games_for_the_West.php#tophead|title=Translating the Humor Tone of Yakuza Games for the West|website=Gamasutra|access-date=September 28, 2018|date=February 5, 2018|first=Alex|last=Wawro|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team took a year and a half to localize Yakuza 0, which has 1.8 million [[Japanese writing system|Japanese characters]], nearly twice as many as the average [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|JRPG]], which has 1 to 1.2 million Japanese characters.&lt;ref name="Wawro"/&gt; In addition to challenges translating tone and humor, Strichart's team at Atlus had difficulties localizing traditional Asian games, including Mahjong and Shogi. In order to make these minigames accessible to Western audiences, Atlus had to provide detailed rules alongside gameplay. During the localization process, Strichart said the team wrote a total of "34 pages of Mahjong explanation."&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt;
