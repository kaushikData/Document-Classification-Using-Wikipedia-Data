An '''air track''' is a scientific device used to study [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in low [[friction]] environment. Its name comes from its structure: air is pumped through a hollow track with fine holes all along the track that allows specially fitted air track cars to glide relatively friction-free. Air tracks are usually triangular in cross-section. Carts which have a triangular base and fit neatly on to the top of the track are used to study motion in low friction environments. 

The air track is also used to study collisions, both elastic and inelastic. Since there is very little energy lost through friction it is easy to demonstrate how momentum is conserved before and after a collision.  The track can be used to calculate the force of [[gravity]] when placed at an angle.

It was invented in the mid-1960s at the California Institute of Technology by Prof Nehr and Leighton. It was first presented by them at a meeting of the American Physical Society in NYC in 1965(?) where it was viewed by Prof John Stull, Alfred University, and Frank Ferguson, the Ealing Corporation. The original track was about 1 meter long with tiny air orifices and highly compressed air.  Stull returned to Alfred Univ. Where he developed a simple version using standard square aluminum tubing with large air orifices and air from the  vent of a shop vacuum cleaner. Stull with Ferguson's help at Ealing designed a custom aluminum track that Ealing offered commercially in various lengths up to 10 meters. T. Walley Williams III at Ealing extended the concept to the 2-dimensional air table in 1969.

'''Aleksei Lotman''' (also known as '''Alex Lotman''' and '''Aleks Lotman'''; born 6 May 1960 in [[Leningrad]]) is an [[Estonia]]n biologist, [[environmentalist]] and politician.

From 2010 to 2011 Lotman served as the leader of political party [[Estonian Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aleksei Lotman was elected as the new chairman of Greens’ Party in Estonia|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=5311|work=The Baltic Course|accessdate=25 October 2013|date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 election, the Greens lost all their parliamentary representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonian Elections 2011: Live Blog in English!|url=http://elections2011.estonianfreepress.com/|work=Estonian Free Press|accessdate=25 October 2013|date=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2011, Lotman was a member of Estonian parliament [[Riigikogu]], representing the Estonian Greens. He was also leader of the parliamentary group for [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonia Forms A New Parliament Support Group for Tibet|url=http://www.thetibetpost.com/en/news/international/1595-estonia-forms-a-new-parliament-support-group-for-tibet|work=Tibet Post International|accessdate=25 October 2013|date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Order of the National Coat of Arms]], 5th Class, by the President of Estonia on 6 February 2006.&lt;ref name="teenetemärk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teenetemärkide kavalerid|url=http://www.president.ee/et/vabariik/teenetemargid/kavalerid.php?tm=riigivapi&amp;y=2006&amp;pg=5|publisher=Vabariigi Presidendi Kantselei|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksei Lotman graduated from the Tartu Miina Härma Secondary School No 2 in 1978, and the [[University of Tartu|Tartu State University]] as a biologist in 1985.&lt;ref name=majanduslugu/&gt;

1991–2000, Lotman served as the vice director of the [[Matsalu National Park]].&lt;ref name=majanduslugu&gt;{{cite web|title=Lotman, Aleksei (1960)|url=http://www.eestimajandus.ee/moodul.php?moodul=CMS&amp;Komponent=Lehed&amp;id=1011&amp;sm_id=1149|publisher=Eesti Majanduslugu|accessdate=22 October 2013|language=Estonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Alex Lotman is the son of literary scholar, semiotician, and cultural historian [[Juri Lotman]] and literary scientist [[Zara Mints]]. His brothers are literature researcher and politician [[Mihhail Lotman]] and artist Grigori Lotman. Alex Lotman is married to environmentalist Kaja Lotman, they have two daughters and a son.&lt;ref&gt;G. Egorov 2011. Внучка великого филолога Ю.М.Лотмана пошла по стопам отца, но не деда.

A '''bathymetric chart''' is the submerged equivalent of an above-water [[topographic map]]. Bathymetric charts are designed to present accurate, measurable description and visual presentation of the submerged terrain. 

In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same [[Scale (measurement)|scale]] and [[Map projection|projection]] of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated [[sea level]] [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]. Thus the topographic map's [[mountain]]s have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart's greatest depths have the greatest values. Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.

A bathymetric chart differs from a [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal while safe [[navigation]] is the requirement for the hydrographic chart. A [[hydrographic chart]] will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to aid [[sailor|mariners]] in avoiding underwater hazards.

Bathymetric surveys are a [[subset]] of the science of [[hydrography]]. They differ slightly from the [[Hydrographic survey|survey]]s required to produce the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing [[chart]]s and [[publication]]s for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information. 

Bathymetric surveys and charts are more closely tied to the science of [[oceanography]], particularly [[marine geology]], and [[underwater engineering]] or other specialized purposes.

Bathymetric charts can also be converted to [[topographic profile|bathymetric profiles]].

'''''Bully for Brontosaurus''''' (1991) is the fifth volume of collected [[essay]]s by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. The essays were culled from his monthly column "This View of Life" in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, to which Gould contributed for 27 years. The book deals, in typically discursive fashion, with themes familiar to Gould's writing: evolution and its teaching, science biography, and probabilities.
[[File:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|''Brontosaurus'' restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]] which was used for the cover]]
The title essay, "Bully for Brontosaurus", discusses the theory and history of taxonomy by examining the debate over whether ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' should be labelled ''[[Apatosaurus]]''. In "Justice Scalia's Misunderstanding", Gould dissects and decisively rejects [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that overturned the last [[creationist]] statute in the country. Gould claimed his favourite essay to be "In a Jumbled Drawer" which discusses the debate between [[Nathaniel Shaler]] and [[William James]] over whether the improbability of our having evolved necessitates divine intervention (Gould, like James, argues no); the essay includes a letter from former President [[Jimmy Carter]] as a postscript, which discusses the issue.

The essay "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples" dealt with the issue of adaptive arguments. It derives from some work by [[Elisabeth Lloyd]], whose subsequent 2005 book&lt;ref name="caseofthefemaleorgasm"&gt;Lloyd, E.A. (2005). ''The Case of The Female Orgasm: Bias in the science of evolution''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to Gould (and her parents), and uses the case of the female orgasm to expand on the subject of adaptiveness in both depth and breadth.

In [[astronomy]], '''CTA 102''', also known by its [[B1950]] coordinates as '''2230+114''' (QSR B2230+114) and its [[J2000]] coordinates as '''J2232+1143''' (QSO J2232+1143), is a [[quasar]] discovered in the early 1960s by a radio survey carried out by the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="internet_encyc_space" /&gt; It has been observed by a large range of instruments since its discovery, including [[WMAP]], [[EGRET]], [[GALEX]], [[VLBI Space Observatory Programme|VSOP]] and [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes]],&lt;ref name="ned" /&gt; and has been regularly imaged by the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] since 1995.&lt;ref name="vlba"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.physics.purdue.edu/MOJAVE/sourcepages/2230+114.shtml | title=MOJAVE Sample: 2230+114 | accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been detected in [[gamma rays]], and a gamma-ray flare has been detected from it.&lt;ref name="atel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=3320 | title=Fermi LAT detection of a GeV flare from blazar CTA 102 | publisher=Astronomers Telegram | date=3 May 2011 | accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 [[Nikolai Kardashev]] proposed that the then-unidentified radio source could be evidence of a Type II or III extraterrestrial civilization on the [[Kardashev scale]].&lt;ref name="internet_encyc_space" /&gt; Follow-up observations were announced in 1965 by Gennady Sholomitskii, who found that the object's radio emission was varying;&lt;ref name="gennady"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Variability of the Radio Source CTA-102 | last=Sholomitsky | first= G.

CTA 102 is one of the two great false alarms in the history of [[SETI]], the other being the discovery of [[pulsars]], specifically [[PSR B1919+21]], which are rotating neutron stars.

The American [[folk rock]] band [[The Byrds]] whimsically reflected the original view that CTA-102 was a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence in their song "C.T.A.-102" from their 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|authorlink=Johnny Rogan|pages=317–320|year=2011|title=Byrds: Requiem for the Timeless|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016 CTA 102, usually glowing around [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] +17, had a bright outburst in visible light to magnitude +11 (~250 times brighter than usual).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/quasar-cta-102-historically-bright-violently-variable/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=9924&lt;/ref&gt; This likely was the most luminous blazar state ever observed,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=9868&lt;/ref&gt; with an [[bolometric magnitude|absolute magnitude]] in excess of -32.

A '''cognitive map''' (sometimes called a [[mental map]] or [[mental model]]) is a type of [[mental representation]] which serves an individual to acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. The concept was introduced by [[Edward C. Tolman|Edward Tolman]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="pmid18870876"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolman |first=Edward C. |authorlink=Edward C.

[...] The cycle of ''problem construction'', ''making sense'', ''defining the problem'', and declaring a ''portfolio of solutions'', which I have discussed elsewhere (Eden, 1982) is the framework that guides the process of working with teams. Thus building and working with the cognitive maps of each individual is primarily aimed at helping each team member reflectively 'construct' and 'make sense' of the situation they believe the team is facing.

Let us just say that cognitive maps are the representation of an individual's personal knowledge, of an individual's own experience (Weick and Bougon, 1986), and they are ways of representing individuals' views of reality (Eden et al., 1981). There are various types of cognitive maps (Huff, 1990). (pp. [//books.google.com/books?id=LE95fcRz_IcC&amp;pg=PA21 21–22])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Cognitive maps have been studied in various fields, such as psychology, education, archaeology, planning, geography, cartography, architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, management and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conspiracy nation: the politics of paranoia in Postwar America |last=Knight |first=Peter |year=2002 |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |location=New York and London |isbn=0814747353}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2016}} As a consequence, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive  maps, [[mental map]]s, [[Behavioral script|script]]s, [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]], and [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]].

Cognitive maps serve the construction and accumulation of spatial knowledge, allowing the "[[mind's eye]]" to visualize images in order to reduce [[cognitive load]], enhance [[recollection|recall]] and [[learning]] of information. This type of spatial thinking can also be used as a metaphor for non-spatial tasks, where people performing non-spatial tasks involving [[memory]] and imaging use spatial knowledge to aid in processing the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kitchin |first=Robert M. |title=Cognitive maps: what are they and why study them? |journal=[[Journal of Environmental Psychology]] |year=1994 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80194-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[neural correlate]]s of a cognitive map have been speculated to be the [[place cell]] system in the [[hippocampus]]&lt;ref name="O'Keefe"&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Keefe |first1=John |authorlink1=John O'Keefe (neuroscientist) |last2=Nadel |first2=Lynn |authorlink2=Lynn Nadel |date=1978 |title=The hippocampus as a cognitive map |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]; [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0198572069 |oclc=4430731 |url=http://www.cognitivemap.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recently discovered [[grid cells]] in the [[entorhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name="pmid16675704"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sargolini |first1=Francesca |last2=Fyhn |first2=Marianne |last3=Hafting |first3=Torkel |last4=McNaughton |first4=Bruce L. |last5=Witter |first5=Menno P. |last6=Moser |first6=May-Britt |last7=Moser |first7=Edvard I. |title=Conjunctive representation of position, direction, and velocity in entorhinal cortex |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=312 |issue=5774 |pages=758–762 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16675704 |doi=10.1126/science.1125572 |bibcode=2006Sci...312..758S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological basis ==

Cognitive mapping is believed to largely be a function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus is connected to the rest of the brain in such a way that it is ideal for integrating both spatial and nonspatial information. Connections from the [[postrhinal cortex]] and the medial entorhinal cortex provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Connections from the [[perirhinal cortex]] and lateral entorhinal cortex provide nonspatial information. The integration of this information in the hippocampus makes the hippocampus a practical location for cognitive mapping, which necessarily involves combining information about an object's location and its other features.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manns |first1=Joseph R. |last2=Eichenbaum |first2=Howard |authorlink2=Howard Eichenbaum |date=October 2009 |title=A cognitive map for object memory in the hippocampus |journal=[[Learning &amp; Memory]] |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=616–624 |doi=10.1101/lm.1484509 |pmc=2769165 |pmid=19794187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Keefe and Nadel were the first to outline a relationship between the hippocampus and cognitive mapping.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe" /&gt; Many additional studies have shown additional evidence that supports this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Moser&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser |first1=Edvard I. |authorlink1=Edvard Moser |last2=Kropff |first2=Emilio |last3=Moser |first3=May-Britt |authorlink3=May-Britt Moser |date=2008 |title=Place cells, grid cells, and the brain's spatial representation system |journal=[[Annual Review of Neuroscience]] |volume=31 |pages=69–89 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723 |pmid=18284371 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/7t2VcSrTYa8V8yACMweG/full/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[pyramidal cells]] ([[place cells]], [[boundary cell]]s, and [[grid cells]]) have been implicated as the neuronal basis for cognitive maps within the hippocampal system.

Numerous studies by O'Keefe have implicated the involvement of place cells. Individual place cells within the hippocampus correspond to separate locations in the environment with the sum of all cells contributing to a single map of an entire environment. The strength of the connections between the cells represents the distances between them in the actual environment. The same cells can be used for constructing several environments, though individual cells' relationships to each other may differ on a map by map basis.&lt;ref name="O'Keefe" /&gt; The possible involvement of place cells in cognitive mapping has been seen in a number of mammalian species, including rats and macaque monkeys.&lt;ref name=Moser /&gt; Additionally, in a study of rats by Manns and Eichenbaum, pyramidal cells from within the hippocampus were also involved in representing object location and object identity, indicating their involvement in the creation of cognitive maps.&lt;ref name=Manns /&gt; However, there has been some dispute as to whether such studies of mammalian species indicate the presence of a cognitive map and not another, simpler method of determining one's environment.&lt;ref name=Bennet /&gt;

While not located in the hippocampus, grid cells from within the medial entorhinal cortex have also been implicated in the process of [[path integration]], actually playing the role of the path integrator while place cells display the output of the information gained through path integration.&lt;ref name=McNaughton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McNaughton |first1=Bruce L. |last2=Battaglia |first2=Francesco P. |last3=Jensen |first3=Ole |last4=Moser |first4=Edvard I. |authorlink4=Edvard Moser |last5=Moser |first5=May-Britt |authorlink5=May-Britt Moser |date=August 2006 |title=Path integration and the neural basis of the 'cognitive map' |journal=[[Nature Reviews Neuroscience]] |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=663–678 |doi=10.1038/nrn1932 |pmid=16858394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of path integration are then later used by the hippocampus to generate the cognitive map.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt; The cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus, even if it is primarily based there. Other than the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps.&lt;ref name=Moser /&gt;

=== Parallel map theory ===

There has been some evidence for the idea that the cognitive map is represented in the [[hippocampus]] by two separate maps. The first is the bearing map, which represents the environment through self-movement cues and [[gradient]] cues. The use of these [[vector (mathematics)|vector]]-based cues creates a rough, 2D map of the environment. The second map would be the sketch map that works off of positional cues. The second map integrates specific objects, or [[landmark]]s, and their relative locations to create a 2D map of the environment. The cognitive map is thus obtained by the integration of these two separate maps.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt;

==Generation==

The cognitive map is generated from a number of sources, both from the [[visual system]] and elsewhere. Much of the cognitive map is created through self-generated movement [[sensory cue|cues]]. Inputs from senses like vision, [[proprioception]], olfaction, and hearing are all used to deduce a person's location within their environment as they move through it. This allows for path integration, the creation of a vector that represents one's position and direction within one's environment, specifically in comparison to an earlier reference point. This resulting vector can be passed along to the hippocampal place cells where it is interpreted to provide more information about the environment and one's location within the context of the cognitive map.&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacobs |first1=Lucia F. |last2=Schenk |first2=Françoise |date=April 2003 |title=Unpacking the cognitive map: the parallel map theory of hippocampal function |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=285–315 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.110.2.285 |pmid=12747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directional cues and positional landmarks are also used to create the cognitive map. Within directional cues, both explicit cues, like markings on a compass, as well as gradients, like shading or magnetic fields, are used as inputs to create the cognitive map. Directional cues can be used both statically, when a person does not move within his environment while interpreting it, and dynamically, when movement through a gradient is used to provide information about the nature of the surrounding environment. Positional landmarks provide information about the environment by comparing the relative position of specific objects, whereas directional cues give information about the shape of the environment itself. These landmarks are processed by the hippocampus together to provide a graph of the environment through relative locations.&lt;ref name=Jacobs /&gt;

== History ==

The idea of a cognitive map was first developed by [[Edward C. Tolman]]. Tolman, one of the early cognitive psychologists, introduced this idea when doing an experiment involving rats and mazes. In Tolman's experiment, a rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it. After this initial exploration, the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right. The rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food. When placed at different arms of the cross maze however, the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial cognitive map it had created of the maze. Rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what, the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=E. Bruce |date=2011 |title=Cognitive psychology: connecting mind, research, and everyday experience |edition=3rd |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=[[Wadsworth Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9780840033550 |oclc=658234658 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In a review, Andrew T.D. Bennett argued that there is no clear evidence for cognitive maps in non-human animals (i.e. cognitive map according to Tolman's definition).&lt;ref name=Bennet&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Andrew T. D. |date=January 1996 |title=Do animals have cognitive maps? |journal=[[The Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=199 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=219–224 |pmid=8576693}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is based on analyses of studies where it has been found that simpler explanations can account for experimental results. Bennett highlights three simpler alternatives that cannot be ruled out in tests of cognitive maps in non-human animals "These alternatives are (1) that the apparently novel short-cut is not truly novel; (2) that path integration is being used; and (3) that familiar landmarks are being recognised from a new angle, followed by movement towards them."

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}

A cognitive map is a spatial representation of the outside world that is kept within the mind, until an actual manifestation (usually, a drawing) of this perceived knowledge is generated, a mental map. Cognitive mapping is the implicit, mental mapping the explicit part of the same process. In most cases, a cognitive map exists independently of a mental map, an article covering just cognitive maps would remain limited to theoretical considerations.

In some uses, mental map refers to a practice done by urban theorists by having city dwellers draw a map, from memory, of their city or the place they live. This allows the theorist to get a sense of which parts of the city or dwelling are more substantial or imaginable. This, in turn, lends itself to a decisive idea of how well urban planning has been conducted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">The '''Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography''', commonly known as '''CICRED''', is a [[non-governmental organization]] accredited with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] of the [[United Nations]]. Founded in 1972, it aims at developing cooperation amongst national population [[research]] centres, and encouraging new research. It serves as a platform for interaction between research centres and [[international organizations]], such as United Nations Population Division, [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO).

CICRED was run from its creation up to 1990 by Jean Bourgeois-Pichat, followed by Léon Tabah and then Philippe Collomb. Christophe Z Guilmoto became the new director in 2005. CICRED elected Francis Gendreau as its first Council Chair in 1993 and Gavin Jones in 2001.

CICRED today is an association of more than 700 research organizations dealing with population issues, from national [[statistical]] bureaux to research departments in [[demography]]. Its office is located in [[Paris]] in the premises of [[INED]]. The CICRED General Assembly consisting of the representatives of the member centres meets every four years during the IUSSP International Population Conference. The CICRED Council consists of seven members elected for four years by the members, three ''ex officio'' members from international organizations and is presided over by the chairperson. The Council decides on the administration of the Committee and on its strategic orientations.

Beyond its networking activities, CICRED conducts also international research programmes. It recently organized several conferences or seminars on subjects such [[aids]] and spatial mobility, [[demographic dividend]], population-environment-development inter-relations or female deficit in Asia. It also published books and policy papers devoted to contemporary population issues.

'''''Connections''''' is a 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary]] television series and 1978 book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]. The series was produced and directed by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]] of the [[BBC]] Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA). It took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the [[history of science]] and [[invention]], and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and [[deadpan|dry humour]]), [[historical re-enactment]]s, and intricate working [[scale model|models]].

The popular success of the series led to the production of ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' (1985), a similar program but showing a more linear history of several important scientific developments. Years later, the success in syndication led to two sequels, ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994) and ''Connections&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1997), both for [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]]. In 2004, [[KPJK|KCSM-TV]] produced a program called ''Re-Connections'', consisting of an interview of Burke and highlights of the original series, for the 25th anniversary of the first broadcast in the USA on [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Content==
[[File:Pike Square.JPG|thumb|Modern soldiers demonstrate the use of steel-tipped [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] by the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] against [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] in one of the many re-enactments used in ''Connections''.]]
''Connections'' explores an "Alternative View of Change" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and [[teleology|teleological]] view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religion) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.

To demonstrate this view, Burke begins each episode with a particular event or innovation in the past (usually [[ancient history|ancient]] or [[middle ages|medieval times]]) and traces the path from that event through a series of seemingly unrelated connections to a fundamental and essential aspect of the modern world. For example, the episode "The Long Chain" traces the invention of plastics from the development of the [[fluyt]], a type of Dutch [[cargo ship]].

Burke also explores three [[corollary|corollaries]] to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events of which we were not even aware at the time.

The second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but also to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly 'change' itself, [[Future shock|becomes too much for the average person]] to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.

Lastly, if the entire modern world is built from these interconnected innovations, all increasingly maintained and improved by specialists who required years of training to gain their expertise, what chance does the average citizen without this extensive training have in making an informed decision on practical technological issues, such as the building of [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] or the funding of controversial projects such as [[stem cell]] research? Furthermore, if the modern world is increasingly interconnected, what happens when one of those nodes collapses? Does the entire system follow suit?

The original 1978 '''''Connections''''' 10-episode [[Television documentary|documentary television series]] and had a companion book (''Connections'', based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]].  The 1978 Connections companion book was published about the time the middle of the series was airing, so likely was written in parallel to the series and had a post-production editing release.&lt;ref&gt;This is not the ISBN of the original 1978 book, but those available online March 2017 via used book web sites {{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The very popular book was re-released as a work in a 1995 edition, 1998, (relations to sections below is unknown.) and again in 2007 as both hardcover or softcover editions.  Since the television series varied in content with each corresponding production run and release, it is likely the companion volumes (as is suggest by the plethora of ISBN codes) are also different works. This 1978 work's coverage deviates in some topics and details being both more in depth and a bit broader, from the lighter coverage of the episodes.  It can be found in many libraries.

{{clear right}}
# "The Trigger Effect" details the world's present dependence on complex technological networks through a detailed narrative of New York City and the [[Northeast Blackout of 1965|power blackout of 1965]]. Agricultural technology is traced to its origins in [[ancient Egypt]] and the invention of the [[plough]]. The segment ends in [[Kuwait]] where, because of [[Crude oil|oil]], society leapt from traditional patterns to advanced technology in a period of only about 30 years.
# "Death in the Morning" examines the standardisation of precious metal with the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] in the ancient world. This innovation stimulated trade from [[Greece]] to [[Persia]], ultimately causing the construction of a huge commercial center and [[library at Alexandria]] which included [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Star catalogue|star table]]s. This wealth of astronomical knowledge aided navigators during the [[age of discovery]] 14 centuries later following the introduction of [[lateen sail]]s and [[sternpost rudder]]s. Mariners discovered that the [[compass]]'s magnetised needle did not actually point directly north. Investigations into the nature of [[magnetism]] by [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|Gilbert]] led to the discovery of electricity by way of the [[Electrostatic generator|sulphur ball]] of [[von Guericke]]. Further interest in [[atmospheric electricity]] at the [[Ben Nevis]] [[weather station]] led to [[C. T. R. Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[cloud chamber]] which in turn allowed development of both [[Robert Watson-Watt|Watson-Watt]]'s [[radar]] and (by way of [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s insights) [[nuclear weaponry]].
# "Distant Voices" suggests that telecommunications exist because [[Normans]] had [[stirrups]] for horse riding which in turn led them to further advancements in warfare. Deep mine shafts flooded and scientists in search of a solution examined [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuums]], air pressure, and other natural phenomena.
# "Faith in Numbers" examines the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Renaissance]] from the perspective of how commercialism, [[climate change]], and the [[Black Death]] influenced cultural development. He examines the impact of [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] waterpower on the Industrial Revolution, derived from [[Roman watermill]] technology such as that of the [[Barbegal aqueduct and mill]]. Also covered are the Gutenberg printing press, the [[Jacquard loom]], and the Hollerith punch card tabulator that led to modern computer programming.
# "The Wheel of Fortune" traces [[astrological]] knowledge in ancient Greek manuscripts from [[Baghdad]]'s founder, Caliph [[Al-Mansur]], via the Muslim monastery/medical school at [[Gundeshapur]], to the medieval Church's need for alarm clocks (the [[water clock|water horologium]] and the [[verge and foliot]] clock). The clock [[mainspring]] gave way to the [[pendulum clock]], but the latter could not be used by mariners, thus the need for [[Machine tool|precision machining]] by way of [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s improved steel (1797) and [[Henry Maudslay|Maudslay]]'s use (1800) of [[Jesse Ramsden|Ramsden]]'s idea of using a screw to better measure (which he took from the [[Polelathe|turner]]'s trade). This process made a better mainspring and was also used by the Royal Navy to make better [[Block (sailing)|blocks]]. [[Honoré Blanc|Le Blanc]] mentioned this same basic idea to [[Thomas Jefferson]], who transmitted this "[[American system of manufacturing|American system of manufactures]]" – precision machine-tooling of [[musket]] parts for interchangeability – to New Englanders [[Eli Whitney]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]], and [[Simeon North]]. The American efficiency expert [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] and his [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|psychologist wife]] later improved the whole new system of the modern [[production line]].
# "Thunder in the Skies" implicates the [[Little Ice Age]] (''[[circa]]'' 1300-1850 AD) in the invention of the [[chimney]], as well as [[knitting]], [[button]]s, [[wainscoting]], [[Tapestry|wall tapestries]], [[Plasterwork|wall plastering]], [[glass window]]s ([[Hardwick Hall]] [1597] has "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the [[steam engine]] is then examined: [[Thomas Newcomen]]'s [[Newcomen engine|engine]] for pumping water out of mines (1712); [[Abraham Darby III|Abraham Darby]]'s cheap iron from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], [[James Watt]]'s addition of a second [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensing cylinder]] (for cooling) to the engine (1763); [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]]'s improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773–75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, [[Joseph Priestley]], investigated gases, leading [[Alessandro Volta]] to invent "bad air" ([[marsh gas]]) detectors and ignitors. Meanwhile, [[Edwin Drake]] discovered oil (in [[Pennsylvania]]), allowing [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] (in [[Bad Cannstatt]]) to replace [[town gas]] with gasoline as fuel for [[Siegfried Marcus|auto engine]]s (1883). They also invented (in 1892) the [[carburetor]] (inspired by the medical [[Atomizer nozzle|atomizers]], which also developed from Priestley's work) and a new ignition system inspired by Volta's "bad air" detection spark gun. Finally, piano-maker [[Wilhelm Kress]] unsuccessfully attempted (1901) to fly the first [[seaplane]] on an Austrian lake using the new gasoline engine.
# "The Long Chain" traces the invention of the [[fluyt]] freighter in Holland in the 16th century. Voyages were insured by Edward Lloyd ([[Lloyd's of London]]) if the ships' hulls were covered in pitch and tar (which came from the colonies until the American War of Independence in 1776). In [[Culross]], Scotland, [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald Cochrane (9th Earl of Dundonald)]] tried to [[coal gasification|distill coal vapour]] to get [[coal tar]] for ships' hulls, which led to the discovery of [[ammonia]]. The search for artificial [[quinine]] to treat malaria led to the development of artificial dyes, which Germany used to produce fertilizers to grow wheat and led to the advancement of chemistry which in turn led to [[DuPont]]'s discovery of polymers such as nylon.
# "Eat, Drink and Be Merry..." begins with plastic, the plastic credit card, and the concept of [[Credit (finance)|credit]], then leaps back to the time of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], the first state to use credit. The [[Dukes of Burgundy|dukes]] used credit for many luxuries, and to buy more armour for a stronger army. The Swiss opposed the army of Burgundy and invented a new military formation (with [[Swiss pikemen|soldiers using pikes]]) called the [[pike square]]. The pike square, along with events following the French Revolution, set in motion the growth in the size of armies and in the use of ill-trained peasant soldiers. Feeding these large armies became a problem for [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], which caused the innovation of bottled food. The bottled food was first put in champagne bottles then in tin cans. [[Canned food]] was used for armies and for navies. In one of the bottles, the canned food went bad, and people blamed the spoiled food on "bad air", also known as swamp air. Investigations around "bad air" and malaria led to the innovation of [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]]. In 1892, [[Sir James Dewar]] invented a container that could keep liquids hot or cold (the [[thermos]]) which led three men – [[Tsiolkovsky]], [[Robert Goddard]], and [[Hermann Oberth]] – to construct a large thermal flask for either [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen|oxygen]] or for [[solid fuel]] combustion for use in [[rocket propulsion]], applying the thermal flask principle to keep [[rocket fuel]] cold and successfully using it for the [[V-2]] rocket and the [[Saturn V rocket]] that put man on the moon.
# "Countdown" connects the invention of the [[movie projector]] to improvements in castle fortifications caused by the invention and use of the [[cannon]]. The use of the cannon caused changes in castle fortifications to eliminate a blind spot where cannon fire could not reach. This improvement in castle defence caused innovation in offensive cannon fire, which eventually required [[map]]s. Thus, a need arose to view and map locations (like a mountain top) from a long distance, which led to the invention of [[limelight]] light source, and later the [[incandescent light]]. Burke turns to the next ingredient for a movie projector, [[Photographic film|film]]. Film is made with [[celluloid]] (made with [[guncotton]]) which was first invented as a substitute for ivory in [[billiard balls]]. Next was the invention of the [[zoopraxiscope]] which was first used for a bet to see if a horse's hooves all left the ground at any point while galloping. The zoopraxiscope used frame-by-frame pictures and holes on the side to allow the machine to pull the film forward. Communication signals for railways using [[Samuel Morse|Morse]]'s telegraph led to [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] discovering how to speak into a microphone creating bumps on a disc that could be played back—the [[phonograph|record player]]. This final ingredient gave [[Sound film|movies sound]]. In summary, Burke connects the invention of the movie projector to four major innovations in history: the incandescent light, the discovery of celluloid, the projector that uses frame-by-frame pictures on celluloid, and finally, recorded sound.
# "Yesterday, Tomorrow and You" recaps the theme that change causes more change. Burke ties together the modern inventions in which previous episodes had culminated: telecommunications, the computer, the jet engine, plastics, rockets, television, the production line, and the atomic bomb. All of these inventions come together in the B-52 nuclear bomber. Start with the plow, you get [[irrigation]], [[pottery]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], [[civilisation]] and writing, mathematics, a [[calendar]] to predict floods, empires, and a [[modern world]] where change happens so rapidly you cannot keep up. What do you do? Stop the change? Throw away all technology and live like cavemen? Decide what change will be allowed by law? Or just accept that the world is changing faster than we can keep up with?

===''Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' (1994)===
# "Revolutions" – What do all these things have in common—three grandfathers' lifetimes, two revolutions, 1750 [[Cornish steam engine]]s for Cornwall's tin mines, water in mines, [[pumps]], [[steam engines]], [[James Watt|Watt]]'s copier, [[carbon paper]], [[match]]es, phosphorus [[fertiliser]], trains and [[Gene pool|gene-pool]] mixing, [[Door-to-door|travelling salesmen]], 24-hour production, educated women, the telephone, high-rise buildings, [[Damascus steel|Damascus]]'s [[sword]]s, steel, diamond, [[carborundum]], [[graphite]], [[oscilloscope]], television, [[Apollo space program]], [[X-ray]] [[crystallography]], [[DNA]] and [[gene therapy]]? You will learn these things in the first episode of Connections&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, "Revolutions".
# "Sentimental Journeys" – What do these have in common – [[Freud]], lifestyle crisis, [[electric shock therapy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[magnetism]], [[phrenology]], [[penology]], [[physiology]], [[synthetic dyes]], the [[Bunsen burner]], [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], [[Fraunhofer lines]], [[astronomical telescope]]s, [[chromatic aberrations]], and [[surveying]]? Follow James Burke on the trail of discovering the connections between these and others in "Sentimental Journeys".
# "Getting it Together" – James Burke explains the relationship between [[hot air balloons]] and [[Nitrous oxide|laughing gas]], and goes on to surgery, hydraulic-water gardens, [[hydraulic rams]], [[Alpine Tunnel|tunnelling through the Alps]], the [[Orient Express]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[heart attacks]] and [[headaches]], [[aspirin]], [[carbolic acid]], [[disinfectants]], [[Maybach]]-[[Gottlieb Daimler]]-[[Mercedes (car)|Mercedes]], [[carburetors]], [[helicopters]], [[typewriters]], [[punch cards]], and [[IBM]].
# "Whodunit?" – This episode starts with a [[billiard ball]] and ends with a billiard ball. Along the way, Burke examines [[Georgius Agricola]]'s ''[[De Re Metallica]]'', how mining supported war, the role of money, the [[Spanish Armada]], large ships, problems posed by a wood shortage, [[glass making]], coal, [[plate glass]], [[mirror]]s, the [[sextant]], the discovery of [[granite]], and seashells in the mountains, which enabled a new view of the [[age of the earth]], and [[Darwin's theory of evolution]], [[Francis Galton]]'s ''[[Eugenics]]'', and the [[fingerprinting|forensic use of fingerprints]].
# "Something for Nothing" – How do [[space shuttle]] landings start with the [[vacuum]] which was [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|forbidden by the Church]]? Burke takes us on an adventure with barometers, [[weather forecasting]], muddy and blacktop roads, rain [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[sewage]], a [[cholera]] epidemic, [[hygiene]], [[plumbing]], [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], [[vacuum pump]]s, [[Drill#Types|compressed-air drills]], tunnels in the Alps, [[railway air brake|train air brakes]], [[hydroelectric power]], the [[electric motor]], [[Galvani]]'s [[Muscle electrostimulation#History|muscle-electricity connection]], [[Alessandro Volta#First battery|Volta's battery]], and [[gyroscopes]].
# "Echoes of the Past" – The past in this case starts with the [[Indian tea culture#Dutch exploration|tea in Dutch-ruled India]], examines the [[Japanese tea ceremony]], [[Zen Buddhism]], [[porcelain]], the architecture of Florence, [[Delftware]], [[Wedgwood]], [[Free Masons]], [[Cryptography|secret codes]], [[radiotelephone|radio-telephones]], [[cosmic background radiation]] and—finally – [[radio astronomy]], which listens to "Echoes of the Past".
# "Photo Finish" – Another series of discoveries examined by Burke includes [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]], the [[disappearing elephant scare of 1867]], billiard balls, [[celluloid]] as a substitute for ivory, false teeth that explode, [[gun cotton]], double shot sound of a bullet, [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[shock wave]], [[aerodynamics]], [[nuclear bombs]], [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity|relativity]], Einstein's selenium, [[talkies|movie talkies]], the [[valve audio amplifier|vacuum tube amplifier]], radio, [[Railroad#History|railroad's use of wood]], [[coal tar]], [[gas lighting|gas lights]], [[creosote]], rubber, the [[Zeppelin]], the [[automobile]], and finally how Adeline [[Vulcanization|vulcanise]]s tires.
# "Separate Ways" – Burke shows how to get from sugar to [[atomic weapons]] by two totally independent paths. The first involves [[Slavery in the United States|African slaves]], [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist societies]], [[Sampson Lloyd II]], [[wire]], [[suspension bridges]], [[Galvanization#Zinc coatings|galvanised wire]], settlement of the [[Wild West]], [[barbed wire]], canned corn, and [[cadmium]]. The second path involves [[sweet tea]], [[rum]], a [[double boiler]], the steam engine, [[Matthew Boulton]], English currency, the [[pantograph]], [[electroplating]], and [[cathode ray tubes]].
# "High Times" – The connection between [[polyethylene]] and [[Big Ben]] is a few degrees of separation, so let us recount them: polyethylene, [[radar]], soap, artificial dyes, [[color perception]], [[tapestries]], Far East goods, fake lacquer furniture, search for shorter route to Japan, [[Henry Hudson#1607 and 1608 voyages|Hudson in Greenland]], the discovery of plentiful whales, printing the Bible, [[Mercator map]], [[Martin Luther]]'s protest, star tables, Earth as a flattened sphere, and [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]]'s clock which of course leads to Big Ben.
# "Deja Vu" – James Burke provides evidence that history does repeat itself by examining the likes of [[black and white movie]]s, [[conquistadors]], [[Incas|Peruvian Incas]], [[small pox]], settlements that look like Spain's cities, the gold abundance ending up in [[Belgium]], Antwerp, colony [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], the practice of [[buried treasure|burying treasure]] to avoid pirates, [[Port Royal]]'s pirates, earthquakes, the [[College of William and Mary]], [[military discipline]], [[Alexander Humboldt]]'s observation on the environment, [[Ratzel]]'s superstate ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and [[Karl Haushofer|Haushofer]]'s world domination.
# "New Harmony" – A dream of utopia is followed from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] to Singapore, from the [[transistor]] to its most important element, [[germanium]], to [[Ming vase]]s and cobalt fakes (which contribute to the blue in blue tiles used in special Islamic places), and [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|mosaics in Byzantium]], the [[donation of Constantine]], [[Portuguese discoveries#Celestial navigation|Portuguese navigation by stars]], the [[History of Brazil#Beginnings of Brazil|"discovery" of Brazil]], [[Multiculturalism in the Netherlands|Holland's tolerance]], diamond merchants, [[optics]], [[microscopes]], beasts of science, [[Frankenstein's monster]], and finally [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony.]]
# "Hot Pickle" – Burke starts out in a [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|spice market in Istanbul]] where you can find hot pickle, recounts the [[Byzantium#History|taking of Constantinople by the Turks]] in 1453, follows the trail of pepper, tea, and [[opium]] and the exploitation of addicts, moves to the jungles of [[Java]], then to [[zoos]], the [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|use of canaries]] as carbon monoxide detectors, how [[George Stephenson]] used his consolation prize to build a [[locomotive]], which led to the [[Monitor and Merrimack|battle between the'' Monitor'' and the ''Merrimack'']]. Next we visit a sea island off the coast of South Carolina, where children of slaves are schooled. By the way, they picked cotton, which leads us to [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] and [[air conditioning]]. [[Georgia Cayvan]]'s glass dress leads to the [[Neodymium laser|neodymium glass laser]], (which was used in the [[Gulf War]]). And the armed switch for firing a missile is also called a "hot pickle".
# "The Big Spin" is what [[The Big Spin|California's lottery TV show]] is called. And lottery being a game of chance, from here Burke takes us through [[Alexander Fleming]]'s chance discovery of [[penicillin]], to [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s observation that contaminated water is related to health, to [[Schliemann]]'s search for the [[City of Troy]], the theft of a discovered treasure, and to Virchow's criminology. From there we proceed to [[anthropology]], the classification of life forms, [[Francis Bacon]], the [[Mortality rate|statistics of mortality]], [[life expectancy]], [[Statistics#Statistical methods|statistical math]], [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley]]'s [[carbonated water]], the [[soda fountain]], [[petroleum oil]], some French fossil hunters, [[seismology]], and impossible-to-predict earthquakes.
# "Bright Ideas" – [[gin and tonic]] was invented to combat malaria in [[British colonies]] like [[Java]], which leads us to [[Geneva]], where cleanliness is an obsession. Here, [[tonic water]] was sealed with a disposable bottle cap, and [[disposable razor|razors became disposable]], leading us to [[Benjamin Huntsman|Huntsman]]'s steel, invaluable for making [[clock]] springs. We take a little trip through [[lighthouses]], the education of orphans, [[psycho-physics]], the law of the [[just noticeable difference]], which is the idea behind [[stellar magnitude]]s, which leads us to discovering the [[size of the universe]].
# "Making Waves" – a [[permanent wave]] in ladies' hair is aided by [[curlers]], and this leads us to explore [[borax]], taking us to Switzerland, [[Johann Sutter]]'s scam, and [[Sutter's Mill]], and that means the discovery of gold leading to the 1848 [[California gold rush]]. Americans then cut into the English tea market with the aide of the ''[[Clipper|Yankee Clipper]]'', which played a big role in the gold rush. A fungus from America created the [[Irish potato famine]], resulting in the importing of corn, but laws prevented the Yankee clippers from being used until it was too late to save Ireland. Finally, the laws were changed, leading to franking fraud, which was overcome by special printing of postage stamps, which gave us [[wallpaper]], and a thickening agent, leading us to the [[Canal du Midi]], the [[American War of Independence|American war for independence]], resettlement in Scotland, [[Highland Clearances|highlanders]] in Nova Scotia and—finally—the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].
# "Routes" – [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], a sick English lawyer, recuperates sipping wine and contributes the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] to help fix farming problems. Farm production is not going so well in France, either. [[François Quesnay]] (doctor of King Louis XV's mistress) suggests a solution based on his complete misunderstanding of English farming techniques. ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' was his erroneous idea. It also got the people to demand social ''laissez-faire''. His inciting the public's rebellion against the [[French monarchy|monarchy]] led to France's invasion of Geneva. The [[French Revolution]] led to personal exploration of the senses. Berlin doctor Müller reasoned that each sense does a different job and the nervous system analyses what the senses are telling one. Helmholtz's pupil, Hertz, discovered that sound and electricity have a wave-like nature in common. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] takes this a step further by sending and receiving signals very long distances across the earth. The [[BBC]] realised that the radio waves were reflected by the ionosphere, and Hess was the first to suggest that the ionization was due to "Hess rays" later related to solar activity. But [[World War II]] started and [[adding machines]] were needed to aim artillery, so [[digital computing]] was invented. Thus was enabled the [[GPS]] which tells travelers their "Routes".
# "One Word" – The one word that changed everything was "[[filioque]]", but we must make a trip to [[Constantinople]], visit the [[Renaissance]], meet [[Aldus Manutius]] of [[Venice]], explore [[abbreviations]], learn about [[Italic type|Italic print]], which resulted in an overload of books, requiring the development of a cataloguing system, which was complicated for those seeking education, where [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]] was innovating with pictorial textbooks. And that brings us to church intolerance, [[James Watt]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[cerium]], the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], Gauss's mathematics, and [[cultural anthropology]].
# "Sign Here" – [[Murphy's Law]] says you need insurance from [[Lloyd's of London]], so pack your bags to study [[international law]] and protect yourself from piracy by calculating the probability. You better study Pascal's math for that, but you might find yourself jailed for [[free thinking]]. While you are in jail, study some [[sign language]], or at least learn to speak better than [[Eliza Doolittle]]. [[My Fair Lady|Henry Higgins]]'s waveform recordings lead you to the telephone, the invention of [[shorthand]], the [[radiometer]], gas flow, the [[Wright brothers]]' aeroplane, [[lubrication]], [[ball bearings]] and a [[ballpoint pen]] so you can "Sign Here".
# "Better Than the Real Thing"  starts in the 1890s with bicycles and [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] and then takes a look at [[boots]], [[zippers]], [[sewing machines]], and infinitesimal difference. Speaking of small, we look at microscopic [[Microorganism|germs]], [[polarized light]], sugar, coal, iron, microbubbles, the [[spectroscope]], [[night vision]], [[beriberi]] resulting from [[polished rice]], chickens, war rationing, and finally, we arrive at [[Vitamin pill|vitamins in a pill]].
# "Flexible Response" is a whimsical look at the myth of the [[English longbow]], [[Robin Hood]], sheep, the need to drain land with [[windmills]], the effect of [[compound interest]], [[decimal fractions]] (wrongly pointing to the USA not Russia as the first country with [[decimal currency]], in fact USA did not exist at the time of Russian decimalisation in 1704), increased [[productivity]], the [[Erie Canal]], railroads, [[telegraphs]], [[department stores]], [[Quaker Oats]], X-ray diagnostics, [[biofeedback]], and [[servo control]] systems in a [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft.

===''Connections³'' (1997)===
# "Feedback" – Electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by [[Claude Bernard]], whose vivisection experiments kick off animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there that are using [[Matthew Maury]]'s data on wind and currents transmitted by the radio telegraph, invented by [[Samuel Morse]], who is also a painter whose hero is [[Washington Allston]], who spends time in Italy with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who comes to [[Malta]] and spies for the governor [[Alexander Ball]], who saved Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s skin so he can go head over heels for [[Emma Hamilton]] in Naples, resulting in an illegitimate son. Emma became notable in the [[James Graham (sexologist)#The Celestial Bed|Electrico-Magnetico Celestial Bed]], where you go regain your fertility through electricity, and you can get more whisky thanks to [[Joseph Black]], who determined the latent heat of vaporisation in steam. [[James Watt]] borrowed that information to make a better steam engine. Watt is linked to Roebuck who discovered chlorine bleach which eventually is used to make white paper. The paper is used for decorating walls by [[William Morris]],  who is a socialist with [[Annie Besant]], who is a vegetarian just like the [[Seventh-day Adventists]]. And we end up with [[W.K. Kellogg]]'s cornflakes.
# "What's in a Name?" – Remember the cornflakes from last episode? Because corncobs make adhesives to bond [[carborundum]] discovered by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]], otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs, silicon carbide is also then used as protection against armour-piercing shells developed to hit tanks that start life as American tractors, which use diesel engines developed from funding from [[Krupp]], who inspired Bismarck's welfare scheme based on [[Adolphe Quetelet|Quetelet's]] statistics that inspired the [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[difference engine]], whose [[punch cards]] were used to rivet the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], the monster ship that laid the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] insulated with [[gutta-percha]] used to manufacture golf balls for factory managers in industrial Scotland, where James Watt had a run-in with [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]], whose protegee was James Macie, also called [[James Smithson]], who caused all the row in the capitol building, so the money got used to set up a world-renowned institution named after James Macie's new family name, which was Smithson: The institution known as the [[Smithsonian]].
# "Drop the Apple" – At the Smithsonian, we learn of electric crystals that help Pierre and [[Marie Curie]] discover what they call radium, and then Langevin uses the piezoelectric crystal to develop sonar that helps save Liberty ships (from German U-boats) put together with welding techniques using acetylene made with carbon arcs, also working the arc lights with clockwork regulators built by Foucault, whose pendulum helps him to take pictures of solar eclipses. Also thanks to ash from seaweed, [[interchangeable parts]] for clocks, the world of opera, and gurus, we get Einstein's theory of the gravity effect, which means Newton's universe is gone and you can drop the apple.
# "An Invisible Object" – Black holes in space, seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]], brought into space with hydrazine fuel, which was a byproduct of fungicides for French vines, fuelled by quarantine conventions and money orders, [[American Express]] and [[Buffalo Bill]], Vaudeville and French battles, [[Joan of Arc]] and the Inquisition, Jews welcomed by Turks, who lost to Maltese knights with surgeons trained on pictures by [[Titian]], in [[Augsburg]], where goldsmiths made French money to pay for tobacco. That triggered logarithms and slide rules made by clock makers, who also made pressure cookers that sterilised French beer kept cool by refrigerators that were also used to freeze meat and chill down paraffin wax for making objects invisible.
# "Life is No Picnic" – Instant coffee gets off the ground in World War II and Jeeps lead to nylons and stocking machines smashed by [[Luddites]], who were defended by [[Lord Byron]], who meets [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] in Turkey, avoiding the same blockade that inspires the "Star-Spangled Banner", which was really an English song all about a Greek poet discovered by a publisher whose son-in-law is pals with [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] of chronology fame, whose military boss, Maurice, inspires [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]], father of the runaway [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], whose teacher [[René Descartes]]' mechanical universe inspires the book about brains by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Willis]], which is illustrated by the architect of St. Paul's, [[Christopher Wren]], who dabbles in investments like [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s Louisiana scam that ruins France, and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], and later the French finance minister [[Jacques Necker]], whose daughter is the opinionated [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël|de Stael]], whose romantic pals get [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] looking into jellyfish so he can defend [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. This demonstrates that "Life is No Picnic".
# "Elementary Stuff" – [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who studied beetles, [[Oliver Lodge]] and telegraphy, a radio designed by [[Reginald Fessenden]], which was used by banana growers, studied by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]], who got the Swiss to use stamps on postcards with cartoons of Gothic houses of parliament, which in turn had been inspired by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s Romantic movement, inspired by fake Scottish poems. The exiled Scots escaped to North Carolina, producing turpentine, which helped make Chinese lacquer on tinplate, which is for what [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] had hoped. French navy decorator [[Pierre Paul Puget]], who paints pictures of locations where barometers are the subject of investigation. The weather experimenter, whose brother's writing turns on Swift, whose pal Berkeley has visual theories that Young confirms while decoding ancient Egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by French balloonists. The American balloons are used for spying by [[Allan Pinkerton]] and his intrepid agent [[James McParland]], who becomes famous in England because of [[Conan Doyle]].
# "A Special Place" – Professor Sir [[Alec Jeffries]] of Leicester University in England develops DNA profiling and schlieren photography used by [[Theodore von Karman]] to study aerodynamics and [[Anthony Fokker]]'s airborne machine guns and the [[Red Baron]] and geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s romantic ideas that start in Italy and paintings of actors and lighthouses and the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] and Spanish gold and [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] and [[William Cheselden]]'s skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing aficionados who write books and [[Charles Cotton]] and sceptical wine-drinkers called [[Michel Eyquem]], and [[Edward Jenner]]'s cure for smallpox and [[J.J. Audubon]] and American bird painters and devious Russian real estate deals, and as a result in 1872, America gets a special place, the first national park, Yellowstone.
# "Fire from the Sky" –   Due to [[continental drift]] and [[Alfred Wegener]]'s passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of [[King Arthur]], whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval [[courtly love]] answers to adultery, which were in turn inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical [[Catharism|Cathars]], who lived next to the mystical [[Christian Kabbalah|cabalists]] who were fascinated with mystic numbers that spark [[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Pico of Mirandola]]'s interest in Hebrew, which then brings trouble for [[Johann Reuchlin]], not helped by his nephew, the [[Protestant]] [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]], who had a feud with [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]], who rewrites the work of [[Copernicus]]. Osiander's Italian pal, Dr. [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]], who cures the asthmatic [[John Hamilton (archbishop)|Archbishop John Hamilton]], executed for helping [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], whose lover, the explosive-bearing [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], ends up in Scandinavia with a friend of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], whose assistant, [[Willem Blaeu]], makes maps updated in the first true atlas by the Englishman Dudley, working in Italy for [[Bernardo Buontalenti]], who got opera started, which was a rave success, especially with the French [[Cardinal Mazarin]], whose library inspired [[Samuel Pepys|the secretary of the English navy]], which eventually buys French [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], after which [[Canning|Gamble]] gets the patent for canned food that feeds explorers like [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]], who transplanted rubber trees to [[Sri Lanka]]. As a result of all that, we have rubber to mix with gasoline to make [[napalm]], which is "Fire from the Sky".
# "Hit the Water" – Thanks to napalm, made with [[palm oil]], also used for [[margarine]], stiffened with a process using [[kieselguhr]] that comes from [[plankton]] living in currents studied by [[C. H. D. Buys Ballot|Ballot]] before observing the [[Doppler effect]] that caused [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] to measure the speed of light. Fizeau's father-in-law's friend, [[Prosper Mérimée]], who wrote "[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]"...&amp;nbsp;his friend, [[Anthony Panizzi]], who works at the British Museum, opened to house the collection of [[Hans Sloane]], who treats Lady Montague's smallpox before she sees Turkish tulips, first drawn by Gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with France, which was the first to develop military music and choreography, used in a London show by [[John Gay]], whose friend Arbuthnot does statistics that impress the Dutch mathematician who knows [[Voltaire]], who hears from the worm-slicing [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], who stars in the story by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Judge Hoffman]], who tries German nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the [[YMCA]] and the man who started the [[Red Cross]], who need a way to figure out blood types, surgical stitching and the perfusion pump invented by [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to [[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']], [[German tanker Altmark|''Altmark'']], and the German invasion of Norway and the Allied commandos whose mission was to "Hit the Water".
# "In Touch" – Starting from an attempt for cheaper fusion power using superconductivity, which was discovered by Onnes, with liquid gas provided by [[Louis-Paul Cailletet]], who carried out experiments on a [[Eiffel Tower|tower]] built by [[Gustave Eiffel]], who also built the [[Statue of Liberty]] with its famous poem by the Jewish activist [[Emma Lazarus]], helped by [[Laurence Oliphant (author)|Oliphant]], whose boss Elgin was the son of the man who stole the [[Elgin Marbles]] and sold them with the help of royal painter [[Thomas Lawrence]], whose colleague [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] had an assistant whose wife's lodger was [[Benjamin Franklin]], who charted the [[Gulf Stream]] with a thermometer [[Fahrenheit]] borrowed from [[Ole Rømer]], whose friend [[Jean Picard|Picard]] surveyed Versailles and provided the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspired [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau|Duhamel]] to write the book on gardening that was read by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], who hired the Scottish stonemason [[Thomas Telford]], whose idea for [[London Bridge]] was turned down by Thomas Young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do Hertz's electricity waves, with which Helmholtz prods a frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, Klages, analyses handwriting so individual post codes have to be capital letters to get your mail to a jungle village to keep you "In Touch".

All three ''Connections'' documentaries have been released in their entirety as DVD box sets in the US. The ten episodes of series one were released in Europe (Region 2) on 6 February 2017.

Burke also wrote a series of ''Connections'' articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and published a book of the same name (1995, {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}), all built on the same theme of exploring the history of science and ideas, going back and forth through time explaining things on the way and, generally, coming back to the starting point.

Burke produced another documentary series called ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' in 1985, which explored man's concept of how the universe worked in a manner similar to the original ''Connections''.

''{{YouTube|user=ArtOfTheProblem|title=Art of the Problem}}'' is a video series launched in 2011 on [[Kickstarter.com]] that was inspired by James Burke's ''Connections''. However, it follows concepts rather than inventions through time.

''[[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]]'', shown on [[BBC2]], follows a similar format.

The '''Conroy Virtus''' was a proposed [[United States|American]] large transport aircraft intended to transport the [[Space Shuttle]]. Designed, beginning in 1974, by [[John M. Conroy]] of the [[Turbo-Three Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19740000770 |title= Feasibility Study to Consider an Aircraft for the Air Launch and Air Transportation of the Space Shuttle Orbiter |first= |last= |work= |date= 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bee"&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sEchAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rn8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1147,3211291&amp;dq=virtus+aircraft+shuttle&amp;hl=en Space Shuttle Orders Giant Plane Developed]" ''[[The Modesto Bee]]''. February 13, 1974, p.A17.&lt;/ref&gt; it was to incorporate a pair of [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] fuselages to form a new craft utilizing existing parts for cost-savings.

While the project was seriously considered, it proved impractically large, and [[NASA]] chose to develop the [[Boeing 747]]-based [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|Shuttle Carrier]] from surplus commercial aircraft instead.

==History==
The Space Shuttle was originally designed to utilize on-board [[turbofan]] engines for propulsion within the atmosphere, both upon [[re-entry]] and for ferry flights between landing sites, such as [[Edwards Air Force Base]], the [[White Sands Missile Range]], or contingency landing sites such as [[Easter Island]], to the launch site at [[Kennedy Space Center]] at [[Cape Canaveral]].&lt;ref name="Low1"&gt;Lowther 2012, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; When the air-breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins 2001, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; One early design for a shuttle carrier aircraft was proposed by [[John M. Conroy]], developer of the [[Pregnant Guppy]] and [[Super Guppy]] oversized cargo aircraft, in cooperation with the [[NASA Langley Research Center]]; named Virtus, a contract was issued for design and development work in 1974.&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt;

Expected to cost [[United States dollar|US$]]12.5 million each,&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt; Virtus was a twin-fuselage design powered by four large jet engines;&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt; it was intended for these to be [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] turbofans.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; Conroy proposed extensive use of 'off the shelf' military parts in the design to reduce costs;&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt; this included the use of fuselages from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] strategic bombers to form the aircraft's main fuselage pods, added to the new-design wing and tail section.&lt;ref name="Low2"&gt;Lowther 2012, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]] would be carried under the center section of the Virtus aircraft's wing, between the fuselages;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; other large cargos, including the [[Space Shuttle external tank]],&lt;ref name="Bee"/&gt; the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s, or dedicated cargo pods, could be alternatively carried.&lt;ref name="Low2"/&gt;

The Virtus design was tested in the NASA Langley [[wind tunnel]];&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Low2"/&gt; while the results of the wind tunnel tests were considered promising,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; the drawbacks of such a large design, including the cost of developing an entirely new aircraft, flight testing the design, and the sheer size of the aircraft requiring the development and/or expansion of infrastructure to support it, militated against further development of Virtus.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The [[Lockheed Corporation]], which had proposed a twin-fuselage version of its [[C-5 Galaxy]] airlifter to carry the Shuttle, also saw its proposal rejected for the same reasons.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; A more modest conversion of existing C-5s was proposed, and nearly taken up by NASA, but it was determined that having aircraft continually available was preferable to being restricted by the [[United States Air Force]] on the use of C-5s, and [[Boeing]]'s proposal for a conversion of the [[Boeing 747|747]] airliner was selected, becoming the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; A proposed commercial version of the Virtus design, named Colossus,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VqkiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=VIRTUS+aircraft+shuttle&amp;dq=VIRTUS+aircraft+shuttle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmEvlq6k8a&amp;sig=vksjU4qtAhY-Ke6FOtLGYIN2iuM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aZYhUKCmM4Sa9gTc-oCgBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ Cargo Aircraft, volume 64]. R. H. Donnelley Corp., 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; also failed to gain any further interest, and the Virtus design was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Low3"&gt;Lowther 2012, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Costa Rican páramo''', also known as the '''Talamanca páramo''', is a  [[natural region]] of [[montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grassland and shrubland]] of [[Costa Rica]] and western [[Panama]].

==Setting==
The Costa Rican páramo includes several enclaves on the highest peaks of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] in eastern Costa Rica and western Panama, with a total area of 31&amp;nbsp;km². The páramo is found above 3000–3100 meters elevation on the summits of [[Cerro de la Muerte]], [[Cerro Chirripó]], and [[Cerro Kamuk]] in Costa Rica, [[Cerro Echandi]] on the Costa Rica-Panama border, [[Cerro Fábrega]], and [[Cerro Itamut]] in Panama.

It is surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Talamancan montane forests]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] includes the Costa Rican páramo within the montane forests ecoregion, although the páramo has a distinct flora with affinities to the [[páramo]] of the Northern Andes.

==Flora==
The Costa Rican páramo can be divided into three zones. The subpáramo is a [[dwarf forest]], dominated by the dwarf [[bamboo]] ''[[Chusquea subtessellata]]'', together with short shrubs.

The páramo proper lies above the subpáramo, and is dominated by grasses, rushes, herbs, and low shrubs of the families [[Gramineae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Cyperaceae]], [[Rosaceae]] and [[Ericaceae]]. Above the páramo lies the superpáramo, a narrow zone with scarce vegetation between the grass páramo and the snow line.

==Fauna==
Tapir,Jaguar toucans, countless lizards and birds

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9694">'''Critical international relations theory''' is a diverse set of schools of thought in [[international relations]] (IR) that have criticized the theoretical, meta-theoretical and/or political [[status quo]], both in IR theory and in international politics more broadly&amp;nbsp;– from [[positivism|positivist]] as well as [[postpositivism|postpositivist]] positions.  Positivist critiques include [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] approaches and certain ("conventional") strands of [[Constructivism in international relations|social constructivism]].  Postpositivist critiques include [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]], [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]], "critical" [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist]], [[critical theory]] (in the strict sense used by the [[Frankfurt School]]), [[Neo-Gramscianism|neo-Gramscian]], most [[feminism|feminist]], and some [[English school of international relations theory|English School]] approaches, as well as non-Weberian [[historical sociology]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvnb|Hobden|Hobson|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[International Political Sociology (security studies)|international political sociology]]", "[[critical geopolitics]]", and the so-called "new materialism"&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvnb|van der Tuin|Dolphijn|2012}}; {{harvnb|Coole|Frost|2010}}; {{harvnb|Connolly|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (partly inspired by [[actor–network theory]]).  All of these latter approaches differ from both realism and liberalism in their [[epistemology|epistemological]] and [[ontology|ontological]] premises.

Such theories are now widely recognized and taught and researched in many universities, but are less common in the United States.  They are taught at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in many major universities outside the US, where a major concern is that "a myopic discipline of IR might contribute to the continued development of a civil society in the U.S. that thinks, reflects and analyzes complex international events through a very narrow set of theoretical lenses".{{sfn|Smith|2002}}

'''DENIS-P J020529.0-115925''' is a [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]]. It is located 64 light-years (19.8 parsecs) away, based on the system's [[stellar parallax|parallax]].&lt;ref name=Dahn2002/&gt; It was first found in the [[Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky]].&lt;!-- P=Provisory or provisional designation --&gt;

This is a triple star system containing three [[brown dwarf]]s: objects that do not have enough mass to fuse [[hydrogen]] like stars. The two brightest components, designated A and B respectively, are both [[L-type star|L-type]] objects. As of 2003, the two were separated 0.287° along a position angle of 246°.&lt;ref name=Bouy/&gt;

Component B was observed to elongated, suggesting a third component. This third component, named C, is a [[T-type star|T-type]] object.&lt;ref name=Bouy/&gt; It is separated about 1.9 [[astronomical unit]]s (au) from B, and based on a total mass of {{solar mass|0.1|link=yes}}, the two may orbit each other every 8 years.&lt;ref name=Bouy/&gt;

'''''Five Billion Years of Solitude: The Search for Life Among the Stars''''' is a non-fiction work by the science author Lee Billings. The text was initially published on October 3, 2013 by Current.

==Overview==
In this book, Billings explores the scientists and science behind the ever-expanding universe of exoplanets.  Since the first detection of a planet orbiting another Sun-like star in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The exoplanet next door|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-exoplanet-next-door-1.11605|location=Nature|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have discovered an increasing number of worlds beyond our solar system through detections by telescopes and spacecraft.  Billings reveals the scientists behind these discoveries and their thoughts on not only exoplanets, but also their triumphs and frustrations in their quest to solve one of the greatest mysteries of humankind: Are we alone?  Billings includes interviews with [[Frank Drake]], [[Geoffrey Marcy]], Greg Laughlin, [[James Kasting]], [[Matt Mountain]], Wesley Traub, [[Sara Seager]], and many other prominent researchers.

== Topics covered ==
The book has 10 chapters:
* Looking for Longevity
* Drake's Orchids
* A Fractured Empire
* The Worth of a World
* After the Gold Rush
* The Big Picture
* Out of Equilibrium
* Aberrations of the Light
* The Order of the Null

The '''Gakkel Ridge''' (formerly known as the '''Nansen Cordillera''' and '''Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge''')&lt;ref name="IHO_IOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gebco.net/about_us/meetings_and_minutes/documents/gebco_scufn_15_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=IHO-IOC GEBCO Gazetteer |accessdate=2008-05-24 |publisher=[[International Hydrographic Organization]]/[[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] |date=September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911062905/http://www.gebco.net/about_us/meetings_and_minutes/documents/gebco_scufn_15_report.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[mid-oceanic ridge]], a divergent [[tectonics|tectonic]] plate boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/news/2003/story11-11-03b.html "GPS Measurements Reveal Imprint of North American Plate in Siberia", Earth Institute at Columbia University, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[Eurasian Basin]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]], between [[Greenland]] and [[Siberia]], and has a length of about 1,800 kilometers. Geologically, it connects the northern end of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] with the [[Laptev Sea Rift]].

The existence and approximate location of the Gakkel Ridge were predicted by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] polar explorer [[Yakov Yakovlevich Gakkel]], and confirmed on Soviet expeditions in the Arctic around 1950. The Ridge is named after him, and the name was recognized in April 1987 by [[SCUFN]] (under that body's old name, the Sub-Committee on Geographical Names and Nomenclature of Ocean Bottom Features).&lt;ref name="IHO_IOC"/&gt;

The ridge is the slowest known spreading ridge on earth, with a rate of less than one centimeter per year. Until 1999, it was believed to be non-volcanic; that year, scientists operating from a nuclear submarine discovered active [[volcano]]es along it. In 2001 two research icebreakers, the German ''[[RV Polarstern|Polarstern]]'' and the American ''[[USCGC Healy|Healy]]'', with several groups of scientists, cruised to the Gakkel Ridge to explore it and collect petrological samples. Among other discoveries, this expedition found evidence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s. In 2007, [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] conducted the "Arctic Gakkel Vents Expedition" (AGAVE), which made some unanticipated discoveries, including the unconsolidated fragmented [[pyroclastic]] volcanic deposits that cover the axial valley of the ridge (whose area is greater than 10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These suggest volatile substances in concentrations ten times those in the magmas of normal mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Sohn, et al., "Explosive volcanism on the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean", ''Nature'' 453, 1236-1238 (26 June 2008) | {{doi|10.1038/nature07075}} http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7199/full/nature07075.html (abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; Using "free-swimming" [[submersible#ROVs|robotic submersible]]s on the Gakkel ridge, the AGAVE expedition also discovered  what they called "bizarre 'mats' of microbial communities containing a half dozen or more new species".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ridge2000.org/dls/abstracts.php "The Arctic Gakkel Vents (AGAVE) Expedition: A High–Stakes Technology Gamble Pays Big Dividends Beneath the Arctic Ice Cap", Ridge 2000 Abstracts 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gakkel ridge is remarkable in that is not offet by any [[transform fault]]s. The ridge does have segments with variable orientation and varying degrees of volcanism: the Western Volcanic Zone From the Lena trough, 7° W, to 3° E longitude), the Sparsely Magmatic Zone (from 3° E to 29° E longitude), and the Eastern Magmatic Zone (from 29° E to 89°E) &lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Michael, et al., "Magmatic and amagmatic seafloor generation at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean", ''Nature'' 423, 956–961, (26 June 2003) | {{doi|10.1038/nature01704}} &lt;/ref&gt;. The gaps of volcanic activity imply very cold crust and mantle, probably related to the very low spreading rate, but it is not yet know why some parts of the ridge are more magmatic than others.&lt;ref&gt; Laurent Montesi and Mark D. Behn, "Mantle flow and melting underneath oblique and ultraslow mid‐ocean ridges", ''Geophysical Research Letters'' 34, L24307, ( 25 December 2007) | {{doi|10.1029/2007GL031067}} &lt;/ref&gt; Some earthquakes have been detected from the mantle, below the crust, which is very unusual for a mid-ocean ridge &lt;ref&gt;Vera Schlindwein, et al., "Seismicity of the Arctic mid-ocean Ridge system", ''Polar Science'' 9, 146-157, (March 2015) | {{doi|10.1016/j.polar.2014.10.001}} &lt;/ref&gt;. It confirms that the mantle and crust of Gakkel ridge, like some segments of the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]], are very cold.

Ground substance provides lubrication for collagen fibers.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stecco |first1=Carla |last2=Hammer |first2=Warren |last3=Vleeming |first3=Andry |last4=De Caro |first4=Raffaele | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Connective Tissues |title=Functional Atlas of the Human Fascial System |pages=1–20 |year=2015 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-7020-4430-4.00001-4 | isbn=978-0-7020-4430-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of the ground substance vary depending on the tissue. Ground substance is primarily composed of water, [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs) such as [[hyaluronic acid]], [[heparan sulfate]], [[dermatan sulfate]], and [[chondroitin sulfate]], [[proteoglycans]] which GAGs are bound to, and [[glycoproteins]]. Components of the ground substance are secreted by [[fibroblasts]]. Usually it is not visible on slides, because it is lost during staining in the preparation process.&lt;ref name="urlConnective Tissue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm | title=Connective Tissue | work = Self Study Unit of the Basic Tissues | publisher = University of Ottawa |access-date=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107231710/http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm |archive-date=2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Link proteins such as [[vinculin]], [[spectrin]] and [[actomyosin]] stabilize the proteoglycans and organize elastic fibers in the ECM.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; Changes in the density of ground substance can allow collagen fibers to form aberrant cross-links.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; [[Loose connective tissue]] is characterized by few fibers and cells, and a relatively large amount of ground substance. [[Dense connective tissue]] has a smaller amount of ground substance compared to the fibrous material.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt;

== Research ==
Much of Jansen's oeuvre uses ''in silico'' methods to study receptor biology, drug design, and drug-protein interactions. An early study (2000) while she was employed at [[Chiron Corporation|Chiron]] looked at conformations of the anti-cancer treatment [[Paclitaxel|Taxol]] in nonpolar environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=James P.|last2=Nevins|first2=Neysa|last3=Cicero|first3=Daniel O.|last4=Jansen|first4=Johanna|date=February 2000|title=The Conformations of Taxol in Chloroform|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja9930115|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=en|volume=122|issue=4|pages=724–725|doi=10.1021/ja9930115|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 commentary for ''Future Medicinal Chemistry'', Jansen led a team of distinguished computational chemists in a call to action, namely that standardized data sets be used across the industry, and that sharing program code between groups at different companies and institutions should be mandated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansen|first=Johanna M|last2=Amaro|first2=Rommie E|last3=Cornell|first3=Wendy|last4=Tseng|first4=Y Jane|last5=Walters|first5=W Patrick|date=October 2012|title=Computational chemistry and drug discovery: a call to action|url=https://www.future-science.com/doi/pdf/10.4155/fmc.12.137|journal=Future Medicinal Chemistry|language=en|volume=4|issue=15|pages=1893–1896|doi=10.4155/fmc.12.137|issn=1756-8919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 open-access study in ''[[PLOS One|PLoS One]]'' related some of Novartis' work - spearheaded by Jansen - to study the oncogenic protein [[Ras oncogene|RAS]] through inhibitors that targeted its inactive conformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansen|first=Johanna M.|last2=Wartchow|first2=Charles|last3=Jahnke|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Fong|first4=Susan|last5=Tsang|first5=Tiffany|last6=Pfister|first6=Keith|last7=Zavorotinskaya|first7=Tatiana|last8=Bussiere|first8=Dirksen|last9=Cheng|first9=Jan Marie|date=2017-04-06|title=Inhibition of prenylated KRAS in a lipid environment|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174706|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=e0174706|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0174706|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5383040|pmid=28384226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article covers the '''History of Sulzer diesel engines''' from 1898 to 1997. Sulzer Brothers foundry was established in [[Winterthur]], Switzerland, in 1834 by  Johann Jakob Sulzer-Neuffert and his two sons, Johann Jakob and Salomon. Products included cast iron, firefighting pumps and textile machinery. Co-operation with [[Rudolf Diesel]] led to the construction of the first Sulzer [[diesel engine]] in 1898. In 2015, the [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer company]] lives on but it no longer manufactures diesel engines, having sold the diesel engine business to [[Wärtsilä]] in 1997. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sulzer.com/en/About-us/History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derbysulzers.com/sulzerengine.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Sulzer built diesel engines for stationary, road, rail and marine use. The engine types usually comprise a number, then some letters, then another number.  For example, 6LDA28 indicates a six-cylinder engine in the "LDA" series with a 28cm cylinder bore.

==Stationary==

Two cylinder engine at King Edward Mine, Camborne(http://kingedwardmine.co.uk/) original application unknown.

==Road==
In 1937, Sulzer introduced an [[opposed piston]] [[two-stroke  diesel engine]] for road use. This was similar to the [[Commer TS3]] but had a piston-type blower instead of a [[Roots blower]]. It was made in two sizes: 69mm bore x 101.6mm stroke or 89mm bore by 120mm stroke. The smaller version had two cylinders, produced 35 hp, and was intended for [[tractor]]s. The larger version was available with two, three or four cylinders and was intended for [[truck]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald H.|title=The Modern Diesel|edition=13th|year=1959|publisher=Iliffe &amp; Sons|location=London|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1690">'''Homoiohydry''' is the capacity of plants to regulate, or achieve [[homeostasis]] of, cell and  tissue water content. Homoiohydry evolved in land plants to a lesser or greater degree during their transition to land more than 500 million years ago, and is most highly developed in the [[vascular plants]].  It is the consequence of a suite of morphological innovations and strategies that enable plant shoots exploring aerial environments to conserve water by internalising the gas exchange surfaces, enclosing them in a waterproof membrane and providing a variable aperture control mechanism, the [[stoma]]tal guard cells, which regulate the rates of water transpiration and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange.  In vascular plants, water is acquired from the soil by roots and transported via the [[xylem]] to aerial portions of the plant. Water evaporation from the aerial surfaces of the plant is controlled by a waterproof covering of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]]. Gas exchange with the atmosphere is controlled by [[stoma]]ta, which can open and close to control water loss, and diffusion of [[carbon dioxide]] to the [[chloroplasts]] takes place in intercellular spaces between [[chlorenchyma]] cells in the [[Plant stem|stem]] or in the mesophyll tissue of the [[leaf]].&lt;ref name="Raven 1977"&gt;Raven, J.A. (1977) The evolution of vascular land plants in relation to supracellular transport processes. Advances in Botanical Research, 5, 153-219&lt;/ref&gt;

The antonym of homoiohydry is [[poikilohydry]], a condition in which plant water content is passively reduced or increased in equilibrium with environmental water status.

The '''International Physics and Culture Olympiad''' '''(IPhCO)''' is a [[physics]] and culture competition for high school students. In June 2016, the IPhCO beta version was held in [[Curitiba]], Brazil at the [[Instituto_Federal_do_Paraná|Federal Institute of Paraná]] (IFPR). The first IPhCO was held in April 2017.

== Problems ==
The problems are based on high school physics and mathematics, but indirectly works with other areas such as: Geography, History, Arts, Biology etc. The competition is online. There are 12 problems in total and the student has 24 hours to solve each problem. Always at midnight, a new problem is released. Enrolled students receive passwords that open the portals that give access to problems.

== Awards ==
The student can be awarded three times, according to the stages due. Each step is related to a number of problems solved successfully. The student can receive up to three postcards of Curitiba with the conquered key printed.

== Cultural exchange ==
An important goal of the Olympiad is to value culture, arousing young people's interest in the history of Brazil and other countries. To do so, the Olympics takes students on virtual walks in places where interesting events have occurred or are remembered, such as in museums, for example. With the objective of offering more visibility to the cultural spaces of Curitiba and the state of Paraná, the Olympiad began a mapping work of those spaces that were not yet in [[Street View]]. In collaboration with [[Google]], which provided equipment for photographing, this work began in October 2017.
== Headquarters ==
The main venue of the Olympiad is in Curitiba, Parana, where the Olympiad began in 2017. Other cities in Brazil and the world will gradually incorporate the network of collaboration and culture.

{{distinguish|Interculturalism}}
'''Intraculturalism''' is the study of behavior within one [[cultural group]]. For example, [[Value (personal and social)|value]] variations among Palestinians are intracultural. This is often part of [[Subaltern Studies]], [[development studies]] and [[sociology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">'''John Senex''' (1678, [[Ludlow, Shropshire]] – died 1740, London) was an [[English people|English]] [[cartographer]], [[engraver]] and [[explorer]].

He was also an [[astrologer]], [[geologist]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and [[geographer]] to Queen Anne of Great Britain,&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11745/ |title = The Historical Theater in the Year 400 AD, in Which Both Romans and Barbarians Resided Side by Side in the Eastern Part of the Roman Empire |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1725 |accessdate = 2013-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; editor and seller of antique maps and most importantly creator of the pocket-size map of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He owned a business on [[Fleet Street]], where he sold maps.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

==Importance==
[[File:1721 John Senex Map of Rome - Geographicus - Rome-sennex-1721.jpg|thumb|A map of Rome by John Senex (1721)]]
He was one of the principal cartographers of the 18th century.  He started his apprenticeship with [[Robert Clavell]], at the [[Stationers Company]], in 1692.  Senex is famous for his maps of the world, some of which have added elevations, and which feature minuscule detailed engravings.  Many of these maps can be found in museum collections; rarely, copies are available for private sale. Some copies are held in the National Maritime Museum; many of his maps are now in the possession of [[Trinity College Dublin]].  Having worked and collaborated with Charles Price, Senex created a series of engravings for the [[London Almanac]]s and in 1714 he published together with Maxwell an English Atlas.  In 1719 he published a miniature edition of ''Brittania'' by Ogilby. He became particularly interested in depicting California as an island instead of part of mainland North America, a trait which makes many of his maps appealing to collectors.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 1721 he published a new general atlas. He used the work of cartographer [[Guillaume de L’Isle]] as an influence.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

In 1728 Senex was elected into the Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of London]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">In [[Theory of relativity|special relativity]], '''light-cone coordinates''' is a special coordinate system where two of the coordinates, x&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and x&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are [[null (mathematics)|null]] coordinates and all the other coordinates are spatial. Call them &lt;math&gt;x_\perp&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume we are working with a (d,1) Lorentzian signature.

Instead of the standard coordinate system (using [[Einstein notation]])
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-dt^2+\delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;i,j=1,\dots,d&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-2dx^+dx^- + \delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j&lt;/math&gt; 
with &lt;math&gt;i,j=1,\dots,d-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^+=\frac{t+x}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^-=\frac{t-x}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Both x&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and x&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; can act as "time" coordinates.

One nice thing about light cone coordinates is that the causal structure is partially included into the coordinate system itself.

A boost in the tx plane shows up as &lt;math&gt;x^+ \to e^{+\beta}x^+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^- \to e^{-\beta}x^-&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^i \to x^i&lt;/math&gt;. A rotation in the ij-plane only affects &lt;math&gt;x_\perp&lt;/math&gt;. The parabolic transformations show up as &lt;math&gt;x^+ \to x^+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^- \to x^- + \delta_{ij}\alpha^i x^j + \frac{\alpha^2}{2} x^+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^i \to x^i + \alpha^i x^+&lt;/math&gt;. Another set of parabolic transformations show up as &lt;math&gt;x^+ \to x^+ + \delta_{ij}\alpha^i x^j + \frac{\alpha^2}{2} x^-&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^- \to x^-&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^i \to x^i + \alpha^i x^-&lt;/math&gt;.

Light cone coordinates can also be generalized to curved spacetime in general relativity. Sometimes calculations simplify using light cone coordinates. See [[Newman–Penrose formalism]].

Light cone coordinates are sometimes used to describe relativistic collisions, especially if the relative velocity is very close to the speed of light. They are also used in the [[light cone gauge]] of string theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12574">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Montana''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 10, 2011, there were 16 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One additional site has been proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  No sites have yet been removed from the list following clean up.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">The '''Multihundred-Watt radioisotope thermoelectric generators''' ('''MHW RTG''') is a type of US [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) developed for the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecrafts, ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]''.&lt;ref name=Heacock80&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.stickings90.webspace.virginmedia.com/voyager.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331162615/http://www.stickings90.webspace.virginmedia.com/voyager.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-31 |title=The Voyager Space Craft |journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers |volume=194 |pages=267–270 |year=1980 |author=Heacock }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MHW-RTGs.gif|right|thumb|Radioisotope thermoelectric generators for the Voyager program.]]

Each RTG had a total weight of 37.7&amp;nbsp;kg including about 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg of [[Plutonium-238|Pu-238]].&lt;ref name="GLB"&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/space/bennett0706.pdf "Space Nuclear Power"] G.L.Bennett 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres and provides enough heat to generate approximately 157 watts of electrical power initially - halving every 87.7 years.

Each RTG generated about 2400 Watts of thermal power.&lt;ref name="tose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totse.com/en/technology/space_astronomy_nasa/spacnuke.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619143130/http://www.totse.com/en/technology/space_astronomy_nasa/spacnuke.html |archivedate=2008-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversion of the decay heat of the plutonium to electrical power used 312 [[silicon-germanium]]
(SiGe) [[thermoelectric]] couples. The initial thermoelectric couple hot junction temperature was 1273 K (1000&amp;nbsp;°C, 1832&amp;nbsp;°F) with a cold junction temperature of 573 K (300&amp;nbsp;°C, 572&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="NuclearNews"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furlong |first1=Richard R. |last2=Wahlquist |first2=Earl J. |year=1999 |title=U.S. space missions using radioisotope power systems |journal=Nuclear News |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=26–34 |url=http://www2.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/pdfs/1999-4-2.pdf |accessdate=January 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft has 3 RTGs. Collectively, the RTGs supplied each Voyager spacecraft with 470 watts at launch.&lt;ref name="PDS-Host"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |title=VOYAGER 2:Host Information |year=1989 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050912/http://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voyager 2 Craft Details|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1977-076A|work=NASA-NSSDC-Spacecraft-Details|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MHW-RTGs were used on the [[Lincoln Experimental Satellite]]s 8 and 9.

Subsequent US spacecraft used the [[GPHS-RTG]] which used similar SiGe thermoelectic devices but a different packaging of the fuel.

The [[Multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator|MMRTG]] is a newer RTG type, used on the [[Curiosity rover]].

'''MISTRAM''' (''MISsile TRAjectory Measurement'') was a high-resolution [[tracking system]] used by the [[United States Air Force]] (and later [[NASA]]) to provide highly detailed [[trajectory]] analysis of [[rocket launch]]es.

A "classic" ranging system used since the 1960s uses [[radar]] to time a radio signal's travel to a target (in this case, the rocket) and back. This technique is accurate to approximately 1%. The accuracy of this technique is limited by the need to create a sharp "[[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]]" of radio so that the start of the signal can be accurately defined. There are both practical and theoretical limits to the sharpness of the pulse. In addition, the timing of the signals often introduced inaccuracies of its own until the introduction of high precision clocks.

In MISTRAM, this was avoided by broadcasting a continuous signal. The basic system used a ground station located down range from the launch site (at [[Valkaria, Florida]] and [[Eleuthera Island, Bahamas]]) and a [[transponder]] on the vehicle. The tracking station transmitted an X-band carrier signal which the transponder responded to by re-broadcasting it on another (shifted) frequency. By slowly changing the frequency of the carrier broadcast from the station and comparing this with the phase of the signal being returned, ground control could measure the distance to the vehicle very accurately. Even with the analog circuitry used, MISTRAM was accurate to less than 1&amp;nbsp;km at the distance of the moon.

[[Image:AFG-060829-002.jpg|thumb|right|US Air Force Eastern Test Range (Historical Map).]]
To meet more stringent [[ballistic missile]] test requirements, several systems were designed, procured and added to the US Air Force Eastern Range's instrumentation in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[AZUSA]] continuous wave tracking system was added to the Cape in the mid-1950s and Grand Bahama in the early 1960s. The [[AN/FPS-16]] radar system was introduced at the Cape, [[Grand Bahama]], [[San Salvador]], [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[East Grand Bahama]] Island between 1958 and 1961. In the early 1960s, the MISTRAM (Missile Trajectory Measurement) system was installed at [[Valkaria, Florida]] and [[Eleuthera]] island in the Bahamas to support [[Minuteman missile]] flights.

==Principles of operation==
[[Image:MISTRAM-layout.jpg|thumb|right|Five receiving stations on 10,000 ft and 100,000 ft baselines receive signals from missile, compute the velocity, position and trajectory.]]
MISTRAM is a sophisticated interferometer system consisting of a group of five receiving stations arranged in an L shape. Baselines are {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. and {{convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The central stations contains a simple tracking antenna. The distance from the central station to the furthest remote station is approximately {{convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Antennas at the central station and the four remote stations follow the flight of a missile and receive signals from its radio beacon.

In the MISTRAM system, the ground station transmits a carrier to the spacecraft and the spacecraft returns this carrier on another frequency. The ground station sweeps the uplink carrier and the phase shift of the downlink carrier is measured (counted) while it is being swept. The round trip delay time can be shown to be T=(delta-phi)/(delta-f) ; where delta-f is the frequency shift (~4000&amp;nbsp;Hz for example) and delta-phi the measured phase shift in radians. Suppose T=2 sec (~lunar distance) then delta-phi=8000 radians, i.e. (8000*180)/Pi. Assume also that the phase can be measured with an accuracy of 1 deg, i.e. means that the range can be determined with a precision of (600000*1*Pi)/(2*8000*180)=0.33&amp;nbsp;km. An additional carrier quite near the one described above that remained fixed in frequency and used as a phase reference. That carrier and the two frequencies (that the sweep changed between) were generated as multiples of the same basic oscillator frequency. In this way, all signals would have a fixed phase relationship, as was done in MISTRAM. A similar technique was used in the Soviet Luna 20 spacecraft at 183.54&amp;nbsp;MHz to survey the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception of signals on 183.54 MHz from the Luna 20 return spacecraft in Stockholm|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/luna20/LUNA20.htm|author=Sven Grahn|location=Sollentuna, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MISTRAM was a multistatic long baseline radar interferometer developed for precision measurements of missile trajectories at the US Air Force Eastern Test Range. Multistatic radar systems have a higher complexity with multiple transmitter and receiver subsystems employed in a coordinated manner at more than two sites. All of the geographically dispersed units contribute to the collective target acquisition, detection, position finding and resolution, with simultaneous reception at the receiver sites. In a simpler sense, multistatic radars are systems which have two or more receiving sites with a common spatial coverage area, and data from these coverage areas are combined and processed at a central location. These systems are considered to be multiple bistatic pairs. Multistatic radar systems have various uses, including prevention of jamming and anti-radar munitions.

Although this method of measurement is not new, either in theory or in practice, the unique manner in which the techniques were implemented in the MISTRAM system permit measurement of vehicle flight parameters with a degree of precision and accuracy not previously obtainable in other long baseline trajectory measurement systems. To a large extent, this was accomplished by a unique method of transferring intact the phase information in the signals from outlying stations to the central station. A two-way transmission path on each baseline was used to cancel out uncertainties due to variance in ground geometry and temperature.&lt;ref name="astronautics"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R.A. Heartz  |author2=T.H. Jones |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mistram and rendezvous|journal=Astronautics|volume=7|date=July 1962|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MISTRAM-diagram.jpg|thumb|right|MISTRAM block diagram shows ground-based components and airborne transponder.]]
The transmitter at the master or central station generates two CW X-band frequencies, nominally 8148&amp;nbsp;MHz and 7884 to 7892&amp;nbsp;MHz. The higher frequency (the range signal) is very stable, whereas the lower frequency (the calibrated signal) is swept periodically over the indicated range. The airborne transponder receives the signals, amplifies &amp; frequency shifts them by 68&amp;nbsp;MHz, and retransmits back to earth. The Doppler shift is used to determine velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jerome Hoffman|title=Relativistic and classical Doppler electronic tracking accuracies|journal=Journal of Spacecraft|volume=2|issue=1|date=Jan–Feb 1965|pages=55–61|doi=10.2514/3.28121|bibcode=1965JSpRo...2...55H|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0409906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MISTRAM transponder==
[[Image:MISTRAM-transponder.jpg|thumb|MISTRAM "A" Model Transponder]]
The Transponder receives the two phase-coherent X-band cw signals transmitted from the ground equipment. A klystron with a 68&amp;nbsp;MHz coherent frequency offset is phase locked to each of the received signals. These klystrons provide the phase coherent return transmission. There are two separate phase locked loops, continuous and calibrate.

==M-236 computer==
The General Electric M236 computer was developed to support MISTRAM and other large military radar projects in the 1960s. (According to Dr. Neelands, certain military people involved in the project were adamant about not relying on "computers", therefore this "information processor" was developed.) This high speed 36-bit minicomputer was developed by the GE Heavy Military Electronics Department (HMED) in [[Syracuse, New York]], eventually leading to the [[GE-600 series]] of mainframe computers. The M236 was designed for real-time processing in a radar-based missile flight measurement system and lacked some general purpose features, such as overlapped instruction processing, the floating point operations needed for [[Fortran]], and operating system support features, such as [[base and bounds]] registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jane King  |author2=William A. Shelly |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A family history of Honeywell's large-scale computer systems|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=19|issue=4|year=1997|pages=42–46|doi=10.1109/85.627898}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M-236 computer was developed for the US Air Force Cape Canaveral Missile Range, and installed it at [[Eleuthera]] (Bahamas). The [[36-bit]] computer [[Word (data type)|word length]] was needed for radar tracking computations and for the required exchange of data with an [[IBM 7094]] located at the Cape. The chief architect of the M-236 was [[John Couleur]] who will become later a technical leader of the GE large computer systems.

The debate in favor or against subsequent development of an M236-derived general purpose computer took more than one year and concluded finally with the victory of the M2360 project proponents in February 1963. The GE upper management was impressed by the opportunity to save the rental fees from IBM leased equipment used internally by GE (the cost of development of the new project was estimated to be offset by only one year of rentals). The other GE departments were not very impressed and were reluctant to jettison their IBM machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean Bellec (FEB) |title=From GECOS to GCOS8 - A History of Large Systems in GE, Honeywell, NEC and Bull |url=http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/english/gecos_to_gcos8_part_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709213845/http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/english/gecos_to_gcos8_part_1.htm |archivedate=2010-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GE-600 series was developed by a team led by John Couleur based on work done for the MISTRAM project in 1959. MISTRAM was a missile tracking system that was used on a number of projects (including Project Apollo) and the Air Force required a data-collection computer to be installed in a tracking station downrange from Cape Canaveral. The data would eventually be shared with the 36-bit IBM 7094 machine at the Cape, so the computer would likely have to be 36-bits as well (why they didn't use an IBM 7094 is something of a mystery). GE built a machine called the M236 for the task, and as a result of the 36-bit needs, it ended up acting a lot like the 7094.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Couleur|title=The Core of the Black Canyon Computer Corporation|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=17|issue=4|pages=56–60|date=Winter 1995|doi=10.1109/85.477436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GE Heavy Military Electronics Department in Syracuse designed and built a tracking system for the ATLAS missile system named MISTRAM that was in fact an advanced computer system. This was quite in accordance with Cordiner's directions since it would not develop a line of machines that be placed on the open market in competition with IBM. (Ralph J. Cordiner was Chairman &amp; CEO of General Electric from 1958 to 1963.) This project also had the advantage that the up front development expenditures were to be paid by the U.S. government rather than GE, an arrangement much more satisfactory to GE's 570 "bean counters." These circumstances brought about the possibility of duplicating the MISTRAM opportunity for the computer department. Much later, the result was an order for 32 computer department machines. However, the MISTRAM computer was the first in a line of developments by John Couleur that led to what may be regarded as the most successful and long-lasting machine - the GE 600 line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.A.N. Lee|title=The Rise and Fall of the General Electric Corporation Computer Department|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=17|issue=4|pages=24–45|date=Winter 1995|doi=10.1109/85.477434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
MISTRAM was used in the development and testing of intertial guidance system for the Minuteman ballistic missile, and subsequently was used for testing the Gemini spacecraft and the Saturn V launch system. With the decommissioning of the MISTRAM X-band interferometer at the Air Force Eastern Test Range in 1971, the flight-test community did not have a conventional ground-based range-instrumentation system better than, or comparable to, the inertial guidance systems whose performance was being assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thomas P. Nosek|title=Space Shuttle as a Dynamic Test Tool for Missile Guidance Systems|journal=J. Guidance|volume=6|issue=6|pages=530 ff|year=1982|doi=10.2514/3.8534}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was true in the intervening years preceding GPS development and deployment.

==Minuteman Inertial Guidance System testing==
The first Minuteman missiles (MM I) were launched in the early 1960s from the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR) and were tracked with the AZUSA CW tracking system. The comparatively low quality of the AZUSA tracking data, combined with the rudimentary stage of evaluation techniques, allowed only estimation of the total error; no isolation of individual inertial measurement unit (IMU) error sources was possible.&lt;ref name="aiaa"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=R. Fuessel |author2=J. McGhee |author3=R. Powers |author4=D. Sifter  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A method for determining the performance of a precision inertial guidance system|booktitle=AIAA Guidance and Control Conference, August 6–8, 1979, Boulder, Colorado. AIAA Paper No. 1979-1891|pages=637–644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent development of improved tracking systems, UDOP and MISTRAM, at AFETR yielded much higher quality velocity tracking profiles. During the Minuteman II flight test program, significant improvements were made in the post-flight evaluation of the IMU accuracy. The most important of these improvement was the introduction of maximum likelihood error estimation using the Kalman algorithm to filter the velocity error profile. Continued improvement of the UDOP and MISTRAM tracking systems and refinement of the evaluation techniques during the Minuteman III flight test program made it possible to gain considerable insight into NS-20A1 IMU error sources.&lt;ref name="aiaa"/&gt;

===Accuracy evaluation===
One of the major problems in trajectory and orbital estimation is to obtain a realistic estimate of the accuracy of the trajectory and other important parameters. In the orbital case, some of the parameters which may not be solved for are geopotential constants, survey, etc. These factors will affect the total uncertainty in the orbit and, of course, ephemeris predictions. A statistical technique was developed that performs a variance-covariance propagation to obtain accuracy estimates based on random and unmodeled errors. An example of the unmodeled error propagation in the MISTRAM system was given for the Geos B satellite.&lt;ref name="technometrics"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norman Bush|title=Unmodeled Error Analysis on Trajectory and Orbital Estimation|journal=Technometrics|volume=13|issue=2|date=May 1971|pages=303–314|doi=10.2307/1266792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key personnel==
Dr. Lewis J. Neelands has been called an engineers' engineer by the people who worked with him when he was with the General Electric Corporation Electronics Laboratory and Heavy Military Electronics Department (HMED) in the 1950s and early 60's. His contributions to missile guidance and telemetry made him a key figure in the Altas Guidance and MISTRAM programs, two of HMED's most challenging and successful efforts.&lt;ref name="neelands"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Neelands|title=Dr. Lewis J. Neelands biography on 100th anniversary of General Electric Co|url=http://user.gru.net/nemesis/dadbio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Neelands said he did not get his greatest satisfaction from his work on the Atlas guidance (about which he said,"it was successful because of a bunch of other people who put it together and made it work"). It is MISTRAM, missile tracking and measuring system, that he remembers with greater pride. "Nothing could match it at the time for the complexity and precision it required," he recalls of the real-time measuring system for precisely tracking a missile's flight. One of his colleagues remembers, "In 1960 he solved the elusive problem of trajectory measurement -- of bringing together at one place for processing, the signals received from widely spaced receiving stations while overcoming inaccuracies due to the propagation anomalies in the medium connecting the stations. A related problem that Lew solved was how to do this using frequencies sufficiently high to develop the required angular measurement accuracy without measurement ambiguities and without requiring a large number of receiving stations to resolve these ambiguities." He conceived a system of unprecedented accuracy.&lt;ref name="technometrics"/&gt; The technical work on the Hermes A-3 rocket guidance was headed by Dr. Lewis J. Neelands and resulted in a successful system with the know-how later transferred to another ICBM guidance system known as the 8014 project and also to the highly accurate Mistram instrumentation equipment, all were based on use of a microwave interferometer.&lt;ref name="neelands"/&gt;  Dr. Neelands died at his home in Gainesville Florida on July 17, 2007, at the age of 91.

In a multiplex assay, microspheres of designated colors are coated with a specific antibodies. The results can be read by [[flow cytometry]] because the beads are distinguishable by fluorescent signature. The number of analytes measured is determined by the number of different bead colors.&lt;ref name="leng"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leng |first1=SX |last2=McElhaney |first2=JE |last3=Walston |first3=JD |last4=Xie |first4=D |last5=Fedarko |first5=NS |last6=Kuchel |first6=GA |title=ELISA and multiplex technologies for cytokine measurement in inflammation and aging research. |journal=The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |date=August 2008 |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=879–84 |pmid=18772478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiplex assays within a given application area or class of technology can be further stratified based on how many analytes can be measured per assay, where "multiplex" refers to those with the highest number of analyte measurements per assay (up to millions) and "low-plex" or "mid-plex" refers to procedures that process fewer (10s to 1000s), though there are no formal guidelines for calling a procedure multi-, mid-, or low-plex based on number of analytes measured.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Single-analyte assays or low-to-mid-plex procedures typically predate the rise of their multiplex versions, which often require specialized technologies or miniaturization to achieve a higher degree of parallelization.

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Crosstie}}

'''Operation Crosstie'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of 48 [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the United States in 1967&amp;ndash;1968 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. These tests followed the ''[[Operation Latchkey]]'' series and preceded the ''[[Operation Bowline]]'' series.

==Gasbuggy==
{{main|Gasbuggy}}
The blast designated '''[[Gasbuggy]]''' involved an underground detonation, intended to stimulate production of [[natural gas]] by cracking the rock in the underground formation of its deposit. The test proceeded as expected, but not only did the production not increase as much as expected, but the customers also refused to buy gas contaminated with traces of radioisotopes.

==Buggy==
'''Buggy''' was a [[Operation Plowshare|Plowshare]] test designed to excavate a channel.  It was a simultaneous detonation of 5 devices, placed {{convert|150|ft|m}} apart and {{convert|150|ft|m}} below the surface that resulted in a

900 feet long, and {{convert|80|ft|m}} deep

The [[USSR]] conducted a similar [[salvo]]-test to investigate the use of nuclear explosions in the construction of the [[Pechora–Kama Canal]] project.  On March 23, 1971, three simultaneously detonated 15 kiloton underground nuclear charges were exploded in the [[Pechora–Kama Canal|Taiga test]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonicbomb.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=241 The Soviet '''Taiga''' PNE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faultless==
The '''Faultless''' test was a calibration test conducted in a mine cavity 3,200 feet beneath the Hot Creek Valley near [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]], Nevada, with a yield of around 1 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]]. This test was conducted to see if the land was fit for testing a 5 megaton thermonuclear warhead for the [[LIM-49 Spartan|Spartan missile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-hometown-nuke28-2009jun28,0,1389110.story latimes]&lt;/ref&gt; The test failed because of the large degree of faulting that resulted in the area around the test. It was decided that the land was unfit for multi-megaton nuclear tests, so a similar calibration test was conducted at [[Amchitka Island]], [[Alaska]], in the fall of 1969 during [[Operation Mandrel]].

The 7.4 foot diameter steel pipe that was used to place the bomb remains at the test site. The top of the pipe was originally flush with the surface, however, the ground sunk by nine feet following the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rachel-nevada.com/places/faultless.html&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque is mounted on the exposed pipe to commemorate the event.

==Table of detonations==
The '''United States's Crosstie nuclear test series''' was a group of 48 [[nuclear test]]s conducted in 1967-1968. These tests &lt;ref group=note&gt;A bomb test may be a salvo test, defined as two or more explosions "where a period of time between successive individual explosions does not exceed 5 seconds and where the burial points of all explosive devices can be connected by segments of straight lines, each of them connecting two burial points and does not exceed 40 kilometers in length". {{cite paper|first=V.

 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear weapons|Device]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Designations for test items where known, "?" indicates some uncertainty about the preceding value, nicknames for particular devices in quotes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6395">The '''Ortega hypothesis''' holds that average or mediocre [[scientists]] contribute substantially to the advancement of [[science]].&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;

== Citation research ==
The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; but a number of systematic studies of scientific [[citations]] have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after [[Isaac Newton]]'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").&lt;ref name=Hess/&gt; The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt; The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and criminology.&lt;ref name=Oromaner/&gt;

The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.&lt;ref name=MacRoberts/&gt; Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.&lt;ref name=Kretschmer/&gt; Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.&lt;ref name=Hoerman/&gt; Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;&lt;ref name=eponym/&gt; Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.&lt;ref name=Goudsmit/&gt;

== The name ==
The name of the hypothesis refers to [[José Ortega y Gasset]], who wrote in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.&lt;ref name=Ortega/&gt; Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific [[geniuses]] create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that [[Albert Einstein]] drew upon the ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Ernst Mach]] to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.&lt;ref name=Szava/&gt;

Under the project management of John Lee, the team at Synnex, Voltaire, [[Supermicro]] and other suppliers, the scientists were able to dramatically reduce the amount of time it took to go from starting the cluster build to actually having hardware here at Livermore in production. In particular, it went from having 4 SUs on the floor on a Thursday, to bring 2 more SUs in for that final cluster and by Saturday, had all of them wired up, burned in, and running Linpack.

==Activities==
The Science and Technology Facilities Council is one of Europe's largest multidisciplinary research organisations supporting scientists and engineers worldwide.  Through research fellowships and grants, it is responsible for funding research in UK universities, in the fields of [[astronomy]], [[particle physics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[space science]].  STFC operates its own world-class, large-scale research facilities (such as materials research, laser and space science and alternative energy exploration) and provides strategic advice to the UK government on their development. It manages international research projects in support of a broad cross-section of the UK research community and directs, coordinates and funds research, education and training. It is a partner in the [[UK Space Agency]] (formerly [[British National Space Centre]] or BNSC) providing about 40% of the UK government's expenditure in space science and technology.

== Facilities ==
It helps operate/provide access for UK and international scientists to the following large-scale facilities:
* [[Central Laser Facility]] (CLF) at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]]
* [[CERN]]
* [[DiRAC]] Distributed Research using Advanced Computing ([[Supercomputer|Supercomputing facility]])
* The space science and space exploration programmes of [[ESA]]

== Budget ==
STFC’s budget is allocated annually by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills.]]

For 2015-16 STFC’s budget allocation was £529 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278326/bis-14-p200-science-and-research-budget-allocations-for-2015-to-2016.pdf|title = Science and research budget allocations for financial year 15/16, Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|date = September 2014|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = Gov.UK|publisher = www.gov.uk|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knowledge exchange obligations ==
STFC is active in its responsibility for [[knowledge exchange]] from government funded civil science into UKPLC. As such, many technologies are licensed to UK companies and spin-out companies created including:

* L3 Technology (L3T);
* Microvisk;
* Orbital Optics Ltd;
* [[Oxsensis]];
* PETRRA;
* [[Quantum Detectors]];

[[File:Stefan Boltzmann 001.svg|thumb|Graph of a function of total emitted energy of a black body &lt;math&gt;j^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; proportional to its thermodynamic temperature &lt;math&gt;T\,&lt;/math&gt;. In blue is a total energy according to the [[Wien approximation]], &lt;math&gt; j^{\star}_{W} = j^{\star} / \zeta(4) \approx 0.924 \, \sigma T^{4} \!\, &lt;/math&gt;]]

The '''Stefan–Boltzmann law''' describes the power radiated from a [[black body]] in terms of its [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]].  Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total [[energy]] radiated per unit [[area|surface area]] of a [[black body]] across [[Black body radiation#Spectrum|all wavelengths]] per unit [[time]] &lt;math&gt; j^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; (also known as the black-body ''[[radiant emittance]]'') is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the fourth power of the black body's [[thermodynamic temperature]] ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt; j^{\star} = \sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[constant of proportionality]] ''σ'', called the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], is derived from other known [[physical constant]]s.  The value of the constant is

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma=\frac{2\pi^5 k^4}{15c^2h^3}= 5.670373 \times 10^{-8}\, \mathrm{W\, m^{-2}K^{-4}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], and ''c'' is [[speed of light|the speed of light in a vacuum]]. The [[radiance]] (watts per square metre per [[steradian]]) is given by

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{j^{\star}}\pi = \frac\sigma\pi T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

A body that does not absorb all incident radiation (sometimes known as a grey body) emits less total energy than a black body and is characterized by an [[emissivity]], &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; j^{\star} = \varepsilon\sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

The radiant emittance &lt;math&gt; j^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; has [[dimensional analysis#Definition|dimensions]] of [[energy flux]] (energy per time per area), and the [[SI units]] of measure are [[joule]]s per second per square metre, or equivalently, [[watt]]s per square metre. The SI unit for absolute temperature ''T'' is the [[kelvin]].  ''&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[emissivity]] of the grey body; if it is a perfect blackbody, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=1&lt;/math&gt;. In the still more general (and realistic) case, the emissivity depends on the wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;.

To find the total [[Power (physics)|power]] radiated from an object, multiply by its surface area, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; P= A j^{\star} = A \varepsilon\sigma T^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==
The law was deduced by [[Josef Stefan]] (1835–1893) in 1879 on the basis of experimental measurements made by [[John Tyndall]]&lt;ref&gt;Stefan stated (Stefan, 1879), p. 421:  ''"Zuerst will ich hier die Bemerkung anführen, … die Wärmestrahlung der vierten Potenz der absoluten Temperatur proportional anzunehmen."'' (First of all, I want to point out here the observation which Wüllner, in his textbook, added to the report of Tyndall's experiments on the radiation of a platinum wire that was brought to glowing by an electric current, because this observation first caused me to suppose that thermal radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.)&lt;br&gt;
In 1864, Irish physicist John Tyndall presented measurements of the infrared emission by a platinum filament and the corresponding color of the filament:
*  {{cite journal|last1=Tyndall|first1=John|title=On luminous [i.e., visible] and obscure [i.e., infrared] radiation|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1864|volume=28|pages=329–341|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000614117o;view=1up;seq=357|series=4th series}} ; see p. 333.
In his physics textbook of 1875, [[Adolf Wüllner|Adolph Wüllner]] quoted Tyndall's results and then added estimates of the temperature that corresponded to the platinum filament's color:
*  {{cite book|last1=Wüllner|first1=Adolph|title=Lehrbuch der Experimentalphysik|trans-title=Textbook of experimental physics|volume=vol. 3|date=1875|publisher=B.G. Teubner|location=Leipzig, Germany|page=215|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4062759;view=1up;seq=231|language=German}}
From (Wüllner, 1875), p. 215:  ''"Wie aus gleich zu besprechenden Versuchen von Draper hervorgeht, … also fast um das 12fache zu."'' (As follows from the experiments of Draper, which will be discussed shortly, a temperature of about 525°[C] corresponds to the weak red glow; a [temperature] of about 1200°[C], to the full white glow.  Thus, while the temperature climbed only somewhat more than double, the intensity of the radiation increased from 10.4 to 122 ; thus, almost 12-fold.)&lt;br&gt;

The law is highly accurate only for ideal black objects, the perfect radiators, called [[black body|black bodies]]; it works as a good approximation for most "grey" bodies. Stefan published this law in the article ''Über die Beziehung zwischen der Wärmestrahlung und der Temperatur'' (''On the relationship between thermal radiation and temperature'') in the ''Bulletins from the sessions'' of the Vienna Academy of Sciences.

With his law Stefan also determined the temperature of the [[Sun]]'s surface.&lt;ref&gt;(Stefan, 1879), pp. 426–427.&lt;/ref&gt; He inferred from the data of [[Jacques-Louis Soret]] (1827&amp;ndash;1890)&lt;ref&gt;Soret, J.L. (1872) "Comparaison des intensités calorifiques du rayonnement solaire et du rayonnement d'un corps chauffé à la lampe oxyhydrique" [Comparison of the heat intensities of solar radiation and of radiation from a body heated with an oxy-hydrogen torch], ''Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles'' (Geneva, Switzerland), 2nd series, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048214449;view=1up;seq=684 '''44''':  220–229] ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048214449;view=1up;seq=1094 '''45''': 252–256.]&lt;/ref&gt; that the energy flux density from the Sun is 29 times greater than the energy flux density of a certain warmed metal [[Lamella (materials)|lamella]] (a thin plate). A round lamella was placed at such a distance from the measuring device that it would be seen at the same angle as the Sun. Soret estimated the temperature of the lamella to be approximately 1900 [[Celsius|°C]] to 2000&amp;nbsp;°C. Stefan surmised that ⅓ of the energy flux from the Sun is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], so he took for the correct Sun's energy flux a value 3/2 times greater than Soret's value, namely 29 &amp;times; 3/2 = 43.5.

Precise measurements of atmospheric [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] were not made until 1888 and 1904. The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950&amp;nbsp;°C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200&amp;nbsp;K. As 2.57&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430&amp;nbsp;°C or 5700&amp;nbsp;K (the modern value is 5778&amp;nbsp;K&lt;ref&gt;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html&lt;/ref&gt;). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800&amp;nbsp;°C to as high as 13,000,000&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waterston|first1=John James|title=An account of observations on solar radiation|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1862|volume=23|pages=497–511|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA497#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|series=4th series}} On p. 505, the Scottish physicist [[John James Waterston]] estimated that the temperature of the sun's surface could be 12,880,000°.&lt;/ref&gt; were claimed. The lower value of 1800&amp;nbsp;°C was determined by [[Claude Pouillet]] (1790–1868) in 1838 using the [[Dulong–Petit law]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

(1846) ''Scientific Memoirs, Selected from the Transactions of Foreign Academies of Science and Learned Societies, and from Foreign Journals.'' vol. 4. London, England:  Richard and John E. Taylor. pp. 44–90 ; see pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Pouillet also took just half the value of the Sun's correct energy flux.

=== Temperature of stars ===

The temperature of [[star]]s other than the Sun can be approximated using a similar means by treating the emitted energy as a [[black body]] radiation.&lt;ref name="luminosity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/photometry_luminosity.html |title=Luminosity of Stars |publisher=Australian Telescope Outreach and Education |accessdate=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So:

: &lt;math&gt;L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma {T_e}^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the [[luminosity]], ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], ''R'' is the stellar radius and ''T'' is the [[effective temperature]]. This same formula can be used to compute the approximate radius of a main sequence star relative to the sun:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{R}{R_\odot} \approx \left ( \frac{T_\odot}{T} \right )^{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L}{L_\odot}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar radius]], &lt;math&gt;L_\odot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar luminosity]], and so forth.

With the Stefan–Boltzmann law, [[astronomer]]s can easily infer the radii of stars. The law is also met in the [[Black hole thermodynamics|thermodynamics]] of [[black hole]]s in so-called [[Hawking radiation]].

=== Effective temperature of the Earth ===

Similarly we can calculate the [[effective temperature]] of the Earth ''T''&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; by equating the energy received from the Sun and the energy radiated by the Earth, under the black-body approximation (Earth's own production of energy being small enough to be negligible).  The luminosity of the Sun, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
L_\odot = 4\pi R_\odot^2 \sigma T_\odot^4
&lt;/math&gt;

At Earth, this energy is passing through a sphere with a radius of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and the [[irradiance]] (received power per unit area) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
E_\oplus = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi a_0^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Earth has a radius of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;, and therefore has a cross-section of &lt;math&gt;\pi R_\oplus^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[radiant flux]] (i.e. solar power) absorbed by the Earth is thus given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_\text{abs} = \pi R_\oplus^2 \times E_\oplus
:&lt;/math&gt;

Because the Stefan–Boltzmann law uses a fourth power, it has stabilizing effect on the exchange and the flux emitted by Earth tends to be equal the flux absorbed, close to the steady state where:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
4\pi R_\oplus^2 \sigma T_\oplus^4 &amp;= \pi R_\oplus^2 \times E_\oplus \\
 &amp;= \pi R_\oplus^2 \times \frac{4\pi R_\odot^2\sigma T_\odot^4}{4\pi a_0^2} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

''T''&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; can then be found:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T_\oplus^4 &amp;= \frac{R_\odot^2 T_\odot^4}{4 a_0^2} \\
T_\oplus &amp;= T_\odot \times \sqrt\frac{R_\odot}{2 a_0} \\
&amp; = 5780 \; {\rm K} \times \sqrt{696 \times 10^{6} \; {\rm m} \over 2 \times 149.598 \times 10^{9} \; {\rm m} } \\
&amp; \approx 279 \; {\rm K}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the Sun, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; the radius of the Sun, and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This gives an effective temperature of 6&amp;nbsp;°C on the surface of the Earth, assuming that it perfectly absorbs all emission falling on it and has no atmosphere.

The Earth has an [[albedo]] of 0.3, meaning that 30% of the solar radiation that hits the planet gets scattered back into space without absorption.  The effect of albedo on temperature can be approximated by assuming that the energy absorbed is multiplied by 0.7, but that the planet still radiates as a black body (the latter by definition of [[effective temperature]], which is what we are calculating).  This approximation reduces the temperature by a factor of 0.7&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt;, giving 255&amp;nbsp;K (&amp;minus;18&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name= "IPCC4_ch01"&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Chapter 1: Historical overview of climate change science] page 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/radiation/ Solar Radiation and the Earth's Energy Balance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above temperature is Earth's as seen from space, not ground temperature but an average over all emitting bodies of Earth from surface to high altitude. Because of [[greenhouse effect]], the Earth's actual average surface temperature is about 288&amp;nbsp;K (15&amp;nbsp;°C), which is higher than the 255&amp;nbsp;K effective temperature, and even higher than the 279&amp;nbsp;K temperature that a black body would have.

In the above discussion, we have assumed that the whole surface of the earth is at one temperature. Another interesting question is to ask what the temperature of a blackbody surface on the earth would be assuming that it reaches equilibrium with the sunlight falling on it. This of course depends on the angle of the sun on the surface and on how much air the sunlight has gone through. When the sun is at the zenith and the surface is horizontal, the irradiance can be as high as 1120&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Solar constant at ground level"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Solar Radiation|url= http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|publisher= Newport Corporation|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029234117/http://www.newport.com/Introduction-to-Solar-Radiation/411919/1033/content.aspx|archivedate=Oct 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stefan–Boltzmann law then gives a temperature of

:&lt;math&gt;T=\left(\frac{1120\text{ W/m}^2}\sigma\right)^{1/4}\approx 375\text{ K}&lt;/math&gt;

or 102&amp;nbsp;°C. (Above the atmosphere, the result is even higher: 394 K.) We can think of the earth's surface as "trying" to reach equilibrium temperature during the day, but being cooled by the atmosphere, and "trying" to reach equilibrium with starlight and possibly moonlight at night, but being warmed by the atmosphere.

== Origination ==

=== Thermodynamic derivation of the energy density ===

The fact that the [[energy density]] of the box containing radiation is proportional to &lt;math&gt;T^{4}&lt;/math&gt; can be derived using thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kknizhni/StatMech/Derivation_of_Stefan_Boltzmann_Law.pdf|title=Derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law|last=Knizhnik|first=Kalman|date=|website=Johns Hopkins University - Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304133636/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kknizhni/StatMech/Derivation_of_Stefan_Boltzmann_Law.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Wisniak, 2002), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt; This derivation uses the relation between the [[radiation pressure]] ''p'' and the [[internal energy]] density &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, a relation that [[Radiation_pressure#Compression_in_a_uniform_radiation_field|can be shown]] using the form of the [[electromagnetic stress–energy tensor]]. This relation is:

: &lt;math&gt; p = \frac{u}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, from the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]]

: &lt;math&gt; dU = T \, dS - p \, dV, &lt;/math&gt;

we obtain the following expression, after dividing by &lt;math&gt; dV &lt;/math&gt; and fixing &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; :

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T = T \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T - p = T \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_V - p. &lt;/math&gt;

The last equality comes from the following [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell relation]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_V. &lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of energy density it follows that

: &lt;math&gt; U = u V &lt;/math&gt;

where the energy density of radiation only depends on the temperature, therefore

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T = u \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial V}\right)_T = u. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, the equality

: &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T = T \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_V - p, &lt;/math&gt;

after substitution of &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; for the corresponding expressions, can be written as

: &lt;math&gt; u = \frac{T}{3} \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_V - \frac{u}{3}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the partial derivative &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_V &lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a relationship between only &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; (if one isolates it on one side of the equality), the partial derivative can be replaced by the ordinary derivative. After separating the differentials the equality becomes

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{du}{4u} = \frac{dT}{T}, &lt;/math&gt;

which leads immediately to &lt;math&gt; u = A T^4 &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; as some constant of integration.

=== Derivation from Planck's law ===
[[File:Stephan-boltz law.jpg|thumb|Deriving the Stefan–Boltzmann Law using the [[Planck's law]].]]
The law can be derived by considering a small flat [[black body]] surface radiating out into a half-sphere. This derivation uses [[spherical coordinates]], with ''θ'' as the zenith angle and ''φ'' as the azimuthal angle; and the small flat blackbody surface lies on the xy-plane, where ''θ'' = &lt;sup&gt;{{pi}}&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The intensity of the light emitted from the blackbody surface is given by [[Planck's law]] :

::&lt;math&gt;I(\nu,T) =\frac{2 h\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{ e^{h\nu/(kT)}-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:*&lt;math&gt;I(\nu,T)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of [[Power (physics)|power]] per unit [[surface area]] per unit [[solid angle]] per unit [[frequency]] emitted at a frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu \,&lt;/math&gt; by a black body at temperature ''T''.
:*&lt;math&gt;h \,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]
:*&lt;math&gt;c \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and
:*&lt;math&gt;k \,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

The quantity &lt;math&gt;I(\nu,T) ~A ~d\nu ~d\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Power (physics)|power]] radiated by a surface of area A through a [[solid angle]] ''dΩ'' in the frequency range between ''ν'' and ''ν''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dν''.

The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the power emitted per unit area of the emitting body,
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{A} = \int_0^\infty I(\nu,T) \, d\nu \int cos \theta \, d\Omega \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- Linked from [[Radiance#Description]]: --&gt;
{{anchor|Integration of intensity derivation}}
Note that the cosine appears because black bodies are ''Lambertian'' (i.e. they obey [[Lambert's cosine law]]), meaning that the intensity observed along the sphere will be the actual intensity times the cosine of the zenith angle.
To derive the Stefan–Boltzmann law, we must integrate ''dΩ'' = sin(''θ'') ''dθ dφ'' over the half-sphere and integrate ''ν'' from 0 to ∞. 

:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{P}{A} &amp; = \int_0^\infty I(\nu,T) \, d\nu \int_0^{2\pi} \, d\varphi \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\theta  \\
&amp; = \pi \int_0^\infty I(\nu,T) \, d\nu
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then we plug in for ''I'':

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{A} = \frac{2 \pi h}{c^2} \int_0^\infty \frac{\nu^3}{ e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1} \, d\nu &lt;/math&gt;

To evaluate this integral, do a substitution,

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u &amp; = \frac{h \nu}{k T} \\[6pt]
du &amp; = \frac{h}{k T} \, d\nu
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which gives:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{A} = \frac{2 \pi h }{c^2} \left(\frac{k T}{h} \right)^4 \int_0^\infty \frac{u^3}{ e^u - 1} \, du.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral on the right is standard and goes by many names: it is a particular case of a [[Bose–Einstein integral]], or the [[Riemann zeta function]], &lt;math&gt; \zeta(4) &lt;/math&gt;, or the [[polylogarithm]]. The value of the integral is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi^4}{15} &lt;/math&gt;, giving the result that, for a perfect blackbody surface:

: &lt;math&gt;j^\star =  \sigma T^4 ~, ~~ \sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 k^4 }{15 c^2 h^3} = \frac{\pi^2 k^4}{60 \hbar^3 c^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, this proof started out only considering a small flat surface. However, any [[Differentiable manifold|differentiable]] surface can be approximated by a collection of small flat surfaces. So long as the geometry of the surface does not cause the blackbody to reabsorb its own radiation, the total energy radiated is just the sum of the energies radiated by each surface; and the total surface area is just the sum of the areas of each surface—so this law holds for all [[convex set|convex]] blackbodies, too, so long as the surface has the same temperature throughout.  The law extends to radiation from non-convex bodies by using the fact that the [[convex hull]] of a black body radiates as though it were itself a black body.

===Energy density===
The total energy density ''U'' can be similarly calculated, except the integration is over the whole sphere and there is no cosine, and the energy flux should be divided by the velocity ''c'':
::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{1}{c} \int_0^\infty I(\nu,T) \, d\nu \int cos \theta \, d\Omega \,&lt;/math&gt;
Thus  &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi/2} \cos \theta \sin \theta \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{\pi} \sin \theta \, d\theta &lt;/math&gt;, giving an extra factor of 4.

Thus, in total:
::&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{4}{c} \, \sigma \, T^4 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Zeiss di Merate - pilastro sud.jpg|thumb|right|1 meter Zeiss telescope at [[Merate Astronomical Observatory]], Merate (LC), Italy. (South support)]]

A '''telescope mount''' is a mechanical structure which supports a [[telescope]]. Telescope mounts are designed to support the mass of the telescope and allow for accurate pointing of the instrument. Many sorts of mounts have been developed over the years, with the majority of effort being put into systems that can track the [[diurnal motion|motion]] of the [[fixed stars]] as the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]].

== Fixed mounts ==
Fixed telescope mounts are entirely fixed in one position, such as [[Zenith telescope]]s that point only straight up and the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]'s Green Bank fixed radio '[[horn (telescope)|horn]]' built to observe [[Cygnus X-1]].

==Fixed altitude mounts==
Fixed-altitude mounts usually have the primary optics fixed at an [[altitude]] angle while rotating horizontally (in [[azimuth]]). They can cover the whole sky but only observe objects for the short time when that object passes a specific altitude and azimuth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kBdAOqtCU58C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=%22alt+alt%22+telescope+mount&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tyN4TdasMarC0QH2wI3vBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alt%20alt%22%20telescope%20mount&amp;f=false Pierre-Yves Bély, The design and construction of large optical telescopes, page 236]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transit mounts==
Transit mounts are single axis mounts fixed in azimuth while rotating in altitude, usually oriented on a north-south axis. This allows the telescope to view the whole sky, but only when the Earth's rotation allows the objects to cross (''transit'') through that narrow north-south line (the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]). This type of mount is used in [[transit telescope]]s, designed for precision astronomical measurement. Transit mounts are also used to save on cost or where the instruments mass makes movement on more than one axis very difficult, such as large [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOpaUFQFwTwC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=radio+telescope+transit+mount&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-PJJkE4Cw&amp;sig=H2lYYo4j9aGl24C67PPOCJuc4i8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bV7gSvqSK9WelAfgt_SEDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA4Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=radio%20telescope%20transit%20mount&amp;f=false Robin Michael Green, '''Spherical Astronomy''', page 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Altazimuth mounts ==
{{Main|Altazimuth mount}}
[[Image:Herschel 40 foot.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Herschel]]'s {{convert|49|in|mm|sing=on}} [[40-foot telescope]] on an altazimuth mount.]]
Altazimuth, altitude-azimuth,  or ''alt-az mounts'' allow telescopes to be moved in altitude (up and down), or azimuth (side to side), as separate motions. This mechanically simple mount was used in early telescope designs and until the second half of the 20th century was used as a "less sophisticated" alternative to equatorial mounts since it did not allow tracking of the night sky. This meant until recently it was normally used with inexpensive commercial and hobby constructions. Since the invention of digital tracking systems, altazimuth mounts have come to be used in practically all modern large research telescopes. Digital tracking has also made it a popular telescope mount used in [[amateur astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetfacts.org/altazimuth-mount/ Altazimuth Telescope Mount]. Planetfacts.org. Accessed April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the mechanical inability to easily follow celestial motion the altazimuth mount does have other limitations. The telescope's field-of-view rotates at varying speed as the telescope tracks, whilst the telescope body does not, requiring a system to counter-rotate the field of view when used for [[astrophotography]] or other types of astronomical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomics.com/main/altazimuth_mounts.asp/catalog_name/astronomics/category_name/455bs0f9rd968kref4bq6fgr63/page/1 Altazimuth Mounts].

Accessed April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The mount also has blind spot or "zenith hole", a spot near the zenith where the tracking rate in the azimuth coordinate becomes too high to accurately follow equatorial motion.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"&gt;[http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/techniques/mountings.html Bill Keel's Lecture Notes - Astronomical Techniques - Telescope Mountings]&lt;/ref&gt;  These mounts also require a third axis to de-rotate the field as the telescope tracks.

== Alt-alt (altitude-altitude) mounts ==
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera 001.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Baker-Nunn satellite-tracking camera on an altitude-altitude-azimuth mount.]]
Alt-alt mounts, or altitude-altitude mounts, are designs similar to horizontal [[Equatorial mount#English or Yoke mount|equatorial yoke mounts]] or [[Gimbal|Cardan suspension gimbal]]s. This mount is an alternative to the altazimuth mount that has the advantage of not having a blind spot near the zenith, and for objects near the [[celestial equator]] the field rotation is minimized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomiainumbria.org/pubblicazioni/OTPT001.pdf La montatura alt-alt (The alt-alt mount), article in italian]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the disadvantage of having all the mass, complexity, and engineering problems of its equatorial counterpart, so is only used in specialty applications such as satellite tracking.&lt;ref name="astr.ua.edu"/&gt; These mounts may include a third azimuth axis (an ''altitude-altitude-azimuth mount'') to rotate the entire mount into an orientation that allows smoother tracking.

== Equatorial mounts ==
[[Image:Stuetzmontierung.jpg|thumb|Equatorial mount (St&amp;uuml;tzmontierung) devised by [[Alfred Jensch]]]]
{{Main|Equatorial mount}}

The equatorial mount has north-south "polar axis" tilted to be parallel to Earth's polar axis that allows the telescope to swing in an east-west arc, with a second axis perpendicular to that to allow the telescope to swing in a north-south arc. Slewing or mechanically driving the mount's polar axis in a counter direction to the Earth's rotation allows the telescope to accurately follow the motion of the night sky. Equatorial mounts come in different shapes, include [[German equatorial mount]]s (GEM in short), equatorial [[Equatorial mount#Fork mount|fork mount]]s, mixed variations on [[Equatorial mount#English or Yoke mount|yoke]] or [[Equatorial mount#Cross-axis mount|cross-axis]] mounts, and [[equatorial platform]]s such as the [[Poncet Platform]].

Tilting the polar axis adds a level of complexity to the mount. Mechanical systems have to be engineered to support one or both ends of this axis (such as in fork or yoke mounts). Designs such as German equatorial or cross axis mounts also need large counter weights to counterbalance the mass of the telescope. Larger domes and other structures are also needed to cover the increased mechanical size and range of movement of equatorial mounts. Because of this, equatorial mounts become less viable in very large telescopes and have been pretty much replaced by altazimuth mounts for those applications.

==Hexapod-Telescope==

{{Main|Hexapod-Telescope}}
Instead of the classical mounting using two [[axle]]s, the mirror is supported by six extendable [[strut]]s ([[Stewart platform|Stewart-Gough platform]]). This configuration allows moving the telescope in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides a strong structural integrity.&lt;ref name=2000CHIN&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2000RvMA...13..257C |title=The Hexapod Telescope -- A Never-ending Story |author1=Chini |first1=Rolf |volume=13 |date=2000 |pages=257 |journal=Reviews in Modern Astronomy 13 : New Astrophysical Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Penultimate Curiosity: How science swims in the slipstream of ultimate questions''''' is a book jointly written by English author and artist [[Roger Wagner (English artist and poet)|Roger Wagner]] and English scientist [[Andrew Briggs]], which sets out to answer one of the most important, vexed, and profound questions about the development of human thought: ''‘What lies at the root of the long entanglement between science and religion?’''

In a prologue Wagner and Briggs begin by describing the entrances to the [[Ashmolean Museum|University Museum in Oxford]] and the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in Cambridge. On the former there is a sculpture of an angel, on the latter a quotation from psalm 111: ''‘the works of the Lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein’''. Their book, they suggest, is an attempt to answer the question of how this sculpture and inscription got there. Rather than directly addressing the question of whether science and religion are compatible, Wagner and Briggs examine the nature of the relationship between them.

Their first move is to consider the connection between the earliest evidences of human religion and early evidences of interest in the natural world. Drawing on recent discoveries of cave art and developments in the cognitive science of religion, they suggest that when the need to make sense of the world as a whole (‘ultimate curiosity’) began to become central to maintaining the coherence of human communities, this created a kind of slipstream in which various kinds of interest in the natural world (penultimate curiosities) were able to travel. They further suggest that particular configurations of this ‘slipstream’ (particular ways of making sense of the world) have been especially conducive to motivating an interest in the natural world.

Their second move is then to follow the way that particular religious ideas have shaped and motivated scientific thinking. They describe the way that the development in Greek religious thought of the idea of a divine arche – a source or principle – giving a rational coherence to the universe, influenced Greek scientific thinking for almost a thousand years. They then go on to describe the interaction between Greek thinking and early Jewish and Christian thought. Their focus here is on the Alexandrian Christian philosopher [[John Philoponus]], and his argument that the heavens and the earth are made of the same materials and may be governed by the same principle.

From there Wagner and Briggs go on to follow these ideas through Islamic and medieval Christian thought, and it is in respect of the latter that another theme begins to emerge. Their original slipstreaming metaphor suggested that religious ideas could motivate scientific thinking. However when science is made to answer religious questions or vice versa confusion can result, as when slipstreaming cyclists in the [[Tour de France]] have a clash of wheels producing a chute or pile up. Galileo’s persecution is cited as an example of this kind of chute, and when the speed of scientific advance increases, they suggest, these kinds of chutes can become more frequent.

Thus while describing how emerging features of religious thought, like the reformation insistence on examining the words (and also the works) of God for yourself, fed into the development of experimental science, they also describe how the weaponisation of science in the battle for intellectual credibility produced some of the modern tensions between scientific and religious ideas.

In an excursus towards the end of the book Wagner and Briggs trace the origins of a particular configuration that they call ‘the religious idea of penultimacy’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner and Briggs|title=The Penultimate Curiosity|pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the Biblical idea of a creator God who cannot be identified with his creation; and explore what the cuneiform texts that began to be discovered and translated in the 19th century, reveal about them.

The final section of the book describes how these ideas influenced two men: [[Henry Acland]] who was responsible for the sculpture at the Oxford University Museum, and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who was responsible for the inscription at Cambridge.

A concluding epilogue brings the story up to date, arguing that contemporary attempts to use science to discredit religion are themselves evidence of ''‘the entrenched need of human beings to make sense of the whole depth of their experience’,'' and are ''‘rooted in the cognitive capacities that…first gave rise to homo religiosus’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner and Briggs|title=The Penultimate Curiosity|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The book has so far been translated into Spanish and Portuguese. 

Reviewing the book in the [[Financial Times]] [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] remarked on its ‘generally irenic tone’ and describes it as a ''‘gripping work of history and reference that deserves to be read on both sides of the science-art divide’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cornwell|first1=John|title=''The Financial Times'' 16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the [[Times Higher Educational Supplement]] Richard Joyner wrote that ''‘to me as an atheist … Wagner and Briggs’ first premise is wrong and their second confusing’'', but nevertheless argued that ''‘their book is well worth reading’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joyner|first1=Richard|title=''Times Higher Educational Supplement'' March 17 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews in more specialist publications echo this last appraisal.

The [http://cerncourier.com/cws/latest/cern CERN Courier] suggests that the book shows how science and religion ''‘can live in a mutually enriching relationship’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''CERN Courier'' Ist July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the [[Church Times]] [[Richard Harries]] describes it as ''‘an exceptionally ambitious and wide-ranging book which approaches the rather stale debate of religion and science with a fresh historical perspective’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harries|first1=Richard|title=''The Church Times'' 7th Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a longer academic review in [[St Anne's College, Oxford|The Ship]], St Anne’s College Journal, [http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/profile?tx_oxford_pi1%5Bstaff%5D=34&amp;cHash=4a45a17a9b2b3e1b62548f0a2cc00ad6 Howard Hotson], Professor of Early Modern Intellectual History at Oxford, wrote that in a culture in which modernity is so often defined in terms of secularization, and religion so often conceived as the archenemy of science, ''‘it seems paradoxical to find glowing testimonials on the dust jacket of The Penultimate Curiosity from the [[Astronomer Royal]] and the Director General of [[CERN]] alongside the former Chief Rabbi and the current Archbishop of Canterbury.''’ Professor Hotson describes how the book’s thesis ''‘at its most impressively robust’'' is illustrated in the ''‘process in which the heritage of Greek natural philosophy and mathematics was reshaped by dialogue with the deepest principles of Judeo-Christian-Islamic [[monotheism]] and vice versa’'', adding that ''‘Wagner and Briggs are themselves swimming in the slipstream of a huge amount of patient scholarly work undertaken at an exponentially accelerating rate’''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hotson|first1=Howard|title=''The Ship'' 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theoretical astronomy''' is the use of the analytical models of physics and chemistry to describe [[astronomical objects]] and astronomical phenomena.

[[Ptolemy]]'s [[Almagest]], although a brilliant treatise on theoretical [[astronomy]] combined with a practical handbook for computation, nevertheless includes many compromises to reconcile discordant observations. Theoretical astronomy is usually assumed to have begun with [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), and [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]]. It is co-equal with observation. The general history of astronomy deals with the history of the descriptive and theoretical astronomy of the Solar System, from the late sixteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. The major categories of works on the history of modern astronomy include general histories, national and institutional histories, instrumentation, descriptive astronomy, theoretical astronomy, positional astronomy, and astrophysics. Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics. From the point of view of theoretical astronomy, not only must the mathematical expression be reasonably accurate but it should preferably exist in a form which is amenable to further mathematical analysis when used in specific problems. Most of theoretical astronomy uses Newtonian theory of gravitation, considering that the effects of general relativity are weak for most celestial objects. The obvious fact is that theoretical astronomy cannot (and does not try to) predict the position, size and temperature of every star in the heavens. Theoretical astronomy by and large has concentrated upon analyzing the apparently complex but periodic motions of celestial objects.

The aim of astronomy is to understand the physics and chemistry from the laboratory that is behind cosmic events so as to enrich our understanding of the cosmos and of these sciences as well.&lt;ref name=Narlikar/&gt;

==Integrating astronomy and chemistry==
{{Main|Astrochemistry}}
'''Astrochemistry''', the overlap of the disciplines of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], is the study of the abundance and reactions of [[chemical elements]] and molecules in space, and their interaction with radiation. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[Molecular cloud|molecular gas cloud]]s, is of special interest because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

Infrared astronomy, for example, has revealed that the [[interstellar medium]] contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons, often abbreviated ([[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s or PACs). These molecules composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state) are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in [[meteorite]]s and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([[cosmic dust]]). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, nucleobases, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [[deuterium]] (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and [[isotope]]s of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying carbon rich [[red giant]] stars).

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since symmetry-forbidden reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [[Protonated molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]] in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for [[stellar evolution]], as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring [[chemical element]]. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental [[hydrogen]] (H) as a fuel source and produces [[helium]] (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one [[proton]]. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause [[nuclear fusion]]. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. [[Lithium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. [[iron]] and [[lead]]).

==Tools of theoretical astronomy==
Theoretical astronomers use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical models]]  (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a [[star]]) and [[computation]]al  [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.&lt;ref name=Roth&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525|author=Roth H |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=39|issue=3 |pages=525–9 |date=1932 |bibcode=1932PhRv...39..525R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eddington&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eddington AS |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |date=1926 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-33708-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomy theorists endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps observers look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. Consistent with the general scientific approach, in the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

==Topics of theoretical astronomy==
Topics studied by theoretical astronomers include:
# [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]];
# [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy formation]];
# [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]]  of [[matter]]  in the [[Universe]];
# origin of [[cosmic ray]]s;
# [[general relativity]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')[[physics]] and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

==Astronomical models==
Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]] are the [[Big Bang]], [[Cosmic inflation]], [[dark matter]], and fundamental theories of [[physics]].

==Leading topics in theoretical astronomy==
[[Dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are the current leading topics in astronomy,&lt;ref&gt;http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/dark_matter.html third paragraph, "There is currently much ongoing research by scientists attempting to discover exactly what this dark matter is". Retrieved 2009-11-02&lt;/ref&gt; as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the galaxies.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
Of the topics approached with the tools of theoretical physics, particular consideration is often given to stellar photospheres, stellar atmospheres, the solar atmosphere, planetary atmospheres, gaseous nebulae, nonstationary stars, and the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to the internal structure of stars.&lt;ref name=Sobolev&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sobolev VV |title=Course in theoretical astrophysics |date=1985 |pages=504 |edition=3rd revised and enlarged |publisher=Izdatel'stvo Nauka |location=Moscow |bibcode=1985cta..book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak equivalence principle===
The observation of a neutrino burst within 3 h of the associated optical burst from [[Supernova 1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) gave theoretical astrophysicists an opportunity to test that neutrinos and photons follow the same trajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Krauss LM|author2=Tremaine S |title=Test of the Weak Equivalence Principle for Neutrinos and Photons |journal=Phys.

# the gravitational field as described with a micocanonical system in a spatially finite region and

are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics as is often observed in astrophysical phenomena associated with a black hole event horizon, the density of states can be expressed as a real-time functional integral and subsequently used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

===Interstellar organics===
"An important goal for theoretical astrochemistry is to elucidate which organics are of true interstellar origin, and to identify possible interstellar precursors and reaction pathways for those molecules which are the result of aqueous alterations."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ehrenfreund P|author2=Charnley SB|author3=Botta O |title=A voyage from dark clouds to the early Earth ''In: Astrophysics of life: proceedings of the Space Telescope Science Institute Symposium held in Baltimore, Maryland, May 6–9, 2002, Volume 16 of Space Telescope Science Institute symposium series'' |date=2005 |editor=Livio M |editor2= Reid IN |editor3=Sparks WB |pages=1–20 of 110 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=9780521824903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ways this goal can be achieved is through the study of carbonaceous material as found in some meteorites. Carbonaceous chondrites (such as C1 and C2) include organic compounds such as amines and amides; alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones; aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; sulfonic and phosphonic acids; amino, hydroxycarboxylic, and carboxylic acids; purines and pyrimidines; and [[kerogen]]-type material.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt; The organic inventories of primitive meteorites display large and variable enrichments in deuterium, [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), and [[nitrogen-15]] (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N), which is indicative of their retention of an interstellar heritage.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfreund/&gt;

===Chemistry in cometary comae===
The chemical composition of comets should reflect both the conditions in the outer solar nebula some 4.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; ayr, and the nature of the natal interstellar cloud from which the [[Solar system]] was formed.&lt;ref name=Rodgers&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rodgers SD|author2=Charnley SB |title=A model of the chemistry in cometary comae: deuterated molecules |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=Mar 2002 |volume=330 |issue=3 |pages=660–74 |bibcode=2002MNRAS.330..660R |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; While comets retain a strong signature of their ultimate interstellar origins, significant processing must have occurred in the protosolar nebula.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Early models of coma chemistry showed that reactions can occur rapidly in the inner coma, where the most important reactions are proton transfer reactions.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt; Such reactions can potentially cycle deuterium between the different coma molecules, altering the initial D/H ratios released from the nuclear ice, and necessitating the construction of accurate models of cometary deuterium chemistry, so that gas-phase coma observations can be safely extrapolated to give nuclear D/H ratios.&lt;ref name=Rodgers/&gt;

==Theoretical chemical astronomy==
While the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrochemistry and theoretical chemical astronomy often become blurred so that the goals and tools are the same, there are subtle differences between the two sciences. Theoretical chemistry as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe chemicals in celestial objects, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrochemistry having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations.

===Astronomical spectroscopy===
The new era of chemical astronomy had to await the clear enunciation of the chemical principles of spectroscopy and the applicable theory.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Merrill PW |title=Great Epochs in Astronomy |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |date=1954 |volume=7 |pages=41–8 |bibcode=1954ASPL....7...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry of dust condensation===
Supernova radioactivity dominates light curves and the chemistry of dust condensation is also dominated by radioactivity.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Clayton DD|author2= Liu W |title=Radioactivity Frontier for Supernova Chemistry |journal=Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. |date=1999 |volume=31 |pages=739 |bibcode=1999HEAD....4.3602C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust is usually either carbon or oxides depending on which is more abundant, but Compton electrons dissociate the CO molecule in about one month.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; The new chemical astronomy of supernova solids depends on the supernova radioactivity:
# the radiogenesis of &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca  from &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti decay after carbon condensation establishes their supernova source,
# their opacity suffices to shift emission lines blueward after 500 d and emits significant infrared luminosity,
# parallel kinetic rates determine trace isotopes in meteoritic supernova graphites,
# the chemistry is kinetic rather than due to thermal equilibrium and
# is made possible by radiodeactivation of the CO trap for carbon.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt;

==Theoretical physical astronomy==
Like theoretical chemical astronomy, the lines of conceptual understanding between theoretical astrophysics and theoretical physical astronomy are often blurred, but, again, there are subtle differences between these two sciences. Theoretical physics as applied to astronomy seeks to find new ways to observe physical phenomena in celestial objects and what to look for, for example. This often leads to theoretical astrophysics having to seek new ways to describe or explain those same observations, with hopefully a convergence to improve our understanding of the local environment of Earth and the physical [[Universe]].

===Weak interaction and nuclear double beta decay===
Nuclear matrix elements of relevant operators as extracted from data and from a shell-model and theoretical approximations both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of decay are used to explain the weak interaction and nuclear structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay.&lt;ref name=Suhonen&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00087-2|author=Suhonen J|author2=Civitarese O |title=Weak-interaction and nuclear-structure aspects of nuclear double beta decay |journal=Phys.

===Neutron-rich isotopes===
New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si have been produced unambiguously for the first time, and convincing evidence for the particle instability of three others, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Na, and &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Mg has been obtained.&lt;ref name=Notani&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=6|author=Notani M|author2=Sakurai H|author3=Aoi N|author4=Yanagisawa Y|author5=Saito A|author6=Imai N|author7=Gomi T|author8=Miura M|author9=Michimasa S|author10=Iwasaki H|author11=Fukuda N|author12=Ishihara M|author13=Kubo T|author14= Kubono S|author15=Kumagai H|author16=Lukyanov SM|author17=Motobayashi T|author18=Onishi TK|author19=Penionzhkevich YE|author20=Shimoura S|author21=Teranishi T|author22=Ue K|author23=Ugryumov V|author24=Yoshida A |title=New neutron-rich isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Na and &lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Si, produced by fragmentation of a 64 A MeV 48Ca beam |journal=Phys.

==Theory of astronomical time keeping==
Until recently all the time units that appear natural to us are caused by astronomical phenomena:
# Earth's orbit around the Sun =&gt; the year, and the seasons,
# [[Moon]]'s orbit around the Earth =&gt; the month,
# Earth's rotation and the succession of brightness and darkness =&gt; the day (and night).

High precision appears problematic:
# amibiguities arise in the exact definition of a rotation or revolution,
# some astronomical processes are uneven and irregular, such as the noncommensurability of year, month, and day,
# there are a multitude of time scales and calendars to solve the first two problems.&lt;ref name=Husfeld&gt;{{Cite web|author=Husfeld D|author2=Kronberg C |title=Astronomical Time Keeping |url=http://www.maa.mhn.de/Scholar/times.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these time scales are [[sidereal time]], [[solar time]], and [[universal time]].

===Atomic time===
{{Main|International Atomic Time}}
[[File:Clock accuracy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Historical accuracy of atomic clocks from [[NIST]].]]
From the [[International System of Units|Systeme Internationale]] (SI) comes the second as defined by the duration of 9 192 631 770 cycles of a particular hyperfine structure transition in the ground state of [[caesium-133]] (&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs).&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; For practical usability a device is required that attempts to produce the SI second (s) such as an [[atomic clock]]. But not all such clocks agree. The weighted mean of many clocks distributed over the whole Earth defines the [[International Atomic Time|Temps Atomique International]]; i.e., the Atomic Time TAI.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; From the [[General theory of relativity]] the time measured depends on the altitude on earth and the spatial velocity of the clock so that TAI refers to a location on sea level that rotates with the Earth.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt;

===Ephemeris time===
{{Main|Ephemeris time}}
Since the Earth's rotation is irregular, any time scale derived from it such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]] led to recurring problems in predicting the [[Ephemeris|Ephemerides]] for the positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], [[planet]]s and their [[natural satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=Husfeld/&gt; In 1976 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) resolved that the theoretical basis for ephemeris time (ET) was wholly non-relativistic, and therefore, beginning in 1984 ephemeris time would be replaced by two further time scales with allowance for relativistic corrections. Their names, assigned in 1979,&lt;ref name=Guinot&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Guinot B|author2=Seidelmann PK |title=Time scales&amp;nbsp;– Their history, definition and interpretation |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=Apr 1988 |volume=194 |issue=1–2 |pages=304–8 |bibcode=1988A&amp;A...194..304G }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized their dynamical nature or origin, [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB) and [[Terrestrial Dynamical Time]] (TDT).  Both were defined for continuity with ET and were based on what had become the standard SI second, which in turn had been derived from the measured second of ET.
{{See also|Dynamical time scale}}
During the period 1991–2006, the TDB and TDT time scales were both redefined and replaced, owing to difficulties or inconsistencies in their original definitions. The current fundamental relativistic time scales are [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG) and [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB). Both of these have rates that are based on the SI second in respective reference frames (and hypothetically outside the relevant gravity well), but due to relativistic effects, their rates would appear slightly faster when observed at the Earth's surface, and therefore diverge from local Earth-based time scales using the SI second at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=Klioner&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Klioner S |display-authors=etal |title=Units of relativistic time scales and associated quantities |journal=IAU Symposium |volume=261 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently defined IAU time scales also include [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) (replacing TDT, and now defined as a re-scaling of TCG, chosen to give TT a rate that matches the SI second when observed at the Earth's surface),&lt;ref name=Resol&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://syrte.obspm.fr/IAU_resolutions/Resol-UAI.rtf |title=IAU 2000 resolutions, at Resolution B1.9. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a redefined Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), a re-scaling of TCB to give TDB a rate that matches the SI second at the Earth's surface.

===Extraterrestrial time-keeping===
{{Main|Timekeeping on Mars|Martian calendar}}

===Stellar dynamical time scale===
For a [[star]], the dynamical time scale is defined as the time that would be taken for a test particle released at the surface to fall under the [[star]]'s potential to the centre point, if pressure forces were negligible.  In other words, the dynamical time scale measures the amount of time it would take a certain [[star]] to collapse in the absence of any [[internal pressure]].  By appropriate manipulation of the equations of stellar structure this can be found to be

&lt;math&gt; \tau_{dynamical} \simeq \frac{R}{v} = \sqrt{\frac{R^3}{2GM}} \sim 1/\sqrt{G\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[radius]] of the star, G is the [[gravitational constant]], M is the [[mass]] of the star and v is the [[escape velocity]].  As an example, the [[Sun]] dynamical time scale is approximately 1133 seconds.  Note that the actual time it would take a star like the Sun to collapse is greater because internal pressure is present.

The 'fundamental' oscillatory mode of a star will be at approximately the dynamical time scale. Oscillations at this frequency are seen in [[Cepheid variables]].

==Theory of astronomical navigation==

===On earth===

The basic characteristics of applied astronomical navigation are
# usable in all areas of sailing around the earth,
# applicable autonomously (does not depend on others&amp;nbsp;– persons or states) and passively (does not emit energy),
# conditional usage via optical visibility (of horizon and celestial bodies), or state of cloudiness,
# precisional measurement, sextant is 0.1', altitude and position is between 1.5' and 3.0'.
# temporal determination takes a couple of minutes (using the most modern equipment) and ≤ 30 min (using classical equipment).&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt;

The superiority of satellite navigation systems to astronomical navigation are currently undeniable, especially with the development and use of GPS/NAVSTAR.&lt;ref name=Stajic&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Stajic D |title=Astronomical navigation at the beginning of the third millenium |journal=Publ Astron Obs Belgrade ''In: Proceedings of the XIII National Conference of Yugoslav Astronomers, Belgrade, October 17–20, 2002'' |date=Oct 2003 |volume=75 |pages=209–16 |bibcode=2003POBeo..75..209S }}{{sic}}&lt;/ref&gt; This global satellite system
# enables automated three-dimensional positioning at any moment,
# automatically determines position continuously (every second or even more often),
# determines position independent of weather conditions (visibility and cloudiness),
# determines position in real time to a few meters (two carrying frequencies) and 100 m (modest commercial receivers), which is two to three orders of magnitude better than by astronomical observation,
# is simple even without expert knowledge,
# is relatively cheap, comparable to equipment for astronomical navigation, and
# allows incorporation into integrated and automated systems of control and ship steering.&lt;ref name=Stajic/&gt; The use of astronomical or celestial navigation is disappearing from the surface and beneath or above the surface of the earth.
{{See also|Geodetic astronomy|Astronomical algorithm|Figure of the Earth|International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service}}
'''Geodetic astronomy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]] for
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination and
* modelling the rock [[density|densities]] of the topography and of [[geological]] layers in the [[subsurface]]
* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the stellar background (see also [[astrometry]] and cosmic triangulation)
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the time system of physics and [[geosciences]]

'''Astronomical algorithms''' are the [[algorithm]]s used to calculate [[ephemeris|ephemerides]], [[calendar]]s, and positions (as in [[celestial navigation]] or [[satellite navigation]]).

Many astronomical and navigational computations use the [[Figure of the Earth]] as a surface representing the earth.

The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), formerly the International Earth Rotation Service, is the body responsible for maintaining global time and [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] standards, notably through its Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) and [[International Celestial Reference System]] (ICRS) groups.

===Deep space===
{{Main|Deep Space Network}}
The '''Deep Space Network''', or '''DSN''', is an international [[Wiktionary:network|network]] of large [[#Antennas|antenna]]s and communication facilities that supports [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[spacecraft]] missions, and [[radio astronomy|radio]] and [[radar astronomy]] observations for the exploration of the [[solar system]] and the [[universe]]. The network also supports selected Earth-orbiting missions. DSN is part of the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL).

===Aboard an exploratory vehicle===
An observer becomes a deep space explorer upon escaping Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576507001300|bibcode=2007AcAau..61.1019K}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Deep Space Network]] maintains communication and enables data download from an exploratory vessel, any local probing performed by sensors or active systems aboard usually require astronomical navigation, since the enclosing network of satellites to ensure accurate positioning is absent.

'''Todd Huffman''' is an American technology entrepreneur and prolific photographer.&lt;ref name=Thnk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2015-01-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=BizJ2016-07-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=SingularityHub2016-10-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=SingularityUToddH/&gt; He is a co-founder of the biomedical imaging company, [[3Scan]].

== Career ==
In 2011, Huffman co-founded 3Scan, a firm that develops new techniques for [[biomedical imaging]].&lt;ref name="Forbes2015-01-28" /&gt; ''[[American City Business Journals|Biz Journals]]'' called 3Scan's main technology, the [[Knife-edge scanning microscope]], a ''"robotic microscope."''&lt;ref name="BizJ2016-07-11" /&gt; The microscope rapidly sections and scans samples, building 3d models of microscopic structures.&lt;ref name="SingularityHub2016-10-11" /&gt; ''[[Singularity Hub magazine]]'' quoted Huffman's description of their goal: “We’re trying to move from a world where humans are hunting and pecking through tissue looking for answers to a world where we generate large and reproducible data sets where we can use analytics to drive insights and real cures.”{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In January 2015, ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' interviewed Huffman, asking him to explain the approach to technology his firm was taking.&lt;ref name="Forbes2015-01-28" /&gt;

In July 2016, ''Biz Journals'' reported that venture capital firms had invested an additional $11 million in 3Scan, reporting the total as $21 million.&lt;ref name="BizJ2016-07-11" /&gt;

[[Sharon Weinberger]], author of a book about [[DARPA]] entitled ''The Imagineers of War'', described Huffman influencing [[DARPA]] decision-makers, following a chance meeting where he described how he and other volunteers had used innovative modeling techniques to aid civilians in disaster zones and warzones.&lt;ref name="ImagineersOfWar" /&gt; Huffman was a regular visitor to [[Jalalabad]], in [[Afghanistan]], where he worked with other technology workers affiliated with an informal group known as the [[Synergy Strike Force]], using technology to help improve the quality of life for Afghan civilians and training them in the use of peaceful technologies such as computers and wireless internet.&lt;ref name="Wired2012-05" /&gt;

Huffman is a cofounder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-gagnier/a-bil-and-ted-excellent-a_b_462987.html|title=A BIL and TED Excellent Adventure|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=25 February 2015|author=Christina Gagnier|date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[BIL Conference]], an ''unconference'' organized and observed by the participants as an unaffiliated counterpart to TED’s structured, ‘invite-only’ paid conference.

'''Transformational theory of imitation''' is one of the two types of [[theories]] that provide alternative accounts of the [[psychological]] processes underlying [[imitation]] in animals.&lt;ref name=name&gt;Heyes, C., &amp; Ray, E. "What is the Significant of Imitation in Animals?". Academic Press, 2000, p. 217-219.&lt;/ref&gt; Associative theories (being the other theory of imitation) suggesting successful imitation matches between a behavior of the demonstrator and the model to be acquired from experiences, transformational theories are in complete contrast suggesting successful imitation matches are derived internally from a series of elaborated cognitive processes that exist void of any experiences.&lt;ref name=name /&gt; 

According to transformational theories, sensory input seen by the model of the demonstrator's action is transformed into a "imaged representation"&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. ''Play, dreams, and imitation in Childhood''. Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd., 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; that contains the fundamental information for the model to accurately execute the imitation of the demonstrator.&lt;ref name=name /&gt; In transformational theories, simply observing the behaviors of the demonstrator creates an incentive to duplicate them because we already have the codes to replicate them.&lt;ref name=name /&gt;

== Bandura's "social cognitive theory" ==

In his "social cognitive theory" Bandura outlines what he believed to be the four sets of constituent processes that govern imitation:
# An model must give attention to the demonstrator's behavior
# An model must store that behavior in the form of a "symbolic conception" that can serve as a sort of standard for the behavior
# An model must imitate the behavior of the demonstrator acquired from the symbolic conception when...
# The model is motivated to imitate the behavior&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. ''Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory.'' Prentice-Hall, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike in associative theories of imitation, Bandura's transformational theory of imitation denies that reinforcement must accompany observation of the demonstrator's behavior for the creation of a mental portrayal of the demonstrator's behavior to occur. &lt;ref name=name /&gt; Bandura's theory also claims reinforcement is not necessary in the maintenance of imitative behavior. &lt;ref name=name /&gt; Rather, it is the symbolic conception that regulates imitation, where no experience is necessary, only the conception that is created internally.

== Problems with the theory ==

=== Underspecification ===

Although there are many theories enveloped within transformational theories of imitation, as a whole, transformational theories all lack in specification. &lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C. "Transformational and Associative Theories of Imitation". MIT Press, 2002, p. 504-505.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these theories, imitation is mediated by a sort of “symbolic conception”, but how this conception works is not specified. It is unknown, then, which behaviors can and cannot be imitated, with which species, and under what conditions because the process of this conception isn't specific. &lt;ref name=name /&gt; In turn, transformational theories are then impossible to test empirically.

==== Bandura's “social cognitive theory” ====

In Bandura's theory and his sets of constituent processes governing imitation, there is essentially a three piece cognitive architecture.&lt;ref name=name /&gt; This architecture consists of a sensory representation where the demonstrator's behavior is first stored, a symbolic conception that is a transformation of the sensory representation, and a motor program that serves as constant reminder of that behavior's standard. &lt;ref name=name /&gt; What there is not, however, is specificity in regards to how this behavior moves from one piece to the next. It is unclear as to how the sensory representation moves and is transformed into a symbolic conception that serves as the behavior's standard and thus, proves to be untestable and unpredictable, a common problem that many find with transformational theories.

'''''Tree: A Life Story''''' (or '''''Tree: A Biography'''''  in Australia) is a Canadian non-fiction book written by [[David Suzuki]] and [[Wayne Grady (author)|Wayne Grady]], and illustrated by [[Robert Bateman (naturalist)|Robert Bateman]]. The book profiles the life of a [[Douglas-fir]] tree, from seed to maturity to death. The story provides ecological context by describing interactions with other lifeforms in the forest and historical context through parallels with world events that occur during the tree's 700&amp;nbsp;years of life. Digressions from the biographical narrative, scattered throughout the book, provide background into related topics, such as the history of botany.

Suzuki was inspired to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic with the help of a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the ''[[Maclean's]]'' and the ''[[National Post]]''{{'s}} non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.

==Background==
Inspiration for the book came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk.&lt;ref name=Koval/&gt; While sitting by the tree, at his home on [[Quadra Island]], near [[Vancouver]], [[David Suzuki]] realized that even though his family had played on it for years, he did not know how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed.&lt;ref name=Koval&gt;Suzuki, David (March 13, 2005), Interview with [[Ramona Koval]], Books and Writing. [[Radio National]] ([[Sydney]]). ([http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/bwriting/stories/s1318602.htm Interview]). Retrieved on July 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt; Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former [[zoologist]], speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life.&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;Grady, Wayne (December 4, 2004), Interview with [[Bob McDonald (science journalist)]], [[Quirks &amp; Quarks]]. [[CBC Radio One]] ([[Toronto]]). ([http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/bwriting/stories/s1318602.htm Interview]). Retrieved on June 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants.&lt;ref name=Donnelly&gt;{{Citation |last=Donnelly |first=Pat |date=2005-02-04 |title=Blue Met thinks green |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |publication-place=[[Montreal]] |pages=H5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator.&lt;ref name=Donnelly/&gt; Science writer and former ''[[Harrowsmith]]'' editor [[Wayne Grady (author)|Wayne Grady]] agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in [[Ontario]] and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts.&lt;ref name=Bellingham&gt;{{Citation |last=Van Hemert |first=Caroline |last2=Colen |first2=Elizabeth J. |date=Fall 2005 |title=Exquisitely Interconnected: An Interview with David Suzuki |journal=Bellingham Review |volume=28 |issue=2 |publication-place=[[Bellingham, Washington]] |pages=94–107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife artist [[Robert Bateman (naturalist)|Robert Bateman]] was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt;&lt;ref name=Donnelly/&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Pseudotsuga seed seedling.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Douglas-fir]] seedling]]
The book consists of five chapters: "Birth", "Taking Root", "Growth", "Maturity", and "Death". The book opens with acknowledgments and an introduction, and closes with selected references and an index. In the introduction, Suzuki describes the tree at his home and the series of ideas and events that led to the writing of the book. Along with the narrative of the tree's life, the book includes digressions into related topics, such as the [[history of botany]] and animal life in the forest. The tree written about in the book is not any specific [[Douglas-fir]], but rather a generic one.

The first chapter, "Birth", begins with lightning starting a forest fire. The heat dries the Douglas-fir cones enough for their scales to spread and release winged seeds. Rain water transports one seed to a sunlit area with well-drained soil. Rodents and insectivores, whose food stashes were destroyed in the fire, eat [[Tuber (genus)|truffles]], which survived underground, and leave feces containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil. Following one dormant winter stage, the seed begins to [[Germination|germinate]].

In the second chapter, "Taking Root", the [[radicle|embryonic root]] emerges through a small opening in the seed coat and through cell division, aided by [[Auxin|plant hormones]], it grows downward. Water and nutrients enter the root by [[osmosis]] and are transported to the seedling. A [[Mycorrhiza|symbiotic relationship]] develops between the roots and the truffles. The roots give its extra sugars to the truffles, which it uses for energy, and the truffles assist the roots' uptake of water and nutrients. From excess starches and nutrients gathered by the root, a stem similar to the root but surrounded with thin, grayish bark, grows upwards. As the starch reserves are exhausted, its [[cotyledon|first needles]] sprout and photosynthesis begins. The tree anchors itself with a deep [[taproot]] and a [[Fibrous root system|web of roots]] begin to grow laterally. Some roots develop symbiotic relationships with near-by red alders which excel at nitrogen-fixation but lack the storage capacity that the Douglas-fir can offer. In early April of every year, a new [[Cork cambium|layer]] grows between the bark and wood. As this new layer takes over transportation of fluids throughout the tree, last year's layer of cells die and form a ring in the wood.

[[File:Douglasie.jpg|thumb|upright|Cross-section of a Douglas-fir]]
After about 20&amp;nbsp;years, the tree begins to develop fertile [[Conifer cone|cones]]. Buds form where [[auxins]] accumulate; these become either new needles or cones. The buds remain undifferentiated until July and continue to develop throughout the fall and winter. The next year, some buds will open in mid-May exposing a new set of needles. The cone buds on the lower end of the tree  while other buds burst open in April releasing a mist of pollen. The cones at the top of the tree open their scales for wind-borne pollen to enter. Within the cone, the pollen fertilizes a seed which is released in September. The quantity and quality of seed production varies year-to-year but a particularly effective crop is produced about every 10&amp;nbsp;years. Less than 0.1% of seeds survive [[Douglas squirrel]]s, [[dark-eyed junco]]s, and other seed-eating animals.

Over the centuries, the tree grows thicker and taller as successive rings develop around its trunk and new [[bud]]s grow on the branches. The tree becomes part of an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]], a mat of dead needles and [[Lobaria|lichen]] accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.

In the opening of the final chapter, "Death", the tree is 550&amp;nbsp;years old and stands 80&amp;nbsp;meters (260&amp;nbsp;feet) tall. Under the weight of too much snow accumulating on the canopy mat, a branch breaks off. Stresses from a long winter with a dry summer weaken the tree's immune system. The exposed area where the branch broke becomes infected with insects and fungus. Insect larvae eat the buds and the fungus spreads into the middle of the tree and down to the roots. With its [[vascular tissue|vascular tissue system]] compromised, the tree diverts nutrients elsewhere, resulting in needles turning orange on the abandoned branches. Death takes years to occur as successive parts are slowly starved of nutrients. As a [[snag (ecology)|snag]], it becomes home to a succession of animals, like woodpeckers, owls, squirrels, and bats. Eventually the roots rot enough that a rainstorm blows it down. Mosses and fungi grow on the [[Nurse log|deadfall]], followed by colonies of termites, ants, and mites, which all help decompose the remaining wood.

==Genre and style==
''Tree'' is a [[popular science]] book, intended to profile the life of single tree using terminology targeted at a general audience. The narrative provides ecological context, describing animals and plants that interact with the tree, as well as historical context. Parallels to the tree's age are made with historical events, like the tree taking root as [[Empiricism|empirical]] science was taking root in Europe during the life of 13th century philosopher [[Roger Bacon]]. The book is most commonly described, and marketed, as a "biography".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=June 2005 |title=Botany |magazine=SciTech Book News |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer grouped it with the 2005 book ''The Golden Spruce'' as part of a new genre: an "arbobiography".&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{Citation |last=Mason |first=Travis |date=2007-07-01 |title=Has History or Hadwin Won? |magazine=[[Canadian Literature (journal)|Canadian Literature]] |issue=193 |pages=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is written in the [[Third-person narrative|third person, omniscient]], style. Grady's writing moderates Suzuki's characteristic rhetoric to create writing that is accessible, with a tone described as "a breezy casualness that welcomes the reader".&lt;ref name=Wiersema/&gt; According to Suzuki, making the book accessible required telling the story from a human perspective, including some [[anthropomorphism]] of biological processes.&lt;ref name=Koval/&gt;

==Publication==
The book was published by [[Greystone Books]], an imprint of [[Douglas &amp; McIntyre]] based in [[Vancouver]] that specializes in nature, travel, and sports topics. They published the hardcover version of ''Tree'' in September 2004. The book is small, [[Book size|measuring]] only 19&amp;times;14&amp;nbsp;cm (7.6&amp;times;5.4&amp;nbsp;inches) with 190 pages. Suzuki and Grady promoted it through media interviews and book signing events across Canada. In February 2005, [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] published it in Australia as ''Tree: A Biography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2008 |title=Tree |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |url=http://www.allenandunwin.com/default.aspx?page=94&amp;book=9781741145175 |accessdate=2008-07-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic]] released the audio book in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2008 |title=RFB&amp;D |publisher=Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic |url=http://www.rfbd.org/ |accessdate=2008-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703154613/http://www.rfbd.org// |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}.

Booksellers' Choice Award and the 2006 [[Council on Botanical and Horticultural Libraries, Inc. (CBHL)|Council on Botanical and Horticultural Libraries' Annual Litereature Award]] for best 'General Interest' book. The French translation by [[Dominique Fortier]] was nominated for the 2006 [[Governor General's Awards]] for best English to French translation.

The premise of a biography for a tree was well received.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{Citation |last=Robertson |first=Patricia |date=2004-11-06 |title=A story lovely as a tree |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publication-place=[[Toronto]] |pages=D8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillespie&gt;{{Citation |last=Gillespie |first=Brenda |date=2004-12-04 |title=Books that connect us truly gifts for the ages |newspaper=The Tri City News |publication-place=[[Coquitlam, British Columbia]] |pages=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing was called engaging, lyrical, and compelling.&lt;ref name=Gillespie/&gt;&lt;ref name=Menna&gt;{{Citation |last=Di Menna|first=Jodi |date=May–June 2005 |title=Tree: A Life Story |journal=[[Canadian Geographic]] |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maksel&gt;{{Citation |last=Maksel |first=Rebecca |date=2004-10-15 |title=Tree: A Life Story (Book) |journal=[[Booklist]] |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Wiersema]] wrote, "''Tree'' is science writing at its finest. It's sweeping but focused, keenly aware of both the minutiae and the big picture. ...&amp;nbsp;Although some of the concepts are complex, the writing is always accessible&amp;nbsp;...

[[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mwdwebsites.com/nj-web-design-world-wide-web.html|title=The Evolution of the World Wide Web|last=Enzer|first=Larry|date=August 31, 2018|website=Monmouth Web Developers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By 1985, the [[Global Internet usage|global Internet]] began to proliferate in Europe and the [[Domain Name System]] (upon which the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs315/BOOKS/TBL12.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2015-08-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022333/http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs315/BOOKS/TBL12.pdf|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced [[ENQUIRE]], a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the [[network address]] of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word ''[[hypertext]]'', a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term ''[[hypermedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|url=http://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|date=March 1989|title=Information Management: A Proposal|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315161300/http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|archivedate=15 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast [[Robert Cailliau]] he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word) as a "web" of "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "[[Web browser|browsers]]" using a [[client–server architecture]].&lt;ref name="W90"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/Proposal.html|title=WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a HyperText Project|first1=Tim|last1=Berners-Lee|authorlink1=Tim Berners-Lee|first2=Robert|last2=Cailliau|authorlink2=Robert Cailliau|date=12 November 1990|accessdate=12 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502080527/http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html|archivedate=2 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point HTML and [[HTTP]] had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve "the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available." While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the [[wiki]] concept, [[WebDAV]], [[blog]]s, [[Web 2.0]] and [[RSS]]/[[Atom (standard)|Atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html|title=Tim Berners-Lee's original World Wide Web browser|quote=With recent phenomena like blogs and wikis, the Web is beginning to develop the kind of collaborative nature that its inventor envisaged from the start.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717031115/http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cern datacenter.jpg|thumb|The CERN [[data center|data centre]] in 2010 housing some WWW servers]]
The proposal was modelled after the [[SGML]] reader [[Dynatext]] by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the [[Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship]] at [[Brown University]]. The Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within [[HyTime]], but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. A [[NeXT Computer]] was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first [[web server]] and also to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]], in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb|title=Tim Berners-Lee: client|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721113108/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb|archivedate=21 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WorldWideWeb|first web browser]] (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. The first web site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html|title=First Web pages|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131201408/http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cern/topics/birth-web|title=The birth of the web|publisher=CERN|accessdate=23 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224103843/http://home.cern/topics/birth-web|archivedate=24 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first web page may be lost, but [[Paul Jones (computer technologist)|Paul Jones]] of [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored it on a [[magneto-optical drive]] and on his NeXT computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt for world's oldest WWW page leads to UNC Chapel Hill|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/05/24/2915835/hunt-for-worlds-oldest-www-page.html|last=Murawski|first=John|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|date=24 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608011200/http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/05/24/2915835/hunt-for-worlds-oldest-www-page.html|archivedate=8 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the [[newsgroup]] ''alt.hypertext''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c|title=Short summary of the World Wide Web project|publisher=Google|date=6 August 1991|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]] taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were "totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silvano de Gennaro disclaims 'the first photo on the Web'|url=http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/disclaimer.html|quote=If you read well our website, it says that it was, to our knowledge, the 'first photo of a band'.

The first server outside Europe was installed at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the [[SPIRES]]-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/2005/01/timelines/timeline-2500x998.png|title=W3C timeline|accessdate=30 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331235418/http://www.w3.org/2005/01/timelines/timeline-2500x998.png|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml|title=The Early World Wide Web at SLAC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124035516/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml|archivedate=24 November 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slac.stanford.edu/spires/about/|title=About SPIRES|accessdate=30 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212023810/http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/about/|archivedate=12 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does a W3C document titled ''A Little History of the World Wide Web''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History.html|title=A Little History of the World Wide Web|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506021750/http://www.w3.org/History.html|archivedate=6 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the [[Hypertext Editing System]] (HES) at Brown University, [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[Project Xanadu]], and [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[microfilm]]-based ''[[memex]]'', which was described in the 1945 essay "[[As We May Think]]".&lt;ref name=Conkling&gt;{{Citation|last=Conklin|first=Jeff|year=1987|title=IEEE Computer|volume=20|issue=9 |publication-date=1987|pages=17–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of ''both'' technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:
* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);
* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML);
* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was [[ViolaWWW]] for [[Unix]] and the [[X Windowing System]].

Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinginternet.com/w/wi_mosaic.htm|title=Mosaic Web Browser History&amp;nbsp;– NCSA, Marc Andreessen, Eric Bina|publisher=Livinginternet.com|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totic.org/nscp/demodoc/demo.html|title=NCSA Mosaic&amp;nbsp;– September 10, 1993 Demo|publisher=Totic.org|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (NCSA-UIUC), led by [[Marc Andreessen]]. Funding for Mosaic came from the US High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and the [[High Performance Computing Act of 1991]], one of [[Al Gore and information technology|several computing developments initiated by US Senator Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/innovation/gore.html|title=Vice President Al Gore's ENIAC Anniversary Speech|publisher=Cs.washington.edu|date=14 February 1996|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183820/http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/innovation/gore.html|archivedate=20 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] and [[Wide Area Information Servers]] (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.

Connected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet|title=Internet legal definition of Internet|publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary|date=15 July 2009|work=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2|accessdate=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www|title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition|publisher=TechTerms|accessdate=19 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015356/http://www.techterms.com/definition/www|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209063216/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implemented as  both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].

[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|The World Wide Web functions as an [[application layer]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] that is run "on top of" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional.

The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rjmc/1999/00000005/00000003/art00004|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020140153/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rjmc/1999/00000005/00000003/art00004|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/home.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (&lt;code&gt;www.example.org&lt;/code&gt;) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="http"&gt;
GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.org
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="http"&gt;
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

followed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example.org – The World Wide Web&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html" inline&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;, &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="HTML" inline&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.

=== Linking ===
Most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html" inline&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.example.org/home.html"&gt;Example.org Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]
Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.&lt;ref name="W90" /&gt;

The hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.

=== Dynamic updates of web pages ===
{{Main|Ajax (programming)}}
[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton /&gt; To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WWW prefix ===
&lt;!-- WWW prefix redirects here --&gt;
Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[USENET]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paolo Palazzi,&lt;ref&gt;Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix "www" to the beginning of it and possibly ".com", ".org" and ".net" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and 'openoffice' to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.openoffice.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. This feature started appearing in early versions of [[Firefox]], when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10980|title=automatically adding www.___.com|publisher=mozillaZine|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=27 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225046/http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=10980|archivedate=27 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{unreliable source?|date=November 2016}} It is reported that Microsoft was granted a US patent for the same idea in 2008, but only for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20080626/0203581527.shtml|title=Microsoft Patents Adding 'www.'

As the [[mobile Web]] grew in popularity, services like [[Gmail]].com, [[Outlook.com]], [[Myspace]].com, [[Facebook]].com and [[Twitter]].com are most often mentioned without adding "www." (or, indeed, ".com") to the domain.

=== Scheme specifiers ===
The scheme specifiers ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;https://&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' at the start of a web [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] refer to [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] or [[HTTP Secure]], respectively.  They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend &lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt; to user-entered URIs, if omitted.

== Privacy ==
{{Main|Internet privacy}}
Every time a client requests a web page, the server can identify the request's IP address and usually logs it. Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, [[personally identifiable information]]—such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.—web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.

[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3086/2589|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204191044/http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3086/2589|archivedate=4 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.

== Standards ==
{{Main|Web standards}}
Many formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the World Wide Web, the Internet, and computer information exchange. Many of the documents are the work of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), headed by Berners-Lee, but some are produced by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and other organisations.

Usually, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as foundational:
* Recommendations for [[markup languages]], especially [[HTML]] and [[XHTML]], from the W3C. These define the structure and interpretation of hypertext documents.
* Recommendations for [[style sheet (web development)|stylesheets]], especially [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], from the W3C.
* Standards for ECMAScript (usually in the form of JavaScript), from [[Ecma International]].
* Recommendations for the [[Document Object Model]], from W3C.

Additional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the World Wide Web, including, but not limited to, the following:
* ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI), which is a universal system for referencing resources on the Internet, such as hypertext documents and images. URIs, often called URLs, are defined by the IETF's {{IETF RFC|3986}} / STD 66: ''Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax'', as well as its predecessors and numerous [[URI scheme]]-defining [[Request For Comments|RFCs]];
* ''HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)'', especially as defined by {{IETF RFC|2616}}: ''HTTP/1.1'' and {{IETF RFC|2617}}: ''HTTP Authentication'', which specify how the browser and server authenticate each other.

== Accessibility ==
{{Main|Web accessibility}}
There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.&lt;ref name=WAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001730/http://www.w3.org/WAI/|archivedate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and [[equal opportunity]] to people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization: Overview|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414173026/http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview|archivedate=14 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."&lt;ref name=WAI /&gt; Many countries regulate [[web accessibility]] as a requirement for websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal and Policy Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/pol|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405142512/http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/pol|archivedate=5 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; International co-operation in the W3C [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using [[assistive technology]].&lt;ref name=WAI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401074742/http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php|archivedate=1 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internationalisation ==
The W3C [[Internationalization and localization|Internationalisation]] Activity assures that web technology works in all languages, scripts, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internationalization (I18n) Activity|url=http://www.w3.org/International/|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=10 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416052903/http://www.w3.org/International/|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2004 or 2005, [[Unicode]] gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both [[ASCII]] and Western European as the Web's most frequently used [[character encoding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Davis, Mark|title=Moving to Unicode 5.1|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html|date=5 April 2008|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521191341/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html|archivedate=21 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally {{IETF RFC|3986}} allowed resources to be identified by [[URI]] in a subset of US-ASCII. {{IETF RFC|3987}} allows more characters—any character in the [[Universal Character Set]]—and now a resource can be identified by [[Internationalized Resource Identifier|IRI]] in any language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=World Wide Web Consortium Supports the IETF URI Standard and IRI Proposed Standard|url=http://www.w3.org/2004/11/uri-iri-pressrelease.html|date=26 January 2005|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=10 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207070535/http://www.w3.org/2004/11/uri-iri-pressrelease.html|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web caching ==
A [[web cache]] is a server computer located either on the public Internet, or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request. Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.

After graduating from Carmen Bozello de Huyke High School, she attended the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez|Mayagüez Campus of the University of Puerto Rico]] where she earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Chemistry]].&lt;ref name="manoa.hawaii.edu"/&gt; After teaching to middle and high school students for a year and a half, Sierra-Sastre participated as a post-baccalaureate in an internship at Stanford University, where she was first introduced to nanotechnology research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hercampus.com/school/uprm/yajaira-sierra-sastre-life-mars|title=Yajaira Sierra Sastre: Life on Mars?|work=Her Campus|access-date=2018-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she was trained in the self-assembly of mono-molecular films. Upon returning to [[Puerto Rico]], she enrolled in graduate Environmental Health courses at the School of Public Health at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Science Campus and graduate Chemistry courses at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras]]. Sierra-Sastre then attended [[Cornell University]], where she earned a [[Ph.D.]] in 2009 in [[Materials Chemistry|materials chemistry]] and  [[nanotechnology]] and specialized in the nanofabrication of semi-conductor nanowires.&lt;ref name="HSN"&gt;[http://www.elnuevodia.com/laborinquenamaspequena-1222612.html "La Borinqueña’ más pequeña"; El Nuevo Dia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-noticias/details/yajaira-sierra-one-step-closer-to-becoming-first-puerto-rican-woman-in-spac/17115/ |title=Yajaira Sierra One Step Closer to Becoming First Puerto Rican Woman in Space |publisher=Hispanicallyspeakingnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As part of her doctoral studies, Sierra-Sastre researched at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="manoa.hawaii.edu" /&gt; 

==NASA's Mars simulation project==
NASA realized that, in long duration missions, astronauts do not eat enough. They experience "menu fatigue" and their overall food intake declines, which puts them at risk of nutritional deficiency, loss of bone and muscle mass, and [[lethargy]]. The NASA Human Research Program is funding a project called "[[HI-SEAS]]," an [[acronym]] for “Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation,” to determine the best way to keep astronauts well nourished during multiple-year missions to [[Mars]] or the moon.&lt;ref name="HSN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2012/07/10/video-six-person-crew-selected-for-nasa-mars-food-mission/ |title=VIDEO: NASA Mars food mission crew named |publisher=Bigislandvideonews.com |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planetary module was built on the Hawaiian island of [[Mauna Loa]], which simulates the living conditions for astronauts at a future base on Mars. It is believed that the saddle area side of the island resembles a Martian environment.&lt;ref name="HSN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCN"/&gt;

After receiving more than 700 applications for positions as crew members of the simulated Mars mission, NASA and researchers from Cornell University and the University of Hawaii at Mānoa chose six astronaut-like individuals. Sierra-Sastre was part of the selected crew with qualifications similar to those required by NASA for their astronaut applicants. The other five are Dr. Oleg Abramov, Simon Engler, Kate Greene, Sian Proctor and [[Angelo Vermeulen]]. Three additional individuals will make up the reserve crew.&lt;ref name="HSN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCN"/&gt;

Prior to the four-month mission, which began on March 2013, the crew participated in a two-week training session. Once the mission began the crew was not to be allowed to have any communication with the outside world, except for limited [[e-mail]]. If they step outside the module they will have to wear simulated space suits. During the mission they will test new forms of food and food preparation strategies for [[Outer space|deep-space]] travel.&lt;ref name="HSN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCN"/&gt;

Sierra-Sastre and her colleagues emerged from the space habitat on August 13, ending the four-month simulated mission. According to Sierra-Sastre and the scientists involved in the mission, the food ingredients that will be essential for future space missions on Mars or the moon will include spices, herbs and hot sauce. Also comfort foods such as [[Nutella]], peanut butter and margarine. Plus, certain foods which contain ingredients which are rich in fiber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/22360-mars-food-mock-space-mission-hawaii.html "Mars Food Scientists End 4-Month Mock Space Mission In Hawaii"; by Mike Wall, SPACE.com Senior Writer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronaut applicant==
In November 2011, NASA announced 15 available positions for its team of astronauts. Sierra-Sastre sent her application in January 2012. Her participation in the Mars project puts her one step closer to achieving her dream of becoming the first female Puerto Rican astronaut.&lt;ref name="HSN"/&gt;

Sierra-Sastre lives in [[Ithaca, New York]]. She is a freelance educator working with disadvantaged school districts and communities in Puerto Rico. Sierra-Sastre is also a research scientist and program manager at the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]'s (BEP's) Office of Technology Development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==The smallest U.S. National Anthem ever written==
Sierra-Sastre also collaborates in a variety of projects with the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network and the Cornell Nanoscale Facility, which included writing the smallest [[The Star-Spangled Banner|US National Anthem]] ever written, ''[[La Borinqueña|La Borinqueña Más Pequeña]]'' (the Puerto Rican national anthem).&lt;ref name="MCN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cienciapr.org/podcasts.php DCiencias PR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428045616/http://cienciapr.org/podcasts.php |date=April 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the scientific works which she has co-authored is the 2008 article&lt;ref name="Picraux Research Group"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cint.lanl.gov/picraux_research.shtml |title=Picraux Research Group |publisher=Cint.lanl.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Vertical Growth of [[Germanium|Ge]] Nanowires from Biotemplated [[Gold|Au]] Nanoparticle Catalysts,"'' published in the [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]], volume 130, issue 10488.&lt;ref name="Picraux Research Group"/&gt;
