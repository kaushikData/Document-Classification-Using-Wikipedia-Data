'''Alexander Khristoforovich Vostokov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Алекса́ндр Христофо́рович Восто́ков}}; {{OldStyleDate|27 March|1781|March 16}} – {{OldStyleDate|20 February|1864|8 February}}) was one of the first [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n [[philologist]]s.&lt;ref name="slovari"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ru:Востоков Александр Христофорович (1781–1864) |url=http://www.slovari.ru/default.aspx?s=0&amp;p=1905|accessdate=7 January 2012|publisher=Учреждение Российской академии наук Институт русского языка им. В. В. Виноградова РАН и ООО "Словари.ру"|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born into a [[Baltic German]] family in [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]], [[Governorate of Livonia]], and studied at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. As a natural son of Baron von [[Osten-Sacken]], he received the name Osteneck, which he later chose to render into Russian as Vostokov (''Ost'', the German word for "east," translates to ''vostok'' in Russian).&lt;ref name="slovari"/&gt; He liked to experiment with language and, in one of his poems, introduced the female name [[Svetlana]], which would gain popularity through [[Vasily Zhukovsky]]'s eponymous ballad.

During his lifetime, Vostokov was known as a poet and translator, but it is his innovative studies of [[Metre (poetry)|versification]] and comparative Slavonic grammars which proved most influential. In 1815, he joined the staff of the [[Imperial Public Library]], where he discovered the most ancient dated book written in Slavonic vernacular, the so-called [[Ostromir Gospel]]. In 1841, Vostokov was elected to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="slovari"/&gt;

Vostokov's works on the [[Church Slavonic language]] were considered a high-water mark of [[Slavic studies]] until the appearance of [[Izmail Sreznevsky]]'s comprehensive lexicon in 1893–1903 and garnered him the doctorates [[honoris causa]] from the [[Charles University]] and [[University of Tübingen]].

Vostokov also laid foundations of modern Russian [[toponymy]]. In 1812, he published an article with the title "An example to the amateurs of etymology" ({{lang-ru|link=no|Задача любителям этимологии}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Востоков |first=Александр Христофорович |year=1812 |script-title=ru:Задача любителям этимологии |journal= Сакт-Петербургский вестник |location=Saint Petersburg |volume=4.1. |issue=2 |pages=204–288 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that  geographical names ([[toponym]]s) have repeating elements which he called ''formants'' and which help to restore the etymology of the name. For instance, the endings -va, -ga, and -ma in the end of such names as the Sylva, the Onega, and the Kama, may mean "water" in the languages these names originate from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jur-portal.ru/work.pl?act=handbook_read&amp;subact=960140&amp;id=467477 |script-title=ru:Древние тайны русского слова "Тюмень" |last=Полищук |first=В.

'''''Before Adam''''' is a novel by [[Jack London]], serialized in 1906 and 1907 in ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="SonomaEdu-BeforeAdam"/&gt; It is the story of a man who dreams he lives the life of an early [[hominid]].

The story offers an early view of human evolution. The majority of the story is told through the eyes of the man's hominid alter ego, one of the Cave People. In addition to the Cave People, there are the more advanced Fire People, and the more animal-like Tree People.

Other characters include the hominid's father, a love interest, and Red-Eye, a fierce "[[atavism]]" that perpetually terrorizes the Cave People. A [[Saber-toothed cat|sabre-cat]] also plays a role in the story.

[[File:Bewareofdog.JPG|thumb|Notice at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]]]]

'''Beware of the dog''' (also rendered as '''Beware of dog''') is a [[warning sign]] indicating that a dangerous dog is within. Such signs may be placed to deter [[burglary]] even if there is no dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How young house burglars choose targets|author=R Wright, RH Logie|journal=The Howard Journal of Criminal Justice|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Deconstructing the fort|author=C Wilkinson|journal=Journal of Australian Studies|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Warning signs of this sort have been found in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] buildings such as the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in [[Pompeii]], which contains a [[mosaic]] with the caption ''[[cave canem]]'' ({{IPA-la|ˈka.weː ˈka.nẽ|pron}}). Some suppose that these warnings may sometimes have been intended to prevent visitors from stepping upon small, delicate dogs of the [[Italian Greyhound]] type.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OI6G9fCwlwC&amp;pg=PR7|pages=10–11|year=2004|title=The Rosetta bone|isbn=978-0-7645-4421-7|author=Cheryl S. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Under [[English law]], placing such a sign does not relieve the owner of responsibility for any harm which may come to people attacked by the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Commentaries on the Liberty of the Subject and the Laws of England|author=James Paterson|year=1877|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A treatise on the law of torts|page=285|author=[[Charles G.

[[File:Butuan Silver Paleograph.jpg|thumb|left|250px|frame|The Butuan Silver Paleograph, housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Manila]].]]
The '''Butuan Silver Palaeograph''', also known as the "Butuan Silver Strip", is a piece of [[metal]] with inscriptions found in [[Butuan City|Butuan]] province in mid-1970s by a team of [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] from the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] of the [[Philippines]]. Treasure hunters who were looking for old [[ceramic]]s and [[gold]] [[Jewellery|ornament]]s discovered this metal strip inside a wooden [[coffin]]. Coffins of the same type, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, were found at the site. According to Dr. Jesus Peralta, found inside were human remains with artificially deformed [[Human skull|skull]]s - a practice in this region limited to Southern Philippines and unpopular in [[Luzon]]. Due to the similarities found between the coffins, it is reasonable for archaeologists to assume that the latter came from that same era. Debate, however, arose regarding the origin of the said artifact, but until now, it is considered to belong to Butuan where it was found. Dr. Boechari of [[Indonesia]], said Peralta, identified the writings as very close to a [[Javanese script]] that existed from the 12th to the 15th century. This yet-to-be-deciphered Butuan palaeograph is now in the hands of Proceso Gonzales, the city engineer of Butuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/mystery/silver.htm|author=Santos, Hector|title=The Butuan Silver Strip.

'''Choquequirao''' (possibly from [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''chuqi'' metal, ''k'iraw'' [[infant bed|crib]], cot)&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) (5-vowel-system)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ref Bertonio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Inca Empire|Incan]] site in south [[Peru]], similar in structure and architecture to [[Machu Picchu]]. The ruins are buildings and terraces at levels above and below Sunch'u Pata, the truncated hill top. The hilltop was anciently leveled and ringed with stones to create a 30 by 50&amp;nbsp;m platform.

Choquequirao at an elevation of {{convert|3050|m|ft}} &lt;ref name="promperu"/&gt;) is in the spurs of the [[Vilcabamba mountain range|Vilcabamba]] mountain range in  the Santa Teresa district,  [[Anta Province|La Convención Province]] of the [[Cusco Region]]. The complex is 1,800&amp;nbsp;hectares, of which 30–40% is excavated.&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"/&gt; The site overlooks the [[Apurimac River]] canyon which has an elevation of {{convert|1450|m|ft}}.

The site is reached by a two-day hike from outside [[Cusco]].&lt;ref name="elcomercio.com.pe"&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca Trail to Choquequirao, El Comercio Newspaper, Lima, Peru, May 13, 2009, [Spanish&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416055304/http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/285557/ruinas-choquequirao-ultimo-refugio-inca |date=April 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choquequirao has topped in the prestigious  Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2017 Top Regions list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/noticia-peru-choquequirao-tops-lonely-planets-best-in-travel-2017-list-637078.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Choquequirao is a 15th and 16th century settlement associated with the Inca Empire, or more correctly [[Tahuantinsuyo]].&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; The site had two major growth stages. This could be explained if [[Pachacuti]] founded Choquequirao and his son, [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Inca Yupanqui]], remodeled and extended it after becoming the [[Sapa Inca]].&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choquequirao is located in the area considered to be Pachacuti’s estate; which includes the areas around the rivers Amaybamba, Urabamba, Vilcabamba, Victos and Apurímac. Other sites in this area are [[Sayhuite]], [[Machu Picchu]], Chachabamba ''(Chachapampa)'', Choquesuysuy ''(Chuqisuyuy)'' and Guamanmarca ''(Wamanmarka)''; all of which share similar architectural styles with Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;
The architectural style of several important features appears to be of [[Chachapoya]] design, suggesting that Chachapoya workers were probably involved in the construction. This suggests that Tupaq Inka probably ordered the construction. Colonial documents also suggest that Tupac Inca ruled Choquequirao since his great grandson, Tupa Sayri, claimed ownership of the site and neighboring lands during Spanish colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the last bastions of resistance and refuge of the Son of the Sun (the "Inca"), [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], who fled [[Cusco]] after his siege of the city failed in 1535.

According to the Peruvian Tourism Office, "Choquequirao was probably one of the entrance check points to the [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and also an administrative hub serving political, social and economic functions. Its urban design has followed the symbolic patterns of the imperial capital, with ritual places dedicated to ''[[Inti]]'' (the Incan sun god) and the ancestors, to the earth, water and other divinities, with mansions for administrators and houses for artisans, warehouses, large dormitories or kallankas and farming terraces belonging to the Inca or the local people. Spreading over 700 meters, the ceremonial area drops as much as 65 meters from the elevated areas to the main square."&lt;ref name="promperu"&gt;[http://www.peru.travel/en/culture/archaeology/choquequirao-1122-2-567-4.1.14 Choquequirao, Peru's Tourism Office, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The city also played an important role as a link between the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Jungle]] and the city of [[Cusco]].

=== Discovery ===
According to Ethan Todras-Whitehill of the New York Times, Choquequirao's first non-Incan visitor was the [[explorer]] [[Juan Arias Díaz]] in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/travel/03inca.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 Ethan Todras-Whitehill on the New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; The first written site reference in 1768 was made by [[Cosme Bueno]], but was ignored at the time.

The Prefect of the Province of Apurimac, J.J. Nuñez, encouraged [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] to visit the 'Cradle of Gold', in order to discover any Incan treasure.  Bingham was a delegate to the 1908 First Pan American Scientific Congress and was in Cusco at the time.  Bingham decided to visit Choquequirao in 1909 to determine if it was [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcapampa]], the Capital of the last four Incas.  He found three groups of buildings, mummified bodies, and places where dynamite had been used in the search of treasure.  Visitors who had recorded their names included Count de Sartiges, Jose Maria Tejada and Marcelino Leon, 1834, Jose Benigno Samanez, Juan Manuel Rivas Plata and Mariana Cisneros, 1861, and three Almanzas, Pio Mogrovejo, and their treasure hunting workmen, 1885.  However, Bingham decided it was merely a frontier fortress, and tempted him to search further.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=Hiram|title=Lost City of the Incas|date=1952|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|isbn=9781842125854|pages=112–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and layout ==
Choquequirao is situated at an elevation of 3,000&amp;nbsp;m above sea level on a southwest-facing spur of a glaciated peak above the [[Apurimac River]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The region is characterized by mountain topography and covered with Amazonian flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is 98&amp;nbsp;km west of Cusco, in the Vilcabamba range. The complex covers 6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Architecturally it is similar to Machu Picchu. The main structures, such as temples, [[huaca]]s, elite residences, and fountain/bath systems are concentrated around two plazas along the crest of the ridge, which encompass approximately 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and follow Inca urban design. Also there is a conglomeration of common buildings clustered away from the plaza. Excavations and surface items suggest they were probably used for workshops and food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings are well-preserved and well-restored; restoration continues.

The terrain around the site was greatly modified. The central area of the site was leveled artificially and the surrounding hillsides were terraced to allow cultivation and small residential areas.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.214"/&gt; The typical Inca terraces form the largest constructions on site.

Many of the ceremonial structures are associated with water. There are two unusual temple ''wak'a'' sites that lie several hundred meters lower than the two plazas. These are carefully crafted step terraces down a steep slope are designed around water.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The site also contains a number of ceremonial structures such as the large ''[[ushnu|usnu]]'' built on a truncates hill, the Giant Staircase, and an aqueduct providing water to the water shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sectors===
The archaeological complex of Choquequirao is divided into 12 sectors. While the contents of each sector are different, terraces used for various purposes are common throughout. It seems that most of the buildings here were either for ceremonial purposes, residences of the priests, or used to store food.
    
* Sector I is the highest and most northerly portion of the site. There exist 5 buildings constructed on terraces at varying levels, a temple and a plaza, as well as a smaller plaza in the uppermost area of the sector. Two of the buildings appear to be ''[[qullqa]]s'' (warehouses). The three long buildings, called ''kallankas'' were likely priests’ residences.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel.(2008). p. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector II is where a majority of the ''qullqanpatas'', or depositories are located. In one part of this sector there are 16 ceremonial platforms with canal routes in between that branch off from the main water way.&lt;ref name="Burga"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector III is between the ''hanan'' (high) area and the ''urin'' (low) area of the complex and contains what is believed to be the Haucaypata ''(Hawkaypata)'', or main plaza. At the periphery of the plaza there are one story and two story buildings. To the north, there is a ''Sunturwasi'' and a single level ''kallanka'' likely used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; To the east are the buildings with two levels. The main plaza is discussed in more detail in the section called '''Ceremonial Center''' of this page.
* Sector IV is located in the southerly area of the complex, known as the ''urin'' zone. The main building here has walls that were probably ceremonial in function since one of them is known as “wall of offerings to the ancestors”.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt;
* Sector V is the location of the ''usnu'' which is a hill leveled at the summit to form an oval platform used for ceremony.&lt;ref name="Burga" /&gt; A small wall encircles the hill. From the platform, one can see the main plaza of sector III, the snowcapped mountains and the Apurímac River.
* Sector VI, south of the ''usnu'' in the ''urin'' area, it has the ''Wasi Kancha'' ("house yard"), also known as the priests' quarters. There are four terraces here that were used as ceremonial space.&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the walls of the terraces there is a zigzagged design.
* Sector VII can be reached from the main plaza by pathway. Located on the east side of Choquequirao, this zone contains cultivation terraces that have markedly greater amplitude than all others throughout the complex.
* Sector VIII, on the western side of the complex, has 80 cultivation terraces divided into plots by water canals that stream down from the main plaza. In this zone, one will find the famous "Llamas del Sol".&lt;ref&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector IX contains general living quarters for groups of people, such as workers or families. The buildings are constructed on top of artificial platforms in circular and rectangular design, interconnected by stairways and narrow alleys.
* Sector X, called ''paraqtepata'', has 18 terraced platforms that have irrigation canals running parallel to the stairs.&lt;ref name="manuel"&gt;Burga, Manuel. (2008). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sector XI has 80 terraces used for cultivation, called ''phaqchayuq'' ("the one with a waterfall"), which are the most extensive in the entire complex.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt; Also found here are small, quadrilateral enclosures with two levels used for both ceremony and living. Outside, there are three water fountains used for drinking and to supply the irrigation canals.
* Sector XII lies three hours away (by foot) from the upper part of the complex. Here there are 57 platforms with permanent irrigation systems. In the uppermost terraces there are buildings for ceremony and a pool of water fed by a spring. In the semicircular enclosures ceramic shards, stone tools and remains of bones have been found.&lt;ref name="manuel" /&gt;

===Ceremonial center===
The ceremonial center of Choquequirao shares many features similar to those of other Inca ceremonial centers and pilgrimage sites, such as Isla del Sol, Quespiwanka (''Qhispi Wank'a'', palace of [[Huayna Capac]]), Machu Picchu/[[Llaqtapata]], [[Tipon]] and Saywite. The long and treacherous route from Cusco to Choquequirao likely passed by Machu Picchu, leading onto the face of Machu Picchu Peak. From Llaqtapata, the path continued down into the Mollepata Valley, traversed the Yanamia pass at 4670 m, and continued across the Rio Blanco, finally reaching Choquequirao from above after an estimated 7- to 10-day journey.&lt;ref name=Malville&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremonial center consists of a main platform and a lower plaza. Stone lined channels carried ceremonial water, or chicha to shrines and baths throughout the site. The main platform, unique in its size and prominence, limited ceremonial activity to royalty and the ministerial class. This seems as such due to evidence showing that the only entrance to the platform was through a double-jam doorway, which functioned to control access to the sacred space.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Other features of the ceremonial center include structures that mark the direction of certain solar events, such as when the June and December solstice sun rises and sets.
 
Located in the main platform, the Giant Stairway opens to the sunrise of the December solstice. Measured at 25 meters long and 4.4 meters wide, this structure seems to have been purely ceremonial in function, since the stairs end abruptly partway down a hill, leading to nothing. Large boulders that rest upon the risers of the stairway become fully illuminated when the December solstice sun rises. Gary R. Ziegler and J. McKim Malville have postulated that when the boulders become illuminated, a ''wak'a'' is activated by its solar camaquen—a case similar to when the large stone of the Torreon at Machu Picchu becomes illuminated.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt;
 
In the lower plaza a group of structures were found that appeared to be water shrines and baths. This belief is held based on their strong resemblance to those at sector II of Llaqtapata and because there are numerous water channels leading to that portion of the plaza.&lt;ref name=Malville/&gt; Overall, it seems as though the site was chosen, as Machu Picchu was, for its sacred geographical location, and was designed to facilitate ritual and ceremonial activity.

===Subsectors===
The area around Choquequiaro contains several subsectors that have been associated with the Inca culture that thrived in Choquequirao, suggesting that the subsectors are most likely part of the site. Design, construction style, and cultural parallels support that these sectors were tightly intertwined with Choquequiaro and the Inca at some point in their history. The lack of residential space in these sectors suggests that these were probably farming outposts from Choquequirao rather than an independent site.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to differences in design and construction styles, it is believed that these sectors were built in three different phases.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Choquequirao art style, the subsector also contains multiple camelid art and ceremonial ''phaqchas'' that are tightly related to Inca, especially Pachacuti’s government.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
All lithic materials utilized for the construction of the site and surrounding sectors were mined from the local quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2008, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[metamorphic rock]] in the quarries of Choquequirao, superb masonry like that at Machu Picchu could not be obtained. Instead, the entrances and corners were shaped from [[quartzite]], and the walls were made of achlar and plastered with clay and then painted in a light orange color.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, pp.164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Most of the rock art in Choquequirao is in the terraced area where cultivation occurred. Archaeologists have documented twenty-five semi-naturalistic figures on the terraces of sector VIII of Choquequirao. The rocks used to build the walls are dark [[schist]] while the camelid images are of white [[calcocuarcita]], a sandstone of quartz and carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, pp.214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; The camelid motifs vary between a maximum height of 1.94&amp;nbsp;m and one minimum of 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría López 2009, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, archaeologist Zenobio Valencia from the University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco found several camelid figurines made of white stones in a group of terraces in one sector of the archaeological site.&lt;ref name="Echevarría López 2009, p.213"/&gt;

One recent discovery for example, uncovered a scene laid into the stone terraces with white quartzite depicting several llamas loaded with cargo standing by their handlers. Present on the uppermost terrace wall is a zigzag pattern of the same quartzite. This style of design is uniquely [[Chachapoya]] and not found in other sites of Inca construction, indicating that workers from Chachapoya may have been involved in the construction of Choquequirao.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler 2011, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
Presently the only way to access Choquequirao is by a hard hike. The common trail head begins at the village of San Pedro de Cachora,&lt;ref name="Horizon Guides"&gt;[https://horizontravelpress.com/guides/trekking-to-machu-picchu-013 Trekking To Machu Picchu, Horizon Guides, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; which is approximately a 4-hour drive from Cuzco, along the Cusco-Abancay route. Another access point is from Huanipaca village, whose crossroad is located on the same route Cusco-Abancay, 4–5&amp;nbsp;km beyond the Cachora crossroad. Huanipaca offers a 15&amp;nbsp;km trail, half distance less than Cachora trail (31&amp;nbsp;km). Over 5,000 people trekked to Choquequirao in 2013. From Choquequirao it is possible to continue hiking to Machu Picchu. Most treks range from 7-day to 11-day hikes, and involve going over the Yanama Pass, which at 4,668&amp;nbsp;m is the highest point on the trek.

The construction of the cable car to Choquequirao has been declared a priority by the [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac Regional Government]], which are destined to receive 220 million Peruvian Soles (US$82.7 million) to fund the project. It will reduce a two-day hike to a 15-minute cable car ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salazar|first=Carla|title=Tramway planned for Machu Picchu’s ‘sister city’|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tramway-planned-machu-picchus-sister-city-065213029.html|work=AP Travel|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Canales, president of the National Chamber of Tourism (Canatur) believes that in the first year of operation the Choquequirao cable car will receive 200,000 tourists, which will generate an income of US$4 million, with the average visitor paying US$20 per ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Choquequirao recibiría 600 mil viajeros en el 2018 con teleférico|url=http://elcomercio.pe/turismo/1506503/noticia-apurimac-recibiria-600-mil-viajeros-2018-gracias-teleferico-choquequirao?ft=grid|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6529">The '''Council for the Development of French in Louisiana''' ('''CODOFIL'''; {{lang-fr|le Conseil pour le développement du français en Louisiane}}) is Louisiana's Office of Francophone Affairs ({{lang-fr|Agence des affaires francophones}}). It is a state agency whose multiple legislative mandates include developing opportunities to use the [[French language]] in tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=216790]." SB800 by Senator Eric Lafleur. Retrieved on July 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; CODOFIL is governed by a board of 23 members and administratively placed within the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development's Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism, overseen by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana|Lieutenant Governor]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/culture/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707134249/http://www.crt.state.la.us/culture/ |archivedate=2013-07-07 |df= }}." CODOFIL. Retrieved on July 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; CODOFIL is the only state agency in the United States whose purpose is to serve a linguistic population.

Today, CODOFIL's role is to promote and support French immersion and French as a second language in education; it acts as a partner to the [[Louisiana Department of Education]] (LDOE), whose role is to manage Louisiana's school districts. CODOFIL continues to recruit and sponsor French, Belgian and Canadian associate teachers as per its accords with those countries, who are placed alongside local teachers upon LDOE's recommendation. CODOFIL encourages Louisiana Francophones to continue transmission of the state's heritage language via its scholarship program (providing opportunities for pedagogical advancement) and the Escadrille Louisiane program (which allows non-native speakers to perfect French at the Université de Rennes in exchange for a minimum 3-year teaching commitment of French in Louisiana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consulfrance-nouvelleorleans.org/The-Escadrille-Louisiane-Project.html] Retrieved on August 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

CODOFIL has also worked to instill pride all Louisiana Francophones in their linguistic identity rather than to uphold one variety of French language or another.&lt;ref name="Bernard"&gt;Shane K. Bernard, The ''Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2003), pp. xx, xxii–xxiii, 18–19, 33–34, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and vision==
CODOFIL's mission is to "work toward the creation of an eco-system that permits the development of French in the economic, educational, cultural and professional sectors and in which Louisiana's French and Creole speakers are valorized in their cultural and linguistic identity." It seeks to "provide access to economic, educational, cultural and professional opportunities in French to all Louisianians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iberianet.com/news/i-m-cajun-and-proud-bills-in/article_be7b927c-a384-11e2-8906-0019bb2963f4.html|title='I'm Cajun and  proud' bills in|first=SARAH BLANCHARD,THE DAILY|last=IBERIAN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board==
CODOFIL originally consisted of a chairman and an advisory committee, all appointed by the governor of Louisiana. Today it is administered by a president, an executive director, and a board of as many as 23 non-paid directors. In addition to the governor, various Louisiana organizations nominate and select board members, who serve for a term of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/louisiana/la-laws/louisiana_revised_statutes_25-651|title=» Louisiana Revised Statutes 25:651 – Creation; domicile; purposesLawServer|website=www.lawserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[James R. Domengeaux]], a former state legislator and former United States Congressman of ethnic French descent, was the driving force behind CODOFIL's creation. A semi-retired attorney at the time, Domengeaux began his crusade for restoring French in Louisiana after Senator [[Edgar G. "Sonny" Mouton, Jr.]], of Lafayette obtained passage of an "urge-and-request" resolution for Louisiana school boards to help reverse the decline of the use of the French language within the state. Domengeaux traveled around Louisiana to gain support for his campaign to make Louisiana a bilingual state through French language education. By the spring of 1968, Domengeaux had gained enough interest from the public and support from officials, to present his plan to the legislature. Legislators, such as [[J. Burton Angelle]] of [[Breaux Bridge, Louisiana|Breaux Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/politics/state/2015/08/29/angelle-local-guy-long-term-vision/71398046/|title=Angelle: Local guy with a long-term vision|author=Ken Stickney|date=August 29, 2015|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Town Talk]]|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
voted to create CODOFIL, and the measure was signed into law in July 1968 by Governor [[John McKeithen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Master of Arts |chapter=1 |title="CODOFIL: A Case Study of an Ethnic Interest Group"|last=Simon |first=Anne |year=1977 |publisher=University of Southwestern Louisiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law empowered CODOFIL to "do any and all things necessary to accomplish the development, utilization, and preservation of the French language ... for the cultural, economic, and tourist[ic] benefit of the State."

==Criticism==
CODOFIL's early efforts to introduce French language education in public classrooms were criticized by many observers. They criticized its emphasis on international French instead of that common to Louisiana, and its use of [[Francophonie|Francophone]] teachers from [[France]], Switzerland, [[Belgium]], and [[Canada]], rather than local teachers. Administrators were said to be deprecating toward the Cajun culture it claimed to be saving.

===''The Death of Superman'' (2018)===
{{Main|The Death of Superman (film)}}

When a monster, nicknamed [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]], crashes down to Earth, it begins a destructive rampage which triggers the [[Justice League]] and later [[Lex Luthor]] to come and stop it. When all attempts fail, they come to realization they need [[Superman]] to kill it.

Despite the story being previously adapted in the first animated movie (though not in the DCAMU), ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', this said movie greatly altered and condensed the original comic story to fit it within a 75-minute runtime. ''The Death of Superman'' was written to be much more faithful to the original story; according to DC's Tim Beedle, the film is "much less condensed and will include many of the fan-favorite moments from the story that were left out of ''Doomsday''".&lt;ref name="dcblogannounce"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beedle|first1=Tim|title=The Death and Return of Superman Gets a Two-Part Animated Movie|url=https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/07/21/the-death-and-return-of-superman-gets-a-two-part-animated-movie|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|accessdate=April 16, 2018|date=July 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417025118/https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/07/21/the-death-and-return-of-superman-gets-a-two-part-animated-movie|archive-date=April 17, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, high-precision [[radiocarbon dating in Hawaii]] using chonometric hygiene analysis, and taxonomic identification selection of samples, puts the initial first settlement of the Hawaiian Islands sometime between 1219 and 1266 C.E., originating from earlier settlements first established in the Society Islands around 1025 to 1120 C.E.,&lt;ref&gt;Janet M.

== Ancient Hawaiian population ==
{{main article|Ancient Hawaiian population}}
The frequently hypothesized model of constant population growth is that once people first arrived the population growth was constant until [[James Cook]]'s arrival and thus halted by disease and then rapidly decreased. This theory though relies on a hypothetical settlement date that [[Radiocarbon Dating in Hawaii|radiocarbon dating in Hawai'i]] has since refuted as well as linear growth on the islands. Notwithstanding this, this theory is still used to support an estimate of between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Stannard, Before the Horror: The Population of Hawai'i on the Eve of Western Contact (Honolulu: Social Science Research Institute, U of Hawaii, 1989) 66-67g&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant population growth theory of Hawaii has scant support from the archaeological data and this is contradicted by paleo-environmental evidence and radiocarbon dating of historical sites. Because as the population increases so does their imprint on the land as more and more people would require more and more food, light, and heat; thus there would be more fires, and thus more wood charcoal produced correlated to the number of people. Accordingly, the evidence indicates rather an interesting model of arrested population growth, especially as a consequence of island life. This theory finds corroboration in archaeological censuses of abandoned habitation sites on leeward Hawai'i island and Kaho'olawe Island which indicate that population levels reached a peak before Cook's arrival &lt;ref&gt;The Hawaiian Journal of History, vol. 28 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The arrested-growth model fits well with an estimated pre-contact-era population of between 100,000 and 150,000, derived primarily from the study of historical records.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Schmitt and Lynn Y. S. Zane, "How Many People Have Ever Lived in Hawaii?," unpublished typescript (Honolulu: Hawai'i State Department of Business and Economic Development Library, 1977);&lt;/ref&gt;

Population estimates based on an initial discovery and settlement of Hawaii settlement date, of around AD 1150, and a proposed growth rate at the highest in the world, and relying on the paleo-environmental evidence of early human impact on the land completely contradicts the constant population growth theory. Instead, the estimated population curve can be divided into three sections, pre-settlement where there were no people, the initial settlement growth phase of approximately 100 people around 1150 AD to the population peak in 1450 of approximately 150,000 people. The third phase between 1450 and 1778 reflected a relatively stable population, where apparent declines were followed by periods of growth.

Simply and briefly, as the population grew so did their agricultural imprint (forest clearing by burning) and building of ''heiau'' at those sites, as well as the decline of plants. The paleo-environmental data showed that during 1450-1778 the pace of construction of ''heiau'' slowed dramatically as did the clearing of agricultural land. Accordingly, the estimated population in 1778 around Cook's arrival was between 110,000 and 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Dye|author2=Eric Komori|title=Pre-censal Population History of Hawai'i, |journal=New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 14 |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/482/1/JL28007.pdf|year=1992|publisher=NA|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Western contact syphilis ===
[[James Cook]] was not the first Westerner to visit Hawaii. Diseases to which Hawaiians lacked immunity may well have already been spread. Testing of a young woman's bones buried in O'ahu, dated sometime between AD 1422 and 1664 according to radiocarbon dating, indicated that she had congenital [[syphilis]], a disease which can leave a variety of distinctive marks on bone.&lt;ref&gt;Bertell D. Davis, Archaeological and Paleontological Investigations at the Proposed HECO Barbers Point Generating Station, Honouliuli, 'Ewa, O'ahu (Honolulu: International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The only possible explanation for syphilis in the pre-Cook era finds reference to traditional Hawaiian accounts of foreign shipwrecks as well as the presence of metal blades seen by James Cook upon landing in Kaua'i, later presumed to be from Japanese sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Fornander, An Account of the Polynesian Race 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis was introduced to Japan around 1512 by mariners who contracted the disease while in China. By 1600, approximately 39.4% of Japanese men contracted syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;Takao Suzuki, Palaeopathological and Palaeoepidemiological Study of Osseous Syphilis in Skulls of the Edo Period, Bulletin no. 23 (Tokyo: University Museum, U of Tokyo, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipwrecks ===
Hawaiian tradition does not record the nationalities of the [[shipwreck]]s on [[Maui]] in Kiwi, Kona in Hawaii or [[Kauai]] (legend has it they cohabited and had children with Hawaiians) except to characterize them as white people arriving between years 1521 and 1530 AD. Many scholars, however, believed them to be Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Fornander, An Account of the Polynesian Race 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; Records of Japanese sailors that were transmitted to their homeland during the Kamakura era state that Japanese boats landed at Makapu'u Point on the island of O'ahu in the year 1258. Further, in 1270, a separate group of Japanese sailors carrying sugar cane went ashore at Kahului, Maui.&lt;ref&gt;The Peopling of Hawaii, by Eleanor C. Nordyke, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metal blades seen by James Cook in Kaua'i ===
There are many parallels between Hawaiian and Japanese cultures; the similarity of Japanese knives to iron blades in the possession of Hawaiians at the time of Cook's first landing at Kaua'i is a prime example. These were thought to have developed through cultural contact, most likely through voyages from Japan to Hawai'i in the period A.D. 1550–1630.&lt;ref&gt;John F. G. Stokes, "Japanese Cultural Influences in Hawaii", Proceedings of the 5th
Pacific Science Congress (1934): 2792–2800&lt;/ref&gt; The shipping practices in shogunate Japan were highly regulated and show that there were up to a dozen successful voyages to Hawai'i from Japan between 1600 and 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Wythe E. Braden, "On the Probability of Pre-1778 Japanese Drifts to Hawaii", Hawaiian Journal of History 10 (1976): 75–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western contact ==
Economic and demographic factors in the 18th to 19th centuries reshaped the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. With unfamiliar diseases such as bubonic plague, leprosy, yellow fever, declining fertility, high infant mortality (infanticide) introduction of alcohol, and emigration off the islands or to larger cities for trade jobs the natives in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] fell from around 150,000 in 1778 to 71,000 by 1853. Alternatively, faced with depopulation and a changing economy [[Kamehameha I]] and others sought tradesmen, including navigators, blacksmith, armorer, carpenter, sailmakers, etc. These men could expect to receive a gift of land and one or more native wives if they agreed to stay.&lt;ref&gt;book:Colonizing Hawai'i: The Cultural Power of Law by Sally Engle Merry&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rapid depopulation ===
The rapid depopulation of the Hawaiian people is traced to many causes. Missionary William Ellis described deserted villages and abandoned enclosures which he attributed to "the frequent and desolating wars during [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha]]'s reign, the ravages of a pestilence brought in the first instance by foreign vessels, which has twice during the period [1778-1823] swept through the islands; the awful prevalence of infanticide; and the melancholy increase and destructive consequences of depravity and vice."&lt;ref&gt;The Peopling of Hawaii, by Eleanor C. Nordyke, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise Hawaii State Statistician Robert C. Schmitt explained the severe depopulation as a result of declining fertility, high infant mortality, and emigration.&lt;ref&gt;The Peopling of Hawaii, by Eleanor C. Nordyke, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawaiians' customs and land use system also caused a downward spiral in the population from which after the diseases they could not recover. Firstly, Hawaiians practiced population control with infanticide, abortion, and the like. By one estimate by William Ellis in 1823, nearly two-thirds of babies were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Anahulu: The Anthropology of History in the Kingdom of Hawaii, Volume 1, by Patrick Vinton Kirch pg 201&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the law of 1850 that abortion and infanticide was made illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Penal Code of the Hawaiian Islands, passed by the House of Nobles Chater XII&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the family unit was centered around a "punahele" or favored child; a firstborn who would inherit the grandparent's property and continue the kupuna kin group. In this system, grandparents were responsible to then feed not only their children, but also their children's children.&lt;ref&gt;Anahulu: The Anthropology of History in the Kingdom of Hawaii, Volume 1, by Patrick Vinton Kirch pg 200&lt;/ref&gt; Further families could simply not accommodate growing unless they were ceded new lands from a kupuna group or applied for new lands with the local konohiki and paid for with renewed acts of submission. During the nineteenth century young adults found other things to do than to go into servitude as a hoa'aina (tenant).&lt;ref&gt;Anahulu: The Anthropology of History in the Kingdom of Hawaii, Volume 1, by Patrick Vinton Kirch pg 200&lt;/ref&gt; Artemas Bishop at Ewa in 1845 stated, "the young people of both sexes are idlers of a most worthless character, and dependent, in most cases, upon others for their daily food. There is scarcely a truly respectable and industrious young person of adult age, among the uneducated classes."

Ultimately the family unit in Hawaiian culture was simply formed more for replacement rather than production.&lt;ref&gt;Anahulu: The Anthropology of History in the Kingdom of Hawaii, Volume 1, by Patrick Vinton Kirch pg 201&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whaling industry ===
Between 1820 and 1845 American commercial involvement in Hawai'i surged and so did the whaling industry. Between the first few ships in 1819 by the 1840s there some 400-500 ships which made semi-annual visits to the islands on their way back to New England Ports for provisions, recreation and labor.&lt;ref&gt;The History and Immigration of Asian Americans By Franklin Ng page 160&lt;/ref&gt; For instance a census of 1840 in Nantucket, Massachusetts, which was a center of whaling ships, indicates 793 Native Hawaiians had emigrated there alone.&lt;ref&gt;Historic Nantucket, Vol 56, No. 1 (Winter 2007) p. 14-16 link: http://www.nha.org/history/hn/HNwinter2007-lebo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early immigration ==
With fewer natives to work on the sugar plantations and the rapid depopulation from emigration on ships and whalers, recruiters started to fan out across Asia and Europe for more male labor. As a result, between 1850 and 1900 some 200,000 laborers from China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Portugal, Germany, Norway and elsewhere came to Hawaii under contracts. This greatly diversified the islands. While most left the sugar plantations on schedule, Hawaii was viewed by migrants as a place to earn money rather than settle and raise families (there was only one Chinese woman per seventeen Chinese males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ELEANOR C. NORDYKE and RICHARD K. C. LEE|title=The Chinese in Hawai'i: A Historical and Demographic Perspective|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/318/2/JL23224.pdf|year=1989|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the rising immigration, King [[Kamehameha V]] established the Board of Immigration to control the importation of foreign labor. Although  critical that Chinese male laborers were treated like slaves and whipped, the Hawaiian government asserted that the primary purpose was population reinforcement of the labor force to combat high mortality and depopulation off the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor C. Nordyke and Richard K. C. Lee|title=The Chinese in Hawai'i: A Historical and Demographic Perspective|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/318/2/JL23224.pdf|year=1989|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881, however, they were prohibiting immigration of Chinese men altogether for a period because of mistreatment and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald T. Takaki|title=Pau Hana: Plantation Life and Labor in Hawaii, 1835-1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD94ovK6Ej0C&amp;pg=PA22|year=1984|pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the ban on immigration, there were still large numbers of Chinese and Japanese who stayed after their contracts ended, creating a small Chinatown in [[Honolulu]]. By 1893, Chinese and Japanese male workers represented 51.9% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor C. Nordyke and Richard K. C. Lee|title=The Chinese in Hawai'i: A Historical and Demographic Perspective|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/318/2/JL23224.pdf|year=1989|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Hawaii was annexed in 1900, federal law applied and prohibited further Chinese immigration altogether. Koreans immigrated until 1905, and by 1908, a total of 180,000 Japanese workers had already arrived, though no more Japanese were allowed in after that. Ultimately, 50,000 Japanese workers remained permanently.&lt;ref&gt;Edward D.

[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|240px|The title page of the Shakespeare [[First Folio]], 1623]]
The term "'''folio'''", from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''folium'' (leaf),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beal | first = Peter | year = 2008 | contribution = folio | title = A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000 | edition = Online | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/ | accessdate = 22 November 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has three interconnected but distinct meanings in the world of books and printing.  It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way.  Secondly, it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly, an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size.

Firstly, a folio (abbreviated '''fo''' or '''2°''') is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded once to produce two [[leaf (books) |leaves]].  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. Ordinarily, additional printed folio sheets would be inserted inside one another to form a group or "gathering" of leaves prior to binding the book.

Secondly, "folio" is used in terms of [[page numbering]] for some books and most [[manuscript]]s that are bound but without page numbers as an equivalent of "page" (both sides), "sheet" or "leaf", using "[[recto and verso|recto]]" and "[[recto and verso|verso]]" to designate the first and second sides, and (unlike the usage in printing) disregarding whether the leaf concerned is actually physically still joined with another leaf. This usually appears abbreviated: "f26r." means the first side of the 26th leaf in a book.  This will be on the right hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as [[Latin script |Latin]] (as used in English), [[Cyrillic script |Cyrillic]], or [[Greek script |Greek]], and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as [[Hebrew script |Hebrew]] and [[Arabic script  |Arabic]].

Thirdly, ''folio'' is also used as an approximate term for a size of book, typically about {{convert |15|in|cm}} tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. Other common book formats are ''[[quarto]]'' and ''[[octavo]]'', which are both also printing formats, involving two and three folds in the sheet respectively.

Famous folios (in both senses) include the [[Gutenberg Bible]], printed in about 1455, and the [[First Folio]] collected edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, printed in 1623; however, their actual size is rather different.

== Format ==
A folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of folium, leaf &lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2d ed, (1989), on line access.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves.  Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a [[quarto]], folding each sheet twice, and [[octavo]], folding each sheet three times.  Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a [[Paper knife|paper-knife]].

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|left|Lenox copy of the Gutenberg bible printed in folio format.]]
There are variations in how folios are produced.  For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a folio (two leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a "folio in 8s." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald B. McKerrow]], ''An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students'', Oxford 1927 and later eds., p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gutenberg Bible]] was printed in about 1455 as a folio, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once.  The page size is 12 x 17.5 inches (307 x 445&amp;nbsp;mm), a "double folio" size.  Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside one another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book.  Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] edition is printed as a folio and has a page height of 12.5 inches (320&amp;nbsp;mm), making it a rather small folio size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/dl_crosscollex/brbldl/oneITEM.asp?pid=2018031&amp;iid=1071364&amp;srchtype= Beinecke Library, Yale]&lt;/ref&gt;

Folios were a common format of books printed in the [[incunabula]] period (books printed before 1501), although the earliest printed book, surviving only as a fragment of a leaf, is a [[Sibyllenbuch fragment|quarto]]. The [[British Library]] [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]] currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9450&amp;sort=idx-year Search of Incunabula Short Title Catalog for imprints before 1501, sorted by date.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  of which about 8,600 are folios,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=search&amp;rsid=9461&amp;sort=idx-year British Library, Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, search for imprints before 1501 and format as "fo", sorted by year.  Search done July 12, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; representing just over 30 percent of all works in the catalogue.

== Page numbering ==
[[File:Recto and verso.svg|thumb|230px|Left-to-right language books (such as English)]]
[[File:Recto and verso RTL.svg|thumb|230px|Right-to-left language books (such as Arabic)]]
{{Main|Recto and verso}}

In the discussion of manuscripts, a folio means a leaf with two pages, the [[recto]] being the first the reader encounters, and the [[verso]] the second. In Western books, which are read by turning the pages over from right to left, when the book is begun with the open page edges at the reader's right, the first page to be seen is "folio 1 recto", typically abbreviated to "f1 r.". When this page is turned over "f1 v." is on the left and "f2 r." on the right of the "opening", or two pages that are visible.  For books in Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and other languages, where the book is begun from the back in Western terms, with the open page edges at the reader's left, the numbering also follows the sequence in which the reader encounters.

In the discussion of two-columned manuscripts, a/b/c/d can denote the left and right-hand columns of recto and verso pages (e.g. "f. 150a" and "f. 150b" are the left and right hand columns on the recto page, and "f. 150c" and "f. 150d" the left and right hand columns on the verso page).  In the discussion of three-columned manuscripts, notation may make use of folio number + recto/verso + column a/b/c (e.g. "f. 3 v. col. c" references the third column on the verso side of the third folio).

== Size ==

The actual size of a folio book depends on the [[Paper size|size of the full sheet of paper]] on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, printers used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127&amp;nbsp;cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63&amp;nbsp;cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58&amp;nbsp;cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51&amp;nbsp;cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46&amp;nbsp;cm), and (the most common) Crown Folio (15 inches, ca 38&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trussel.com/books/booksize.htm|title=Book Sizes|work=trussel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time.  As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press).  The term "folio" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 15&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

== Shakespeare folios ==

From the earliest days of printing, folios were often used for expensive, prestigious volumes.   In the Seventeenth Century, plays of the [[English Renaissance theatre]] were printed as collected editions in folio.  Thirty-six of Shakespeare's plays, for example, were included in the [[First Folio]] collected edition of 1623, which was followed by additional folio editions, referred to as the [[Second Folio]], etc. Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in folio editions, such as [[Ben Jonson]]'s collected works of 1616.

'''''Giacomo Joyce''''' is a posthumously-published work by Irish writer [[James Joyce]]. Written in 1914, following the publication of ''[[Dubliners]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://theoxenofthesun.blogspot.com/2009/05/giacomo-joyce-by-james-joyce-love-me.html&lt;/ref&gt; it was published by [[Faber and Faber]] from sixteen handwritten pages by Joyce. In the free-form love poem, presented in the guise of a series of notes, Joyce attempts to penetrate the mind of a "dark lady", the object of an illicit love affair.

"Giacomo" is the Italian form of the author's forename, [[James (name)|James]].

Typically applications are [[unwrapping]]s (or rollouts)&lt;ref name="Abrollung_Silberbecher" /&gt;, [[profile cuts]] (or [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]])&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; as well as visualizations of [[distance]]s and [[curvature]], which can be exported as [[raster graphics]] or [[vector graphics]].

The retrieval of text in 3D like damaged cuneiform tablets or [[Weathering|weathered]] medieval [[headstones]]&lt;ref name="Spiegel_Heiliger_Sand" /&gt; using [[Multi-scale approaches|Multi Scale]] Integral Invariant (MSII)&lt;ref name="Dissertation_Mara" /&gt; [[Digital_image_processing#Filtering|filtering]] is a core function of the software. Futhermore small or faint surface details like [[fingerprints]] can be visualized.&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mara_Vortrag_2017" /&gt; The [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] of the 3D-models can be inspected, cleaned and repaired to provide optimal filtering results. The repaired datasets are suitable for [[3D printing]] and for [[Electronic publishing|digital publishing]] in a [[dataverse]].&lt;ref name="IWR_Dataverse" /&gt;

== Name and Logo ==
The name "GigaMesh" refers to processing of large 3D-datasets and relates intentional to the mythical [[Sumer|sumerian]] king [[Gilgamesh]] and his heroic epic described on a set of clay tablets.{{r|Dissertation_Mara|p=115}} The central element of the logo is the [[cuneiform]] sign [[wikt:𒆜|𒆜 (kaskal)]] meaning street or [[road junction]], which symbolizes the intersection of the [[humanities]] and [[computer science]]. The surrounding circle refers to the integral [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] computation using a [[sphere|spherical]] [[Domain of a function|domain]]. The color [[red]] is used by the Heidelberg University, where GigaMesh is developed.

== Development and application in research projects ==
The development began in 2009 and was inspired by the edition project ''Keilschrifttexte aus [[Assur]] literarischen Inhalts'' (KAL, cuneiform texts with literary content) of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt; In parallel it was applied within the Austrian [[Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum]] of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] for documentation of [[red-figure pottery]].&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; Current projects are funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] and the [[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung|BMBF]] for contextualization and analysis of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and sealings of the [[Corpus der minoischen und mykenischen Siegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DFG - GEPRIS - Minoische Siegelglyptik zwischen corpusartiger Erfassung und 3D-Forensik.

'''''His Master's Voice''''' is a [[satirical]] [[comedy]] series on [[BBC Radio 4]].  It is written by both [[Mark Tavener]], who also wrote the satirical novel ''[[In the Red (novel)|In The Red]]'' and the satirical radio series ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]'', and [[Steve Punt]].  Their writing satirises both the hard-right Conservatism and "caring Conservatism", along with the rest of British politics. Following Tavener's death in October 2007, no new series have been produced.

==Plot==
It is set in the office of a [[Conservative]] magazine called "The Blue Touch Paper" owned by South African media mogul Lord Malan ([[Robert Hardy]]).  To revive its failing sales, Malan hires a new editor Keith ([[Tony Gardner]]), who was previously the "[[tokenism|token]] [[Tory]]" at the left-wing ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' (and is thus nicknamed "Toynbee", after [[Polly Toynbee]] from the Guardian, by Malan).  This angers Anna ([[Amelia Bullmore]]), the magazine's political commentator (and its acting editor for the last 3 months), who had been hoping to become full editor.  

Much to the discontent of Malan and Anna, Keith then moves the magazine away from its traditional hard-right standpoint to views more in line with [[David Cameron]]'s new "[[Compassionate conservatism#In the United Kingdom|caring Conservatism]]", such as [[environmentalism]].  Anna, Malan and hard-right Tory [[backbencher]]s therefore try to ensure that Keith fails to make a success of the paper, often using Malan's three other national papers to do so.  However, their attempts usually backfire, with Keith's brand of conservatism ''increasing'' rather than decreasing the readership.

==Episodes==
#The magazine has become so Blue that it is sadly out of touch, with a declining and ageing readership. The time has come to appoint a new editor who favours compassionate Cameron conservatism.
#Following a successful first edition, Keith decides that this week's Blue Touch should focus on the Tory's green agenda, much to the chagrin of Lord Malan who spends his life on planes and likes watching ice melt.
#Keith decides that it's time for a Gordon Brown Special, but can the team unite on the angle they take and avoid just being rude about Scotland? And how will Giles contribute when he's busy testing 25 different whiskies for a consumer comparison article?
#Much to Keith's disgust, Lord Malan decides that he wants a globalization special with a celebrity angle. Giles finds himself covering the topic in a burger bar.

==Quotations==
*''first line'' - Malan - Life's too short to read the Guardian.

==Production and broadcast==
The series was recorded at [[The Drill Hall]] in London on 16 May and 22 May 2007, and was broadcast on Wednesday evenings at 6.30pm between 4 July and 25 July 2007.

==Cast==
*Lord Malan, old-fashioned Tory and owner of ''The Blue Touch'' - [[Robert Hardy]]
*Keith, the editor, formerly the "Token Tory" for ''[[The Guardian]]'' - [[Tony Gardner]]
*Anna, vicious, right-wing political columnist and current acting editor - [[Amelia Bullmore]]
*Giles, the paper's [[:wikt:plummy|plummy]] [[gossip columnist]], nicknamed "the [[:wikt:louche|Louche]]" - [[Michael Maloney]]
*Katrina, [[Personal assistant|PA]] and party worker - [[Rachel Atkins]]
*With [[Beth Chalmers]], [[Simon Treves]], [[Eve Webster]]

==Cultural references==
*"Blue Touch" is a reference to the instructions formerly written on the side of most fireworks, usually "light the blue touch paper and retire immediately"; the '''"blue touch paper"''' being the "fuse" used to light the firework. Blue is historically the color most associated with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and, from the early 1980s until September 2006, the Conservative Party's own logo had been a torch. ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5348630.stm BBC News Online article])
*Lord Malan, a South African media mogul, combines elements of real media moguls born in the former [[British Empire]], notably [[Rupert Murdoch]] from [[Australia]], [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]] from [[Canada]], and his fellow Canadian [[Conrad Black]]. In fiction, he echoes the characters of Lambert Leroux in the stage play ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'', and Robert Hardy's role as Twiggy Rathbone in the TV comedy ''[[Hot Metal]]''.

[[File:Jimbo Lyon.jpg|thumb|Jim Lyon, the other author of INTERCAL, in 2005]]

The '''Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym''', abbreviated '''INTERCAL''', is an [[esoteric programming language]] that was created as a [[parody]] by [[Don Woods (programmer)|Don Woods]] and [[James M. Lyon]], two [[Princeton University]] students, in 1972. It satirizes aspects of the various programming languages at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com.au/article/251892/-z_programming_languages_intercal?pp=1&amp;fp=2&amp;fpid=-1 |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: INTERCAL |publisher=Techworld |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the proliferation of proposed language constructs and notations in the 1960s.

There are two currently maintained versions of INTERCAL: C-INTERCAL, maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]],&lt;ref name="esr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ |title=The INTERCAL Resources Page |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CLC-INTERCAL, maintained by Claudio Calvelli.&lt;ref name="clc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clc.intercal.org.uk/ |title=Clc-Intercal |publisher=Clc-Intercal |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224003625/http://clc.intercal.org.uk/ |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to the original manual by the authors,&lt;ref name="manual72"&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716084816/http://oops.se/~urban/pit/intercal.ps | title = INTERCAL reference manual | url = http://oops.se/~urban/pit/intercal.ps | archivedate = 2011-07-16 | accessdate = 2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The full name of the compiler is "Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym," which is, for obvious reasons, abbreviated "INTERCAL."}}

The original Princeton implementation used [[punched card]]s and the [[EBCDIC]] character set. To allow INTERCAL to run on computers using [[ASCII]], substitutions for two characters had to be made: $ substituted for ¢ as the ''mingle'' operator, "represent[ing] the increasing cost of software in relation to hardware", and ? was substituted for ⊻ as the unary [[exclusive-or]] operator to "correctly express the average person's reaction on first encountering exclusive-or".&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt; In recent versions of C-INTERCAL, the older operators are supported as alternatives; INTERCAL programs may now be encoded in [[ASCII]], [[Latin-1]], or [[UTF-8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c.intercal.org.uk/manual/atvm81sp.htm|title=Princeton and Atari Syntax – C-INTERCAL 0.27 Revamped Instruction Manual|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==

INTERCAL was intended to be completely different from all other computer languages. Common operations in other languages have cryptic and redundant syntax in INTERCAL. From the INTERCAL Reference Manual:&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

{{quote| It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem. For example, if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

&lt;source lang="fortran"&gt;
DO :1 &lt;- #0¢#256
&lt;/source&gt;

any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd. Since this is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish in front of his boss, who would of course happen to turn up, as bosses are wont to do. The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer having been correct. }}

INTERCAL has many other features designed to make it even more aesthetically unpleasing to the programmer: it uses statements such as "READ OUT", "IGNORE", "FORGET", and modifiers such as "PLEASE". This last keyword provides two reasons for the program's rejection by the compiler: if "PLEASE" does not appear often enough, the program is considered insufficiently polite, and the error message says this; if too often, the program could be rejected as excessively polite. Although this feature existed in the original INTERCAL compiler, it was undocumented.&lt;ref name="manualick"/&gt;

Despite the language's intentionally obtuse and wordy syntax, INTERCAL is nevertheless [[Turing-complete]]: given enough memory, INTERCAL can solve any problem that a [[Universal Turing machine]] can solve. Most implementations of INTERCAL do this very slowly, however. A [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] benchmark, computing all prime numbers less than 65536, was tested on a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARCstation 1]]. In C, it took less than half a second; the same program in INTERCAL took over seventeen hours.&lt;ref name="stross"&gt;{{cite news|title=Intercal -- the Language From Hell|url=http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/stross.html|first=Charles|last=Stross|authorlink=Charles Stross|date=September 1992|work=[[Computer Shopper (UK magazine)|Computer Shopper (UK)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentation ==
[[File:INTERCAL Circuitous Diagram.svg|thumb|The "circuitous diagram" from the INTERCAL Reference Manual, purportedly to explain the operation of the "select" operator]]

The INTERCAL Reference Manual contains many paradoxical, nonsensical, or otherwise humorous instructions:

{{quote| Caution! Under no circumstances confuse the mesh with the interleave operator, except under confusing circumstances! }}

The manual also contains a "[[tonsil]]", as explained in this footnote: "4) Since all other reference manuals have [[appendix (organ)|Appendices]], it was decided that the INTERCAL manual should contain some other type of removable organ."&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

The INTERCAL manual gives unusual names to all non-alphanumeric [[ASCII]] characters: single and double quotes are "sparks" and "rabbit ears" respectively. (The exception is the [[ampersand]]: as the [[Jargon File]] states, "what could be sillier?") The assignment operator, represented as an equals sign (INTERCAL's "half mesh") in many other programming languages, is in INTERCAL a left-arrow, &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt;, made up of an "angle" and a "worm", obviously read as "gets".

== Syntax ==

Input (using the &lt;code&gt;WRITE IN&lt;/code&gt; instruction) and output (using the &lt;code&gt;READ OUT&lt;/code&gt; instruction) do not use the usual formats; in INTERCAL-72, WRITE IN inputs a number written out as digits in English (such as SIX FIVE FIVE THREE FIVE), and READ OUT outputs it in "butchered" [[Roman numerals]].&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt; More recent versions have their own I/O systems.&lt;ref name="clc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manualick"/&gt;

Comments can be achieved by using the inverted statement identifiers involving NOT or N'T; these cause lines to be initially ABSTAINed so that they have no effect.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt; (A line can be ABSTAINed from even if it doesn't have valid syntax; syntax errors happen at runtime, and only then when the line is un-ABSTAINed.)&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

=== Data structures ===

INTERCAL-72 (the original version of INTERCAL) had only four [[data type]]s: the 16-[[bit]] [[integer]] (represented with a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, called a "spot"), the 32-bit integer (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, a "twospot"), the [[Array data type|array]] of 16-bit integers (&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;, a "tail"), and the array of 32-bit integers (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;, a "hybrid"). There are 65535 available variables of each type, numbered from &lt;code&gt;.1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.65535&lt;/code&gt; for 16-bit integers, for instance. However, each of these variables has its own [[stack (data structure)|stack]] on which it can be pushed and popped (STASHed and RETRIEVEd, in INTERCAL terminology), increasing the possible complexity of data structures.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt; More modern versions of INTERCAL have by and large kept the same data structures, with appropriate modifications; TriINTERCAL, which modifies the [[radix]] with which numbers are represented, can use a 10-[[trit (computing)|trit]] type rather than a 16-bit type,&lt;ref name="manualick"/&gt; and CLC-INTERCAL implements many of its own data structures, such as "classes and lectures", by making the basic data types store more information rather than adding new types.&lt;ref name="clc"/&gt; Arrays are dimensioned by assigning to them as if they were a [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] variable. Constants can also be used, and are represented by a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; ("mesh") followed by the constant itself, written as a [[decimal]] number; only integer constants from 0 to 65535 are supported.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

=== Operators ===

There are only five operators in INTERCAL-72. Implementations vary in which characters represent which operation, and many accept more than one character, so more than one possibility is given for many of the operators.

| &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; backspace &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;¥&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Contrary to most other languages, AND, OR, and XOR are [[Unary operation|unary]] operators, which work on consecutive bits of their argument; the [[most significant bit]] of the result is the operator applied to the least significant and most significant bits of the input, the second-most-significant bit of the result is the operator applied to the most and second-most significant bits, the third-most-significant bit of the result is the operator applied to the second-most and third-most bits, and so on. The operator is placed between the punctuation mark specifying a variable name or constant and the number that specifies which variable it is, or just inside grouping marks (i.e. one character later than it would be in programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]].) SELECT and INTERLEAVE (which is also known as MINGLE) are infix binary operators; SELECT takes the bits of its first operand that correspond to "1" bits of its second operand and removes the bits that correspond to "0" bits, shifting towards the least significant bit and padding with zeroes (so 51 (1'''1'''0'''0'''1'''1''' in binary) SELECT 21 (10101 in binary) is 5 ('''101''' in binary)); MINGLE alternates bits from its first and second operands (in such a way that the least significant bit of its second operand is the least significant bit of the result). There is no operator precedence; grouping marks must be used to disambiguate the precedence where it would otherwise be ambiguous (the grouping marks available are &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; ("spark"), which matches another spark, and &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; ("rabbit ears"), which matches another rabbit ears; the programmer is responsible for using these in such a way that they make the expression unambiguous).&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

=== Control structures ===

INTERCAL statements all start with a "statement identifier"; in INTERCAL-72, this can be &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PLEASE&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;PLEASE DO&lt;/code&gt;, all of which mean the same to the program (but using one of these too heavily causes the program to be rejected, an [[undocumented feature]] in INTERCAL-72 that was mentioned in the C-INTERCAL manual),&lt;ref name="manualick"/&gt; or an inverted form (with &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;N'T&lt;/code&gt; appended to the identifier).&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt; Backtracking INTERCAL, a modern variant, also allows variants using &lt;code&gt;MAYBE&lt;/code&gt; (possibly combined with PLEASE or DO) as a statement identifier, which introduces a choice-point.&lt;ref name="backtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/intercal/backtracking.html |title=Backtracking in Intercal |publisher=Cse.unsw.edu.au |date=2006-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the identifier, an optional line number (an integer enclosed in parentheses) can be given; after the identifier, a percent chance of the line executing can be given in the format &lt;code&gt;%50&lt;/code&gt;, which defaults to 100%.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

In INTERCAL-72, the main control structures are NEXT, RESUME, and FORGET. &lt;code&gt;DO (''line'') NEXT&lt;/code&gt; branches to the line specified, remembering the next line that would be executed if it weren't for the NEXT on a call stack (other identifiers than DO can be used on any statement, DO is given as an example); &lt;code&gt;DO FORGET ''expression''&lt;/code&gt; removes ''expression'' entries from the top of the call stack (this is useful to avoid the error that otherwise happens when there are more than 80 entries), and &lt;code&gt;DO RESUME ''expression''&lt;/code&gt; removes ''expression'' entries from the call stack and jumps to the last line remembered.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

C-INTERCAL also provides the [[COME FROM]] instruction, written &lt;code&gt;DO COME FROM (''line'')&lt;/code&gt;; CLC-INTERCAL and the most recent C-INTERCAL versions also provide computed COME FROM (&lt;code&gt;DO COME FROM ''expression'')&lt;/code&gt; and NEXT FROM, which is like COME FROM but also saves a return address on the NEXT STACK.&lt;ref name="clc"/&gt;

Alternative ways to affect program flow, originally available in INTERCAL-72, are to use the IGNORE and REMEMBER instructions on variables (which cause writes to the variable to be silently ignored and to take effect again, so that instructions can be disabled by causing them to have no effect), and the ABSTAIN and REINSTATE instructions on lines or on types of statement, causing the lines to have no effect or to have an effect again respectively.&lt;ref name="manual72"/&gt;

=== Hello, world ===

The traditional [[Hello world program|"Hello, world!" program]] demonstrates how different INTERCAL is from standard programming languages. In [[C (programming language)|C]], it could read as follows:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The equivalent program in C-INTERCAL is longer and harder to read:

&lt;source lang="basic"&gt;
DO ,1 &lt;- #13
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #0
DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #64
DO ,1 SUB #6 &lt;- #194
DO ,1 SUB #7 &lt;- #48
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #8 &lt;- #22
DO ,1 SUB #9 &lt;- #248
DO ,1 SUB #10 &lt;- #168
DO ,1 SUB #11 &lt;- #24
DO ,1 SUB #12 &lt;- #16
DO ,1 SUB #13 &lt;- #162
PLEASE READ OUT ,1
PLEASE GIVE UP
&lt;/source&gt;

== Dialects ==

The original Woods–Lyon INTERCAL was very limited in its [[input/output]] capabilities: the only acceptable input were numbers with the digits spelled out, and the only output was an extended version of [[Roman numerals]].

The C-INTERCAL reimplementation, being available on the Internet, has made the language more popular with devotees of esoteric programming languages.&lt;ref name="nickm"/&gt; The C-INTERCAL dialect has a few differences from original INTERCAL and introduced a few new features, such as a [[COMEFROM|COME FROM]] statement and a means of doing text I/O based on the Turing Text Model.&lt;ref name="manualick"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~sbg/intercal/ick.html |title=C-INTERCAL supplemental reference manual |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223094001/http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~sbg/intercal/ick.html |archivedate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of C-INTERCAL also created the TriINTERCAL variant, based on the [[Ternary numeral system]] and generalizing INTERCAL's set of operators.&lt;ref name="manualick"/&gt;

A more recent variant is Threaded Intercal, which extends the functionality of COME FROM to support [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]].&lt;ref name="manualthick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/intercal/threaded.html |title=Threaded Intercal |publisher=Cse.unsw.edu.au |date=2004-06-09 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In early 2017 a .NET Implementation targeting the [[.NET Framework]] appeared on [[GitHub]]. This implementation supports the creation of standalone binary libraries and interop with other programming languages. &lt;ref name="componentintercal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/jawhitti/INTERCAL|title=Official home of Simple Component Intercal for .NET }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact and discussion ==

In the article "A Box, Darkly: Obfuscation, Weird Languages, and Code Aesthetics",&lt;ref name="nickm"&gt;{{cite conference | last = Mateas | first = Michael |author2=Nick Montfort | title = A Box, Darkly: Obfuscation, Weird Languages, and Code Aesthetics | booktitle = Proceedings of the 6th Digital Arts and Culture Conference, IT University of Copenhagen, 1–3 December 2005 | pages = 144–153 | url = http://nickm.com/cis/a_box_darkly.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; INTERCAL is described under the heading "Abandon all sanity, ye who enter here: INTERCAL". The compiler and commenting strategy are among the "weird" features described:

{{quote| The compiler, appropriately named "ick", continues the parody. Anything the compiler can't understand, which in a normal language would result in a compilation error, is just skipped. This "forgiving" feature makes finding bugs very difficult; it also introduces a unique system for adding program comments. The programmer merely inserts non-compileable text anywhere in the program, being careful not to accidentally embed a bit of valid code in the middle of their comment.}}

In "Technomasochism",&lt;ref name=levb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratishenko|first=Lev|title=Technomasochism|journal=Cabinet|date= Winter 2009|issue= 36|url=http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/36/bratishenko.php|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lev Bratishenko characterizes the INTERCAL compiler as a dominatrix:
{{quote|If PLEASE was not encountered often enough, the program would be rejected; that is, ignored without explanation by the compiler. Too often and it would still be rejected, this time for sniveling. Combined with other words that are rarely used in programming languages but appear as statements in INTERCAL, the code reads like someone pleading.}}

'''''I Am My Own Wife''''' is a play by [[Doug Wright]] based on his conversations with German [[Charlotte von Mahlsdorf]]. The [[one-man play]] premiered [[Off-Broadway]] in 2003 at [[Playwrights Horizons]]. It opened on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] later that year. The play was developed with [[Moisés Kaufman]] and his [[Tectonic Theater Project]], and Kaufman also acted as director. [[Jefferson Mays]] starred in the Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, playing some forty roles. Wright received the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work.

''I Am My Own Wife'' (or ''I Am My Own Woman'') is also the English title of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf's autobiography, first issued in 1992, translated in 1995.

== Plot synopsis ==
''I Am My Own Wife'' is an examination of the life of German antiquarian [[Charlotte von Mahlsdorf]], born Lothar Berfelde, who killed her father when she was a young child and survived the Nazi and Communist regimes in [[East Berlin]] as a transgender woman.

== Productions ==
''I Am My Own Wife'' began with Moises Kauffman and Doug Wright at About Face Theatre in Chicago in 2002, and moved to Broadway in 2004 where it won the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play]] (Mays) and [[Tony Award for Best Play|Best Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutfacetheatre.com/aft-looks-back-i-am-my-own-wife-2003/|title=AFT Looks Back: I AM MY OWN WIFE (2003) - About Face Theatre|website=aboutfacetheatre.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the play had its European premiere at [[Stockholms Stadsteater]], [[Stockholm]], starring [[Björn Kjellman]]. In 2005, it had its American regional premiere at [[Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati]], starring Todd Almond. That production then traveled to [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] and [[Florida Studio Theatre]]. In 2006, the play was staged in Hudson, New York at Stageworks/Hudson starring Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] at [[CanStage]], with [[Stephen Ouimette]] in the starring role, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], at the Playhouse Theatre with Canadian actor Tom Rooney, at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal with actor Brett Christopher, in [[Portland, Oregon]] at the Gerding Theater starring actor [[Wade McCollum]], in [[Portland, Maine]] at the Portland Stage Company starring actor Tom Ford, and in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] at the [[Performance Network Theatre]] starring actor Malcolm Tulip. In January 2007, the San Pedro Playhouse in San Antonio, Texas successfully mounted the play. It was also performed at the [[George Street Playhouse]], New Brunswick, New Jersey from January 16, 2007 to February 11, 2007. It featured Mark Nelson, and was directed by Anders Cato. Vince Gatton performed the role in a production directed by Andrew Volkoff at Barrington Stage Company in 2008. A French translation (''Ma femme, c'est moi'') was performed in February 2009 at Théâtre du Rideau Vert in [[Montreal]]. It also ran at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, starring Helen Hayes award winner Andrew Long, and directed by Alan Paul, and at  Theater Three&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theaterthree.com/now_playing.htm |title=Playing now |work=TheaterThree.com |accessdate=December 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221431/http://theaterthree.com/now_playing.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Port Jefferson, New York]], featuring Jeffrey Sanzel.

Between May 6 and May 23, 2009, it played in [[Tasmania]] at the Earl Arts Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/205/450 |title=? |publisher=Launceston.tas.gov.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522233642/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/205/450/ |archivedate=May 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], and the [[Theatre Royal, Hobart]] Backspace, produced by the [[Tasmanian Theatre Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tastheatre.com/season09/i-am-my-own-wife |title=''I Am My Own Wife'' |first=Doug |last=Wright |date=June 22–26, 20?? |publisher=Tasmanian Theatre Company |accessdate=December 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915102608/http://www.tastheatre.com/season09/i-am-my-own-wife |archivedate=September 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and featuring [[Robert Jarman]].

In the [[Czech Republic]], the play was premiered in 2008 by Divadlo Letí&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divadlo-leti.cz |title=Divadlo Letí homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]], starring Pavol Smolárik. At the same time it was also staged by a Czech non-professional theater group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soliteater.cz |title=Soliteater homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Libor Ulovec in the role. The latter was awarded the Best Czech Non-Professional Drama Performance 2009 and Libor Ulovec received (among others) the Best Czech Non-Professional Actor Prize 2009.

In Mexico it is starring by the actor Hector Bonilla who, on January 23, 2010, accomplished 100 performances, with 89 standing ovations by that time. It was also performed in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], at Gettysburg Stage starring actor Eric Jones.

In [[Greece]], ''I Am My Own Wife''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.facebook.com/iammyownwife |title=''I Am My Own Wife''{{'}}s Greek production page}}&lt;/ref&gt; had its premiere in January 2011, in Bios Basement, [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bios.gr |title=Bios Theatre, Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Degreezero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/degreezerogr |title=Degreezero Theatre Company homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre Company, translated and directed by Iossif Vardakis and performed by Haris Attonis with the original music of Marietta Fafouti who also composed a special song for the show, named "Ich Erinnere Mich"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81jVGykpVM |title=Ich Erinnere Mich Video by Marietta Fafouti |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; — lyrics by Dimitris Dimopoulos. It went on for 20 performances and carried on for the following season, moving to 104&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.104.gr |title=104 Theatre homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; theatre, in [[Athens]] and opening in November 2011 for the second run. It has received great acceptance and outstanding critiques both for the whole of the show but for Haris Attonis' exceptional performance, as well. The play itself and the story of Charlotte are very well-timed with the political and social situation in [[Greece]]. The staging itself is very minimal and it has been considered to be one of the most emotional presentations, internationally and there have been innovations like the beard and the lack of the head scarf, for the very first time. Haris Attonis won the 2012 Best Male Theatre Performance Award for ''I Am My Own Wife'' in Athens Voice Best Choice and Audience Awards and Marietta Fafouti won the 2012 Best Original Theatre Music for ''I Am My Own Wife'' in the Gay Theatre Awards.

I Am My Own Wife returned to Chicago's About Face Theatre in November 2016 in a re-imagined production directed by Artistic director Andrew Volkoff using four actors and featuring Delia Kropp in the role of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf.  This production marks the first known professional performance of the role by a trans actor. It was met with high praise from area critics as well as the author.

'''John MacInnes''' (''Iain MacAonghuis'', ''Iain mac Ruairidh mhic Iain mhic Iain mhic Néill mhic Mhaol Mhoire mhic Iain mhic Mhaol Chaluim'') is a Scottish [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] scholar and authority on Scottish Gaelic [[oral tradition]].  He was born in 3 April 1930 in [[Uig, Lewis]].  He took an active interest in Gaelic tradition while still young and made a conscious effort to seek it out amongst his family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacInnes |first=John |editor-last=Newton |editor-first=Michael |title=Dùthchas nan Gàidheal: Selected Essays of John MacInnes |publisher=Birlinn |date=2006 |pages=xxiii |isbn=978-1-84158-316-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 John MacInnes went to study at the University of Edinburgh and was awarded a scholarship in Gaelic established by the Church of Scotland.  In 1958, MacInnes was appointed to a Junior Research Fellowship in the School of Scottish Studies and spent years conducting fieldwork amongst Gaelic speakers in Scotland and in Nova Scotia, Canada. MacInnes formally retired from the School of Scottish Studies in 1993.

John MacInnes penned a significant body of seminal articles on aspects of [[Scottish Gaelic]] linguistics, folklore, oral narrative, song, dance, history and indigenous beliefs which continue to inform contemporary scholarship. A thorough bibliography and selection of these essays was published as ''Dùthchas nan Gàidheal''. A special issue of the journal ''Scottish Studies'' contains biographical information and a range of articles celebrating and extending MacInnes’ intellectual and cultural legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2014 |journal=Scottish Studies |volume=37 |title=Craobh nan Ubhal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 John MacInnes was recognised with Services to Gaelic Award by The Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.handsupfortrad.scot/hall-of-fame/dr-john-macinnes-services-to-gaelic-award-2015/ |title=Dr John MacInnes – Services to Gaelic Award 2015 |date=2015 |access-date=8 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Khoit Tsenkher Cave Rock Paintings''' are found in [[Mankhan Sum]], [[Khovd Province]], [[Mongolia]].

==Site description==
Originating in the [[Paleolithic]] period, the rock art found in Khoit Tsenkher Cave includes symbols and animal forms painted from the walls up to the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/935/ Khoit tsenkher cave rock painting - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; Stags, buffalo, oxen, ibex, lions, Argali sheep, antelopes, camels, elephants, ostriches, and other animal pictorials are present, often forming a [[palimpsest]] of overlapping images.  The paintings appear brown or red in color, and are stylistically similar to other [[Paleolithic]] [[rock art]] from around the world but are unlike any other examples in Mongolia.

==World Heritage Status==
This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on August 1, 1996 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/935/ Khoit tsenkher cave rock painting - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, as a cofounder she opened the [[Norbulingka Institute]] near [[Dharamshala]] in northern India where she and her husband [[Kalsang Yeshi]] seek to preserve [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions and culture]].&lt;ref name=vassar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vq.vassar.edu/issues/2003/04/beyond-vassar/culture-works.html|title=Culture Works: Kim Sciaky Yeshi '77|author=Anguin-Cohen, Rebecca|publisher=''Vassar''|date=2003|accessdate=1 February 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=monde&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2009/03/17/tibet-histoire-d-une-tragedie-de-kim-yeshi_1169039_3260.html|title="Tibet, histoire d'une tragédie", de Kim Yeshi : le Tibet, civilisation en danger|author=Evin, Florence|publisher=''Le Monde''|date=17 March 2009|accessdate=1 February 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Kim's father, Mario Sciaky, was born in Salonica, Greece, and later immigrated to France, then the US, during World War II. Kim's mother, Sara Burkett Sciaky, was born in Mississippi and moved to France in 1947. Kim attended [[Vassar College]] in [[New York State]], graduating in 1977 with a B.A. in anthropology. In 1974, she met Kalsang Yeshi in [[New York City]], where he had recently arrived to from India and took Tibetan lessons from him. In 1977, they joined the Tibetan Buddhism PhD program at the [[University of Virginia]], where Kalsang also taught Tibetan language and dialects. Kim obtained an M.A. in Tibetan Studies in 1979.

Kim and Kalsang married in 1979 and moved to Dharamsala in India, where they devoted themselves to preserving Tibetan culture. They had four children; Sonam Choezom (1980), Dechen Lhamo (1982), Gelek Namgyal (1987), and Noryang Lhamo (1989).

==Life devoted to Tibet==
[[File:Tibetan_lamas_and_priests,_Losel_Doll_Museum,_Norbulingka_Institute,_Dharamsala.jpg|thumb|Tibetan dolls museum, Norbulingka]]
In 1983, Kim created the Loseling Doll Project, with monks from Drepung Loseling Monastery, making dolls recreating Tibetan costumes and selling them to museums worldwide to raise funds for the Monastery. The dolls were first exhibited in the library of [[Westminster Abbey]] following the visit of the Dalai Lama with the support of the UK Tibet Society and soon afterwards in Paris. They are now displayed not only in the Norbulingka Institute but in museums around the world.&lt;ref name="Odelys2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GwtZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125|title=Dharamsala: Chroniques tibétaines|last=Odelys|first=Bertrand|publisher=Albin Michel|year=2013|isbn=978-2-226-27141-9|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Kalsang and Kim founded the Norbulingka Institute with the aim of creating an environment for Tibetan artisans; thangka painters, statue makers, applique artists and wood carvers. It was set up as a Trust and inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in 1995. Norbulingka is self-sufficient and now counts over 300 artisans.&lt;ref name="vassar" /&gt;

The Norbulingka Cultural Centre in particular includes a Japanese garden, a large Tibetan temple, [[thangka]] workshops, and above all Kim Yenshi's museum of Tibetan dolls which have been produced by the monks from the temple and represent various regions and occupations in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://letterindra.com/article/kim-yeshi|title=Kim Yeshi´|author=Rediar, Birger|publisher=Letter Indra|date=27 August 2016|accessdate=1 February 2017 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim's dream had always been to create a project in Tibet itself, and in 2005, she began researching yak wool which she accurately believed was a valuable asset due to its soft, warm qualities. With the help of her daughter Dechen she set up a workshop in [[Zorgey Ritoma]], Amdo in 2007 creating jobs for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indagare.com/destinations/world/articles/qa-kim-yeshi|title=Q&amp;A with Kim Yeshi|author=Pierce, Emma|date=2 March 2015|publisher=''Indagare Magazine''|accessdate= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began as a way to utilize local resources and create sustainable industry, to give nomads who had too few animals or wished for opportunities other than herding, work in their own villages, rather than having to migrate to local cities looking for jobs. Dechen, her husband Yidam, and three other people from their core team spent time in Cambodia and Nepal studying weaving and spinning techniques, and bought weaving equipment in Katmandu, which they transported to Ritoma. They then hired and trained local nomads who soon became skilled artisans.

[[Tianjin Television And Radio Station|Tianjin Satellite Television]] featured their efforts to train the mostly illiterate workers in a documentary. The workshop employs over 100 workers, most of whom have been employed since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lin |first1=Qi |title=Yaks for haute couture |url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-11/19/content_17115719.htm |accessdate=2 February 2017 |publisher=''[[China Daily]]'' |date=19 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102214111/http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2013-11/19/content_17115719.htm |archivedate= 2 January 2015 |location=Beijing, China |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the products remain traditional, no synthetic dyes or bleaching are used.

[[Image:LDSWWalesCastles.png|thumb|400px|Norman castles and boroughs in southwest Wales]]
The '''Landsker Line''' is a term used for the [[language boundary]] in [[Wales]] between the largely [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaking and largely [[English language|English]]-speaking areas in [[Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]]. The English-speaking areas, south of the Landsker line and known as [[Little England beyond Wales]], are notable for having been English linguistically and culturally for many centuries despite being far from the [[England–Wales border]]

==History==
During the 11th and 12th centuries both invaders and defenders built more than fifty [[castle]]s during a complex period of conflict, effectively to consolidate the line. The southernmost was [[Laugharne Castle|Laugharne]]; others included [[Wiston Castle|Wiston]], [[Camrose, Pembrokeshire|Camrose]], [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narberth]], and [[Roch]].  These are often referred to as "frontier castles" but they were in fact set back a considerable distance from the frontier itself.  In the heart of the Normanised colony, the two great fortresses were at [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]] and [[Haverfordwest Castle|Haverfordwest]].  There were other fortresses within the colony as well, including [[Manorbier Castle|Manorbier]], [[Carew Castle|Carew]] and [[Tenby]].

The Landsker has changed position many times, first moving north into the foothills of [[Preseli Hills|Mynydd Preseli]] during the military campaigns of the Early Middle Ages, and then moving southwards again in more peaceful times, as the English colonists found that farming and feudalism were difficult to maintain on cold acid soils and exposed hillsides.

[[File:Welsh speakers in the 2011 census.png|thumb|180px|Proportion of Welsh speakers (2011 census)]]
When historians began to gain interest in the strange linguistic divide which was incredibly sharp in the early part of the 1900s, they started to use the term "landsker." Since then, it has stuck, and remains in common use.  Local people may or may not know what the word means, but they certainly all recognize that the language divide stretching from [[St Bride's Bay]] to [[Carmarthen Bay]] remains very distinct.

==Language and genetic differences==
The differences in the proportion of Welsh speakers persists in the 21st century and is illustrated by the map derived from the 2011 census.

Researchers at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics reported in 2015 "unexpectedly stark differences between inhabitants in the north and south of the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire" in DNA signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Nature|title=The fine-scale genetic structure of the British population|volume=519|pages=309–314|date=19 March 2015|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7543/full/nature14230.html|subscription=yes|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=New Scientist|date=21 March 2015|title=Roman invasion left no genetic legacy|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-depth description==

The term Landsker is a word of Anglo-Saxon origin&lt;ref&gt;Awbery, Gwenllian M, ''The Term 'Landsker' in Pembrokeshire'' in ''Journal of the Pembrokeshire Historical Society'', '''4''', 1990-91, pp 32-41.&lt;/ref&gt; used in southwest England and along the anglicised [[south Wales]] coast. It signifies a permanent, visible boundary between two tracts of land, and may be a natural feature (e.g. a river) or an artificial feature (e.g. a hedge or a line of marker stones).  In [[Wales]], its official use became obsolete at the end of the eighteenth century.

In 1939, the term was first applied&lt;ref&gt;Davies, M. F, ''Pembrokeshire'', Part 32 (pp 75-170) of [[Laurence Dudley Stamp|Stamp, L. D.]] (Ed.), ''The Land of Britain, Report of the Land Utilisation Survey'', London, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; to the linguistic frontier in southwest [[Wales]]. This is an unfortunate usage, because the linguistic boundary, in general, is neither visible nor permanent.  However, many commentators have taken up the use of the word in this context in the last 50 years, so that today it is usually understood to mean the language boundary.

The language boundary is an example of a cultural frontier that has persisted, without legal status, for ten centuries or more. The boundary (with Welsh to the north and east, and English to the south and west) starts on [[St Bride’s Bay]] and follows a serpentine course eastwards until it meets the [[River Taf]] north of [[Laugharne]] in [[Carmarthenshire]]. Traces of a boundary also persist across the [[Llansteffan]] peninsula and the country near [[Kidwelly]], and it reappears strongly in the boundary between English and Welsh [[Gower (Lordship)|Gower]]. The area to the south of the line was referred to in the 16th century as ''Anglia Transwalliana'' (Little England beyond Wales).

In 1603, [[George Owen of Henllys|George Owen]]&lt;ref&gt;Owen, George, ''The Description of Pembrokeshire'' Dillwyn Miles (Ed) (Gomer Press, Llandysul 1994) {{ISBN|1-85902-120-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a snapshot description of the language boundary and 'Little England beyond Wales', and provided an antiquarian account of the settlement of English speakers in southwest Wales.  This provides the “traditional” view: that the area was cleared of native Welsh by the Norman invaders in the early 12th century, and was planted with Flemings from elsewhere in England. However, Owen pointed out that there was no trace of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] custom or language in his time. In fact, traditional [[Pembrokeshire]] English is lexically related to the Early English of southwest England, and in all probability the anglicisation of the [[south Wales]] coast paralleled the anglicisation of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], perhaps concurrently.  A 2003 DNA study&lt;ref&gt;C Capelli ''et al.'', “A Y Chromosome Census of the British Isles”, ''Current Biology'','''3''', 979-984 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; showed that people in 'Little England' are genetically indistinguishable from the people of southern England.

The frontier was not solely linguistic: there were also differences in customs (notably of inheritance) and in architecture. Owen characterised the cultural frontier in 1602 as both sharp and stable, and subsequent observers (with less local knowledge than Owen) have reiterated his description, and suggested that the line remained close to that described by Owen. The first objective, statistically based description of the frontier was made in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;John, Brian S, “The Linguistic Significance of the Pembrokeshire Landsker” in ''The Pembrokeshire Historian'', '''4''', 1972 pp 7-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and showed a line similar to that described by Owen, although in some places it had moved north, while in others it had moved south.  People in the frontier zone did not recognise the term “Landsker”, but were well aware of the location of the boundary. Rather than a sharp line of demarcation, the boundary consists of a corridor of mixed language, typically 3–5&amp;nbsp;km wide, in which the direction of language trend varies according to the migration characteristics of the inhabitants. The frontier zone has probably always had these characteristics.

As mentioned above, the frontier moved between 1600 and today. Historic data on personal names also show that it also moved between 1200 and 1600. Attempts to set up a number of Norman/English “planned villages” (e.g. Letterston and New Moat) were made north of the current frontier in the mediæval period.  These subsequently failed, and were re-occupied by Welsh speakers in the post Black Death period. In more modern times, the [[enclosure of commons]] allowed a substantial southward spread of Welsh speakers, particularly in Carmarthenshire. These are quite rare examples of Welsh-speaking areas expanding at the expense of English-speaking areas; in the central part of Pembrokeshire the shift of the Landsker southwards between 1600 and 1900 was in excess of 10&amp;nbsp;km.

Southwest Wales is very rich in [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Castles. Some are deep within the Welsh zone (e.g. [[Newport, Pembrokeshire|Newport]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Cilgerran]], [[Newcastle Emlyn]], [[Carmarthen]]), and some are deep in [[Little England beyond Wales|Little England]] (e.g. [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]], [[Carew Castle|Carew]], [[Manorbier]], [[Haverfordwest]], [[Tenby]]).  A number lie close to the language boundary (e.g. [[Roch]], [[Wiston, Pembrokeshire|Wiston]], [[Llawhaden]], [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narberth]], [[Laugharne]]) and are sometimes referred to as “frontier castles”, but the whole of [[Dyfed]] (the territory south of the River Teifi and west of the Towy and Gwili) was in the hands of Norman marcher lords.  The language boundary was never a defended frontier. All the castles had the primary function of intimidating and controlling the local population, whether Welsh or English speaking.

The line is noted for being sharp, and for having moved only slightly over the past several centuries. A visible boundary which represents the Landsker line is Brandy Brook which runs through [[Newgale, Pembrokeshire|Newgale]]. The next beach north after the brook has the Welsh name Pen-y-Cwm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3575">This is a list of all known publications by [[Ottaviano Petrucci]], an influential Italian printer of the 16th century. Most of these were reprinted several times during Petrucci's life, but in this list only dates of first publication are given. Some of the earlier publications (for instance, the [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]] masses) were reprinted separately, in [[Fossombrone]], after Petrucci moved there around 1510; these reprints are listed. The vast majority of Petrucci's publications were published in [[Venice]]; those from his Fossombrone years are marked accordingly.

The '''Metrological Relief''' is an [[ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[relief]] of a man with arms outstretched, cut with hammer and chisel on a triangular, [[marble]] slab between 460 and 430 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="Kappraff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Kappraff|title=Beyond measure: a guided tour through nature, myth, and number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAfBrK678_kC&amp;pg=PA237|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4702-7|pages=237–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found in [[Turkey]] or the [[Greek Islands]] in 1625–26 [[AD]] by a [[chaplain]] called William Petty collecting [[sculptures]] for [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Thomas Howard]], [[Earl]] of [[Arundel]]. It was sold to [[William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster|Sir William Fermor]] in 1691 and then presented to [[Oxford University]] in 1755. It is now on display at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was the only known metrological relief until 1988 when another was found on [[Salamis Island]], [[Greece]].

==Measurements==
The relief measures 2.09 m long, 62&amp;nbsp;cm high by ca. 10&amp;nbsp;cm thick and is broken over the figure's left forearm but when complete it measured one [[ancient Greece|Greek]] fathom or [[orguia]].&lt;ref name="Tavernor2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Tavernor|title=Smoot's ear: the measure of humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kg-t6xsv48C&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12492-7|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also an image of a foot above the right forearm which measures 29.7&amp;nbsp;cm, an imprint of a clenched fist over the right forearm of 11&amp;nbsp;cm and fingers, which measure between 1.85 and 2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Lorenzen1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eivind Lorenzen|title=Technological studies in ancient metrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aToLAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1966|publisher=Nyt Nordisk Forlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Fernie studied the relief and noted its ancient measurement of the Greek fathom.&lt;ref name="London1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Society of Antiquaries of London|title=The Antiquaries journal: being the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London, The Greek Metrological Relief in Oxford by Eric J.

==History==
NGP VAN was created in November 2010 by the merger of its two predecessor companies, '''NGP Software''', founded in 1997 by [[Nathaniel Pearlman]], who later served as chief technology officer for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2008 presidential campaign,&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Pearlman LinkedIn"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanielpearlman | title = LinkedIn: Nathaniel Pearlman }}&lt;/ref&gt; in his attic in Washington, D.C, and '''Voter Activation Network''', founded in 2001 by Mark Sullivan, in his study in [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Personal democracy forum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://personaldemocracy.com/company-reviews-2010/voter-activation-network | title = VAN:Personal Democracy Forum |date=July 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, NGP VAN launched their EveryAction fundraising management platform for non-profits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trevelyan|first1=Stu|title=Make EveryAction Count|url=https://blog.everyaction.com/make-everyaction-count|website=EveryAction.com|accessdate=12 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Products==
'''MiniVAN''' is a [[mobile application|mobile]] [[Canvassing|canvassing]] application that allows for campaigns and organizations to contact voters or supporters, collect data, and sync the information back to their VAN or EveryAction database in real time, thus eliminating the need for paper lists and data entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox21online.com/2016/03/02/minivan-app-computes-on-the-campaign-trail/38290498/ MiniVAN App Computes On The Campaign Trail - App Provides Names, Gender, Addresses Of Registered Voters] by Graham Hakala for [[KQDS-TV]]; March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the company reported record usage of the app - 71% of progressive voter contact attempts were made on MiniVAN instead of paper lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.ngpvan.com/2018-takeaways|title=Organize Everywhere: How Technology Powered Grassroots Engagement in 2018|last=Coulombe|first=Amanda|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/2018-midterms-democrats-mobile-canvassing-records/|title=Democrats Are Busting Their 2016 Mobile Canvassing Records|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VoteBuilder''' is one of the software systems created by NGP VAN. It is used by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and associated campaigns to track interaction with [[voter database|potential voters]].  Votebuilder is used as part of campaign voter persuasion and "[[get out the vote]]" operations. It stores information like phone calls and other methods of contact with voters in the system. The software was created in 2006 to bridge a perceived gap in [[microtargeting]] abilities between the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and Democratic parties.&lt;ref name =NYTimesGap&gt;Democrats Take Page From Their Rival’s Playbook. New York Times, 2008-10-31, https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/us/politics/01target.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

On Wednesday December 16, 2015, NGP VAN released a code update to their Votebuilder application which contained a [[Software bug|bug]] that allowed two campaigns to see proprietary analytical scores. On the evening of Thursday, December 17 the DNC revoked the Sanders campaign's access to the national voter file. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@AmyKDacey/here-s-what-happened-with-ngp-van-the-sanders-campaign-and-the-clinton-campaign-d75dd1d2edbf#.vyswby7ib|title=Here’s what happened with NGP VAN, the Sanders Campaign, and the Clinton Campaign|author=Amy Dacey|work=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanders campaign sued the DNC in District Court and concurrently fired Uretsky.

'''NGP''' is a software platform for digital engagement, fundraising, and [[Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States#Disclosure_rules|compliance reporting]] used by most federal Democratic campaigns. It is also used by state and local campaigns less often due to the service's high price tag. In August 2017, the company released NGP 8 used for campaign compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.campaignsandelections.com/campaign-insider/ngp-van-unveils-new-iteration-of-software-ahead-of-midterm-cycle|title=NGP VAN Unveils New Iteration Of Software Ahead of Midterm Cycle|access-date=2017-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://act.ngpvan.com/ngp8|title=NGP 8|last=VAN|first=NGP|website=act.ngpvan.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New media''' are forms of media that are native to computers, computational and relying on computers for redistribution. Some examples of new media are [[telephone]]s, [[computer]]s, [[virtual world]]s, [[single media]], [[website games]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]], [[computer animation]] and [[New media art|interactive computer installations]].&lt;ref name="Manovich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11661|title=Designing Learning Tools. Methodological Insights.|last=Leinonen|first=Teemu|publisher=Aalto University School of Art and Design|year=2010|isbn=978-952-60-0031-2|location=Helsinki|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New media are often contrasted to "[[old media]]", such as television, radio, and print media, although scholars in communication and media studies have criticised rigid distinctions based on oldness and novelty. New media does not include [[television program]]s (only analog broadcast), feature films, [[magazine]]s, [[book]]s, &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; unless they contain technologies that enable digital generative or interactive processes.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;Manovich, Lev. "New Media From Borges to HTML." ''The New Media Reader.'' Ed. Noah Wardrip-Fruin &amp; Nick Montfort. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2003. 13-25. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, is a good example of New Media, combining [[Internet]] accessible digital text, images and video with web-links, creative participation of contributors, interactive feedback of users and formation of a participant community of editors and donors for the benefit of non-community readers. [[Facebook]] is another type of New Media, belonging to the category of [[social media]] model, in which most users are also participants. Another type of New Media is [[Twitter]] which also belongs to the social media category, through which users interact with one another and make announcements to which the public receive. Both Facebook and Twitter have risen in usage in recent years and have become an online resource for acquiring information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/|title=The Evolving Role of News on Twitter and Facebook|date=2015-07-14|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1950s, connections between computing and radical art began to grow stronger. It was not until the 1980s that [[Alan Kay]] and his co-workers at [[Xerox PARC]] began to give the [[computability]] of a [[personal computer]] to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and [[computer design]]. Although causally unrelated, conceptually it makes sense that the [[Cold War]] and the design of the Web took place at exactly the same time."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

Writers and philosophers such as [[Marshall McLuhan]] were instrumental in the development of [[media theory]] during this period. His now famous declaration in ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) that "[[the medium is the message]]" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.

Until the 1980s [[media (communication)|media]] relied primarily upon print and [[analog signal|analog]] [[broadcast]] models, such as those of [[television]] and [[radio]]. The last twenty-five years have seen the rapid transformation into media which are predicated upon the use of digital technologies, such as the [[Internet]] and [[video game]]s. However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of [[digital computer]]s has transformed the remaining 'old' media, as suggested by the advent of [[digital television]] and [[online publication]]s. Even traditional media forms such as the printing press have been transformed through the application of technologies such as [[image manipulation]] software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] and desktop publishing tools.

[[Andrew L. Shapiro]] (1999) argues that the "emergence of new, digital technologies signals a potentially radical shift of who is in control of information, experience and resources" (Shapiro cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). [[W. Russell Neuman]] (1991) suggests that whilst the "new media" have technical capabilities to pull in one direction, economic and social forces pull back in the opposite direction. According to Neuman, "We are witnessing the evolution of a universal interconnected network of audio, video, and electronic text communications that will blur the distinction between interpersonal and mass communication and between public and private communication" (Neuman cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). Neuman argues that new media will:
*Alter the meaning of geographic distance.
*Allow for a huge increase in the volume of [[communication]].
*Provide the possibility of increasing the speed of communication.
*Provide opportunities for interactive communication.
*Allow forms of communication that were previously separate to overlap and interconnect.

Consequently, it has been the contention of scholars such as [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[James Bohman]] that new media, and particularly the Internet, provide the potential for a democratic [[postmodern]] public sphere, in which citizens can participate in well informed, non-hierarchical debate pertaining to their social structures. Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Ed Herman and [[Robert D. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful [[International|transnational]] [[telecommunication]]s corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.

Scholars, such as Lister et al. (2003), have highlighted both the positive and negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of technological [[determinism]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; whereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.

Based on the argument that people have a limited amount of time to spend on the consumption of different media, Displacement theory argue that the viewership or readership of one particular outlet leads to the reduction in the amount of time spent by the individual on another. The introduction of New Media, such as the internet, therefore reduces the amount of time individuals would spend on existing "Old" Media, which could ultimately lead to the end of such traditional media.&lt;ref name="Dimmick"&gt;Dimmick, J., Chen, Y., &amp; Li, Z. (2004). Competition between the internet and traditional news media: The gratification-opportunities niche dimension. Journal of Media Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although there are several ways that New Media may be described, Lev Manovich, in an introduction to ''The New Media Reader'', defines New Media by using eight propositions:&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;
#'''New Media versus [[Cyberculture]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Cyberculture is the various social phenomena that are associated with the Internet and network communications (blogs, online multi-player gaming), whereas New Media is concerned more with cultural objects and paradigms (digital to analog television, iPhones).
#'''New Media as Computer Technology Used as a Distribution Platform'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media are the cultural objects which use digital computer technology for distribution and exhibition. e.g. (at least for now) Internet, Web sites, computer multimedia, Blu-ray disks etc. The problem with this is that the definition must be revised every few years. The term "new media" will not be "new" anymore, as most forms of culture will be distributed through computers.
#'''New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The language of New Media is based on the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.
#'''New Media as the Mix Between Existing Cultural Conventions and the Conventions of Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media today can be understood as the mix between older cultural conventions for data representation, access, and manipulation and newer conventions of data representation, access, and manipulation. The "old" data are representations of visual reality and human experience, and the "new" data is numerical data. The computer is kept out of the key "creative" decisions, and is delegated to the position of a technician. e.g. In film, software is used in some areas of production, in others are created using computer animation.
#'''New Media as the [[Aesthetics]] that Accompanies the Early Stage of Every New Modern Media and Communication Technology'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; While ideological tropes indeed seem to be reappearing rather regularly, many aesthetic strategies may reappear two or three times ... In order for this approach to be truly useful it would be insufficient to simply name the strategies and tropes and to record the moments of their appearance; instead, we would have to develop a much more comprehensive analysis which would correlate the history of technology with social, political, and economical histories or the modern period.
#'''New Media as Faster Execution of [[Algorithms]] Previously Executed Manually or through Other Technologies'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Computers are a huge speed-up of what were previously manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically speeding up the execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, we should not ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.
#'''New Media as the Encoding of Modernist [[Avant-Garde]]; New Media as Metamedia'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Manovich declares that the 1920s are more relevant to New Media than any other time period. [[Metamedia]] coincides with [[postmodernism]] in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media is an example of how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.
#'''New Media as Parallel Articulation of Similar Ideas in Post-WWII Art and Modern Computing'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Post WWII Art or "combinatorics" involves creating images by systematically changing a single parameter. This leads to the creation of remarkably similar images and spatial structures. This illustrates that algorithms, this essential part of new media, do not depend on technology, but can be executed by humans.

==Globalization==
The rise of new media has increased communication between people all over the world and the Internet. It has allowed people to express themselves through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.

[[Terry Flew|Flew]] (2002) stated that, "as a result of the evolution of new media technologies, [[globalization]] occurs." Globalization is generally stated as "more than expansion of activities beyond the boundaries of particular nation states".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John B. (1995). ''The Media and Modernity''. Cambridge: Polity Press, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization shortens the distance between people all over the world by the electronic communication (Carely 1992 in Flew 2002) and Cairncross (1998) expresses this great development as the "death of distance". New media "radically break the connection between physical place and social place, making physical location much less significant for our social relationships" (Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 311).

However, the changes in the new media environment create a series of tensions in the concept of "public sphere".&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, "Building Media's industry while promoting community of values in the globalisation", Politické Vedy, Journal of International Affairs, Policy and Security, 2/2011, http://www.fpvmv.umb.sk/politickevedy&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingrid Volkmer, "public sphere" is defined as a process through which public communication becomes restructured and partly disembedded from national political and cultural institutions. This trend of the globalized public sphere is not only as a geographical expansion form a nation to worldwide, but also changes the relationship between the public, the media and state (Volkmer, 1999:123).&lt;ref&gt;Volkmer, Ingrid (1999) News in the Global Sphere. A Study of [[CNN]] and its impact on [[Global Communication]], Luton: University of Luton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Virtual communities]]" are being established online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions.&lt;ref name="DeFleur 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeFleur|first=Everette E. Dennis, Melvin L.|title=Understanding media in the digital age : connections for communication, society, and culture|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=New York|isbn=0205595820}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Rheingold]] (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what we do in real life. "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk" (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For [[Sherry Turkle]] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" (Holmes 2005: 184). New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.

While this perspective suggests that the technology drives&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and therefore is a determining factor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the process of globalization, arguments involving [[technological determinism]] are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond (1974) 'Television: Technology and Cultural Form, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durham, M &amp; Kellner, Douglas (2001) Media and Cultural Studies Keyworks, Malden, Ma and Oxford, UK, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddings, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) "New Media: A Critical Introduction", London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of processes by which technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.

While commentators such as [[Manuel Castells|Castells]]&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"&gt;Castells, Manuel, (1996) Rise of the Network Society, The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture volume 1, Massachusetts, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; espouse a "soft determinism"&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddins, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) New Media: A Critical Introduction, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereby they contend that "Technology does not determine society. Nor does society script the course of technological change, since many factors, including individual inventiveness and entrpreneurialism, intervene in the process of scientific discovery, technical innovation and social applications, so the final outcome depends on a complex pattern of interaction. Indeed the dilemma of technological determinism is probably a false problem, since technology is society and society cannot be understood without its technological tools." (Castells 1996:5) This, however, is still distinct from stating that societal changes are instigated by technological development, which recalls the theses of [[Marshall McLuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962) The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, Toronto, McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

Manovich&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' [[MIT Press]], Cambridge and London&lt;/ref&gt; and Castells&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"/&gt; have argued that whereas mass media "corresponded to the logic of industrial mass society, which values conformity over individuality," (Manovich 2001:41) new media follows the logic of the postindustrial or globalized society whereby "every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and select her ideology from a large number of choices. Rather than pushing the same objects to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately." (Manovich 2001:42).

==As tool for social change==
[[Social movement]] media has a rich and storied history ''(see [[Agitprop]])'' that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003"&gt;[[Chris Atton|Atton, Chris]] "Reshaping Social Movement Media for a New Millennium." Social Movement Studies, 2, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] of [[Chiapas]], Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003" /&gt; Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]] was another landmark in the use of New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, television, "Will the Revolution be Cybercast?"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "New Technologies, TechnoCities, and the Prospects for Democratization"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paschal "Reshaping Communications: Technology, Information and Social Change," London:Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "Globalization and Technopolitics"&lt;/ref&gt; Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle."  In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Herman, "Is a New Worldwide Web Possible? An Explorative Comparison of the Use of ICTs by Two South African Social Movements," African Studies Review, Volume 50, Number 1 (April 2007), pp. 109–131&lt;/ref&gt; Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.&lt;ref&gt;Marmura, Stephen, "A net advantage? The Internet, grassroots activism and American Middle-Eastern Policy," New Media Society 2008; 10; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media has also found a use with less radical social movements such as the [[Free Hugs Campaign]]. Using websites, blogs, and online videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the movement itself. Along with this example the use of high volume blogs has allowed numerous views and practices to be more widespread and gain more public attention. Another example is the ongoing [[Free Tibet Campaign]], which has been seen on numerous websites as well as having a slight tie-in with the band [[Gorillaz]] in their Gorillaz Bitez clip featuring the lead singer [[2D (Gorillaz)|2D]] sitting with protesters at a Free Tibet protest. Another social change seen coming from New Media is trends in fashion and the emergence of subcultures such as [[SMS language|Text Speak]], [[Cyberpunk]], and various others.

Following trends in fashion and [[Text Speak]], New Media also makes way for "trendy" social change. The [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] is a recent example of this. All in the name of raising money for [[ALS]] (the lethal neurodegenerative disorder also known as [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]), participants are nominated by friends via [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and ownmirror to dump a bucket of ice water on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook's tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people's feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.

== National security ==
{{See also|Terrorism and social media}}
New Media has also recently become of interest to the global [[espionage]] community as it is easily accessible electronically in [[database]] format and can therefore be quickly retrieved and reverse engineered by national [[governments]]. Particularly of interest to the [[espionage]] community are [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], two sites where individuals freely divulge personal information that can then be sifted through and archived for the automatic creation of dossiers on both people of interest and the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Mind_Your_Tweets:_The_CIA_Social_Networking_Surveillance_System&lt;/ref&gt;

New media also serves as an important tool for both institutions and nations to promote their interest and values (The contents of such promotion may vary according to different  purposes). Some communities consider it an approach of "peaceful evolution" that may erode their own nation's system of values and eventually compromise national security.

==Interactivity==
[[Interactivity]] has become a term for a number of new media use options evolving from the rapid dissemination of [[Internet]] access points, the [[digitalization]] of media, and [[media convergence]]. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information.&lt;ref&gt;Schorr, A &amp; Schenk, M &amp; Campbell, W (2003),''Communication Research and Media Science in Europe'', Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Such a definition replaces the "[[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]]" model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a "[[many-to-many]]" web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, David &amp; Hoynes, William (2003) Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences (third edition), Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In "What is new media?" Vin Crosbie&lt;ref name="Crosbie, 2002"&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc] Crosbie, V. (2002). What is New Media? Retrieved from http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as "one to one", Mass media as "one to many", and finally New Media as [[Individuation]] Media or "many to many".

When we think of interactivity and its meaning, we assume that it is only prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf (1988). "[https://www.academia.edu/533664/Interactivity_From_new_media_to_communication Interactivity: From new media to communication]". Beverly Hills, CA. Pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and there is no longer a limit to what we can do with our creativity.

Interactivity can be considered a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf &amp; Ariel, Yaron (2007), "Assessing Interactivity in Computer-Mediated Research". In: A.N Joinson, K.Y.A McKenna., T. Postmes &amp; U-D. Reips (Eds). The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; different degrees of interactivity,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry (2002), ''New Media: An Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], UK, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Tony (1997) ''An Introduction to Digital Media'', Routledege, London&lt;/ref&gt; considers digital [[satellite television]] as an example of a new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.

[[Terry Flew]] (2005) argues that "the global interactive games industry is large and growing, and is at the forefront of many of the most significant innovations in new media" (Flew 2005: 101). Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Sims Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''. These games, which are developments of "new media," allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from different parts of the world interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of ''The Sims'', "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article The Sun Newspaper Online]&lt;/ref&gt; New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in. With the creation of ''Second Life'' and [[Active Worlds]] before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://secondlife.com/whatis/#Be_Creative&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media changes continuously because it is constantly modified and redefined by the interaction between users, emerging technologies, cultural changes, etc.

New forms of New Media are emerging like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with video games and the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and that people want to watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created that the majority of the gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.

==Industry==
The new media industry shares an open association with many market segments in areas such as [[software]]/[[video game design]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[mobile phone|mobile]] and particularly movies, [[advertising]] and [[marketing]], through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the [[Internet]]. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the [[television]] industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar [[interactive advertising]] subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] have also set up new divisions to study new media. [[Public relations]] firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through [[interactive PR]] practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2010/03/16/public-relations-social-media-results/&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a mass audience of online social network users.

With the rise of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many technical jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed.  What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not.  New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill's Cool, Creative and Egalitarian?&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ideology of new media careers as an egalitarian and stress-free environment is a myth. It is a game of networking and thriving at what you are capable of. Many workers face job instability. Inequality within this field exists due to the informality and flexibility of this career path.

Within the Industry, many Companies have emerged or transformed to adapt to the fast moving exciting opportunities that new media offers. The following companies are great examples of the changing landscape of companies/agencies whom have redeveloped, added or changed services to offer new media services.&lt;ref name="Counting the change – The Economist"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21583687-media-companies-took-battering-internet-cash-digital-sources-lasty|title=Counting the change|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on nationally representative data, a study conducted by [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth.&lt;ref&gt;Rideout V, Foehr U, Roberts D. Generation M2: Media in the lives o 8- to 18- year olds. January 2010, http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/8010.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, 8- to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week) – about the same amount most adults spend at work per day.  Since much of that time is spent 'media multitasking' (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]], 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults.aspx|title=Social Media and Young Adults|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|author2=Kristen Purcell |author3=Aaron Smith |author4=Kathryn Zickuhr |date=February 3, 2010|work=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site's stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Ólafsson, Kjartan |author3=Staksrud, Elisabeth |title=Risky Social Networking Practices Among "Underage" Users: Lessons for Evidence-Based Policy|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=303|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the new digital media demands a new educational model by parents and educators. The ''parental mediation'' become a way to manage the children’s experiences with Internet, chat, videogames and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/media-education/educating-in-the-knowledge-of-new-media/|title=Educating in the knowledge of New Media|date=2017-05-24|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in internet is Youtubers Generation. Youtubers are young people who offer free video in their personal channel on YouTube. There are videos on games, fashion, food, cinema and music, where they offers tutorial or comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/internet-and-social-network/who-are-they-and-why-do-kids-like-them-so-much/|title=YouTubers: Who are they, and why do kids like them so much?|date=2017-02-20|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of cellular phones, such as the [[iPhone]], has created the inability to be in [[social isolation]], and the potential of ruining relationships. The iPhone activates the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love. People show similar feelings to their phones as they would to their friends, family and loved ones. Countless people spend more time on their phones, while in the presence of other people than spending time with the people in the same room or class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindstrom|first=Martin|title=You Love Your iPhone.

==Political campaigns in the United States==
In trying to determine the impact of new media on [[political campaign]]ing and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. [[Television]] is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has had a significant impact on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different [[social media]] platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.

Additionally, their websites are socially connected, engaging voters before, during, and after elections. Email and [[text message]]s are also regularly sent to supporters encouraging them to donate and get involved.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"&gt;Owen, D. (2011). New Media and Political Campaigns. In K. K. Jamieson (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication Theory and Research. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some existing research focuses on the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data and in some cases harness the [[web analytics|analytics]] of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;
One body of existing research into the impact of new media on elections investigates the relationship between voters' use of new media and their level of political activity. They focus on areas such as "attentiveness, knowledge, attitudes, orientations, and engagement" (Owen, 2011). In references a vast body of research, Owen (2011) points out that older studies were mixed, while "newer research reveals more consistent evidence of information gain".&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;

Some of that research has shown that there is a connection between the amount and degree of voter engagement and turnout (Owen, 2011). However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either of those. Other research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it "imitates the established pattern of [[political participation]]" (Nam, 2012). After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Nam (2012) found that "the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation." These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2012). Dual effects on the internet on political activism: Reinforcing and mobilizing.Government Information Quarterly, S90–S97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towner (2013) found, in his survey of college students, that attention to new media increases offline and online political participation particularly for young people. His research shows that the prevalence of online media boosts participation and engagement. His work suggests that "it seems that online sources that facilitate political involvement, communication, and mobilization, particularly campaign websites, social media, and blogs, are the most important for offline political participation among young people".&lt;ref&gt;Towner, T. L. (2013). All Political Participation is Socially Networked? New Media and the 2012 Election. Social Science Computer Review, 00(0), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deliberation When gauging effects and implications of new media on the political process, one means of doing so is to look at the deliberations that take place in these digital spaces (Halpern &amp; Gibbs, 2013). In citing the work of several researchers, Halpern and Gibbs (2003) define deliberation to be "the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough discussion. and the notion that in this process of communication the individuals involved weigh carefully the reasons for and against some of the propositions presented by others".&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"&gt;Halpern, D., &amp; Gibbs, J. (2013). Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation? Exploring the affordances of Facebook and YouTube for political expression. Computers in Human Behavior, 1159-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Halpern and Gibbs (2013) "suggest that although social media may not provide a forum for intensive or in-depth policy debate, it nevertheless provides a deliberative space to discuss and encourage political participation, both directly and indirectly". Their work goes a step beyond that as well though because it shows that some social media sites foster a more robust [[political debate]] than do others such as Facebook which includes highly personal and identifiable access to information about users alongside any comments they may post on political topics. This is in contrast to sites like YouTube whose comments are often posted anonymously.&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"/&gt;

== Ethical Issues in New Media Research ==
Due to the popularity of new media, social media websites (SMWs) like Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular among researchers (Moreno, Goniu, Moreno, Diekema, 2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Goniu|first2=N.|last3=Moreno|first3=P.S|last4=Diekema|first4=D.|date=2013|title=Ethics of Social Media Research: Common Concerns and Practical Considerations|url=|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=16|pages=708–713|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0334|via=|pmc=3942703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SMWs present new opportunities, they also represent challenges for researchers interested in studying social phenomena online, since it can be difficult to determine what are acceptable risks to privacy unique to social media. Some scholars (e.g. Moreno, Frost &amp; Christakis, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Frost|first2=N.C.|last3=Christakis|first3=D.A|date=2008|title=Research ethics in the MySpace era|url=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|pages=157–161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures provide little guidance on research protocols relating to social media in particular.

As a consequence, Moreno et al. (2013) identified three major approaches to research on social media and relevant concerns scholars should consider before engaging in social media research.

=== Observational Research ===
One of the major issues for observational research is whether a particular project is considered to involve human subjects. A human subject is one that “is defined by federal regulations as a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private information”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreno et al. (2013) note that if access to a social media site is public, information is considered identifiable but not private, and information gathering procedures do not require researchers to interact with the original poster of the information, then this does not meet the requirements for human subjects research. Research may also be exempt if the disclosure of participant responses outside the realm of the published research does not subject the participant to civic or criminal liability, damage the participant’s reputation, employability or financial standing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given these criteria, however, researchers still have considerable leeway when conducting observational research on social media. Many profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Twitter are public and researchers are free to use that data for observational research.

It should be noted, however, that users have the ability to change their privacy settings on most social media websites. Facebook, for example, provides users with the ability to restrict who sees their posts through specific privacy settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.A|date=2011|title=Social privacy in networked publics: teens' attitudes, practices and strategies. A decade in internet time.|url=|journal=Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also debate about whether requiring users to create a username and password is sufficient to establish whether the data is considered public or private. Historically, Institutional Review Boards considered such websites to be private,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although newer websites like YouTube call this practice into question. For example, YouTube only requires the creation of a username and password to post videos and/or view adult content, but anyone is free to view general YouTube videos and these general videos would not be subject to consent requirements for researchers looking to conduct observational studies.

=== Interactive Research ===
According to Romano et al. (2013), interactive research occurs when "a researcher wishes to access the [social media website] content that is not publicly available" (pg. 710). Because researchers have limited ways of accessing this data, this could mean that a researcher sends a Facebook user a friend request, or follows a user on Twitter in order to gain access to potentially protected tweets (pg.711). While it could be argued that such actions would violate a social media user's expectation of privacy, Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) argued that actions like "friending" or "following" an individual on social media constitutes a "loose tie" relationship and therefore not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy since individuals often have friends or followers they have never even met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=July 2007|title=The Benefits of Facebook "Friends:" Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143–1168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey/Interview Research ===
Because research on social media occurs online, it is difficult for researchers to observe participant reactions to the informed consent process. For example, when collecting information about activities that are potentially illegal, or recruiting participants from stigmatized populations, this lack of physical proximity could potentially negatively impact the informed consent process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another important consideration regards the confidentiality of information provided by participants. While information provided over the internet might be perceived as lower risk, studies that publish direct quotes from study participants might expose them to the risk of being identified via a Google search&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 4 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s speech at [[Columbia University]] in 2007.]]A '''political argument''' is an instance of a [[logical argument]] applied to [[politics]]. Political arguments are used by [[academia|academics]], media [[pundit (politics)|pundits]], candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously [[fallacy|fallacious]].

A classic example of political arguments are those contained in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' arguing in favor of ratification of the [[American constitution]].

There are several ways of classifying political argument:

* Based on the purpose of the argument.
* Based on the logical structure of the argument.
* Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.

== Purpose of political argument ==

The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief. Political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda.  One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that [[propaganda]] will take the place of argument.  In a [[democracy]], though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power.  In this case, political argument is an important element of [[political strategy]]. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda.

This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of [[social choice]]. Consider a social decision [[model (abstract)|model]] of the kind used in the [[theory of social choice]] (such as used in stating [[Arrow's theorem]]).  In this model society has a set of individuals ''X'' and it faces a set (political) alternatives ''A'' which need to be ranked in some way.  A ''ranking'' is a [[binary relation|relation]] ''R'' between the elements of ''A'' which is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. Note that two alternatives ''a'', ''b'' can satisfy ''a R b'' and ''b R a''. If this is the case, we say ''R'' is indifferent to ''a'', ''b''.  Each individual ''x'' in ''X'' will have an idiosyncratic ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of the alternatives in ''A''. A ''profile'' is any function ''P'' that associate to each individual ''x'' a ranking of alternatives ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;; a profile is thus a function from ''X'' to rankings of ''A''. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt; for the whole society from any profile ''P''. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function ''P'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an ''effective'' political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. ''Effective'' political argument is a concept distinct from ''valid'' political argument.

=== Example ===
{{POV check|date=December 2008}}
Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point ''T'', that is individuals with income in excess of ''T'' pay taxes, everyone else pays no taxes.   In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate ''T'' can be determined: the [[median]] income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change individual's ''voting by their pocket book'' by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, that is raising the tax cutoff point.

A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.

== Structure of political argument ==

Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion etc.   An argument cannot start from purely logical principles.  An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions.  The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of  argument (which  we can consider rules of fairness).

Semantically, one should note that some of the  premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument, are associated to specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable.  For example, arguments concerning  war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in  a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

"'''Pretty Fly for a Rabbi'''" (alternatively called "'''Pretty Fly (For a Rabbi)'''" in Australia) is a song by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. It is a parody of "[[Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)]]" by [[The Offspring]], and it was released from the [[1999 in music|1999]] album ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]''. The song was released as a single exclusively in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allthingsyank.com/singles/rabbi.htm Pretty Fly for a Rabbi Single]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tress MacNeille]]  performs the line "How ya doin' Bernie?", and appears in the music video. Voice Actress [[Mary Kay Bergman]] also contributes with the, "For a rabbi!" line near the middle of the song.

As opposed to the phrase "Gunter Glieben Glauten Globen" in the original song, Weird Al starts this song with the [[Yiddish]] sentence "Weren soll von dir a Blintze" meaning "You should turn into a [[blintz]]." At one point, Yankovic references the line "Mecca lecca hi, mecca hiney hiney ho" and "Mecca-lecca hi mecca lecca chahney ho!", catchphrases of [[Jambi (Pee-wee's Playhouse)|Jambi]], the wish-granting disembodied head from ''[[Pee-Wee's Playhouse]]''.

==Music video==
A "music video" for the song was assembled for the singles release in Australia. Yankovic stated that his Australian record company decided to release "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi" as a single and they insisted on releasing a video to go along with it. He decided against the idea, but told them that they could make one themselves by cutting together bits from ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic Live!]]'', which they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100 |title='Ask Al' Q&amp;As for January, 2000 |last=Al |first=Weird |work=WeirdAl.com |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121216133001/http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm%230100#0100 |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The psychology of art''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the [[perception]], [[cognition]] and characteristics of art and its production. For the use of [[art materials]] as a form of [[psychotherapy]], see [[art therapy]].  The psychology of art is related to [[architectural psychology]] and [[environmental psychology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The work of [[Theodor Lipps]], a Munich-based research psychologist, played an important role in the early development of the concept of ''art psychology'' in the early decade of the twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His most important contribution in this respect was his attempt to theorize the question of Einfuehlung or "[[empathy]]", a term that was to become a key element in many subsequent theories of ''art psychology''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

== History ==

===1880-1950===
One of the earliest to integrate psychology with [[art history]] was [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), a Swiss art critic and historian, whose dissertation ''Prolegomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur'' (1886) attempted to show that architecture could be understood from a purely psychological (as opposed to a historical-progressivist) point of view.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. ''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure in the development of art psychology was [[Wilhelm Worringer]], who provided some of the earliest theoretical justification for expressionist art. The Psychology of Art (1925) by [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896–1934) is another classical work. [[Richard Müller-Freienfels]] was another important early theorist.&lt;ref name="RMF"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychologie der Kunst | author=Müller-Freienfels, R | publisher=Teubner | location=Leipzig, Germany | year=1923 | url=https://archive.org/details/psychologiederk00fregoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous artists in the twentieth century began to be influenced by the psychological argument, including [[Naum Gabo]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and somewhat [[Josef Albers]] and [[György Kepes]]. The French adventurer and film theorist [[André Malraux]] was also interested in the topic and wrote the book [[La Psychologie de l'Art]] (1947-9) later revised and republished as ''The Voices of Silence''.

===1950-present===
Though the disciplinary foundations of art psychology were first developed in Germany, there were soon advocates, in psychology, the arts or in philosophy, pursuing their own variants in the USSR, England ([[Clive Bell]] and [[Herbert Read]]), France ([[André Malraux]], [[Jean-Paul Weber]], for example), and the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the US, the philosophical premises of art psychology were strengthened—and given political valence—in the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Time of American Liberalism''. W.W. Norton 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Art as Experience'' was published in 1934, and was the basis for significant revisions in teaching practices whether in the kindergarten or in the university. Manuel Barkan, head of the Arts Education School of Fine and Applied Arts at Ohio State University, and one of the many pedagogues influenced by the writings of Dewey, explains, for example, in his book ''The Foundations of Art Education'' (1955), that the aesthetic education of children prepares the child for a life in a complex democracy. Dewey himself played a seminal role in setting up the program of the [[Barnes Foundation]] in Philadelphia, which became famous for its attempt to integrate art into the classroom experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al. (1993). ''Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 6, 13–14. {{ISBN|0-679-40963-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of art psychology between 1950 and 1970 also coincided with the expansion of art history and museum programs. The popularity of [[Gestalt psychology]] in the 1950s added further weight to the discipline. The seminal work was ''Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality'' (1951), that was co-authored by [[Fritz Perls]], Paul Goodman, and Ralph Hefferline. The writings of [[Rudolf Arnheim]] (born 1904) were also particularly influential during this period. His ''Toward a Psychology of Art'' (Berkeley: University of California Press) was published in 1966. [[Art therapy]] drew on many of the lessons of art psychology and tried to implement them in the context of ego repair.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: Arthur Robbins and Linda Beth Sibley, ''Creative Art Therapy''. (Brunner/Mazel, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing]] also began to draw on the lessons of art psychology in the layout of stores as well as in the placement and design of commercial goods.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Creating images and the psychology of marketing communication'', Edited by Lynn R. Kahle &amp; Chung-Hyun Kim (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art psychology, generally speaking, was at odds with the principles of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]] with many art psychologists critiquing, what they interpreted as, its reductivism [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that the creative process is an alternative to neuroses. He felt that it was likely a sort of defence mechanism against the negative effects of neuroses, a way to translate that energy into something socially acceptable, which could entertain and please others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Jeff|title=Understanding Creativity: What Drives us to Create?|url=http://www.naturibeauty.com/understanding-creativity-drives-us-create/|publisher=Psychology of Beauty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Carl Jung]], however, had a favorable reception among art psychologists given his optimistic portrayal of the role of art and his belief that the contents of the personal unconscious and, more particularly, the collective unconscious, could be accessed by art and other forms of cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=18–103 |chapter=Approaching the Unconscious|first=Carl|last=Jung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=230–271 |chapter=Symbolism in the Visual Arts |last= Jaffe|first=Aniela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the centrality of art psychology in academy began to wane. Artists became more interested in [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock (ed.), ''Psychoanalysis and the Image''. (Oxford: Blackwell. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher (ed.), ''Inside the Visible''. (MIT Press, Boston, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and architects in [[phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and the writings of [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]] and [[Derrida]]. As for art and architectural historians, they critiqued psychology for being anti-contextual and culturally naive. [[Erwin Panofsky]], who had a tremendous{{peacock term|date=June 2016}} impact on the shape of art history in the US, argued that historians should focus less on what is seen and more on what was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Podro ''The Critical Historians of Art'' (Yale University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Arnold and Margaret Iverson (eds.) ''Art and Thought''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, psychology still plays an important role in art discourse, though mainly in the field of art appreciation.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek/&gt;

Because of the growing interest in personality theory—especially in connection with the work of Isabel Briggs Myers and Katherine Briggs (developers of the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]])—contemporary theorists are investigating the relationship between personality type and art. Patricia Dinkelaker and John Fudjack have addressed the relationship between artists’ personality types and works of art; approaches to art as a reflection of functional preferences associated with personality type; and the function of art in society in light of personality theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/j7readintro.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Experience==

Art is considered to be a subjective field, in which one composes and views artwork in unique ways that reflect one’s experience, knowledge, preference, and emotions.  The aesthetic experience encompasses the relationship between the viewer and the art object.  In terms of the artist, there is an emotional attachment that drives the focus of the art.  An artist must be completely in-tune with the art object in order to enrich its creation.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0014292|title=An experiential account of the psychology of art|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=3|issue=3|pages=181–187|year=2009|last1=Sullivan|first1=Paul|last2=McCarthy|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the piece of art progresses during the creative process, so does the artist.  Both grow and change to acquire new meaning.  If the artist is too emotionally attached or lacking emotional compatibility with a work of art, then this will negatively impact the finished product.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;  According to Bosanquet (1892), the "aesthetic attitude" is important in viewing art because it allows one to consider an object with ready interest to see what it suggests.  However, art does not evoke an aesthetic experience unless the viewer is willing and open to it.  No matter how compelling the object is, it is up to the beholder to allow the existence of such an experience.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Lloyd E.|last1=Sandelands|first2=Georgette C.|last2=Buckner|chapter=Of Art and Work: Aesthetic Experience and the Psychology of Work Feelings|chapter-url=http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=11|pp=105–131|isbn=9780892329212|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073948/http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eyes of Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim, the aesthetic experience of art stresses the relationship between the whole object and its individual parts.  He is widely known for focusing on the experiences and interpretations of artwork, and how they provide insight into peoples' lives.  He was less concerned with the cultural and social contexts of the experience of creating and viewing artwork.  In his eyes, an object as a whole is considered with less scrutiny and criticism than the consideration of the specific aspects of its entity.  Artwork reflects one’s "lived experience" of his/her life.  Arnheim believed that all psychological processes have cognitive, emotional, and motivational qualities, which are reflected in the compositions of every artist.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;

==Psychological research==

===Overview: bottom-up and top-down processing===
Cognitive psychologists consider both "bottom-up" and "top-down" processing when considering almost any area of research, including vision.&lt;ref name=Lindell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindell|first=Annukka K.|author2=Mueller, Julia |title=Can science account for taste? Psychological insights into art appreciation|journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date=1 June 2011|volume=23|issue=4|pages=453–475|doi=10.1080/20445911.2011.539556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso&gt;{{cite book|last=Solso|first=Robert L.|title=The psychology of art and the evolution of the conscious brain|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262194848|pages=2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cog text"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology : applying the science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=9780205033645|edition=3rd|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to how these terms are used in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|software design]], "bottom-up" refers to how information in the stimulus is processed by the visual system into colors, shapes, patterns, etc.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso /&gt; "Top-down" refers to conceptual knowledge and past experience of the particular individual.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso /&gt; Bottom-up factors identified in how art is appreciated include abstract vs figurative painting, form, complexity, symmetry and compositional balance, laterality and movement.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt; Top-down influences identified as being related to art appreciation include prototypicality, novelty, additional information like titles, and expertise.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;

=== Abstract versus figurative art ===
[[Abstract paintings]] are unique in the explicit abandonment of representational intentions.&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landau|first=Mark J.|author2=Greenberg, Jeff |author3=Solomon, Sheldon |author4=Pyszczynski, Tom |author5= Martens, Andy |title=Windows Into Nothingness: Terror Management, Meaninglessness, and Negative Reactions to Modern Art|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=90|issue=6|pages=879–892|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.6.879|pmid=16784340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative or [[representational art]] is described as unambiguous or requiring mild interpretation.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

==== The importance of meaning ====
The popular distaste for abstract art is a direct consequence of [[semantic ambiguity]].&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Researchers have examined the role of [[Terror management theory|terror management theory (TMT)]] concerning meaning and the aesthetic experience of abstract versus figurative art. This theory suggests that humans, like all life forms are biologically oriented toward continued survival but are uniquely aware that their lives will inevitably end. TMT reveals that modern art is often disliked because it lacks appreciable meaning, and is thus incompatible with the underlying terror management motive to maintain a meaningful conception of reality.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;  [[Mortality salience]], or the knowledge of approaching death, was manipulated in a study aimed at examining how aesthetic preferences for seemingly meaningful and meaningless art are influenced by intimations of mortality. The mortality salience condition consisted of two opened ended questions about emotions and physical details concerning the participant’s own death.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Participants were then instructed to view two abstract paintings and rate how attractive they find them.  A t test comparing the mortality salience condition and the control found that participants in the mortality salience condition found the art less attractive.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

The meaning maintenance model of sociology states that when a committed meaning framework is threatened, people experience an arousal state that prompts them to affirm any other meaning framework to which they are committed.&lt;ref name="Absurd art"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proulx|first=T.|author2=Heine, S. J. |author3=Vohs, K. D. |title=When Is the Unfamiliar the Uncanny? Meaning Affirmation After Exposure to Absurdist Literature, Humor, and Art|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=5 May 2010|volume=36|issue=6|pages=817–829|doi=10.1177/0146167210369896|pmid=20445024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers sought to illustrate this phenomenon by demonstrating a heightened personal need for structure following the experience of abstract artwork.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;  Participants were randomly assigned to a between-subjects viewing of artwork (abstract vs. representational vs. absurd artwork), followed by allocation of the Personal Need for Structure scale. Personal Need for Structure scale is used to detect temporary increases in people’s need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; Theoretically, one should experience more need for structure when viewing abstract art than figurative art since unrelated meaning threats (abstract art) evoke a temporarily heightened general need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; However, results showed that overall scores for representational art, and abstract art did not differ significantly from one another.  Participants reported higher scores on the Personal Need for Structure scale in absurd rather than abstract art. Yet, the question remains as to whether the same kinds of results would be obtained with an expanded sample of abstract expressionist or absurd images.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;

==== Complexity ====

Studies have shown that when looking at abstract art, people prefer complexity in the work to a certain extent.  When measuring "interestingness" and "pleasingness," viewers rated works higher for abstract works that were more complex.  With added exposure to the abstract work, liking ratings continued to rise with both subjective complexity (viewer rated) and judged complexity (artist rated).  This was only true up to a certain point.  When the works became too complex, people began to like the works less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=237–249|doi=10.1037/h0082029|title=Preference for non-representational art as a function of various measures of complexity|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|volume=29|issue=3|year=1975|last1=Nicki|first1=R. M.|last2=Moss|first2=Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neural evidence ====
Neuroanatomical evidence from studies using [[fMRI]] scans of aesthetic preference show that representational paintings are preferred over abstract paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuroanatomical correlates of aesthetic preference for paintings|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology|year=2004|volume=15|issue=5|pages=893–897|doi=10.1097/00001756-200404090-00032|last1=Vartanian|first1=Oshin|last2=Goel|first2=Vinod}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is displayed through significant activation of brain regions related to preference ratings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  To test this, researchers had participants view paintings that varied according to type (representational vs. abstract) and format (original vs. altered vs. filtered). Behavioral results demonstrated a significantly higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt; A positive correlation existed between preference ratings and response latency. FMRI results revealed that activity in the right [[caudate nucleus]] extending to [[putamen]] decreased in response to decreasing preference for paintings, while activity in the left [[cingulate sulcus]], [[Gyri|bilateral occipital gyri]], [[Gyri|bilateral fusiform gyri]], [[Gyri|right fusiform gyrus]], and [[Cerebellum|bilateral cerebellum]] increased in response to increasing preference for paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  The observed differences were a reflection of relatively increased activation associated with higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;

Brain wave studies have also been conducted to look at how artists and non-artists react in different ways to abstract and representational art.  EEG brain scans showed that while viewing abstract art, non-artists showed less arousal than artists.  However, while viewing figurative art, both artists and non-artists had comparable arousal and ability to pay attention and evaluate the art stimuli.  This suggests abstract art requires more expertise to appreciate it than does figurative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Style and spectral power: Processing of abstract and representational art in artists and non-artists|journal=Perception|date=11 June 2010|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1659–1671|doi=10.1068/p6747|pmid=21425703|author1=Batt|first1=R|last2=Palmiero|first2=M|last3=Nakatani|first3=C|last4=Van Leeuwen|first4=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personality type ====
Individual personality traits are also related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Individuals chronically disposed to clear, simple, and unambiguous knowledge express a particularly negative aesthetic experience towards abstract art, due to the void of meaningful content.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Studies have provided evidence that a person’s choice of art can be a useful measure of personality.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personality and judgments of abstract, pop art, and representational paintings|journal=European Journal of Personality|year=2001|volume=15|issue=1|pages=57–72|doi=10.1002/per.340|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Walker|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual personality traits are related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Testing personality after viewing abstract and representational art was performed on the [[NEO-Five Factor Inventory|NEO Five-Factor Inventory]] which measures the [[Big Five personality traits|“big five” factors of personality]].&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;  When referencing the “Big Five” dimensions of personality, Thrill and Adventure Seeking were positively correlated with a liking of representational art, while Disinhibition was associated with positive ratings of abstract art. Neuroticism was positively correlated with positive ratings of abstract art, while Conscientiousness was linked to liking of representational art. Openness to Experience was linked to positive ratings of abstract and representational art.&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;

==== Automatic evaluation ====

Studies looking at implicit, automatic evaluation of art works have investigated how people react to abstract and figurative art works in the split-second before they had time to think about it.  In implicit evaluation, people reacted more positively to the figurative art, where they could at least make out the shapes.  In terms of explicit evaluation, when people had to think about the art, there was no real difference in judgement between abstract and representational art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano |author2=Bartoli, Gabriella |author3=Carrus, Giuseppe|title=The Automatic Aesthetic Evaluation of Different Art and Architectural Styles|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2011|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–134|doi=10.1037/a0021126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laterality and movement ===

==== Handedness and reading direction ====

Laterality and movement in visual art includes aspects such as interest, weight, and balance. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of handedness and reading direction on how one perceives a piece of art. Research has been conducted to determine if hemispheric specialization or reading habits affect the direction in which participants “read” a painting. Results indicate that both factors contribute to the process. Furthermore, hemispheric specialization leads individuals to read from left to right, giving those readers an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maass|first=A|author2=Russo, A |title=Directional bias in the mental representation of spatial events: nature or culture?|journal=Psychological Science|date=July 2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=296–301|pmid=12807400|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Building off of these findings, other researchers studied the idea that individuals who are accustomed to reading in a certain direction (right to left, versus left to right) would then display a bias in their own representational drawings reflecting the direction of their reading habits. Results indicated that this prediction held true, in that participants’ drawings reflected their reading bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaid|first=Jyotsna|author2=Rhodes, Rebecca |author3=Tosun, Sumeyra |author4= Eslami, Zohra |title=Script Directionality Affects Depiction of Depth in Representational Drawings|journal=Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=3|pages=241–248|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000068|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also looked to see if one’s reading direction, left to right or right to left affects one’s preference for either a left to right directionality or a right to left directionality in pictures. Participants were shown images as well as its mirror image, and were asked to indicate which they found more aesthetically pleasing. Overall, results indicate that one’s reading directionality impacts one’s preference for pictures either with left to right directionality or right to left directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chokron|first=Sylvie|author2=De Agostini, Maria|title=Reading habits influence aesthetic preference|journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=10|issue=1–2|pages=45–49|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(00)00021-5|pmid=10978691|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, researchers examined if the right-side bias in aesthetic preference is affected by handedness or reading/writing habits. The researchers looked at Russian readers, Arabic readers, and Hebrew readers that were right handed and non-right-handed. Participants viewed pictures taken from art books that were profiles or human faces and bodies in two blocks. Images were shown to participants as inward or outward facing pairs and then in the opposite orientation. After viewing each pair, participants were asked which image of the pair was more aesthetically pleasing. When looking at the results for handedness, right-handed participants had "left preferences" and non right-handed participants had "right preferences". These results indicated that “aesthetic preference for facial and bodily profiles is associated primarily with the directionality of acquired reading/writing habits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nachson|first=I.|author2=Argaman, E. |author3=Luria, A. |title=Effects of Directional Habits and Handedness on Aesthetic Preference for Left and Right Profiles|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1177/0022022199030001006|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reading direction seems to impact how people of all ages view artwork. Using kindergarten to college aged participants, researchers tested viewers’ aesthetic preference when comparing an original piece of art with its mirror image. The original paintings followed the convention that viewers "read" paintings from left to right; therefore, the patterns of light directed the audience to view the painting in the same manner. Findings indicated that participants preferred the original paintings, most likely due to the western style of viewing paintings from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swartz|first=Paul|author2=Hewitt, David |title=Lateral organization in pictures and aesthetic preference|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1970|volume=30|issue=3|pages=991–1007|doi=10.2466/pms.1970.30.3.991|pmid=5429349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lighting direction====

The direction of the lighting placed on a painting also seems to have an effect on aesthetic preference. The left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with lighting coming from the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place lighting on the upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with lighting on the left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was lighter on the right side and when given the opportunity to create light on an already existing painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDine|first=David A.|author2=Livingston, Ian J. |author3=Thomas, Nicole A. |author4= Elias, Lorin J. |title=Lateral biases in lighting of abstract artwork|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|volume=16|issue=3|pages=268–279|doi=10.1080/13576500903548382|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Left and right cheek bias====

The left cheek bias occurs when viewers prefer portraits with the subject displaying their left cheek, while those that hold a right cheek bias prefer portraits displaying the right cheek. Studies have found mixed results concerning the left cheek bias and the right cheek bias. Male and female participants were shown male and female portraits, each displaying an equal number of left or right cheek positions.  Participants were shown each portrait in its original orientation and in its reversed orientation and asked which portrait they preferred more. Results indicated that the majority of participants chose portraits displaying the subject’s right cheek over the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=John P.|author2=Murphy, Kimberly E. |title=Preference for Profile Orientation in Portraits|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.2190/MUD5-7V3E-YBN2-Q2XJ|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study explored which posing orientations conveyed certain messages. Scientists in the 18th century{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} more commonly displayed a right cheek bias, and were rated as “more scientific.” According to the researchers, showing one’s right cheek hides emotion, while the left cheek expresses it. The shift from right to left cheek bias post 18th century may represent more personal or open facial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=175–192|doi=10.1023/A:1020713416442|year=2002|last1=ten Cate|first1=Carel|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|title=Posing as Professor: Laterality in Posing Orientation for Portraits of Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===

Complexity can literally be defined as being "made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions."&lt;ref name="Simon (Econ)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=H. A.|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been applied to many subjects, such as art, music, dance, and literature. In aesthetics research, complexity has been divided into three dimensions that account for the interaction between the amount of elements, differences in elements, and patterns in their arrangement. Furthermore, this characteristic in aesthetics consists of a wide spectrum, ranging from low complexity to high complexity. Key studies have found through [[Galvanic skin response]] that more complex artworks produce greater physiological arousal and higher hedonic ratings,&lt;ref name=Krupinski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krupinski|first=E|author2=Locher, P |title=Skin conductance and aesthetic evaluative responses to nonrepresentational works of art varying in symmetry|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1988|volume=26|issue=4|pages=355–358|doi=10.3758/bf03337681}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with other findings that claim that aesthetic liking increases with complexity. Most important, several studies have found that there exists a [[#Inverse U-Shape hypothesis|U-shape]] relationship between aesthetic preference and complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berlyne|first=D.E.|title=Aesthetics and Psychobiology|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measuring complexity====
In general, complexity is a something that has many parts in an intricate progression. Some researchers break complexity down into two different subparts: objective complexity and perceived complexity. Objective complexity is any part of art that could be manipulated. For visual art that may be the size of the shapes, the number of patterns, or the number of colors used. For acoustic art that could include duration, loudness, number of different harmonies, number of changes in rhythmic activity, and rate of rhythmic activity.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Mark|author2=Ohlsson, Stellan |title=Relationship Between Complexity and Liking as a Function of Expertise|journal=Music Perception|year=2005|volume=22|issue=4|pages=583–611|doi=10.1525/mp.2005.22.4.583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of complexity is perceived complexity, or subjective complexity. In this form each individual person rates an object on the complexity they perceive. Therefore, subjective complexity might depict our view of complexity more accurately, however, the measure may change from person to person.

One form of using computer technology to rate complexity, is by using computer intelligence when rating an image.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=K.|author2=Harrell, S. |author3=Ji, X. |title=Computational Aesthetics: On the Complexity of Computer-Generated Paintings|journal=Leonardo|year=2012|volume=45|issue=3|pages=243–248|doi=10.1162/leon_a_00366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this format, the amount of computer intelligence used is assessed when creating a digital image. Computer intelligence is assessed by recording the mathematic formulas used in creating the images. Human involvement, adding or taking away aspects of the image, could also add or take away from the complexity of the image.&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;

One way to measure complexity is to manipulate original artwork to contain various levels of density.  This process is done by subtracting and adding pixels to change the density of black and white paintings. This technique allowed researchers to use authentic artwork, instead of creating artificial versions of artwork, to control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neperud|first=Ronald|author2=Marschalek |title=Informational and Affect Bases of Aesthetic Response|journal=Leonardo|year=1988|volume=21|issue=3|pages=305–31|doi=10.2307/1578660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others find it best to measure complexity based on the number of parts an artwork has.&lt;ref name=Chamorro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=T|author2=Burke, C. |title=Personality Predictors of Artistic Preferences as a Function of Emotional Valence and Perceived Complexity of Paintings|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0019211|pages=196–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; More aspects to the art, such as more colors, details, shapes, objects, sounds, melodies, and the like, create a more complex artwork. However, there is limited research done on the comparison between part based complexity and human perception of complexity, making it unclear if people perceive images with more parts as being more complex.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

====Inverse U-Shape hypothesis====

[[File:Inverted u.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Inverted-U Graph.]]
The Inverted U-Shape Hypothesis suggests that aesthetic responses in relation to complexity will exhibit an inverted-shape distribution.  In other words, the lowest ratings in aesthetic responses correlate with high and low levels of complexity, which displays an "avoidance of extremes". Furthermore, the highest level of aesthetic response occurs in the middle level of complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971" /&gt; Previous studies have confirmed the U-Shape hypothesis (see Inverted U-graph image). For instance, in a study of undergraduates’ ratings of liking and complexity of contemporary pop music reported an inverted U-shape relationship between liking and complexity.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

Previous research, suggest that this trend of complexity could also be associated with ability to understand, in which observers prefer artwork that is not too easy or too difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=What Is Interesting? Exploring the Appraisal Structure of Interest|journal=Emotion|year=2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.89|pmid=15755222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research both confirms and disconfirms predictions that suggest that individual characteristics such as artistic expertise and training can produce a shift in the inverted U-shape distribution.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

====Aspects of art====

;Visual art

A general trend shows that the relationship between image complexity and pleasantness ratings form an inverted-U shape graph (see [[#Art and expertise|Expertise]] section for exceptions). This means that people increasingly like art as it goes from very simple to more complex, until a peak, when pleasantness ratings being to fall again.

A recent study had also found that we tend to rate natural environment and landscape images as more complex, hence liking them more than abstract images that we rate as less complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsythe|first=A|author2=Nadal, M. |author3=Sheehy, C. |author4=Cela-Conde, C. |author5=Sawey, M. |title=Predicting beauty: Fractal dimension and visual complexity in art|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=2011|doi=10.1348/000712610X498958 |pmid=21241285|volume=102 |issue=1|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Music
Music shows similar trends in complexity vs. preference ratings as does visual art. When comparing popular music, for the time period, and perceived complexity ratings the known inverted-U shape relationship appears, showing that generally we like moderately complex music the most.&lt;ref name=North&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=A.C.|author2=Hargreaves, D.J. |title=Subjective Complexity, Familiarity, and Liking for Popular Music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the music selection gets more or less complex, our preference for that music dips. People who have more experience and training in popular music, however, prefer slightly more complex music.&lt;ref name=North /&gt; The inverted-U graph shifts to the right for people a stronger musical background. A similar pattern can be seen for [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass music]].&lt;ref name=Orr /&gt; Those with limited musical training in jazz and bluegrass demonstrate the typical inverted-U when looking at complexity and preference, however, experts in those fields do not demonstrate the same pattern. Unlike the popular music experts, jazz and bluegrass experts did not show a distinct relationship between complexity and pleasantness. Experts in those two genres of music seem to just like what they like, without having a formula to describe their behavior. Since different styles of music have different effects on preference for experts, further studies would need to be done to draw conclusions for complexity and preference ratings for other styles.

;Dance

Psychological studies have shown that the hedonic likings of dance performances can be influenced by complexity. One experiment used twelve dance choreographies that consist of three levels of complexity performed at four different tempos. Complexity in the dance sequences were created varying the sequence of six movement patterns (i.e. circle clockwise, circle counterclockwise, and approach stage). Overall, this studied showed that observers prefer choreographies with complex dance sequences and faster tempos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodchilds|first=Jacqueline|author2=Thornton B. Roby |author3=Momoyo Ise |title=Evaluative reactions to the viewing of pseudo-dance sequences: Selected temporal and spatial aspects.|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=1969|volume=79|issue=1|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/00224545.1969.9922395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal differences====

It has been found that personality differences and demographic differences may lead different art preferences as well. One study tested peoples preferences on various art pieces, taking into account their personal preferences as well. The study found that gender diffences exist in art preference. Women generally prefer happy, colorful, and simple paintings whereas men generally prefer geometric, sad, and complex paintings. An age difference in complexity preferences exists as well, where preference for complex paintings increases as age increases.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt;

Certain personality traits can also predict the relationship between art complexity and preference.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; In one study it was found that people who scored high on conscientiousness liked complex painting less than people who scored low on conscientiousness. This falls in line with the idea that conscientious people dislike uncertainty and enjoy control, thereby disliking artwork that might threaten such feelings. On the other hand, people who scored highly on openness to experience liked complex artworks more than those who didn't score highly on openness to experience. Individual differences are better predictors for preference of complex art than simple art, where no clear personality traits predict preference for simple art. Although educational level did not have a direct relationship with complexity, higher educational levels led to more museum visits, which in turn led to more appreciation of complex art.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; This shows that more exposure to complex art leads to greater preference, where indeed familiarity causes greater liking.

===Symmetry===
Symmetry and beauty have a strong biological link that influences aesthetic preferences. It has been shown that humans tend to prefer art that contains symmetry, deeming it more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tinio|first=P. P. L.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Just how stable are stable aesthetic features? Symmetry, complexity, and the jaws of massive familiarisation|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2009|volume=130|issue=3|pages=241–250|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.01.001|pmid=19217589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, symmetry directly correlates to the understanding of a face or artwork as beautiful.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.|author2=Lisa, D.M. |author3=Little, A. |title=The role of symmetry in attraction to average faces|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=69|issue=8|pages=1273–1277|doi=10.3758/BF03192944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the symmetry within the work or the face, generally the more beautiful it appears to be.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Research on aesthetic preference for geometric forms and the fluent processing of symmetry sheds light on the role that symmetry plays in the overall aesthetic judgment and experience.

Humans innately tend to see and have a visual preference for symmetry, an identified quality yielding a positive aesthetic experience that uses an automatic bottom-up factor.&lt;ref name=Rentschler&gt;{{cite journal|title=Innate and learned components of human visual preference|journal=Current Biology|year=1999|volume=9|issue=13|pages=665–671|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80306-6|pmid=10395537|author1=Rentschler|first1=I|last2=Jüttner|first2=M|last3=Unzicker|first3=A|last4=Landis|first4=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottom-up factor is speculated to rely on learning experience and visual processing in the brain, suggesting a biological basis.&lt;ref name=Rentschler/&gt; Many studies have ventured to explain this innate preference for symmetry with methods including the [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT).&lt;ref name=Makin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makin|first=Alexis D. J. |author2=Pecchineda, A. |author3=Bertamini, M.|title=Implicit Affective Evaluation of Visual Symmetry|journal=Emotion|year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026924|pmid=22251051 |volume=12|issue=5 |pages=1021–1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that we may prefer symmetry because it is easy to process; hence we have a higher perceptual fluency when works are symmetrical.&lt;ref name=Reber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=Rolf|author2=Schwarz, Norbert |author3=Winkielman, Piotr |title=Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure: Is Beauty in the Perceiver's Processing Experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=1 November 2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|pmid=15582859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluency research draws on evidence from humans and animals that point to the importance of symmetry regardless of biological necessity. This research highlights the efficiency with which computers recognize and process symmetrical objects relative to non-symmetrical models.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; There have been investigations regarding the objective features that stimuli contain that may affect the fluency and therefore the preferences.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; Factors such as amount of information given, the extent of symmetry, and figure-ground contrast are only a few listed in the literature.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; This preference for symmetry has led to question on how fluency affects our implicit preferences by using the [[Implicit Association Test]]. Findings suggest that perceptual fluency is a factor that elicits implicit responses, as shown with the [[Implicit Association Test]] results.&lt;ref name=Makin/&gt; Research has branched from studying aesthetic pleasure and symmetry on an explicit but also implicit level. In fact, research tries to integrate [[priming (psychology)]], cultural influences and the different types of stimuli that may elicit an aesthetic preference.

Further research investigating perceptual fluency has found a gender bias towards neutral stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Kathrine|author2=Bar, Moshe |title=Preference for symmetry: Only on Mars?|journal=Perception|year=2011|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1254–1256|doi=10.1068/p7057|pmid=22308897|pmc=3786096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies pertaining to generalizing symmetry preference to real-world versus abstract objects allow us to further examine the possible influence meaning may have on preference for a given stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; In order to determine whether meaning mattered for a given stimuli, participants were asked to view pairs of objects and make a forced-choice decision, evaluating their preference.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; The findings suggest that an overall preference for symmetric features of visual objects existed. Furthermore, a main effect for gender preference existed in the males that consistently indicated a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; This finding did not transcend in the female participants.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the factors that influence female preferences for visual stimuli as well as for why males showed a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real world objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

Art containing geometric forms, as seen in much of Islamic art, has an inherent symmetry to the work. This symmetry can be correlated to the attractiveness associated with the art form, since there is a correlation between human preference and symmetry.&lt;ref name=Cardenas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cárdenas|first=R.A.|author2=Harris, L.J. |title=Symmetrical decorations enhance the attractiveness of faces and abstract designs|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies regarding facial attractiveness, symmetry is found to be a significant factor as well as the shape and coloration in determining attractiveness. The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] for symmetry preference argues that symmetry is a biological indicator of stable development, mate quality and fitness and therefore explains why we choose symmetrical traits in our mates.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] does not, however, explain why this phenomenon is observed in our preferences for decoration art.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Another proposed hypothesis is the [[the extended phenotype|extended phenotype hypothesis]] that argues that decoration art is not mate-irrelevant but rather a reflection of the fitness of the artist, as symmetrical forms are difficult to produce.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; These hypothesis and findings provide evidence for evolutionary biases on preference for symmetry and as reinforcement for cultural biases.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Research suggests that symmetrical preference due to its evolutionary basis, biological basis and cultural reinforcement, might be replicable cross-culturally.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt;

===Compositional balance===
Compositional balance refers to the placement of various elements in a work of art in relation to each other, through their organization and positioning, and based upon their relative weights.&lt;ref name="Balance definition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=Balance|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/b_balance.htm|work=Education: Art History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements may include the size, shape, color, and arrangement of objects or shapes. When balanced, a composition appears stable and visually right.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt; Just as symmetry relates to aesthetic preference and reflects an intuitive sense for how things ‘should’ appear, the overall balance of a given composition contributes to judgments of the work.

The positioning of even a single object, such as a bowl or a light fixture, in a composition contributes to preferences for that composition. When participants viewed a variety of objects, whose vertical positions on a horizontal plane were manipulated, participants preferred objects that were lower or higher in the plane of vision, corresponding to the normal placement of the image (e.g., a light bulb should be higher and a bowl lower). The center bias manifests can explain the preference for the most important or functional part of an object to occupy the center of the frame, suggesting a bias for a "rightness" of object viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sammartino|first=Jonathan|author2=Palmer, Stephen E. |title=Aesthetic issues in spatial composition: Effects of vertical position and perspective on framing single objects.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1 January 2012|volume=38|issue=4|pages=865–879|doi=10.1037/a0027736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are also sensitive to balance in both abstract and representational works of art. When viewing variations on original artwork, such as the manipulation of the red, blue, and yellow areas of color in several [[Piet Mondrian]] paintings, design-trained and untrained participants successfully identified the balance centers of each variation. Both groups were sensitive to the distribution of color, weight, and area occupied. Expertise (see [[#Art and expertise|Art and Expertise]]) does not seem to have a large effect on perceiving balance, though only the trained participants detected the variation between the original work and manipulated versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul|author2=Overbeeke, Kees |author3=Stappers, Pieter Jan |title=Spatial balance of color triads in the abstract art of Piet Mondrian|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=169–189|doi=10.1068/p5033|pmid=15832568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experts and novices tend to judge original abstract works as more optimally balanced than experimental variations, without necessarily identifying the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latto|first=Richard|author2=Brain, Douglas |author3=Kelly, Brian |title=An oblique effect in aesthetics: Homage to Mondrian (1872 - 1944)|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2000|volume=29|issue=8|pages=981–987|doi=10.1068/p2352|pmid=11145089}}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be an intuitive sense for experts and non-experts alike that a given representational painting is the original. Participants tend to deem original artwork as original versus the manipulated works that had been both subtly and obviously altered with respect to the balance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul J|title=An empirical investigation of the visual rightness theory of picture perception|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 October 2003|volume=114|issue=2|pages=147–164|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2003.07.001|pmid=14529822}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests some innate knowledge, perhaps not influenced by artistic expertise, of the rightness of a painting in its balance. Both masters and novices are equally susceptible to shifts in balance affecting preference for paintings, which may suggest that both artists viewers have an intuitive sense of balance in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Oshin|author2=Martindale, Colin |author3=Podsiadlo, Jacob |author4=Overbay, Shane |author5= Borkum, Jonathan |title=The link between composition and balance in masterworks vs. paintings of lower artistic quality|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 November 2005|volume=96|issue=4|pages=493–503|doi=10.1348/000712605X47927|pmid=16248938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and expertise===
{{primary sources|date=December 2012}}
Psychologists have found that a person's level of expertise in art influences how they perceive, analyze, and interact with art.&lt;ref name=Silvia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=Knowledge-based assessment of expertise in the arts: exploring aesthetic fluency|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2007|volume=1|issue=4|pages=247–249|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.1.4.247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test psychologically, scales have been designed to test experience rather than just years of expertise by testing recognition and knowledge of artists in a number of fields, fluid intelligence, and personality with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] factor inventory.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;  These found that people with high art expertise were not significantly smarter, nor had a college major in the arts.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;   Instead, openness to experience, one of the Big Five factors, predicted someone's expertise in art.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;

====Preferences====

In one study, experienced art majors and naive students were shown pairs of popular art paintings from magazines and high-art paintings, from museums.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=W.

C. |title=The evaluation of high art and popular art by naive and experienced viewers|journal=Visual Arts Research|year=1992|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–14|jstor=20715763}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers found a significant interaction between expertise and art preference. Naive participants preferred popular art over high-art, while expert participants preferred high-art over popular art.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt; They also found that naive participants rated popular art as more pleasant and warm and the high-art paintings as more unpleasant and cold, while experts showed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt;  Experts look to art for a challenging experience, naive participants view art more for pleasure.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt; Systematic preferences for viewing portraiture (left or right 3/4 profiles) have been found across media, artists, styles, gender/sex, and historical epoch.&lt;ref name=Conesa&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incidence of the Half-Left Profile Pose in Single-Subject Portraits|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1995|volume=81|issue=3|pages=920–922|pmid=8668453|author1=Conesa|first1=J|last2=Brunold-Conesa|first2=C|last3=Miron|first3=M|doi=10.2466/pms.1995.81.3.920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both experiential tendencies and innate predispositions have been proposed to account for pose preferences.&lt;ref name=2Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preference for the half-left profile pose: Three inclusive models|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1996|volume=82|issue=3|pages=1070|pmid= 8823872 |author1=Conesa|first1=J|doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.3c.1070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies controlling variables such as sex and handedness,&lt;ref name="3Conesa-Sevilla, et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla-et. al.|first=J.|title=Sex and differential hemispheric activation in directional and orientation preferences|journal=Presented at the 77th meeting of the Western Psychological Association, Tacoma, Washington|year=1997|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ongoing hemispheric activation, have shown that these preferences can be studied across several construct dimensions.&lt;ref name=4Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla|first=J.|title=Hemispheric activation and preference for the half-left profile|journal=Presented at the Western Psychological Association, Portland, Oregon, April 2000|year=2000|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eye movements====

To investigate if experts and non-experts experience art differently even in their eye movements, researchers used an eye tracking device to see if there are any differences in the way they look at works of art.&lt;ref name=Pihko&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pihko|first=E.|title=Experiencing art: the influence of expertise and painting abstraction level|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|pages=1–10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00094|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After viewing each work, participants rated their liking and emotional reactions to the works.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Some works were presented with auditory information about that work, half of which were neutral facts and the other half were emotional statements about the work.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; They found that non-experts rated the least abstract works more preferably, while abstraction level did not matter to the experts.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Across both groups, the eye paths showed more fixations within more abstract work, but each fixation was shorter in time than those within less abstract work .&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Expertise influences how participants thought about works, but did not influence at all how they physically viewed them.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt;

In another study using eye-movement patterns to investigate how experts view art, participants were shown realistic and abstract works of art under two conditions: one asking them to free scan the works, and the other asking them to memorize them.&lt;ref name=Vogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogt|first=S.|author2=S. Magnussen |title=Expertise in pictorial perception: eye-movement pattern and visual memory in artists and laymen|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=91–100|doi=10.1068/p5262|pmid=17357707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants' eye movements were tracked as they either looked at the images or tried to memorize them, and their recall for the memorized images was recorded.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; The researchers found no differences in the fixation frequency or time between picture types for experts and nonexperts.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  However, across sessions, the non-experts had more short fixations while free scanning the works, and fewer long fixations while trying to memorize; experts followed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  There was no significant difference in the recall of the images across groups, except experts recalled abstract images better that non-experts, and more pictorial details.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; These results show that people with arts expertise view repeated images less than non-experts, and can recall more details about images they have previously seen.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;

====Levels of abstraction====

Aesthetic reactions to art can be measured on a number of different criteria, like arousal, liking, emotional content, and understanding. The art can be rated on its levels of abstraction or place in time. An experiment examining how these factors combine to create aesthetic appreciation included experts and nonexperts rating their [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]], arousal, liking, and comprehension of abstract, modern, and classical art works.&lt;ref name=Leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=H.|author2=G. Gerger |author3=S. G. Dressler |author4=A. Schabmann |title=How art is appreciated|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts demonstrated a higher degree of appreciation with higher ratings on all scales, except for arousal with classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Classical artworks yielded the highest comprehension ratings, with abstract art receiving the lowest values.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; However, emotional valence was highest for classical and modern art, while arousal was highest for abstract works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Although experts rated the works higher overall, each factor influenced the nonexperts' ratings more, creating greater flexibility in their ratings than those of the experts.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt;

Another experiment examined the effect of color and degree of realism on participants' perception of art with differing levels of expertise. Groups of experts, relative experts, and non-experts viewed stimuli consisting of generated versions of figurative paintings varying in color and abstraction.&lt;ref name=Hekkert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hekkert|first=P.|author2=Van Wieringen, P. C.|title=The impact of level of expertise on the evaluation of original and altered versions of post-impressionistic paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=1996|volume=94|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(95)00055-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants rated the stimuli on their overall preference, abstractness, color properties, balance, and complexity.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; Figurative pictures were preferred over abstract pictures with decreasing expertise and colored pictures were preferred over black-and-white pictures.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; However, experts were more likely to prefer black-and-white pictures over colored ones than non-experts and relative experts.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; This suggests that experts may view art with cognitive models, while non-experts view art looking for familiarity and pleasure.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt;

====Other factors====

An experiment studying the effect of expertise on the perception and interpretation of art had art history majors and psychology students view ten contemporary art paintings of diverse styles. Then, they grouped them into whatever labels they thought to be appropriate.&lt;ref name=Augustin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Augustin|first=M. D.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Art expertise: a study of concepts and conceptual spaces|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=135–156|url=http://www.pabst-publishers.de/psychology-science/2-2006/05_Augustin.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data were coded to classify the categorizations and compared between experts and non-experts.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt; Experts broke down their classifications into more groups than the non-experts and categorized by style, while the non-experts depended on personal experiences and feelings.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt;

This style-related processing, which leads to a mastery of the artwork, is important in viewing modern abstract art and is affected by expertise.&lt;ref name=Belke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belke|first=B.|author2=Leder, H. |author3=Augustin, M.D. |title=Mastering style - effects of explicit style-related information, art knowledge and affective state on appreciation of abstract paintings|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=115–134|url=http://cognitivefluency.com/research/mastering.style.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants viewed and rated their liking on three sets of paintings, half of which included information about the style of the painting, such as artistic technique, stylistic features, and the materials used.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The next day, participants viewed new paintings, saw a blank screen, and estimated how long they had viewed the paintings.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Participants also completed questionnaires indicating interest in art, a questionnaire indicating expertise in art, and the “Positive and Negative [[Affect (psychology)|Affect]] Schedule” mood questionnaire.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The effects of style-related information depended on art expertise, where non-experts liked the paintings more after receiving information about the paintings and the experts liked the paintings less after receiving style-related information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Explicit style information provoked mood changes in liking, where the high Positive Affect group liked the paintings more with information and the low Positive Affect group liked the paintings less with information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Art expertise did not, however, affect the estimations of presentation time.

===Title information===

Titles do not simply function as a means of identification, but also as guides to the pleasurable process of interpreting and understanding works of art.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Phil A.|title=Effort after meaning and the hedonic value of paintings|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 February 2003|volume=94|issue=1|pages=99–110|doi=10.1348/000712603762842138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing title information about a painting does not seem to affect eye movement when looking at it or how subjects interpret its spatial organization. However, titles influence a painting’s perceived meaning.  In one study, participants were instructed to describe paintings while using flashlight pointers to indicate where they were looking. The participants repeated this task for the same set of paintings in two sessions. During the second session, some of the paintings were presented with new titles to evaluate the consistency in their descriptions. As expected, subjects did not change where their eye-gaze focused, but they did change their descriptions by making them more consistent with a given title.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Margery B.|author2=Becklen, Robert C. |author3=Doyle, Charlotte L. |title=The Influence of Titles on How Paintings Are Seen|journal=Leonardo|date=1 January 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=103|doi=10.2307/1575894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though descriptions might fluctuate, aesthetically appreciating both abstract and representative art remains stable, regardless of different title information.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Carbon, Claus-Christian |author3=Ripsas, Ai-Leen |title=Entitling art: Influence of title information on understanding and appreciation of paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 February 2006|volume=121|issue=2|pages=176–198|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.08.005|pmid=16289075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that word/image relations can promote different modes of understanding art, but do not account for how much we like a particular piece.&lt;ref name=Franklin /&gt;

A famous example of title confusion that altered a work’s title/image relationship, and thus its ostensive meaning, is a painting titled ''[[La trahison des images]]'' (''The treachery of images''), by [[René Magritte]], that is often referred to as "This is not a pipe". It contains an image of a pipe as well as the legend "This is not a pipe," even though that was not meant to be its title. In this case, two different understandings of the artists’ intentions and the content depend on which title is chosen to go with it.&lt;ref name=Yeazell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeazell|first=Ruth Bernard|authorlink=Ruth Yeazell|title=This Is Not a Title|journal=The Yale Review|date=April 2011|volume=99|issue=2|pages=134–143|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, random titles, other than the original, decrease understanding ratings, but do not necessarily alter the significance of aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Millis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: the influence of titles on aesthetic experiences|journal=Emotion|date=1 September 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborative, as opposed to descriptive, titles are particularly important in helping viewers assign meaning to abstract art. Descriptive titles increase understanding of abstract art only when viewers are presented with an image for a very short period of time (less than 10 seconds). Because art can have a variety of multi-leveled meanings, titles and other additional information can add to its meaningfulness and consequently, its hedonic value.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt;

==Applications==

Discoveries from the psychology of art can be applied to various other fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfirevic | first1 = Dj | year = 2011 | title = Visual Expression in Architecture | url = http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2011/0354-60551131003A.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arhitektura i urbanizam | volume = 31 | issue = 31| pages = 3–15 | doi=10.5937/arhurb1131003a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markovic | first1 = S. | last2 = Dj | first2 = Alfirevic | year = 2015 | title = Basic dimensions of experience of architectural objects' expressiveness: Effect of expertise | url = https://www.academia.edu/11541805/Basic_dimensions_of_experience_of_architectural_objects_expressiveness_Effect_of_expertise | journal = Psihologija | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 61–78 | doi=10.2298/psi1501061m}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creative process of art yields a great deal of insight about the mind.  One can obtain information about work ethics, motivation, and inspiration from an artist’s work process.  These general aspects can transfer to other areas of one’s life.  Work ethic in art especially, can have a significant impact on one’s overall productivity elsewhere.  There is a potential in any kind of work that encourages the aesthetic frame of mind.  Moreover, art defies any definite boundaries.  The same applies to any such work that is aesthetically experienced.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
The psychology of art can be a criticized field for numerous reasons.  Art is not considered a science, so research can be scrutinized for its accuracy and relativity.  There is also a great deal of criticism about art research as psychology because it can be considered subjective rather than objective.  It embodies the artist’s emotions in an observable manner, and the audience interprets the artwork in multiple ways.  The aims of an artist differ dramatically from the aims of a scientist.  The scientist means to propose one outcome to a problem, whereas an artist means to give multiple interpretations of an object.  The inspirations of an artist are fueled through his/her experiences, perceptions, and perspectives of the world art movements such as Expressionism are known for the artist’s release of emotions, tension, pressure, and inner spiritual forces that are transcribed to external conditions.  Art comes from within oneself, and it is expressed in the external world for the entertainment of others.  Everyone can appreciate a piece of artwork because it speaks to each individual in unique ways—therein lies the criticism of subjectivity.&lt;ref name="R &amp; T"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Saeid|last1=Rahmatabadi|first2=Reza|last2=Toushmalani|title=Physical Order and Disorder in Expressionist Architecture Style|url=http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|volume=5|issue=9|pp=406–409|year=2011|issn=1991-8178|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234028/http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the aesthetic experience of art is heavily criticized because it cannot be scientifically determined.  It is completely subjective, and it relies on an individual’s bias.  It cannot be fundamentally measured in tangible forms.  In contrast, aesthetic experiences can be deemed "self-motivating" and "self-closing".&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Qualified School Construction Bond''' (QSCB) are a U.S. debt instrument created by Section 1521 of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Section 54F of the Internal Revenue code covers QSCBs.  QSCBs allow schools to borrow at a nominal zero percent rate for the rehabilitation, repair and equipping of schools.  In addition, QSCB funds can be used to purchase land on which a public school will be built.  Depending on the type of payment elected for the QSCB, tax credit or direct pay,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-35.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the QSCB lender either receives a Federal tax credit in lieu of receiving an interest payment or, for direct pay QSCBs, a direct interest payment from the Federal government.  The QSCB rate is set by the IRS each day. [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/irs/rates_qtcb.htm U.S. Treasury Qualified Tax Credit Bond Rates] The rate paid by treasury on issued bonds is fixed based on the published rate at the time of issue. However, the direct payments are currently subject to a discount on the published rate of payment as a result of the automatic spending cuts required by the 2011 Budget Control Act, P.L. 112-25. The IRS publishes the discount rate applied to QSCB direct pay bonds annually, as of October 2104 it increased to 7.3% (prior year rate was 7.2%).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Exempt-Bonds/Effect-of-Sequestration-on-Certain-State-and-Local-Government-Filers-of-Form-8038CP&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual allocation of $11,000,000,000 has been approved for 2009 and 2010 resulting in a total of $22,000,000,000 in QSCB authority.  The US Treasury and the IRS allocate the authority to issue QSCBs to all fifty states and US possessions.  60% is allocated to the fifty states and US possessions and 40% is allocated among "large local educational agencies." Some states have provided QSCB allocation to charter schools. Only the allocations for 2009 have been released by the IRS in Notice 2009-35&lt;ref&gt;IRS Notice 2009-35 dated April 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the [[Internal Revenue Bulletin]] 2009-17 on April 27, 2009.

Funds can be used for renovation and rehabilitation projects, as well as equipment purchases, although conservative advice is to avoid use for furniture purchases. QSCBs may also be used for new building construction and land acquisition. They cannot be applied to building acquisition.  All state and local laws applicable to bonds also apply to QSCBs, including Section 148 of the IRS Code.  All tax credit bonds covered by Section 54 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 54A provides general guidance for tax credit bonds and was established by Section 15316 of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-246).  Subsequent sections cover specific tax credit bonds and these sections were established as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .

[[File:Redundantly redundant road sign.jpg|thumb|Redundant road sign, Germany]]
In [[linguistics]], '''redundancy''' refers to information that is expressed more than once.&lt;ref name="Bussmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bussmann|first=Hadumod|title=Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-63038-7|pages=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0278-3|pages=406–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of redundancies include multiple agreement features in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]],&lt;ref name="Bussmann"/&gt; multiple features distinguishing [[phoneme]]s in [[phonology]],&lt;ref name="Crystal"/&gt; or the use of multiple words to express a single idea in [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="Bussmann"/&gt;

==Grammar==
Redundancy may occur at any level of [[grammar]]. Because of [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] – a requirement in many languages that the form of different words in a phrase or clause correspond with one another – the same [[semantics|semantic information]] may be marked several times. In the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] phrase ''los árboles verdes'' ("the green trees"), for example, the [[article (linguistics)|article]] ''los'', the [[noun]] ''árboles'', and the [[adjective]] ''verdes'' are all [[inflection|inflected]] to show that the phrase is [[plural]].&lt;ref name="Bussmann"/&gt; An English example would be: ''that man is a soldier'' versus ''those men are soldiers.''

In phonology, a [[minimal pair]] is a pair of words or phrases that differs by only one phoneme, the smallest distinctive unit of the sound system. Even so, phonemes may differ on several [[Phonetics|phonetic features]]. For example, the English phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/b/}} in the words ''pin'' and ''bin'' feature different [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]], [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]], and [[Muscle tone|muscular tension]]. Any one of these features is sufficient to differentiate /p/ from /b/ in English.&lt;ref name="Crystal"/&gt;

[[Generative grammar]] uses such redundancy to simplify the form of grammatical description. Any feature that can be predicted on the basis of other features (such as aspiration on the basis of voicing) need not be indicated in the grammatical rule. Features that are not redundant and therefore must be indicated by rule are called [[distinctive feature]]s.&lt;ref name="Crystal"/&gt;

As with agreement in morphology, phonologically conditioned [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]], such as [[coarticulation]] and [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] add redundancy on the phonological level. The redundancy of phonological rules may clarify some vagueness in [[speech|spoken communication]]. According to psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], "In the comprehension of speech, the redundancy conferred by phonological rules can compensate for some of the ambiguity of the sound wave. For example, a speaker may know that ''thisrip'' must be ''this rip'' and not ''the srip'' because in English the initial [[consonant cluster]] ''sr'' is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=[[The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language]]|year=1994|publisher=William Morrow|page=181|isbn=0-688-12141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, redundancies occur in speech unintentionally, but redundant phrases can also be deliberately constructed for emphasis, to reduce the chance that a phrase will be misinterpreted. In rhetoric, the term "redundancy" tends to have a [[negative connotation]] and may be perceived as improper because of its use of duplicative or unnecessary wording (and some people expand the definition to include self-contradictory wording, similar to [[Double negative|double negation]]); however, it remains a linguistically valid way of placing emphasis on some expressed idea. Through the use of repetition of certain concepts, redundancy increases the odds of predictability of a message's meaning and understanding to others.

&lt;!--This paragraph rehash from [[Pleonasm]] and [[Tautology (rhetoric)]].--&gt;Redundancy typically takes the form of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: phrases that repeat a meaning with different though semantically similar words. Common examples are: "a variety of different items", "an added bonus", "to over-exaggerate", "and etc.", "end result", "free gift", "future plans", "unconfirmed rumor", "to kill or murder someone to death", "past history", "safe haven", "potential hazard", "completely surrounded", "false pretense", and so on. There is also the self-referential "joke organization" called "The Redundancy Society of Redundancy", also called "Society of Redundancy Society".

&lt;!--This paragraph is rehash from [[Tautology (rhetoric)]].--&gt;A subset of tautology is [[RAS syndrome]] in which one of the words represented by an [[acronym]] is then repeated outside the acronym: "ATM machine", "HIV virus", "PIN number", "RIP in peace" and "RAID array". These phases expand to "automated teller machine machine", "human immunodeficiency virus virus", "personal identification number number", "rest in peace in peace" and "redundant array of independent disks array", respectively. "RAS syndrome" is itself a [[tongue-in-cheek]] example of the RAS syndrome in action; it expands to "Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome". Another common redundancy is the phrase "i ily you", an 'msn speak' phrase which literally means "i i love you you".

A more general classification of redundancy is [[pleonasm]], which can be any unnecessary words (or even word parts). Subsuming both rhetorical tautology and RAS syndrome, it also includes dialectal usage of technically unnecessary parts, as in "off of" vs. "off". Pleonasm can also take the form of purely semantic redundancies that are a part of the de facto standard usage in a language and "transparent" to the user (e.g., the French question "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" meaning "What's that?" or "What is it?", which translates very literally as "What is it that it is?"). The term pleonasm is most often, however, employed as synonymous with tautology.

==Redundancy versus Repetition==

Writing guides, especially for [[technical writing]], usually advise to avoid redundancy, "especially the use of two expressions that mean the same thing. Such repetition works against readability and conciseness."&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Dawson, "Avoid Redundancy in Writing", in the column "Helpful Hints for Technical Writing", Weed Technology 6:782 (1992). http://wssa.net/wp-content/uploads/Avoid-Redundancy-in-Writing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Others make a distinction between redundancy and repetition: "Repetition, if used well, can be a good tool to use in your writing. It can add emphasis to what  you are trying to say and  strengthen a point. There are many  types  of useful  repetition. Redundancy, on the other  hand, cannot be a good thing. Redundancy happens when the repetition of a word or idea does not add anything to the previous usage; it just restates what has already been said, takes up space, and  gets in the way without adding meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Nick  Jobe and  Sophia  Stevens: "Repetition and Redundancy", April  2009, https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/q-z/repetition-and-redundancy/&lt;/ref&gt; Computer Scientist [[Donald E. Knuth]], author of highly acclaimed textbooks, recommends "to state things twice, in complementary ways, especially when giving a definition. This reinforces the reader’s understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts: "Mathematical Writing" (1987), https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/cs1193.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eglise Saint-Ayoul Provins retable maitre-autel.jpg|thumb|On one strict definition, this French 17th-century construction is a retable rather than a reredos, as it is all one construction]] 
A '''retable''' is a structure or element placed either on or immediately behind and above the [[altar]] or [[communion table]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Retable |volume=23 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a church. At the minimum it may be a simple shelf for candles behind an altar, but it can also be a large and elaborate structure. A retable which incorporates sculptures or painting is often referred to as an [[altarpiece]].

According to the Getty ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online'', "A 'retable' is distinct from a '[[reredos]]'; while the reredos typically rises from ground level behind the altar, the retable is smaller, standing either on the back of the altar itself or on a pedestal behind it. Many altars have both a reredos and a retable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=retable&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300076035 ''Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online''] 'Retable'&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is not always upheld in common use, and the terms are often confused or used as synonyms. In several foreign languages, such as [[French language|French]] (also using 'retable'), the usage is different, usually equating the word with the English 'reredos' or 'altarpiece', and this often leads to confusion, and incorrect usage in translated texts. The [[Medieval Latin]] ''retrotabulum'' (modernized ''retabulum'') was applied to an architectural feature set up at the back of an altar, and generally taking the form of a screen framing a picture, carved or sculptured work in wood or stone, or [[mosaic]], or of a movable feature such as the  ''[[Pala d'Oro]]'' in [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], of gold, jewels and enamels.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The non-English word "retable" therefore often refers to what should in English be called a [[reredos]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The situation is further complicated by the frequent modern addition of free-standing altars in front of the old integrated altar, to allow the celebrant to face the congregation, or be closer to it. 

[[Dossal]]' is another term that may overlap with both retable and reredos; today it usually means an altarpiece painting rising at the back of the altar to which it is attached, or a cloth usually hanging on the wall directly behind the altar.

The cognate Spanish term, ''[[retablo]]'', refers also to a reredos or retrotabulum, although in the specific context of Mexican folk art it may refer to any two-dimensional depiction (usually a framed painting) of a saint or other Christian religious figure, as contrasted with a ''[[bulto]]'', a three-dimensional statue of same.

The retable may hold the [[altar cross]], mostly in Protestant churches, as well as candles, flowers and other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19416">The '''Right to Buy''' scheme is a policy in the United Kingdom (with the exception of [[Scotland]] since August 1, 2016) which gives [[Secure tenancy|secure tenants]] of [[Council house|councils]] and some [[housing association]]s the [[legal right]] to buy, at a large discount, the council house they are living in. There is also a '''Right to Acquire''' for [[Assured tenancy|assured tenants]] of housing association homes built with public subsidy after 1997, at a smaller discount. About 1,500,000 homes in the UK have been sold in this manner since the introduction of the scheme in 1980.

Supporters claim that the programme has given millions of households a tangible asset, secured their families' finances and—by releasing cash to repay local authority debt—helped improve the public finances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Critics claim that the policy compounded a housing shortage for people of low income, initiated a national house price bubble, and led ultimately to what is commonly recognised as the displacement and [[social cleansing]] of traditional communities.&lt;ref&gt;MKoore, Thatcher'' p 471&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Councilhousing04.jpg|thumb|alt=Council Housing|Council-type housing stock in [[Weaverham]], now mostly owner-occupied]]
Individual local authorities have always had the ability to sell [[council house]]s to their tenants, but until the early 1970s such sales were extremely rare.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] initially proposed the idea of the right of tenants to own the house they live in, in their manifesto for the [[1959 UK general election|1959 general election]] which they subsequently lost.&lt;ref&gt;Housing, [http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1959/1959-labour-manifesto.shtml 1959 Labour Party manifesto]. Retrieved 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-controlled [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) of the late 1960s was persuaded by [[Horace Cutler]], its Chairman of Housing, to create a general sales scheme. Cutler disagreed with the concept of local authorities as providers of housing, and supported a free-market approach. GLC housing sales were not allowed during the Labour administration of the mid-1970s, but picked up again once Cutler became Leader in 1977. They proved extremely popular. Cutler was close to [[Margaret Thatcher]] (MP for [[Finchley (constituency)|Finchley]]) who made the right to buy council housing a Conservative Party policy nationally. The policy was largely in place for the 1974 Conservative manifesto, but did not prove an asset in the two general elections that year because of high interest and mortgage repayment rates, as well as the growth of negative equity as house prices fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-right-to-buy-history-and-prospect|title=The Right to Buy: History and Prospect|last=Murie|first=Alan|date=11 November 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, council house sales to tenants began to increase. Some 7,000 were sold to their tenants during 1970; this soared to more than 45,000 in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14380936 |work=BBC News |title=What future for social housing? |date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thatcher policies===
After Margaret Thatcher became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in May 1979, the legislation to implement the Right to Buy was passed in the [[Housing Act 1980]]. [[Michael Heseltine]], in his role as Secretary of State for the Environment, was in charge of implementing the legislation. Some 6,000,000 people were affected; about one in three actually purchased their housing unit. Heseltine noted that "no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people". He said the right to buy had two main objectives: to give people what they wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the state over the life of the individual.

He said: "There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership. The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered. It reflects the wishes of the people, ensures the wide spread of wealth through society, encourages a personal desire to improve and modernise one's own home, enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society."&lt;ref&gt;"Housing Bill – Provisions and Enactment" in ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' v. 27, January, 1981 p. 30644&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale price of a council house was based on its market valuation but also included a discount of between 33% and 50% (up to 70% for council flats), to reflect the rents paid by tenants and also to encourage take-up. According to a government survey in 1988, the average discount that had been offered was 44%.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beckett|first1=Andy|title=The right to buy: the housing crisis that Thatcher built|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/26/right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-david-cameron-housing-crisis|accessdate=27 June 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortgages involved no downpayments. The legislation gave council tenants the right to buy their council house at a discounted value, depending on how long they had been living in the house, with the proviso that if they sold their house before a minimum period had expired they would have to pay back a proportion of the discount. The sales were an attractive deal for tenants; hundreds of thousands of homes were sold. The policy became one of the major points of [[Thatcherism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Polly Toynbee]], "It's on the house," [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/11/society.housing ''The Guardian,'' 11 October 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy proved immediately popular. Some local Labour-controlled councils were opposed, but the legislation prevented them from blocking purchases, and gave them half the proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: From Grantham to the Falklands'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were much higher in the south and east of England than in [[inner London]] and [[northern England]].&lt;ref&gt;Murrie (1989) p 221&lt;/ref&gt; Sales were restricted to general-needs housing; adapted properties and those built specifically for older people were exempted from the scheme. 

Half the proceeds of the sales were paid to the local authorities, but the government restricted authorities' use of most of the money to reducing their debt until it was cleared, rather than spending it on building more homes. The effect was to reduce the council housing stock, especially in areas where property prices were high, such as London and the south-east of England.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22077190 BBC article: Right-to-buy: Margaret Thatcher's controversial gift&lt;/ref&gt;

200,000 council houses were sold to their tenants in 1982. By 1987, more than 1,000,000 council houses in the UK had been sold to their tenants, although the number of council houses purchased by tenants declined during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Slide 4, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm Thatcher years in graphics], BBC News, 18 November 2005. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour Party was initially against the sales, and pledged to oppose them at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] general election, but then dropped its official opposition to the scheme in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4017000/4017019.stm |work=BBC News |title=1979: Council tenants will have 'right to buy' |date=20 December 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], the Conservative government warned voters that a Labour government would still abolish the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/newspaper-advertisement-for-the-british-conservative-party-news-photo/92063336 Newspaper advert for Conservative Party] by [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], 1987. Getty Images. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Labour returned to power at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities which had severe pressure on their housing stock; this included almost the whole of London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/HRD28.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to Buy rules after 2005==
The Right to Buy rules were changed in 2005. Five years' tenancy was now required for new tenants to qualify, and properties purchased after January 2005 could no longer immediately be placed on the open market should the owner decide to sell. Such owners now had to approach their previous landlord (council or housing association) and offer them "first right of refusal". If the previous landlord was no longer in existence, for example in cases where the former landlord was a registered social landlord that has ceased business, then the property had to first be offered to the local housing authority.

The time in which a Right to Buy conveyance should take place was reduced from 12 months to 3 months. The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) now governed and regulated most types of mortgage-selling.

The FCA's governance of Right to Buy purchases was partly to solve the widespread problem of Right to Buy mis-selling from brokers and solicitors alike. Each had their own agenda and many were charging excessive fees which were then taken out of their client's discount. The above actions that have been taken coupled with the end of the boom period seem to have brought this problem under control.

In 2009, the [[Localis]] think tank suggested, as part of a review of principles for social housing reform, that the right to buy should be extended into equity slivers, which could be part-earned through being a good tenant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localis.org.uk/images/Localis%20Principles%20for%20Social%20Housing%20Reform%20WEB.pdf Principles for Social Housing Reform], Localis, 2009. Retrieved 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualifying period changed from 5 years to 3 years (edited rbcdd3117 in 2018)

==Recent changes==
At the 2011 [[Conservative Party Conference]], [[David Cameron]] proposed to increase Right to Buy discounts in order to revitalise the housing market and generate receipts which could be spent on new housing. Social housing professionals expressed concerns over the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SALE! (while stocks last)|url=http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/tenancies/sale!-(while-stocks-last)/6519917.article|accessdate=13 January 2012|newspaper=Inside Housing|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 April 2012, the Right to Buy discount was increased to a maximum of £75,000 or 60% of the house value (70% for a flat) depending on which is lower. In March 2013, the maximum discount in London was increased to £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reforming the Right to Buy in 2012 &amp; 2013|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06251|work=Commons Library Standard Note|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum amount of discount changes annually wef April 2017 it changed to £78,600.00 (edited 2018 rbc dd3117)

The maximum right to buy discount increases each financial year in line with CPI as at the previous September (see separate document from the Right to Buy Team, Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

As the CPI in September 2017 was 3% the new maximum discounts for Redditch in respect of the financial year 2018/19 will be £80,900 and applies to all applications made by the tenant on or after 6 April 2018.  Any applications made before then are processed using the current discounts (£78,600). In summary discount is a maximum of £80,900.00 from April 2018 (rbcdd3117)

The aim of the scheme is, for every additional home sold, a new home will be built for 'affordable rent'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affordable Rent|url=http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/affordable-rent|publisher=DCLG}}&lt;/ref&gt; at up to 80% of market rent, aimed at maintaining the level of affordable housing while also increasing the number of properties available for those on the waiting list. The five year tenancy criterion will remain, and should the property be sold within the first five years of the original sale, part or all of the discount will be required to be paid back.

The [[Housing and Planning Act 2016|Housing and Planning Bill 2016]] will if enacted extend right-to-buy to housing association tenants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/05/expert-views-housing-bill-end-affordable-housing&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the [[Scottish Government]] confirmed that Right to Buy would be abolished in Scotland from 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23155904|title='Right to buy' to be scrapped in Scotland|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=3 July 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the end abolished as a part of the [[Housing (Scotland) Act 2014]] from 1 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00463751.pdf The Right to Buy Notice Period].

In the summer of 2017, the [[Welsh Government]] proposed a law to abolish Right to Buy in [[Wales]]. This law was passed by the [[Welsh Assembly]] in December 2017, and the scheme will effectively end on 26 January 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welsh Government{{!}}Abolition of the Right to Buy and Associated Rights (Wales) Act 2018 |url=https://gov.wales/topics/housing-and-regeneration/legislation/abolition-of-right-to-buy-and-associated-rights/?lang=en |website=gov.wales |accessdate=18 September 2018 |language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
The Right to Buy scheme has been criticised for the following reasons:
*Speculating investors were able to buy up council properties through deferred transaction agreements, hastening the rise in property costs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Nick|first = Sommerlad|title = Great Tory housing shame: Third of ex-council homes now owned by rich landlords| newspaper = The Daily Mirror| date = 5 March 2013|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/right-to-buy-housing-shame-third-ex-council-1743338}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}
*Commercially and socially valuable council assets being sold at below their market value or replacement cost;
*The remaining stock of council housing was concentrated in undesirable areas with little employment opportunity, further isolating and stigmatising the tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Carol|title=Built to Last?: Reflections on British Housing Policy|year=1992|publisher=ROOF Magazine|isbn=978-1870767583|pages=214|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Built-Last-Reflections-British-Housing/dp/1870767586/ref=dp_ob_title_bk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in January 2013 by [[London Assembly]] member [[Tom Copley]], From Right to Buy to Buy to Let,&lt;ref&gt;From Right to Buy to Buy to Let [http://tomcopley.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/From-Right-to-Buy-to-Buy-to-Let-Jan-2014.pdf From Right to Buy to Buy to Let]&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 36% of homes sold under Right to Buy in London (52,000 homes) were being rented by councils from private landlords, leading to criticisms that the scheme "represents incredibly poor value for money to taxpayers" since it "helped to fuel the increase in the housing benefit bill, heaped more pressure on local authority waiting lists and led to more Londoners being forced into the under-regulated private rented sector".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = |first = |title = Councils are renting sold Right to Buy homes, says report| newspaper = BBC London News| date = 13 January 2014|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-25710150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A survey in 2013 showed around one third of Right to Buy houses were now owned by private landlords, while the son of the late [[Ian Gow]] (Thatcher's sometime housing minister) owned some 40 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/28/new-class-landlords-profiting-generation-rent|title=Meet the new class of landlords profiting from Generation Rent|work=Guardian Newspapers|author=Patrick Collinson|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of recent changes in 2015, Alan Murie concluded that "the proposed extension of right-to-buy could not easily be reconciled with the independence and charitable status of housing associations", and that "extending the right-to-buy to housing association tenants revived a previous Parliamentary debate and raised questions about the legal position of charities and the risks faced by housing associations and their funders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/the-right-to-buy-history-and-prospect|title=The Right to Buy: History and Prospect|last=Murie|first=Alan|date=11 November 2015|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 BBC survey of council areas where waiting lists were rising showed the councils had bought back houses they had been forced to sell, sometimes at many times the original price. Housing charities criticised the lack of investment in affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39264631|title=Town halls buy back Right-to-Buy homes|author= Alex Homer|work=BBC news|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''''' is a [[pinball]] machine produced by [[Stern (game company)|Stern]]. The game is based on the newspaper comic strip of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]￼￼''  

==Notable features==
''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' pinball machine is notable for its multi-level rule that enables the beginning player to achieve some of the game's goals early on, while it allows the more advanced player to extend their opportunities with better play. There is also a very strong magnet under the [[shrunken head]] that catches the ball, holds it for a second, then shoots the ball to the rear. In another mode, it stops the ball and immediately gives it back to the lower playfield.&lt;ref name=openkqm&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4917 | work=| title=Internet Pinball Machine Database: Stern 'Ripley's Believe It or Not!®' | first= | last= | date=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital versions==
''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' is available as a licensed table of ''[[The Pinball Arcade]]'' for several platforms and was also released for ''[[Stern Pinball Arcade]]''.

'''Rose Rand''' (June 14, 1903 &amp;ndash; July 28, 1980) was an Austrian-American [[logician]] and [[philosopher]]. She was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]].

== Life and work ==

Rand was born in [[Lemberg]] (today, Lviv, [[Ukraine]]). After her family moved to [[Austria]] she studied at the Polish [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Vienna]]. In 1924 she enrolled in [[Vienna University]], her teachers  included [[Heinrich Gomperz]], [[Moritz Schlick]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]]. She graduated with her first degree in 1928. During her post-graduation years, she continued to remain in contact with some of her fellow Vienna Circle colleagues, including [[Rudolf Carnap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Rose |title=Rose Rand's Papers| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061817825.pdf1|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=September 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a PhD candidate, Rand participated regularly in the Vienna Circle discussions, and kept records of these discussions, she was most active in the [[Vienna Circle]] from 1930-1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Rose|title=Rose Rand'sPapers|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061817833.pdf|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1930 and 1937 she worked, and took part in research, at the Psychiatric-neurological Clinic of the Vienna university.&lt;ref&gt;Hamacher-Hermes, Adelheid. 2003. 'Rose Rand: a Woman in Logic'. In Stadler, Friedrich, (ed.)''The Vienna Circle and Logical Empiricism: Re-Evaluation and Future Perspectives''. Springer. {{ISBN|0-306-48214-2}}, pp. 375-6&lt;/ref&gt; She also earned money by tutoring students and giving adult educations classes.

In 1938 she received her PhD for "T. [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński|Kotarbiński]]'s Philosophy”.

Rand, unemployed and of [[Jewish]] descent, suffered great difficulties in pre-[[World War II]] Vienna. In 1939 she finally emigrated to [[London]] as a Jew without nationality.

After a period of time in England in which she worked as a [[nurse]] she was admitted as "distinguished foreigner” at the faculty of Moral Science at [[Cambridge University]]. In 1943 she lost her privileges and had to work at a metal factory, and teach night classes in [[German language|German]] and [[psychology]] in the [[Luton Technical College]] and [[Tottenham Technical College]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose Rand's Curriculum Vitae, 1 March 1949, cited in Adelheid Hamacher-Hermes. 2003. 'Rose Rand: a Woman in Logic'. In Stadler, Friedrich, (ed.)''The Vienna Circle and Logical Empiricism: Re-Evaluation and Future Perspectives''. Springer. {{ISBN|0-306-48214-2}}, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] helped her to get a small research grant, so she could attend [[Oxford University]] as a "recognized student." Between 1943-50 she also worked in practical [[engineering]].

Rand moved to the [[United States]] in 1954. Between 1955 and 1959 she taught elementary math, ancient philosophy and logic, and was a research associate, in the [[University of Chicago]], [[Indiana University Northwest]] in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]] and [[Notre Dame University]].

In 1959 she returned to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and after that to [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In the following years she earned her living from grants and fellowships which were given to her mostly for her work on translations.  When not supported by grants Rand operated on private loans &amp; other financial assistance, free-lance translation work, or sporadic temporary employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Special Collections Staff|title=Rose Rand Papers Finding Aid|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead;cc=ascead;q1=ASP.1990.01;rgn=main;view=text;didno=US-PPiU-asp199001|publisher=Special Collections, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand’s records were purchased by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. They contain, among other things, her research, the records of the discussions in the Vienna Circle protocols and over 1,600 letters to [[Otto Neurath]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and others.

'''Semantic processing''' is the processing that occurs after we hear a word and encode its meaning.  Semantic processing causes us to relate the word we just heard to other words with similar [[etymology|meanings]].  Once a word is perceived, it is placed in a context mentally that allows for a deeper processing.  Therefore, semantic processing produces memory traces that last longer than those produced by shallow processing since shallow processing produces fragile memory traces that decay rapidly.

Semantic processing is the deepest level of processing and it requires the listener to think about the meaning of the cue.  Studies on [[brain imaging]] have shown that, when semantic processing occurs, there is increased [[brain activity]] in the left [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal regions]] of the brain that does not occur during different kinds of processing.  One study used MRI to measure the brain activity of subjects while they made semantic decisions.  The participants then took a memory test after a short period of time.  When the subjects showed high confidence and correctly retained the information, the fMRI measured increased activity in the left prefrontal regions.

==Convergent semantic processing==
Convergent semantic processing occurs during tasks that elicit a limited number of responses.  During these tasks, subjects must suppress alternate options in order to select a single best option from a multitude of choices.  It is believed that the left hemisphere of the brain dominates convergent semantic processing due to the fine grained, small window of temporal integration.  Spatially, [[neurons]] in the left hemispheres occupy mutually exclusive regions, allowing for the more fine-tuned response seen in convergent semantic processing.

===Neurons in the left hemisphere===

The [[cerebral hemisphere|left hemisphere]] quickly selects the most familiar meaning or response, while suppressing other closely related meanings.  In addition, when presented with an ambiguous word with no context, the left hemisphere will prime the most frequent meaning of the word.  Studies of patients with left hemisphere damage have demonstrated a disruption of convergent semantic processing, causing subjects to associate words with abstract, non-literal meanings produced by the right hemisphere.  For example, a subject with left hemisphere damage may affiliate the word “deep” with “wise” rather than its literal antonym “shallow.”

===Examples of convergent processing===
Experimenter instructs the subject to select an infinite verb that most accurately describes the function of each stimuli.

;Stimulus/Verb
Hammer/To Pound, Needle/To Sew, Bat/To Swing, Sponge/To Scrub, Basketball/To Shoot, Pencil/To Write

==Divergent semantic processing==
Divergent semantic processing occurs during linguistic tasks that can elicit a large variety of responses.  During these tasks, listeners produce different possible meanings and list all the other words that come to their minds.  It is believed that the right hemisphere of the brain commands divergent semantic processing through its coarse grained, large windows of temporal integration.  Neurons in the right hemisphere occupy overlapping regions of space, allowing for the network activation of concepts necessary for divergent processing.

===Neurons in the right hemisphere===

The left hemisphere activates concepts that are more loosely associated with a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], allowing for production of non-literal and less frequent meanings of words.  For example, when presented with an ambiguous word without context, the right hemisphere primes less frequent meaning of the word.  Studies of patient with right hemisphere damage have demonstrated a disruption of divergent semantic processing, causing subjects to affiliate words with concrete, literal meanings produced by the left hemisphere.  For example, a subject with right hemisphere damage will group the word “deep” with its antonym “shallow,” and have trouble producing the non-literal association of “deep” with “wise.”

===Examples of divergent processing===
Experimenter instructs the subject to produce as many infinite verbs as possible for each stimuli.
;Stimulus
Basketball

;Verbs
To shoot, to pass, to throw, to dribble, to steal, to block, to tip, to spin, etc.

'''Symbolic communication''' is exchange of messages that change ''a priori'' expectation of events. Examples of this are modern [[communication]] technology and the exchange of information amongst animals. 
By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in our current state of modernity.

==Animal Societies==
{{See also|Animal communication|Bee learning and communication}}
In animal societies, symbolic communication helps one understand the conduct of members of cooperating groups. The behavior of [[weaver ant]] workers has been carefully studied and it has been found that communicative gestures with respect to members of the same [[colony]] are different from those used with intruders. The interpretation of the symbolic dance of [[honey bee]]s as a communicative language has been questioned by a few, though numerous experimental results over the last several decades have effectively laid this controversy to rest.

==Human Societies==
An example of symbolic communication in  humans is the wearing of uniforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A man in a white coat with a stethoscope will often be perceived as a doctor on the basis of his appearance alone. Military uniforms have badges and insignias which indicate rank and honours as well as their branch of operation. Humans are the only species who use a symbolic language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=2004|title=13Cooperation and the Evolution of Symbolic Communication|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30820582/2004_MIT_EvolutionOfCommunication.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1480437082&amp;Signature=5%2FcPLjb2v%2FdlbFteER5AT5UDFX4%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSocial_and_cultural_learning_in_the_evol.pdf#page=248|journal=Evolution of Communication Systems|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temple 20''' (or '''Temple XX''') is a [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramidal building]], dated to between AD 430 and 600 ([[Palenque#Early Classic period|Early Classic period]]), located at the [[Maya city]] of [[Palenque]] in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Chiapas]] in southern [[Mexico]] with a funerary chamber that contains remains of a high rank character.&lt;ref name="restoration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyramid that Contains Maya Tomb Restored|url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php/english-press-releases/57-restoration/4813--pyramid-that-contains-maya-tomb-restored|publisher=[[National Institute of Anthropology and History]]|accessdate=2011-12-28|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Merle Greene Robertson]] has suggested that the vaulted tomb under Temple 20 is that of Queen [[Yohl Ik'nal|Ix Yohl Ik'nal]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Stuart 2008, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
In 1999 archeologists discovered a tomb inside Temple 20, but any attempt of penetration could lead to damage, due to the uncertain structural state of the pyramid built on top of it.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roach|first=John|title=Pictures: Blood-Red Pyramid Tomb Revealed by Tiny Camera|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/pictures/110629-tiny-camera-maya-tomb-palenque-mexico-science/|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=2011-12-28|date=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small camcorder ({{convert|4|by|6|cm|in}}), lowered to the depth of {{convert|5|m|ft}} through a {{convert|15|cm|in}} wide hole in an upper floor of the pyramid in April 2011,&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heredero|first=Liliet|title=Camera uncovers secrets of a Mayan tomb in Mexico|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13905695|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2011-12-28|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed [[mural]]s of nine human figures outlined in black against the blood-red background.&lt;ref name=inah&gt;{{cite web|title=camera reveals images of the interior of a millenary tomb a Palenque|url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php/boletines/14-hallazgos/5100Micro |publisher=[[National Institute of Anthropology and History]]|accessdate=2011-12-28|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiny camera looks inside Mayan tomb|url=http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/11739|publisher=thehistoryblog.com|accessdate=2011-12-28|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[sarcophagus]], it is probable that the skeleton lies on the slabs of the floor.

The INAH Council of Archaeology determined that the pyramidal base must be stabilized before exploration.

==Restoration==
Temple 20 was restored by specialists from the [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH) in 2010.&lt;ref name="restoration"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''tenuis consonant''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|.|j|u|ɪ|s}}){{refn|Plural: ''tenues'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|.|j|u|i:|z|,_|-|eɪ|z}}.&lt;ref name="epd"&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="epd"/&gt; is an [[obstruent]] that is [[voiceless consonant|unvoiced]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]], [[palatalization (phonetics)|unpalatalized]], and [[glottalic consonant|unglottalized]].

In other words, it has the "plain" [[phonation]] of {{IPA|[p, t, ts, tʃ, k]}} with a [[voice onset time]] close to zero (a zero-VOT consonant), as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''p, t, ch, k'' or [[English language|English]] ''p, t, k'' after ''s'' (''s'''p'''y, s'''t'''y, s'''k'''y'').

For most languages, the distinction is relevant only for [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[affricate]]s. However, a few languages have analogous series for [[fricative]]s. [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]], for example, has ejective, aspirated, and voiced fricatives {{IPA|/sʼ sʰ z/}} alongside tenuis {{IPA|/s/}}, parallel to stops {{IPA|/ɗ tʼ tʰ d/}} alongside tenuis {{IPA|/t/}}.

Many [[click language]]s have tenuis click consonants alongside voiced, aspirated, and glottalized series.

==Transcription==
In transcription, tenuis consonants are not normally marked explicitly, and consonants written with voiceless IPA letters, such as {{angle bracket|{{IPA|p, t, ts, tʃ, k}}}}, are typically assumed to be unaspirated and unglottalized unless otherwise indicated. However, aspiration is often left untranscribed if no contrast needs to be made, like in English, so there is an explicit diacritic for a lack of aspiration in the [[extensions to the IPA]], a superscript equal sign: {{angle bracket|{{IPA|p˭, t˭, ts˭, tʃ˭, k˭}}}}. It is sometimes seen in phonetic descriptions of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Collins &amp; Mees, 1984, ''The Sounds of English and Dutch'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=wbQ3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=281 p. 281]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also languages, such as the [[Northern Ryukyuan languages]], whose phonologically-[[markedness|unmarked]] sound is aspirated, and the tenuis consonants are marked and transcribed explicitly.

In [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|02ED|MODIFIER LETTER UNASPIRATED|html=}}.

An early IPA convention was to write the tenuis stops {{angle bracket|{{IPA|pᵇ, tᵈ, kᶢ}}}} etc. if the plain letters {{angle bracket|{{IPA|p, t, k}}}} were used for aspirated consonants (as they are in English): {{IPA|[ˈpaɪ]}} 'pie' vs. {{IPA|[ˈspᵇaɪ]}} 'spy'.

==Etymology==
The term ''tenuis'' comes from Latin translations of [[Ancient Greek]] grammar, which differentiated three series of consonants, voiced ''β δ γ'' {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}}, aspirate ''φ θ χ'' {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}}, and tenuis ''π τ κ'' {{IPA|/p˭ t˭ k˭/}}. Analogous series occur in many other languages. The term was widely used in 19th-century philology but became uncommon in the 20th.

'''''The Cave Girl''''' is a [[Lost World (genre)|lost world novel]] by American writer [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].  Originally published in two separate stories, ''The Cave Girl'' begun in February 1913 and published by "All-Story" in July, August, and September 1913; and ''The Cave Man'' begun in 1914 and published by "All-Story Weekly" throughout March and April 1917.&lt;ref name="Tarzan.com"&gt;[http://www.tarzan.com/bib/0755.html Tarzan.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book version was first published by [[A. C. McClurg]] on 1925-03-21.  In August 1949, [[Dell Publishing|Dell Paperback]] published a version with a map captioned "Wild Island Home of Nadara the Cave Girl Where Violence and Bloodshed Rule."&lt;ref name="Tarzan.com"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
Blueblooded mama's boy Waldo Emerson Smith-Jones is swept overboard during a south seas voyage for his lifelong ill health. He finds himself on a jungle island. His bookish education has not prepared him to cope with these surroundings, and he is a coward. He is terrified when he encounters primitive, violent men, ape-like throwbacks in mankind's evolutionary history. He runs from them, but when he reaches a dead end, he successfully makes a stand, astonishing himself. While keeping the hairy brutes at bay, he meets a beautiful girl, Nadara, also on the run. In an uncharacteristic gesture, he saves her from the grasp of one ape-man during their escape. He is shocked that she believes him a hero, mistaking his frightened screams for war cries. She calls him Thandar, meaning the brave one. She teaches him the language, how to swim, how to fish, and basic woodcraft, as he begins to realize that he doesn't know everything. However, Nadara warns him that a newcomer to her tribe must fight the strongest men, who have killed many. When they reach her home village, he is horrified to see that despite her appearance, her tribe seems to be [[Caveman|cavemen]] from the [[paleolithic]] era, not much better than the first tribe. In order to avoid death at the hands of the tribal bullies, he vanishes.

As his jungle adventures continue, he finds that he is growing more healthy due to the constant physical demands of primitive living. Although he wants to go back to see Nadara, he recognizes that he will need more strength before he can make a difference. For six months he trains himself, and also makes some weapons. A modern ship stops at the island, but Waldo surprises himself by deciding to stay until he can ensure Nadara's safety. He gives the crew a letter for his mother and returns to the jungle.

Upon reaching Nadara's tribe's caves, he finds them empty, for they routinely move to new caves. He kills one of her oppressors, but then misses her on the trail. He finds the tribe's new home, and her father charges Waldo to give her a packet of her deceased mother's things. Waldo tracks and finds Nadara, and kills the brutal man chasing her. She is uninterested in the packet, discarding it unopened as she knows her tribal mother had no possessions. Then they spy a ship approaching the island. As he suddenly realizes he loves her, and how harshly society would treat her, the two of them agree to head for the hills. The ship's search party finds the packet Nadara carelessly discarded, and discovers that the contents identify a married noble couple from modern society, who disappeared on a voyage less than 20 years previously.

===Part Two===
Before they get far, Waldo changes his mind, realizing that his love for Nadara is such that he wants her to have everything he can offer. However, they meet the hostile ape-men on their way to the beach, and when they finally arrive, the ship is gone. They return to Nadara's tribe. On his deathbed, her father explains her mother was actually a woman who arrived in a small boat with a dead man; she died right after giving birth to Nadara. Waldo decides that living with Nadara under primitive moral customs would be wrong, and determines not to take her as his wife until they can return to civilization. He teaches her English in preparation.

Waldo teaches the tribe about rule by [[consent of the governed]], and they choose him as king. He begins to introduce them to concepts such as agriculture and permanent housing. He has them make spears and shields, and they successfully fight off a raid by the ape-like tribe. However, one ape-man returns that night and kidnaps Nadara. Away from the caves, an earthquake frightens him and he releases her. When she returns to the cliff dwellings, she finds them in ruins. She cannot locate Waldo's cave nor lift the rocks she finds, so she assumes everyone is dead, and leaves the next day to find a new home.

Back in the States, Waldo's parents decide to send another search mission after they receive his letter. His mother and father both come along. They find Nadara being chased by an ape-man, who they quickly kill. She explains Waldo's death in the earthquake, and Mr. Smith-Jones decides to bring her home. However, his wife is hostile to Nadara. The ship departs, but a storm blows it back towards the islands. When Stark, the first officer, grabs Nadara on the deck late at night, he kidnaps her overboard to a nearby shore. Upon returning to consciousness, she quickly escapes him, but they are captured by a tribe of cannibals. Stark is killed but she is treated considerately.

In the meantime, it seems that Waldo is indeed alive, though he lay unconscious and trapped in his cave a long time. He discovers from a caveman that Nadara left on a ship, and determinedly builds a tiny boat to go after her. After a storm he is washed ashore on a new island, and saves a pirate king from a cannibal. One of the pirates tells of a white goddess at a cannibal temple inland, so Waldo goes to search for Nadara. He rescues her, but they are pursued all the way to the coast. His pirate friends have left, so they are forced to use his little boat again. When they reach land, they are captured by more pirates, who then bring them to a modern boat - his father's ship. It also is being held by the pirates, who are awaiting their leader's return. Waldo's parents initially do not recognize him, but after they do, Waldo's mother reconciles with Nadara. When the pirate king arrives, he recognizes Waldo as his savior and releases the entire group. They sail to Honolulu, and the ship's captain presents Nadara with the found packet as a wedding present, not realizing her connection to it. They discover her noble heritage, and she and Waldo marry.

==Reception==
[[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1963 described ''The Cave Girl'' as "a typical Burroughs adventure yarn" and among the rarest of his books before it was reprinted.&lt;ref name="gale196310"&gt;{{Cite magazine

'''''The Hispanic American Historical Review''''' is a quarterly, [[peer-reviewed]], [[Academic journal|scholarly journal]] of [[Latin American history]], the official publication of the [[Conference on Latin American History]], the professional organization of Latin American historians. Founded in 1916, HAHR is the oldest journal of [[Latin American]] history, and, since 1926, published by [[Duke University Press]]. On July 1, 2017 editorial responsibility shifted from Duke University to Penn State for the 2017-2022 term.

==History==
The journal was founded by a group of Latin American historians within the [[American Historical Association]], who met to create an institutional structure for this branch of history. Latin-Americanists felt marginalized within the AHA, with few sessions at the annual meeting and limited space within ''[[The American Historical Review]]''. ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'' was founded in 1916 at the Cincinnati meeting of the AHA, originally to have had the title ''Ibero-American Historical Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Tate Lanning, “The Hispanist in the American Historical Association” in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965'', compiled and edited by Howard F. Cline.2 vols.  University of Texas Press 1967, vol. 2, pp. 641-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the journal's first issue in 1918, [[J. Franklin Jameson]], one of the founders of the [[American Historical Association]], greeted HAHR's establishment as a step forward, indicating the growth of Latin American history as a field.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin Jameson, “A New Historical Journal”, ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 1:2-7 (Feb. 1918).&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal had an initial editorial board of six, Charles E. Chapman, Isaac J. Cox, Julius Klein, William R. Manning, [[James A. Robertson]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|William Spence Robertson|es}},  and two advisory editors, [[Herbert E. Bolton]] and William R. Shepherd.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2506011| title=The Founding of the ''Review'' | author=Chapman, Charles E. | journal=Hispanic American Historical Review | date=February 1918 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=8–23 | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] / [[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal published issues for four years, but foundered for lack of funding until in 1926, when Duke University Press stepped in, housing the journal and providing financial support, putting the journal on a firm basis since then.&lt;ref&gt;William Spence Robertson, “The Hispanic American Historical Review”, republished in ''Latin American History, Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965.'' Vol. 2, 121-122. Originally published as part of the introduction, ''Guide to the Hispanic American Historical Review, 1918-1945'', compiled by Ruth Lapham Butler, Durham: 1950, pp. vii-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal predates the founding of the [[Conference on Latin American History]] in 1926 as an entity within the American Historical Association. Until the 1944 founding of the journal ''The Americas'', ''HAHR'' was the main outlet for publication of scholarly articles on Latin American history.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''Looking South'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the journal published three articles that assessed the history of its first thirty years. Lesley Byrd Simpson's article contains a series of tabulations of articles by time period and found that only 10% dealt with the twentieth century, 44% on the nineteenth century, with the colonial period having 14% for the sixteenth century, 15% for the eighteenth century, 4.5 for general colonial era articles, and just 4% for the seventeenth century. Mexico had the most articles dealing with its history, at 24%, with Brazil 11.5%, the Caribbean (The Antilles), 11.5% and Spanish borderlands now part of the U.S. 10%. In terms of fields, diplomatic history had the most articles at 28%, biography 16%, economic history 13%, social history 12%, and institutional history 10%. Simpson urged a “genetic approach to historical problems without which we cannot hope to expand our horizons.” &lt;ref&gt;Lesley Byrd Simpson, “Thirty Years of the ''Hispanic American Historical Review''”. HAHR 29:188-204 (May 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another article on the occasion of the 30th volume of HAHR was by Charles W. Hackett, who also did tabulations of the corpus, identifying authors with the most publications.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Hackett, “Discussion of Lesley Byrd Simpson, ‘Thirty Years of the Hispanic American Historical Review’”. HAHR 29, 213-221 (May 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; The third assessment, by Howard F. Cline,  called for “some serious consideration of the methods which were an outgrowth of the ‘New History’” and “to restore to our particular historiography a ''depth'' of insight, a part of its humanistic base,” with young historians immersing themselves in the historiographical traditions of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, “Reflections on Traditionalism in the Historiography of Hispanic America” HAHR, 29, 205-12 (May 1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, HAHR published the translation of an analysis of the journal's content by a Soviet scholar of Latin America, I.R. Lavretskii.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Lavretskii, “A Survey of the Hispanic American Historical Review, 1956-58.” HAHR 40, 340-60 (Aug. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;  HAHR's editors’ aim in publishing it was to “demonstrate what Soviet historians are doing in Latin American history.”&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Worchester, “Editor’s Note” HAHR 41: 173 (Feb. 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lavretskii's article was preceded a brief one by J. Gregory Oswald, “A Soviet Criticism of the Hispanic American Historical Review,”  in which he suggests that based on Lavretskii's article “historical scholarship in the U.S. S. R. remains a branch of politics.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Oswald, “A Soviet Criticism of the Hispanic American Historical Review”, HAHR 40:337-339 (Aug. 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;  Lavretskii's article assesses a number of HAHR articles and concludes by saying “A survey of HAHR materials indicates that the official Latin Americanists of the U.S. falsify and distort the historical truth in order to benefit imperialism.”&lt;ref&gt;Lavretskii, “A survey”, republished in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965.'' Compiled and edited by Howard F. Cline. Austin: University of Texas Press 1966, vol. 1, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters to the editor followed, but the journal demurred in publishing them. “For the HAHR to publish rebuttals of only a few of the statements would suggest that the remaining ones stand as correct and acceptable, an impression which would be unfair to the other capitalistic historians who were singled out for attention.”&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, ”Editor’s note”.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Magdalen Reading''''' is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century [[Panel painting|oil-on-panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The panel, originally [[oak]], was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the [[National Gallery]], London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky pp.&amp;nbsp;258–9 (writing before the painting had been cleaned of its overpaint): "Soon after the completion of the 'Descent from the Cross,' that is to say, in 1436–1437, Roger would seem to have produced two works in which the youthful feminine types of the Escorial picture, still vaguely Flémallesque, appear refined to greater spirituality: a major composition, apparently a ''Virgo inter Virgines,'' of which only a fragment, the 'Magdalen Reading' in the National Gallery at London, survives; and the beautiful "Madonna Duran" or "Madonna in Red" in the Prado".&lt;/ref&gt; She is identifiable as the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalen]] from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the [[Mary of Bethany#Catholic identification with Mary Magdalene|Magdalen was conflated]] with both [[Mary of Bethany]] who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–48}} is also relevant.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unnamed "sinner" of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}. [[Iconography]] of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.

The background of the painting had been [[overpainting|overpainted]] with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, which shows the head of [[Saint Joseph]], while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], is thought to be from the same larger work.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rogier-van-der-weyden-the-magdalen-reading The Magdalen Reading]".

The drawing shows that ''The Magdalen'' occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of ''The Magdalen'', which measures {{convert|62.2|x|54.4|cm|abbr=on}}.

Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. ''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the [[National Gallery]], London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] as "one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works."&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:M Reading Detail2.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the face and veil of Mary Magdalene painted in pure whites. The eyebrows and eyelids have been plucked in accordance with conventional ideals of beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Plucked-Shaved-Braided-Renaissance-Practices/dp/193006408X Turudich] (2004), 198&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Mary Magdalene]] as depicted in early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painting]] is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on [[Mary of Bethany]], who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and "listened to His Word", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister [[Martha]] who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve.&lt;ref name="jj54"&gt;Jones (2011), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a ''chemise'' of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript "looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible" and is "clearly a devotional text".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395–396, 398; quotes 396, 398.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.&lt;ref name="B58"&gt;Belloli (2001), 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;  She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden [[sideboard]]. By her feet is her usual [[emblem|attribute]] of an [[alabaster]] jar; in the [[Gospel]]s she brought spices to the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998),398; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:1}}. Another passage, taken in the [[Middle Ages]] to refer to the Magdalene, {{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}} is the source of the [[alabaster]] jar.&lt;/ref&gt; The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an [[Archery|archer]] atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.&lt;ref name="P54"&gt;Potterton (1977), 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail showing the prayer book, likely a [[book of hours]], decorated with white cloth and gold clasps.]]
Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master [[Robert Campin]] or his workshop.&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;  It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of [[Saint Barbara]] in Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]'',&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Clark (1960), 45&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Virgin in an ''[[Annunciation]]'' attributed to Campin in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 400; the ''[[Merode Altarpiece]]'' is another version of this composition, though the Virgin's figure there is less similar.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white.&lt;ref&gt;Salih (2002), 130&lt;/ref&gt; Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue [[sash]], while the gold [[brocade]] of her [[Petticoat|underskirt]] is adorned by a jewelled hem.&lt;ref name="B58" /&gt; Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a "[[Prostitution|fallen woman]]" is hinted at by the [[Nap (textile)|nap]] in the [[fur]] lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil.  Darwent wrote, "Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't."&lt;ref name="Darw"&gt;Darwent, Charles. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/rogier-van-der-weyden-master-of-passions-museum-leuven-belgium-1793708.html Rogier van der Weyden: Master of Passions, Museum Leuven, Belgium]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 27 September 2009. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as [[Hans Memling|Memling]] and [[Quentin Matsys|Matsys]] often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she "is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in ''The Magdalen Reading'' by Rogier van der Weyden".&lt;ref&gt;Crispin (2008), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the jar and row of nails on the timber floor at the lower right corner of the panel. Note the attention paid to the gilded clasp and fall of the shadow.]]

The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as "far exceed[ing]" [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]. Her lips are painted with a shades of [[vermilion]], white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of [[impasto]], grid and dots of varying colour and size.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"&gt;Campbell (1998), 402&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt; The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal [[Rosary#Rosary beads|rosary beads]] have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt;

Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as "small miracles of painting", and says that "the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 396 and 402&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect".&lt;ref name="Darw" /&gt; A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases.&lt;ref&gt;These objects are often cut off in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]], possibly a [[reliquary]]. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.&lt;ref name="JW35"&gt;Ward (1971), 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altarpiece fragment==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - St Joseph - WGA25722.jpg|thumb|220px|''Head of Saint Joseph'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. This panel is thought to show [[Saint Joseph]], whose body is visible to his upper arm in ''The Magdalen Reading''.]]

''Virgin and Child with Saints'',&lt;ref name="C49"&gt;Campbell (2004), 49&lt;/ref&gt; a drawing in Stockholm's [[Nationalmuseum]], is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden,&lt;ref name="C398-400"&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400&lt;/ref&gt; who possibly may have been the [[Master of the Drapery Studies|Master of the Coburger Rundblätter]]. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with [[mitre]] and [[crosier]] making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint [[John the Baptist]]; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as [[John the Evangelist]]. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt; This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden (1399of1400-1464) - Buste van Ste. Catharina - Lissabon Museu Calouste Gulbenkian 21-10-2010 13-11-07.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Head of a Female Saint (Saint Catherine?)'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. A possible representation of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop.]]

At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, 398&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to damage, although ''The Magdalen'' fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings".&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"/&gt; From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1&amp;nbsp;m high by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period.&lt;ref name="C398-400"/&gt; The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of Léo Lardus in [[Suresnes]], France.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt; Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear [[rosary]] beads in one hand&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's beads closely resemble those in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside ''The Magdalen Reading''. See Jones, 46, 54&lt;/ref&gt; and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]] shows the head of a figure believed to be the [[Saint Joseph]]; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

[[File:The Magdalen Reading uncleaned.jpg|thumb|260px|Cropped 1930s black and white photograph of the panel before it was cleaned of the overpaint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Davies (museum director)|Davies, Martin]] (1937), 140, 142–145&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the overpainting and the breaking up of the altarpiece are unknown.]]

There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at [[Suresnes]]. The figure may represent [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.&lt;ref name="Campell49"&gt;Campell (2009), 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  Some art historians, including [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] and John Ward,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since.&lt;/ref&gt; have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is [[chamfer]]ed. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3&amp;nbsp;cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures {{convert|18.6|x|21.7|cm|abbr=on}}, the Saint Joseph {{convert|18.2|x|21|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "W32"&gt;Ward (1971), 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is "obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the ''Magdalen''",&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"/&gt; it "seems likely" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that "about half way up the right edge of this fragment ["Catherine"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist".&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.&lt;!-- Campbell says J the Baptist &amp; Ward says J the Evangelist? Is this a mistake? --&gt;&lt;ref name = "W32"/&gt;

The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward—which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints—is widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the ''[[recto and verso|verso]]'' shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a [[Brussels]] workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Weyden, Rogier van der - Descent from the Cross - Detail women (left).jpg|260px|thumb|Detail from ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany,&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described as "This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair".{{Bibleref2|John|11:1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified by the time of [[Pope Gregory I]] as the repentant prostitute of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara (1994), 24&lt;/ref&gt; She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by [[Tintoretto]] and [[Titian]] which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a [[Gaze|male gaze]]), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212/&gt; Writing in "The Crying Face", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a "pictorial formula for crying".&lt;ref&gt;Barasch (1987), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campin Annunciation triptych.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Mérode Altarpiece|Annunciation]]'', attributed to Robert Campin, [[Brussels]], c. 1427–1432, where the figure of the Virgin is close to van der Weyden's London Magdalen.]]

By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a [[psalter]] or [[book of hours]] in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2007), 10–12, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.&lt;ref&gt;Jagodzinski (1999), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212&gt;Badir (2007), 212&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in [[Sainte-Baume]] and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2009), 174&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and "borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth".&lt;ref&gt;Maisch (1998), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1996), 170&lt;/ref&gt; She signified the "sacrament of anointing ([[Chrism]] and [[Anointing|Unction]])" by pouring precious [[spikenard]] on Christ's feet at his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos-Cappadona (2005), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and provenance==

The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/rogier-van-der-weyden Rogier van der Weyden]". [[National Gallery]], London. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by [[Robert Campin]].&lt;ref name="JW35"/&gt; He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna and Child with Saints Master of the Koberger.JPG|thumb|280px|The Stockholm drawing, attributed to the Master of the Coburger Rundblätter, likely shows the portion of the altarpiece to the left of the Magdalen. The kneeling figure to the far right is probably Saint [[John the Evangelist]], some of whose red drapery can be seen in the London fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's position on the lower right hand corner (out of view) is guessed at by Ward from van der Weyden's positioning of similar figures in other works.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Because van der Weyden, like most of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|early Netherlandish painters]], was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 7, 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.

''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in [[Haarlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell; Stock (2009), 441&lt;/ref&gt; when the work was already cut down.&lt;ref name="Darw"/&gt; The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell (2004), 50&lt;/ref&gt; After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt; in Paris, whose "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the [[National Gallery]], London by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] in 1860; an acquisition that also included two [[Robert Campin]] portraits and panels by [[Simon Marmion]] (1425–1489).&lt;ref name ="R203"&gt;Borchert (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery.&lt;ref name ="R203"/&gt; Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, with photo on 395&lt;/ref&gt;  In general the "painted surface is in very good condition", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.&lt;ref name="C394"&gt;Campbell (1998), 394&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magdalen Reading'' was transferred from its original oak to a [[mahogany]] panel (West Indian [[swietenia]])&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395&lt;/ref&gt; by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was "Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="C394"/&gt; Artificial [[ultramarine]]-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997), 85&lt;/ref&gt; The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bjurström (1985), 166&lt;/ref&gt; It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="C49" /&gt;

'''Theatre for Development''' ('''TfD''') means live [[performance]], or [[theater]] used as a development tool—as in [[international development]]. TfD encompasses the following in-person activities, with people before an audience:
* a spoken-word [[drama]] or [[comedy]]
* a music, singing and/or dance production
* a production with movement but no sound ([[Mime artist|mime]])
* participatory or [[Improvisational theater|improvisational techniques]] using any or all of these

Theater for development can also be defined as a progression from less interactive theatre forms to a more dialogical process, where theatre is practiced with the people or by the people as a way of empowering communities, listening to their concerns, and then encouraging them to voice and solve their own problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Kabaso Sydney (2013) as reflected in "Theatre for Development in Zambia" is defined as "modes of theatre whose objective is to disseminate messages, or to conscientize communities about their objective social political situation" (1993:48). And Penina Mlama, referring to the enterprise as Popular Theatre, describes its aims briefly as follows: …it aims to make the people not only aware of but also active participants in the development process by expressing their viewpoints and acting to better their conditions. Popular theatre is intended to empower the common man with a critical consciousness crucial to the struggle against the forces responsible for his poverty. (1991:67)

Theatre for Development can be a kind of [[participatory theatre]], that encourages [[improvisation]] and audience members to take roles in the performance, or can be fully scripted and staged, with the audience observing. Many TfD productions are a mix of the two. "Theatre of the Oppressed" (TO), a technique created by [[Augusto Boal]] is a form of community-based theatre.

Hundreds, if not thousands, of organizations and initiatives have used theatre as a development tool: for education or propaganda, as therapy, as a participatory tool, or as an exploratory tool in development. An account of an early use of TfD is the thesis ''Theater as a Means of Moral Education and Socialization in the Development of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, 1839-1845'', which recounts how theater was used to promote ideological and civil development in a religious community in the US (Hurd 2004).

==Participatory performances==

In usual [[performances]] there are actors on stage and spectators who watch the play. With ‘usual plays’ it is meant the Eurocentric way that was long seen as the only ‘right’ way to do theatre all over the world, especially by the former European rulers of colonized countries. In e.g. African or Asian countries different forms of theatre were and still are very common in the sense of bringing information to the people in an oral way. Thus, different theatre traditions developed worldwide and re-lived in colonized countries after independence, whilst in rural areas they were even common during colonization. By now these times are over, and development communication got a very important topic, thus it seems perfect to make up still living traditions through participative theatre methods.
First of all it is very important for actors and organisers of the performance or TfD-project to get to know the society and the problems people face. Therefore, the play that is going to be performed and worked with has to be developed with local people, who know [[cultural behavior]]s and social problems of the society. Moreover, it is very helpful to have local authority persons and opinion leaders in the team of a TfD-project, whom the regional society listens to and trusts. In this way it is even possible to take advantage of the knowledge that locals have about best dates for performances or even to advertise for the ongoing TfD-performance.

===Forum theatre===

In TfD programs the EEE BAYE performance is mostly played on a community (or gathering) place, but randomly on a stage. In forum theatre the scene acted out shows one ore even more problems the audience faces on their daily routine. Afterwards [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] is explained to the audience by another person of the team and the scene will be shown again. This second and even third, fourth, fifth etc. time, one person after another from the audience can stop the play wherever she or he think it’s suitable and come into the scene. Spectators become so called "spect-actors", whereas the replaced actor steps back. Through being part of the scene participating people dive into the situation performed, what makes the whole topic feel more real for the person who came in to change the situation. Thus, it is an alternative way of problem solving, where creativity is asked for and different approaches are tried. Forum theatre functions as ‘a rehearsal for reality’, like Augusto Boal used to call it.
You can obtain more information on Augusto Boal and his techniques of The Theatre of the Oppressed at the Website of the [http://www.ccdc.in Centre for Community Dialogue and Change](CCDC). This site also has [http://www.ccdc.in/theater-oppressed-links links] to other excellent Websites with indepth information on Theatre of the Oppressed

==Non-participative 'Theatre for Development' performances==
The plays are performed to build awareness about critical topics which are mostly within a political or developmental context, often using an [[agitprop]] style. Especially in oppressive regimes it is not possible to perform political plays, as they will be prohibited from the very beginning on or the revolutionists become prisoners. A lot of [[creativity]] is asked for writing and performing a politically critical play that is a very important feature of TfD methods. Besides political issues common topics are [[nonformal learning|non-formal education]], [[hygiene]], disposal of sewage, environment, [[women's rights]], [[child abuse]], [[prostitution]], [[street children]], [[health education]], HIV/[[AIDS]], [[literacy]] etc.

==[[Street theatre]]==
Methods like e.g. '[[invisible theatre]]' or '[[Theatre of the Oppressed|image theatre]]' can be acted in the streets, seen by people passing by. 'Invisible theatre' seems like a real situation to the audience, which mainly functions as a thought-provoking impulse to the people who observe the situation.
Every kind of TfD-programme trusts in the strength of the word of mouth via people who face the situation, are part of a project or watch a critical play. 'Invisible theatre' in the streets reaches people who wouldn't attend a workshop or watch a play, thus the coverage of addressed people can be even higher and [[social change]] is another step closer.
