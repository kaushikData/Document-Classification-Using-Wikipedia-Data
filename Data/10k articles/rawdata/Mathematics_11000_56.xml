'''87''' ('''eighty-seven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[86 (number)|86]] and preceding [[88 (number)|88]].

==In mathematics==
'''87''' is:

* the sum of the squares of the first four primes (87 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* the sum of the sums of the divisors of the first 10 [[positive integers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A024916|2=sum_{k=1..n} sigma(k) where sigma(n) = sum of divisors of n}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the twenty-sixth distinct [[semiprime]] and the eighth of the form (3.q).
* 5! - 4! - 3! - 2! - 1! = 87

==In sports==
* [[Cricket]] [[Cricket in Australia|in Australia]] holds 87 as a superstitiously unlucky score and is referred to as "the devil's number." This originates from the fact that 87 is [[13 (number)|13]] runs short of a [[Century (cricket)|century]]. 187, 287 and so on are also considered unlucky but is not as common as 87 on its own. 
* In the [[National Hockey League]], [[Wayne Gretzky]] scored a league-high 87 goals with the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in the [[1983–84 NHL season]].

==In other fields==
'''Eighty-seven''' is also:

*The [[atomic number]] of [[francium]]
*An answer to a popular puzzle question states 16, 06, 68, 88, xx, 98. The answer is 87 when looked upside down.
*The number of years between the signing of the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], immortalized in [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] with the phrase "''[[Eighty|fourscore]]'' and seven years ago..."

The '''Abelian sandpile model''', also known as the '''Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model''', was the first discovered example of a [[dynamical system]] displaying [[self-organized criticality]].  It was introduced by [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] in a 1987 paper.&lt;ref name=Bak1987&gt;

The model is a [[cellular automaton]].  In its original formulation, each site on a finite grid has an associated value that corresponds to the slope of the pile.  This slope builds up as "grains of sand" (or "chips") are randomly placed onto the pile, until the slope exceeds a specific threshold value at which time that site collapses transferring sand into the adjacent sites, increasing their slope.  Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld considered process of successive random placement of sand grains on the grid; each such placement of sand at a particular site may have no effect, or it may cause a cascading reaction that will affect many sites.

The model has since been studied on the infinite lattice, on other (non-square) lattices, and on arbitrary graphs (including directed multigraphs).&lt;ref name=Hol2008&gt;{{cite journal

|arxiv=0801.3306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The iteration rules for the model on the square lattice can be defined as follows:

Begin with some nonnegative configuration &lt;math&gt;z(x,y)\in \mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which is finite, in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x,y}z(x,y)&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Any site &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;z(x,y)\geq 4&lt;/math&gt;
is ''unstable'' and can ''topple'', sending one of its chips to each of its four neighbors:
:&lt;math&gt;z(x,y) \rightarrow z(x,y) - 4,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z( x \pm 1, y) \rightarrow z( x \pm 1, y) + 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z(x, y \pm 1) \rightarrow z( x, y \pm 1 ) + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Action (philosophy)|process]] is guaranteed to terminate given that the initial configuration was finite.  Moreover, although there will often be many possible choices for the order in which to topple vertices, the final configuration does not depend on the chosen order; this is one sense in which the sandpile is [[Abelian group|''Abelian'']].  The number of times each vertex topples in this process is also independent of the choice of toppling order.

On an arbitrary undirected graph, a special vertex called a ''sink'' is specified that is not allowed to topple. In the presence of a sink, the term ''chip configuration'' refers to a chip-counting vector (nonnegative and integral) indexed by the non-sink vertices. The rules are that any non-sink vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with 
:&lt;math&gt;z(v)\geq \deg(v)&lt;/math&gt;
is unstable; toppling again sends one of its chips to each of its neighbors:
:&lt;math&gt;z(v) \rightarrow z(v) - \deg(v)&lt;/math&gt;
and, for each &lt;math&gt;u\sim v&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z(u) \rightarrow z(u) + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiple toppling operations can be efficiently encoded by using the [[Laplacian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Deleting the row and column of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; corresponding with the sink yields the ''reduced Laplacian'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative integral vector indexed by the non-sink vertices, then starting with a configuration &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and toppling each vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; a total of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(v)&lt;/math&gt; times yields the configuration &lt;math&gt;z-\mathbf{x}\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;.

This and other models that involve a toppling operation are sometimes referred to as ''chip-firing models'' or ''[[chip-firing game|chip-firing games]]''.

==Sandpile group==
[[File:Sandpile identity 300x205.png|upright=1.25|thumb|The identity element of the sandpile group of a rectangular grid]]
Given a configuration &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, toppling unstable non-sink vertices on a finite connected graph until no unstable non-sink vertex remains leads to a unique ''stable'' configuration &lt;math&gt;z^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the ''stabilization'' of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of stable configurations forms a [[commutative monoid]] under the operation &lt;math&gt;z*w \to (z+w)^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. The minimal [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] of this monoid is a group of ''recurrent'' configurations called the ''sandpile group''. A stable configuration is recurrent if it can be obtained from any other configuration by adding chips and stabilizing.

The sandpile group is isomorphic to the group of equivalence classes of configurations obtained by reducing modulo the toppling operation, which can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}^{n-1}/\mathbf{Z}^{n-1}\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of vertices and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}^{n-1}\Delta'&lt;/math&gt; is the integer row-span of &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;.

The order of the sandpile group is the determinant of &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;, which by the [[Kirchhoff's theorem|matrix tree theorem]] is the number of spanning trees of the graph.

==Self-organized criticality==
{{main|Self-organized criticality}}
The original interest behind the model stemmed from the fact that in simulations on lattices, it is attracted to its [[critical state]], at which point the correlation length of the system and the correlation time of the system go to infinity, without any fine tuning of a system parameter.  This contrasts with earlier examples of critical phenomena, such as the [[phase transition]]s between solid and liquid, or liquid and gas, where the critical point can only be reached by precise tuning (e.g., of temperature).  Hence, in the sandpile model we can say that the criticality is [[self-organization|self-organized]].

Once the sandpile model reaches its critical state there is no correlation between the system's response to a [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] and the details of a perturbation.  Generally this means that dropping another grain of sand onto the pile may cause nothing to happen, or it may cause the entire pile to collapse in a massive slide.  The model also displays [[1/f noise|1/''&amp;fnof;'' noise]], a feature common to many complex systems in nature.

This model only displays critical behaviour in two or more dimensions.  The sandpile model can be expressed in 1D; however, instead of evolving to its critical state, the 1D sandpile model instead reaches a minimally stable state where every lattice site goes toward the critical slope.

For two dimensions, the associated conformal field theory is suggested to be symplectic fermions with central charge ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moghimi-Araghi|date=|title=Abelian Sandpile Model: a Conformal Field Theory Point of View |arxiv=cond-mat/0410434 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.04.002 |volume=718|journal=Nuclear Physics B|pages=362–370|bibcode = 2005NuPhB.718..362M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization to directed graphs ==
The sandpile model can be generalized to arbitrary directed multigraphs. The rules are that any vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with 
:&lt;math&gt;z(v)\geq \deg^{+}(v)&lt;/math&gt;
is unstable; toppling again sends chips to each of its neighbors, one along each outgoing edge:
:&lt;math&gt;z(v) \rightarrow z(v) - \deg^{+}(v) + \deg(v,v)&lt;/math&gt;
and, for each &lt;math&gt;u\neq v&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z(u) \rightarrow z(u) + \deg(v,u)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\deg(v,u)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of edges from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case the Laplacian matrix is not symmetric. If we specify a sink &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a path from every other vertex to &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, then the stabilization operation on finite graphs is well-defined and the sandpile group can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}^{n-1}/\mathbf{Z}^{n-1}\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;
as before.

The order of the sandpile group is again the determinant of &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;, which by the general version of the [[Kirchhoff's theorem|matrix tree theorem]] is the number of oriented [[spanning tree]]s rooted at the sink.

==Least action principle==
The stabilization of chip configurations obeys a form of ''[[principle of least action|least action principle]]'': each vertex topples no more than necessary in the course of the stabilization.&lt;ref name=Fey2010&gt;
{{cite journal

This can be formalized as follows.  Call a sequence of topples ''legal'' if it only topples unstable vertices, and ''stabilizing'' if it results in a stable configuration.  The standard way of stabilizing the sandpile is to find a maximal legal sequence; i.e., by toppling so long as it is possible.  Such a sequence is obviously stabilizing, and the Abelian property of the sandpile is that all such sequences are equivalent up to permutation of the toppling order; that is, for any vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the number of times &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; topples is the same in all legal stabilizing sequences.  According to the least action principle, a '''minimal stabilizing''' sequence is also equivalent up to permutation of the toppling order to a legal (and still stabilizing) sequence.  In particular, the configuration resulting from a minimal stabilizing sequence is the same as results from a maximal legal sequence.

More formally, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of times the vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; topples during the stabilization (via the toppling of unstable vertices) of a chip configuration &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is an integral vector (not necessarily non-negative) such that &lt;math&gt;z-\mathbf{n}\Delta'&lt;/math&gt; is stable, then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(v) \leq \mathbf{n}(v)&lt;/math&gt; for all vertices &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

A strongly related model is the so called '''divisible sandpile model''', introduced in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levine|first=Lionel|last2=Peres|first2=Yuval|date=2008-10-29|title=Strong Spherical Asymptotics for Rotor-Router Aggregation and the Divisible Sandpile|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11118-008-9104-6|journal=Potential Analysis|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1007/s11118-008-9104-6|issn=0926-2601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, in which instead of a discrete amount of particles in each site &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, there is a real number &lt;math&gt;s(x)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amount of mass on the site. In case such mass is negative, one can understand it as a hole. The topple occurs whenever a site has mass larger than 1, it topples the excess evenly between its neighbors, this means that if a site is full at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it will be full for all later times.

== Cultural references ==
The Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile was mentioned on the [[Numb3rs]] episode "Rampage," as mathematician Charlie Eppes explains to his colleagues a solution to a criminal investigation.

The [[computer game]] Hexplode is based around the Abelian sandpile model on a finite hexagonal grid where instead of random grain placement, grains are placed by players.

The '''Adjust flag''' is a [[status register|CPU flag]] in the [[FLAGS register]] of all [[x86]]-compatible [[CPU]]s, and the preceding [[Intel 8080#8080_CPU_family|8080-family]]; it is also called the '''Auxiliary flag''' and the '''Auxiliary Carry''' flag (AC). The flag bit is located at [[bit position|position]]&amp;nbsp;4 in the CPU flag register. It indicates when an [[arithmetic]] [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry]] or borrow has been generated out of the four least significant bits, or lower nibble. It is primarily used to support [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) arithmetic.

The Auxiliary flag is set (to 1) if during an "'''add'''" operation there is a carry from the low nibble (lowest four bits) to the high nibble (upper four bits), or a borrow from the high nibble to the low nibble, in the low-order 8-bit portion, during a subtraction. Otherwise, if no such carry or borrow occurs, the flag is cleared or "reset" (set to 0).

'''Backhouse's constant''' is a [[mathematical constant]] named after Nigel Backhouse. Its value is approximately 1.456 074 948.

It is defined by using the [[power series]] such that the [[coefficient]]s of successive terms are the [[prime numbers]],
: &lt;math&gt;P(x)=1+\sum_{k=1}^\infty p_k x^k=1+2x+3x^2+5x^3+7x^4+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
and its [[multiplicative inverse]] as a [[formal power series]],
: &lt;math&gt;Q(x)=\frac{1}{P(x)}=\sum_{k=0}^\infty q_k x^k.&lt;/math&gt;
Then:
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}\left | \frac{q_{k+1}}{q_k} \right \vert = 1.45607\ldots&lt;/math&gt; {{OEIS|id=A072508}}.

This limit was conjectured to exist by {{harvtxt|Backhouse|1995}}, and the conjecture was later proven by {{harvs|first=Philippe|last=Flajolet|authorlink=Philippe Flajolet|year=1995|txt}}.

In [[mathematics]], any of the positive [[integer]]s that occurs as a [[coefficient]] in the [[binomial theorem]] is a '''binomial coefficient'''.  Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers {{math|''n'' ≥ ''k'' ≥ 0}} and is written &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}.&lt;/math&gt; It is the [[coefficient]] of the {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} term in the [[polynomial expansion]] of the [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]] [[exponentiation|power]] {{math|(1 + ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and it is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

For example: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}(1{+}x)^4&amp;=&amp; \tbinom 40 x^0 + \tbinom 41 x^1 + \tbinom 42 x^2 + \tbinom 43 x^3 + \tbinom 44 x^4 \\
&amp;=&amp; 1 + 4x + 6 x^2 + 4x^3+x^4,
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tbinom 42 =\tfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6&lt;/math&gt;, etc.

Arranging the numbers &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n0, \tbinom n1, \ldots,\tbinom nn&lt;/math&gt; in successive rows for &lt;math&gt;n=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; gives a triangular array called [[Pascal's triangle]], satisfying the [[recurrence relation]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk = \tbinom{n-1}{k} + \tbinom{n-1}{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially [[combinatorics]].
The symbol &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is usually read as "{{math|''n''}} choose {{math|''k''}}" because there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose an (unordered) subset of {{math|''k''}} elements from a fixed set of {{math|''n''}} elements. For example, there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom 42=6&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose 2 elements from &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1,2\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{1,3\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{1,4\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{2,4\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{3,4\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many properties of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; also apply to the generalized binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tbinom zk&lt;/math&gt; for any complex number ''z'' and integer ''k'' &amp;ge; 0.

==History and notation==

[[Andreas von Ettingshausen]] introduced the notation &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; in 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Higham|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see [[Pascal's triangle]]). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by [[Halayudha]], on an ancient [[Sanskrit]] text, [[Pingala]]'s ''Chandaḥśāstra''.  In about 1150, the Indian mathematician [[Bhaskaracharya]] gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book ''[[Līlāvatī]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lilavati]] Section 6, Chapter 4 (see {{harvtxt|Knuth|1997}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative notations include {{math|''C''(''n'', ''k'')}}, {{math|&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="position:relative; left:-.5em;"&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub style="position:relative; left:-.5em;"&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in all of which the {{math|''C''}} stands for ''[[combination]]s'' or ''choices''. Many calculators use variants of the {{nowrap|{{math|''C''}} notation}} because they can represent it on a single-line display.  In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to [[permutation#k-permutations of n|{{math|''k''}}-permutations of {{math|''n''}}]], written as {{math|''P''(''n'', ''k'')}}, etc.

== Definition and interpretations ==
For [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0) ''n'' and ''k'', the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as the [[coefficient]] of the [[monomial]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the expansion of {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The same coefficient also occurs (if {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}) in the [[binomial formula]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk x^{n-k}y^k&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|∗}}}}
(valid for any elements ''x'',''y'' of a [[commutative ring]]),
which explains the name "binomial coefficient".

Another occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that ''k'' objects can be chosen from among ''n'' objects; more formally, the number of ''k''-element subsets (or ''k''-[[combination]]s) of an ''n''-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the ''n'' factors of the power {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} one temporarily labels the term ''X'' with an index ''i'' (running from 1 to ''n''), then each subset of ''k'' indices gives after expansion a contribution ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number for any natural numbers ''n'' and ''k''. There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of ''n'' [[bit]]s (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is ''k'' is given by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;, while the number of ways to write &lt;math&gt;k=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n&lt;/math&gt; where every ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a nonnegative integer is given by &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n+k-1}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting ''k''-combinations.

== Computing the value of binomial coefficients ==
Several methods exist to compute the value of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt; without actually expanding a binomial power or counting ''k''-combinations.

=== Recursive formula ===
One method uses the [[recursion|recursive]], purely additive, formula

:&lt;math&gt;  \binom nk = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}k \quad \text{for all integers }n,k : 1\le k\le n-1,&lt;/math&gt;

with initial/boundary values

:&lt;math&gt;\binom n0 = \binom nn = 1 \quad \text{for all integers } n\ge0,&lt;/math&gt;

The formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…,''n''} and counting separately (a) the ''k''-element groupings that include a particular set element, say "''i''", in every group (since "''i''" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 from the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) and (b) all the ''k''-groupings that don't include "''i''"; this enumerates all the possible ''k''-combinations of ''n'' elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''X'')}}. As there is zero ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''X''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in {{nowrap|(1 + ''X'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when either ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' or ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. This recursive formula then allows the construction of [[Pascal's triangle]], surrounded by white spaces where the zeros, or the trivial coefficients, would be.

=== Multiplicative formula ===
A more efficient method to compute individual binomial coefficients is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\binom nk = \frac{n^{\underline{k}}}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n+1-i}{i},&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerator of the first fraction &lt;math&gt;n^{\underline{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as a [[falling factorial power]].
This formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.
The numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of ''k'' distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of ''n'' objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same ''k''-combination when order is disregarded.

Due to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to ''k'' and ''n''−''k'', calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of ''k'' and ''n''−''k''.

=== Factorial formula ===
Finally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar [[factorial]] function:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!} \quad \text{for }\ 0\leq k\leq n,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''! denotes the factorial of ''n''. This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''k'')!}}; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator.  It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that ''k'' is small and ''n'' is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \binom nk = \binom n{n-k} \quad \text{for }\ 0\leq k\leq n,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

which leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial notation]],

:&lt;math&gt; \binom nk =  
\begin{cases}
 n^{\underline{k}}/k! &amp; \text{if }\ k \le \frac{n}{2} \\
 n^{\underline{n-k}}/(n-k)! &amp; \text{if }\ k &gt; \frac{n}{2}
\end{cases}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generalization and connection to the binomial series ===
The multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extended&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Graham|Knuth|Patashnik|1994}}, which also defines &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Alternative generalizations, such as to [[#Two real or complex valued arguments|two real or complex valued arguments]] using the [[Gamma function]] assign nonzero values to &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, but this causes most binomial coefficient identities to fail, and thus is not widely used by the majority of definitions.  One such choice of nonzero values leads to the aesthetically pleasing "Pascal windmill" in Hilton, Holton and Pedersen, ''Mathematical reflections: in a room with many mirrors'', Springer, 1997, but causes even [[Pascal's identity]] to fail (at the origin).&lt;/ref&gt; by replacing ''n'' by an arbitrary number ''α'' (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any [[commutative ring]] in which all positive integers are invertible:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom \alpha k = \frac{\alpha^{\underline k}}{k!} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)\cdots(\alpha-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}
  \quad\text{for } k\in\N \text{ and arbitrary } \alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the &lt;math&gt;\tbinom\alpha k&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficients:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; (1+X)^\alpha = \sum_{k=0}^\infty {\alpha \choose k} X^k.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This formula is valid for all complex numbers ''α'' and ''X'' with |''X''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of [[formal power series]] in ''X'', where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of power series with constant coefficient equal to&amp;nbsp;1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for [[exponentiation]], notably

:&lt;math&gt;(1+X)^\alpha(1+X)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha+\beta} \quad\text{and}\quad ((1+X)^\alpha)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''α'' is a nonnegative integer ''n'', then all terms with ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However, for other values of ''α'', including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.

== Pascal's triangle ==
[[Image:Pascal's triangle - 1000th row.png|150px|right|thumb|1000th row of Pascal's triangle, arranged vertically, with grey-scale representations of decimal digits of the coefficients, right-aligned. The left boundary of the image corresponds roughly to the graph of the logarithm of the binomial coefficients, and illustrates that they form a [[logarithmically concave sequence|log-concave sequence]].]]

{{Main|Pascal's triangle|Pascal's rule}}

[[Pascal's rule]] is the important [[recurrence relation]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} +  {n \choose k+1} = {n+1 \choose k+1},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
which can be used to prove by [[mathematical induction]] that &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number for all ''n'' and ''k'', a fact that is not immediately obvious from [[#Definition_and_interpretations|formula (1)]].

Pascal's rule also gives rise to [[Pascal's triangle]]:

Row number ''n'' contains the numbers &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; for ''k'' = 0,…,''n''. It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that
:(''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = '''1''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + '''5''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' + '''10''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + '''10''' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + '''5''' ''x'' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + '''1''' ''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
The differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation ({{EquationNote|3}}) above.

== Combinatorics and statistics ==
Binomial coefficients are of importance in [[combinatorics]], because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:
* There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose ''k'' elements from a set of ''n'' elements.  See [[Combination]].
* There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {n+k-1}k&lt;/math&gt; ways to choose ''k'' elements from a set of ''n'' elements if repetitions are allowed. See [[Multiset]].
* There are &lt;math&gt; \tbinom {n+k} k&lt;/math&gt; [[string (computer science)|strings]] containing ''k'' ones and ''n'' zeros.
* There are &lt;math&gt; \tbinom {n+1} k&lt;/math&gt; strings consisting of ''k'' ones and ''n'' zeros such that no two ones are adjacent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muir|first=Thomas|title=Note on Selected Combinations|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|year=1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EN8vAAAAIAAJ&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Catalan number]]s are &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{n+1}\tbinom{2n}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The [[binomial distribution]] in [[statistics]] is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \!.&lt;/math&gt;

== Binomial coefficients as polynomials ==
For any nonnegative integer ''k'', the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\binom{t}{k}}&lt;/math&gt; can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by ''k''!:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{k} =\frac{(t)_k}{k!}=\frac{(t)_k}{(k)_k}= \frac{t(t-1)(t-2)\cdots(t-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots2 \cdot 1};&lt;/math&gt;

this presents a [[polynomial]] in ''t'' with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.

As such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number ''t'' to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.
These "generalized binomial coefficients" appear in [[Binomial theorem#Newton's generalized binomial theorem|Newton's generalized binomial theorem]].

For each ''k'', the polynomial &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be characterized as the unique degree ''k'' polynomial ''p''(''t'') satisfying ''p''(0) = ''p''(1) = ... = ''p''(''k'' &amp;minus; 1) = 0 and ''p''(''k'') = 1.

Its coefficients are expressible in terms of [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^k s(k,i)\frac{t^i}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by [[logarithmic differentiation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \binom{t}{k} = \binom{t}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{1}{t-i}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial coefficients as a basis for the space of polynomials ===
Over any [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic 0]] (that is, any field that contains the [[rational number]]s), each polynomial ''p''(''t'') of degree at most ''d'' is uniquely expressible as a linear combination &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^d a_k \binom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; of binomial coefficients.  The coefficient ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[finite difference|''k''th difference]] of the sequence ''p''(0), ''p''(1), …, ''p''(''k'').
Explicitly,&lt;ref&gt;This can be seen as a discrete analog of [[Taylor's theorem]]. It is closely related to [[Newton's polynomial]]. Alternating sums of this form may be expressed as the [[Nörlund–Rice integral]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;a_k = \sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^{k-i} \binom{k}{i} p(i).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

=== Integer-valued polynomials ===
{{main|Integer-valued polynomial}}
Each polynomial &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{t}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is [[integer-valued polynomial|integer-valued]]: it has an integer value at all integer inputs &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.
(One way to prove this is by induction on ''k'', using [[Pascal's identity]].)
Therefore, any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.
Conversely, ({{EquationNote|4}}) shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.
More generally, for any subring ''R'' of a characteristic 0 field ''K'', a polynomial in ''K''[''t''] takes values in ''R'' at all integers if and only if it is an ''R''-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.

=== Example ===
The integer-valued polynomial 3''t''(3''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;9\tbinom{t}{2} + 6 \tbinom{t}{1} + 0\tbinom{t}{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Identities involving binomial coefficients ==
The factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients.  For instance, if ''k'' is a positive integer and ''n'' is arbitrary, then
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n}{k} \binom{n-1}{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
and, with a little more work,
:&lt;math&gt;\binom {n-1}{k} - \binom{n-1}{k-1} = \frac{n-2k}{n} \binom{n}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, the following may be useful:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{h}\binom{n-h}{k}=\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
For constant ''n'', we have the following recurrence:
:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n+1-k}{k} \binom{n}{k-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sums of the binomial coefficients ===
The formula
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom n k = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|∗∗}}}}
says the elements in the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row of Pascal's triangle always add up to 2 raised to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. This is obtained from the binomial theorem ({{EquationNote|∗}}) by setting ''x'' = 1 and ''y'' = 1.  The formula also has a natural combinatorial interpretation: the left side sums the number of subsets of {1,...,''n''} of sizes ''k'' = 0,1,...,''n'', giving the total number of subsets. (That is, the left side counts the [[power set]] of {1,...,''n''}.) However, these subsets can also be generated by successively choosing or excluding each element 1,...,''n''; the ''n'' independent binary choices (bit-strings) allow a total of &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; choices. The left and right sides are two ways to count the same collection of subsets, so they are equal. 

The formulas
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n k \binom n k = n 2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
and
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n k^2 \binom n k = (n + n^2)2^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;
follow from ({{EquationNote|2}}) after [[derivative|differentiating]] with respect to ''x'' (twice in the latter)  and then substituting ''x'' = 1.

The [[Chu–Vandermonde identity]], which holds for any complex-values ''m'' and ''n'' and any non-negative integer ''k'', is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^k \binom m j \binom{n-m}{k-j} = \binom n k&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
and can be found by examination of the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; in the expansion of (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; using equation ({{EquationNote|2}}).  When ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, equation ({{EquationNote|7}}) reduces to equation ({{EquationNote|3}}).  In the special case ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''m'', ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m'', using ({{EquationNote|1}}), the expansion ({{EquationNote|7}}) becomes (as seen in Pascal's triangle at right)
[[File:Pascal triangle small.png|thumb|right|300px|Pascal's triangle, rows 0 through 7. Equation {{EquationNote|8}} for ''m'' = 3 is illustrated in rows 3 and 6 as &lt;math&gt;1^2+3^2+3^2+1^2=20.&lt;/math&gt;]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^m \binom{m}{j} ^2 = \binom {2m} m,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
where the term on the right side is a [[central binomial coefficient]].

Another form of the Chu–Vandermonde identity, which applies for any integers ''j'', ''k'', and ''n'' satisfying 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'', is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^n \binom m j \binom {n-m}{k-j}= \binom {n+1}{k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
The proof is similar, but uses the binomial series expansion ({{EquationNote|2}}) with negative integer exponents.
When ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', equation ({{EquationNote|9}}) gives the [[hockey-stick identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=k}^n \binom m k = \binom {n+1}{k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''F''(''n'') denote the ''n''-th [[Fibonacci number]].
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} \binom {n-k} k = F(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;
This can be proved by [[mathematical induction|induction]] using ({{EquationNote|3}}) or by [[Zeckendorf's theorem|Zeckendorf's representation]]. A combinatorial proof is given below.

==== Multisections of sums ====
For integers ''s'' and ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;0\leq t &lt; s,&lt;/math&gt; [[series multisection]] gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients:
: &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{t}+\binom{n}{t+s}+\binom{n}{t+2s}+\ldots=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{j=0}^{s-1}\left(2\cos\frac{\pi j}{s}\right)^n\cos\frac{\pi(n-2t)j}{s}.&lt;/math&gt;

For small ''s'', these series have particularly nice forms; for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gradshteyn|Ryzhik|2014|pp=3–4}}
.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{3}+\binom{n}{6}+\cdots = \frac{1}{3}\left(2^n +2 \cos\frac{n\pi}{3}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{4}+\binom{n}{7}+\cdots = \frac{1}{3}\left(2^n +2 \cos\frac{(n-2)\pi}{3}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{5}+\binom{n}{8}+\cdots = \frac{1}{3}\left(2^n +2 \cos\frac{(n-4)\pi}{3}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{4}+\binom{n}{8}+\cdots = \frac{1}{2}\left(2^{n-1} +2^{\frac{n}{2}} \cos\frac{n\pi}{4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{5}+\binom{n}{9}+\cdots = \frac{1}{2}\left(2^{n-1} +2^{\frac{n}{2}} \sin\frac{n\pi}{4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{6}+\binom{n}{10}+\cdots = \frac{1}{2}\left(2^{n-1} -2^{\frac{n}{2}} \cos\frac{n\pi}{4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{3} + \binom{n}{7}+\binom{n}{11}+\cdots = \frac{1}{2}\left(2^{n-1} -2^{\frac{n}{2}} \sin\frac{n\pi}{4}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

==== Partial sums ====

Although there is no closed formula for partial sums

of binomial coefficients,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\binom n j = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' &gt; 0.  This latter result is also a special case of the result from the theory of [[finite differences]] that for any polynomial ''P''(''x'') of degree less than ''n'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Sebastian|title=An Algebraic Identity Leading to Wilson's Theorem|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|year=1996|volume=80|issue=489|pages=579–582|doi=10.2307/3618534|jstor=3618534|arxiv=math/0406086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\binom n j P(j) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating ({{EquationNote|2}}) ''k'' times and setting ''x'' = &amp;minus;1 yields this for
&lt;math&gt;P(x)=x(x-1)\cdots(x-k+1)&lt;/math&gt;,
when 0 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''n'',
and the general case follows by taking linear combinations of these.

When ''P''(''x'') is of degree less than or equal to ''n'',

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\binom n j P(n-j) = n!a_n&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of degree ''n'' in ''P''(''x'').

More generally for ({{EquationNote|10}}),
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\binom n j P(m+(n-j)d) = d^n n! a_n&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' and ''d'' are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying ({{EquationNote|10}}) to the polynomial ''Q(x):=P(m + dx)'' instead of ''P(x)'', and observing that ''Q(x)'' has still degree less than or equal to ''n'', and that its coefficient of degree ''n'' is ''d&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The [[series (mathematics)|series]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{k-1}k\sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac 1 {\binom {j+x} k}= \frac 1 {\binom{x-1}{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent for ''k'' ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the [[German tank problem]]. It follows from  &lt;math&gt;\frac{k-1}k\sum_{j=0}^{M}\frac 1 {\binom{j+x} k}=\frac 1{\binom{x-1}{k-1}}-\frac 1{\binom{M+x}{k-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
which is proved by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on ''M''.

=== Identities with combinatorial proofs ===
Many identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by [[combinatorial proof|combinatorial means]]. For example, for nonnegative integers &lt;math&gt;{n} \geq {q}&lt;/math&gt;, the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=q}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{k}{q} = 2^{n-q}\binom{n}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

(which reduces to ({{EquationNote|6}}) when ''q'' = 1) can be given a [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting proof]], as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of [''n''] = {1, 2, …, ''n''} with at least ''q'' elements, and marking ''q'' elements among those selected. The right side counts the same thing, because there are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n q&lt;/math&gt; ways of choosing a set of ''q'' elements to mark, and &lt;math&gt;2^{n-q}&lt;/math&gt; to choose which of the remaining elements of [''n''] also belong to the subset.

In Pascal's identity
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k},&lt;/math&gt;
both sides count the number of ''k''-element subsets of [''n'']: the two terms on the right side group them into those that contain element ''n'' and those that do not.

The identity ({{EquationNote|8}}) also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose you have &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) ''n'' of them. There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {2n}n&lt;/math&gt; ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your ''n'' squares by selecting ''k'' squares from among the first ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt; squares from the remaining ''n'' squares; any ''k'' from 0 to ''n'' will work. This gives
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n\binom  n k\binom n{n-k} = \binom {2n} n.&lt;/math&gt;
Now apply ({{EquationNote|5}}) to get the result.

If one denotes by {{math|''F''(''i'')}} the sequence of [[Fibonacci number]]s, indexed so that {{math|''F''(0) {{=}} ''F''(1) {{=}} 1}}, then the identity 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor} \tbinom {n-k} k = F(n)&lt;/math&gt;
has the following combinatorial proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Quinn|2003|loc=pp. 4−5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One may show by [[mathematical induction|induction]] that {{math|''F''(''n'')}} counts the number of ways that a {{math|''n'' × 1}} strip of squares may be covered by {{math|2 × 1}} and {{math|1 × 1}} tiles.  On the other hand, if such a tiling uses exactly {{mvar|k}} of the {{math|2 × 1}} tiles, then it uses {{math|''n'' − 2''k''}} of the {{math|1 × 1}} tiles, and so uses {{math|''n'' − ''k''}} tiles total.  There are &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n-k}{k}&lt;/math&gt; ways to order these tiles, and so summing this coefficient over all possible values of {{mvar|k}} gives the identity.

The number of ''k''-[[Combination#Number of k-combinations for all k|combinations]] for all ''k'', &lt;math&gt;\sum_{0\leq{k}\leq{n}}\binom nk = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;, is the sum of the ''n''th row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of [[base 2]] numbers counting from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, where each digit position is an item from the set of ''n''.

=== Dixon's identity ===
[[Dixon's identity]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=-a}^{a}(-1)^{k}{2a\choose k+a}^3 =\frac{(3a)!}{(a!)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

or, more generally,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=-a}^a(-1)^k{a+b\choose a+k} {b+c\choose b+k}{c+a\choose c+k}  = \frac{(a+b+c)!}{a!\,b!\,c!}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are non-negative integers.

=== Continuous identities ===
Certain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of
binomial coefficients:

For &lt;math&gt;\textstyle m, n \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos((2m-n)x)\cos^n x\ dx = \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin((2m-n)x)\sin^n x\ dx = \left \{
\begin{array}{cc}
(-1)^{m+(n+1)/2} \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ odd} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos((2m-n)x)\sin^n x\ dx = \left \{
\begin{array}{cc}
(-1)^{m+(n/2)} \frac{\pi}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ even} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{array} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

These can be proved by using [[Euler's formula]] to convert [[trigonometric functions]] to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.

== Generating functions ==

=== Ordinary generating functions ===
For a fixed {{math|''n''}}, the [[ordinary generating function]] of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n0,\tbinom n1,\tbinom n2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty {n\choose k} x^k = (1+x)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed {{math|''k''}},  the ordinary generating function of the sequence &lt;math&gt;\tbinom 0k,\tbinom 1k, \tbinom 2k,\ldots,&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=k}^\infty {n\choose k} y^n = \frac{y^k}{(1-y)^{k+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[bivariate generating function]] of the binomial coefficients is
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} x^k y^n = \frac{1}{1-y-xy}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another, symmetric, bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty {n+k\choose k} x^k y^n = \frac{1}{1-x-y}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exponential generating function ===
A symmetric [[exponential generating function|exponential bivariate generating function]] of the binomial coefficients is:
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty {n+k\choose k} \frac{x^k y^n}{(n+k)!} = e^{x+y}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Divisibility properties ==
{{main|Kummer's theorem|Lucas' theorem}}
In 1852, [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] proved that if ''m'' and ''n'' are nonnegative integers and ''p'' is a prime number, then the largest power of ''p'' dividing &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{m+n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; equals ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the number of carries when ''m'' and ''n'' are added in base ''p''.
Equivalently, the exponent of a prime ''p'' in &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt;
equals the number of nonnegative integers ''j'' such that the [[fractional part]] of ''k''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; is greater than the fractional part of ''n''/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It can be deduced from this that &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by ''n''/[[greatest common divisor|gcd]](''n'',''k''). In particular therefore it follows that ''p'' divides &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{p^r}{s}&lt;/math&gt; for all positive integers ''r'' and ''s'' such that ''s''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. However this is not true of higher powers of ''p'': for example 9 does not divide &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{9}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

A somewhat surprising result by [[David Singmaster]] (1974) is that any integer divides [[almost all]] binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer ''d'' and let ''f''(''N'') denote the number of binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' &lt; ''N'' such that ''d'' divides &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{f(N)}{N(N+1)/2} = 1. &lt;/math&gt;
Since the number of binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; with ''n'' &lt; ''N'' is ''N''(''N'' + 1) / 2, this implies that the density of binomial coefficients divisible by ''d'' goes to 1.

Binomial coefficients have divisibility properties related to least common multiples of consecutive integers. For example:&lt;ref name="Farhi2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farhi |first=Bakir |title=Nontrivial lower bounds for the least common multiple of some finite sequence of integers |journal=Journal of Number Theory |volume=125 |year=2007 |pages=393–411 |doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2006.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\binom{n+k}k&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{lcm}(n,n+1,\ldots,n+k)}n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\binom{n+k}k&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{lcm}(n,n+1,\ldots,n+k)}{n\cdot \text{lcm}(\binom{k}0,\binom{k}1,\ldots,\binom{k}k)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another fact:
An integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 is prime if and only if
all the intermediate binomial coefficients
: &lt;math&gt; \binom n 1, \binom n 2, \ldots, \binom n{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
are divisible by ''n''.

Proof:
When ''p'' is prime, ''p'' divides
:&lt;math&gt; \binom p k = \frac{p \cdot (p-1) \cdots (p-k+1)}{k \cdot (k-1) \cdots 1} &lt;/math&gt; for all 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''
because &lt;math&gt;\tbinom p k&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number and ''p'' divides the numerator but not the denominator.
When ''n'' is composite, let ''p'' be the smallest prime factor of ''n'' and let ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;n/p. Then 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' and
:&lt;math&gt; \binom n p = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-p+1)}{p!}=\frac{k(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-p+1)}{(p-1)!}\not\equiv 0 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
otherwise the numerator ''k''(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) has to be divisible by ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;times;''p'', this can only be the case when (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) is divisible by ''p''. But ''n'' is divisible by ''p'', so ''p'' does not divide ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and because ''p'' is prime, we know that ''p'' does not divide (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;times;...&amp;times;(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) and so the numerator cannot be divisible by ''n''.

== Bounds and asymptotic formulas ==
The following bounds for &lt;math&gt;\tbinom n k&lt;/math&gt; hold for all values of ''n'' and ''k'' such that  1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n^k}{k^k} \le {n \choose k}  \le \frac{n^k}{k!} &lt; \left(\frac{n\cdot e}{k}\right)^k&lt;/math&gt;.

The first inequality follows from the fact that &lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = \frac{n}{k} \cdot \frac{n-1}{k-1} \cdots \frac{n-(k-1)}{1} &lt;/math&gt; and each of these &lt;math&gt;k &lt;/math&gt; terms in this product is &lt;math&gt; \geq \frac{n}{k} &lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument can be made to show &lt;math&gt; {n \choose k}  \le \frac{n^k}{k!} &lt;/math&gt;. The final strict inequality follows from multiplying &lt;math&gt;  \left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^k &lt;/math&gt; by the Taylor series for &lt;math&gt;e^{k} &lt;/math&gt;.

From the divisibility properties we can infer that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{lcm}(n-k,\ldots,n)}{(n-k)\cdot \text{lcm}(\binom{k}0,\ldots,\binom{k}k)}\leq\binom{n}k\leq\frac{\text{lcm}(n-k,\ldots,n)}{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;,

where both equalities can be achieved.&lt;ref name="Farhi2007" /&gt;

[[Stirling's approximation]] yields the following approximation, when  &lt;math&gt;n,i&lt;/math&gt; are sufficiently large:
: &lt;math&gt;{n \choose i} \sim 
\sqrt{n\over 2\pi i (n-i)} \cdot
{n^n \over i^i (n-i)^{n-i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, when  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently large:
: &lt;math&gt; {2n \choose n} \sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}&lt;/math&gt;

Also:{{why|date=September 2017}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}{2n \choose n} \ge 2^{2n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and, in general, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}{mn \choose n} \ge \frac{m^{m(n-1)+1}}{(m-1)^{(m-1)(n-1)}}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1,

For &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt; both much larger than 1, [[Stirling's approximation]] also yields the following asymptotic approximation:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_2{n \choose k} \sim n H(k/n)  = n\log_2(n/k) + (n-k)\log_2(n/(n-k))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(\epsilon) = -\epsilon\log_2(\epsilon) -(1-\epsilon)\log_2(1-\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binary entropy function|binary entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
More precisely, for all integers &lt;math&gt;n \geq k \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon \doteq k/n \leq 1/2&lt;/math&gt;, we can estimate the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; binomial coefficients as follows:&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{harvtxt |Ash|1990|p=121}} or {{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006| p=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{8n\epsilon(1-\epsilon)}} \cdot 2^{H(\epsilon) \cdot n} \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} \leq 2^{H(\epsilon) \cdot n}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is large and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, one can also write

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = \frac{n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1)}{k!} \approx \frac{(n-k/2)^k }{ k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k}} = \frac{(n/k-0.5)^k e^k }{ \sqrt{2\pi k}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\ln{n \choose k} \approx k \ln(n/k-0.5) + k - 0.5 \ln(2 \pi k)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If more precision is desired, one can approximate &lt;math&gt;\ln{(n(n-1)\dots(n-k+1))}&lt;/math&gt; with an integral, obtaining

:&lt;math&gt;\ln{n \choose k} \approx (n+0.5) \ln\frac{n+0.5}{n-k+0.5} + k \ln \frac{n-k+0.5}{k} - 0.5 \ln(2 \pi k)&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;n=20&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=10&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ln{\tbinom n k} \approx 12.127&lt;/math&gt;, and these approximations yield 12.312 and 12.133 respectively.

The infinite product formula (cf. [[Gamma function#Alternative definitions|Gamma function, alternative definition]])
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^k {z \choose k}= {-z+k-1 \choose k} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(-z)} \frac{1}{(k+1)^{z+1}} \prod_{j=k+1} \frac{(1+\frac{1}{j})^{-z-1}}{1-\frac{z+1}{j}}&lt;/math&gt;
yields the asymptotic formulas
:&lt;math&gt;{z \choose k} \approx \frac{(-1)^k}{\Gamma(-z) k^{z+1}} \qquad  \mathrm{and}  \qquad {z+k \choose k} = \frac{k^z}{\Gamma(z+1)}\left( 1+\frac{z(z+1)}{2k}+\mathcal{O}\left(k^{-2}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

This asymptotic behaviour is contained in the approximation
:&lt;math&gt;{z+k \choose k}\approx \frac{e^{z(H_k-\gamma)}}{\Gamma(z+1)}&lt;/math&gt;
as well. (Here &lt;math&gt;H_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th [[harmonic number]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].)

Further, the asymptotic formula
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{z+k\choose j}}{{k\choose j}}\to \left(1-\frac{j}{k}\right)^{-z}\quad\text{and}\quad \frac{{j\choose j-k}}{{j-z\choose j-k}}\to \left(\frac{j}{k}\right)^z&lt;/math&gt;
hold true, whenever &lt;math&gt;k\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j/k\to x&lt;/math&gt; for some complex number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

A simple and rough upper bound for the sum of binomial coefficients can be obtained using the [[binomial theorem]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^k {n \choose i} \leq \sum_{i=0}^k n^i\cdot 1^{k-i} \leq (1+n)^k&lt;/math&gt;

If ''n'' is large and ''k'' is linear in ''n'', various precise asymptotic estimates exist for the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, if &lt;math&gt;| n/2 - k | = o(n^{2/3})&lt;/math&gt; then&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spencer |first1=Joel |author1link=Joel Spencer |last2=Florescu |first2=Laura |date=2014 |title=Asymptopia |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] |series=Student mathematical library |volume=71 |isbn=978-1-4704-0904-3 |oclc=865574788 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} \sim \binom{n}{\frac{n}{2}} e^{-d^2/(2n)} \sim \frac{2^n}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}n \pi }} e^{-d^2/(2n)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' = ''n'' − 2''k''.

==Generalizations==

===Generalization to multinomials===
{{main|Multinomial theorem}}
Binomial coefficients can be generalized to '''multinomial coefficients''' defined to be the number:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} =\frac{n!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_r!}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^rk_i=n.&lt;/math&gt;

While the binomial coefficients represent the coefficients of (''x''+''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the multinomial coefficients
represent the coefficients of the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_r)^n.&lt;/math&gt;
The case ''r'' = 2 gives binomial coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2}={n\choose k_1, n-k_1}={n\choose k_1}= {n\choose k_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The combinatorial interpretation of multinomial coefficients is distribution of ''n'' distinguishable elements over ''r'' (distinguishable) containers, each containing exactly ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' elements, where ''i'' is the index of the container.

Multinomial coefficients have many properties similar to those of binomial coefficients, for example the recurrence relation:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} ={n-1\choose k_1-1,k_2,\ldots,k_r}+{n-1\choose k_1,k_2-1,\ldots,k_r}+\ldots+{n-1\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r-1}&lt;/math&gt;
and symmetry:
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_r} ={n\choose k_{\sigma_1},k_{\sigma_2},\ldots,k_{\sigma_r}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[permutation]] of (1,2,...,''r'').

=== Taylor series ===
Using [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] the [[Taylor series|series expansion]] around any arbitrarily chosen point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} {z \choose k} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^k z^i s_{k,i}&amp;=\sum_{i=0}^k (z- z_0)^i \sum_{j=i}^k {z_0 \choose j-i} \frac{s_{k+i-j,i}}{(k+i-j)!} \\ &amp;=\sum_{i=0}^k (z-z_0)^i \sum_{j=i}^k z_0^{j-i} {j \choose i} \frac{s_{k,j}}{k!}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Binomial coefficient with ''n'' = 1/2 ===
The definition of the binomial coefficients can be extended to the case where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is real and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is integer.

In particular, the following identity holds for any non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt;{{1/2}\choose{k}}={{2k}\choose{k}}\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2^{2k}(2k-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This shows up when expanding &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+x}&lt;/math&gt; into a power series using the Newton binomial series :
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+x}=\sum_{k\geq 0}{\binom{1/2}{k}}x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Identity for the product of binomial coefficients ===
One can express the product of binomial coefficients as a linear combination of binomial coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;{z \choose m} {z\choose n} = \sum_{k=0}^m {m + n - k \choose k, m - k, n - k} {z \choose m + n - k},&lt;/math&gt;

where the connection coefficients are [[Multinomial theorem|multinomial coefficients]]. In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign ''m'' + ''n'' − ''k'' labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects&amp;mdash;of weight ''m'' and ''n'' respectively&amp;mdash;that have had their first ''k'' labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight ''m'' + ''n'' − ''k''. (That is, to separate the labels into three portions to apply to the glued part, the unglued part of the first object, and the unglued part of the second object.) In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what [[falling factorial]]s are to ordinary generating series.

=== Partial fraction decomposition ===
The [[partial fraction decomposition]] of the reciprocal is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{{z \choose n}}= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-1-i} {n \choose i} \frac{n-i}{z-i}, 
\qquad \frac{1}{{z+n \choose n}}= \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i-1} {n \choose i} \frac{i}{z+i}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Newton's binomial series ===
{{main|Binomial series}}
Newton's binomial series, named after [[Sir Isaac Newton]], is a generalization of the binomial theorem to infinite series:

:&lt;math&gt; (1+z)^{\alpha} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\alpha\choose n}z^n = 1+{\alpha\choose1}z+{\alpha\choose 2}z^2+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

The identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the [[differential equation]] (1 + ''z'') ''f'''(''z'') = α ''f''(''z'').

The [[radius of convergence]] of this series is 1.  An alternative expression is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1-z)^{\alpha+1}} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{n+\alpha \choose n}z^n&lt;/math&gt;

where the identity

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k} = (-1)^k {k-n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

is applied.

=== Multiset (rising) binomial coefficient ===
{{main|Multichoose#Counting multisets}}
Binomial coefficients count subsets of prescribed size from a given set.  A related combinatorial problem is to count [[multiset]]s of prescribed size with elements drawn from a given set, that is, to count the number of ways to select a certain number of elements from a given set with the possibility of selecting the same element repeatedly.  The resulting numbers are called ''[[Multiset#Counting multisets|multiset coefficients]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

To avoid ambiguity and confusion with ''n'''s main denotation in this article,&lt;br&gt; let ''f'' = ''n'' = ''r'' + (''k'' – 1) and ''r'' = ''f'' – (''k'' – 1).

Multiset coefficients may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients by the rule
:::::&lt;math&gt;\binom{f}{k}=\left(\!\!\binom{r}{k}\!\!\right)=\binom{r+k-1}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
One possible alternative characterization of this identity is as follows:
We may define the [[falling factorial]] as
:::::&lt;math&gt;(f)_{k}=f^{\underline k}=(f-k+1)\cdots(f-3)\cdot(f-2)\cdot(f-1)\cdot f&lt;/math&gt;,
and the corresponding rising factorial as
:::::&lt;math&gt;{\color{white}{ \big|}}r^{(k)}=\,r^{\overline k}=\,r\cdot(r+1)\cdot(r+2)\cdot(r+3)\cdots(r+k-1)&lt;/math&gt;;
so, for example,
:::::&lt;math&gt;17\cdot18\cdot19\cdot20\cdot21=(21)_{5}=21^{\underline 5}=17^{\overline 5}=17^{(5)}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the binomial coefficients may be written as 
:::::&lt;math&gt;\binom{f}{k} = \frac{(f)_{k}}{k!} =\frac{(f-k+1)\cdots(f-2)\cdot(f-1)\cdot f}{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots k}&lt;/math&gt;, 
while the corresponding multiset coefficient is defined by replacing the falling with the rising factorial:
:::::&lt;math&gt;\left(\!\!\binom{r}{k}\!\!\right)=\frac{r^{(k)}}{k!}=\frac{r\cdot(r+1)\cdot(r+2)\cdots(r+k-1)}{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdots k}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Generalization to negative integers ====
For any ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\binom{-n}{k} &amp;= \frac{-n\cdot-(n+1)\dots-(n+k-2)\cdot-(n+k-1)}{k!}\\
&amp;=(-1)^k\;\frac{n\cdot(n+1)\cdot(n+2)\cdots (n + k - 1)}{k!}\\
&amp;=(-1)^k\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\
&amp;=(-1)^k\left(\!\!\binom{n}{k}\!\!\right)\;.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, binomial coefficients evaluated at negative integers are given by signed multiset coefficients.  In the special case &lt;math&gt;n = -1&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to &lt;math&gt;(-1)^k=\binom{-1}{k}=\left(\!\!\binom{-k}{k}\!\!\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if ''n'' = -4 and ''k'' = 7, then ''r'' = 4 and ''f'' = 10:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\binom{-4}{7} &amp;= \frac
{-10\cdot-9\cdot-8\cdot-7\cdot-6\cdot-5\cdot-4}
{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7}\\
&amp;=(-1)^7\;\frac{4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7\cdot8\cdot9\cdot10}
{1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7}\\
&amp;=\left(\!\!\binom{-7}{7}\!\!\right)\left(\!\!\binom{4}{7}\!\!\right)=\binom{-1}{7}\binom{10}{7}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two real or complex valued arguments ===
The binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the [[gamma function]] or [[beta function]] via
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y}= \frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(y+1) \Gamma(x-y+1)}= \frac{1}{(x+1) \Beta(x-y+1,y+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This definition inherits these following additional properties from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y}= \frac{\sin (y \pi)}{\sin(x \pi)} {-y-1 \choose -x-1}= \frac{\sin((x-y) \pi)}{\sin (x \pi)} {y-x-1 \choose y};&lt;/math&gt;
moreover,
:&lt;math&gt;{x \choose y} \cdot {y \choose x}= \frac{\sin((x-y) \pi)}{(x-y) \pi}.&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in {{Harv|Fowler|1996}}. Notably, many binomial identities fail: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{{n \choose m} = {n \choose n-m}}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{{-n \choose m} \neq {-n \choose -n-m}}&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' positive (so &lt;math&gt;-n&lt;/math&gt; negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the ''x'' and ''y'' axes and the line &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;), with the behavior for negative ''x'' having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:
* in the octant &lt;math&gt;0 \leq y \leq x&lt;/math&gt; it is a smoothly interpolated form of the usual binomial, with a ridge ("Pascal's ridge").
* in the octant &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x \leq y&lt;/math&gt; and in the quadrant &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0, y \leq 0&lt;/math&gt; the function is close to zero.
* in the quadrant &lt;math&gt;x \leq 0, y \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; the function is alternatingly very large positive and negative on the parallelograms with vertices 
:&lt;math&gt;(-n,m+1), (-n,m), (-n-1,m-1), (-n-1,m)&lt;/math&gt;
* in the octant &lt;math&gt;0 &gt; x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt; the behavior is again alternatingly very large positive and negative, but on a square grid.
* in the octant &lt;math&gt;-1 &gt; y &gt; x + 1&lt;/math&gt; it is close to zero, except for near the singularities.

=== Generalization to ''q''-series ===
The binomial coefficient has a [[q-analog]] generalization known as the [[Gaussian binomial coefficient]].

=== Generalization to infinite cardinals ===
The definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to [[Cardinal Number|infinite cardinals]] by defining:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \beta} = | \{ B \subseteq A : |B| = \beta \} |&lt;/math&gt;

where A is some set with [[cardinality]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \beta}&lt;/math&gt; will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.

Assuming the [[Axiom of Choice]], one can show that &lt;math&gt;{\alpha \choose \alpha} = 2^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; for any infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==Binomial coefficient in programming languages==
The notation &lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} &lt;/math&gt; is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for [[typewriter]]s and [[computer terminal]]s. Many [[programming language]]s do not offer a standard [[subroutine]] for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the [[APL programming language]] and the (related) [[J programming language]] use the exclamation mark:  k ! n .

Naive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
from math import factorial
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

are very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    if k &lt; 0 or k &gt; n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    k = min(k, n - k) # take advantage of symmetry
    c = 1
    for i in range(k):
        c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1)
    return c
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
(In Python, range(k) produces a list from 0 to k–1.)

[[Pascal's rule]] provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python, although it is less efficient:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    if k &lt; 0 or k &gt; n:
        return 0
    if k &gt; n - k: # take advantage of symmetry
        k = n - k
    if k == 0 or n &lt;= 1:
    	return 1
    return binomialCoefficient(n-1, k) + binomialCoefficient(n-1, k-1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example uses the recursive definition
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k+1} = \frac{n-k}{k+1} {n \choose k} &lt;/math&gt;
Rational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k+1} = \left[(n-k) {n \choose k}\right] \div (k+1) &lt;/math&gt;
The following implementation uses all these ideas
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="scheme"&gt;
(define (binomial n k)
;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion
  (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)
    (if (&gt;= i k)
      prev
     (binomial-iter n k (+ i 1) (/ (* (- n i) prev) (+ i 1)))))
;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k)
  (if (&lt; k (-  n k))
    (binomial-iter n k 0 1)
    (binomial-iter n (- n k) 0 1)))
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

When computing &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {n \choose k+1} = \left[(n-k) {n \choose k}\right] \div (k+1) &lt;/math&gt; in a language with fixed-length integers, the multiplication by &lt;math&gt;(n-k)&lt;/math&gt; may overflow even when the result would fit. The overflow can be avoided by dividing first and fixing the result using the remainder:
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose k+1} = \left[\textstyle {n \choose k} \div (k+1)\right](n-k) + {\left[{n\choose k}\ \mathrm{mod}\ (k+1)\right](n-k) \over (k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

Implementation in the C language:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c" start="1"&gt;
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;

unsigned long binomial(unsigned long n, unsigned long k) {
  unsigned long c = 1, i;
  
  if (k &gt; n-k) // take advantage of symmetry
    k = n-k;
  
  for (i = 1; i &lt;= k; i++, n--) {
    if (c/i &gt; UINT_MAX/n) // return 0 on overflow
      return 0;
      
    c = c / i * n + c % i * n / i;  // split c * n / i into (c / i * i + c % i) * n / i
  }
  
  return c;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Another way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that

:&lt;math&gt;
  {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!} = \frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)\,\Gamma(n-k+1)} = \exp(\ln\Gamma(n+1)-\ln\Gamma(k+1)-\ln\Gamma(n-k+1)),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt;&amp;thinsp;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[natural logarithm]] of the [[gamma function]] at &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. It is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using ''log_gamma'' in [[Maxima (software)|Maxima]], ''LogGamma'' in [[Mathematica]], ''gammaln'' in [[MATLAB]] and Python's [[SciPy]] module, ''lngamma'' in [[PARI/GP]] or ''lgamma'' in C, [[R (programming language)|R]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Victor A. |last=Bloomfield |title=Using R for Numerical Analysis in Science and Engineering |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4987-8662-1 |year=2016 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfEbDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]]. Roundoff error may cause the returned value to not be an integer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">In algebraic geometry, '''Bloch's higher Chow groups''', a generalization of [[Chow group]], is a precursor and a basic example of [[motivic cohomology]] (for smooth varieties). It was introduced by [[Spencer Bloch]] {{harv|Bloch|1986}} and the basic theory has been developed by Bloch and [[Marc Levine (mathematician)|Marc Levine]].

In more precise terms, a theorem of Voevodsky&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voevodsky|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies: for a [[smooth scheme]] ''X'' over a field and integers ''p'', ''q'', there is a natural isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{H}^p(X; \mathbb{Z}(q)) \simeq \operatorname{CH}^q(X, 2q - p)&lt;/math&gt;
between motivic cohomology groups and higher Chow groups.

== Definition ==
Let ''X'' be an algebraic scheme over a field (“algebraic” means separated and of finite type).

For each integer &lt;math&gt;q \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;, define
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta^q = \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[t_0, \dots, t_q]/(t_0 + \dots + t_q - 1)),&lt;/math&gt;
which is an algebraic analog of a standard ''q''-simplex. For each sequence &lt;math&gt;0 \le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_r \le q&lt;/math&gt;, the closed subscheme &lt;math&gt;t_{i_1} = t_{i_2} = \cdots = t_{i_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Delta^{q-r}&lt;/math&gt;, is called a face of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^q&lt;/math&gt;.

For each ''i'', there is the embedding
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{q, i}: \Delta^{q-1} \overset{\sim}\to \{ t_i = 0 \} \subset \Delta^q.&lt;/math&gt;

We write &lt;math&gt;Z_i(X)&lt;/math&gt; for the group of [[algebraic cycle|algebraic ''i''-cycles]] on ''X'' and  &lt;math&gt;z_r(X, q) \subset Z_{r+q}(X \times \Delta^q)&lt;/math&gt; for the subgroup generated by closed subvarieties that [[proper intersection|intersect properly]] with &lt;math&gt;X \times F&lt;/math&gt; for each face ''F'' of &lt;math&gt;\Delta^q&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\partial_{X, q, i} = \operatorname{id}_X \times \partial_{q, i}: X \times \Delta^{q-1} \hookrightarrow X \times \Delta^q&lt;/math&gt; is an effective Cartier divisor, there is the [[Gysin homomorphism]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{X, q, i}^*: z_r(X, q) \to z_r(X, q-1)&lt;/math&gt;,
that (by definition) maps a subvariety ''V'' to the [[scheme-theoretic intersection|intersection]] &lt;math&gt;(X \times \{ t_i = 0 \}) \cap V.&lt;/math&gt;

Define the boundary operator &lt;math&gt;d_q = \sum_{i=0}^q (-1)^i \partial_{X, q, i}^*&lt;/math&gt; which yields the chain complex
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \to z_r(X, q) \overset{d_q}\to z_r(X, q-1) \overset{d_{q-1}}\to \cdots \overset{d_1}\to z_r(X, 0).&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the ''q''-th higher Chow group of ''X'' is defined as the ''q''-th homology of the above complex:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CH}_r(X, q) := \operatorname{H}_q(z_r(X, \cdot)).&lt;/math&gt;

(More simply, since &lt;math&gt;z_r(X, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is naturally a simplicial abelian group, in view of the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]], higher Chow groups can also be defined as homotopy groups &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CH}_r(X, q) := \pi_q z_r(X, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;.)

For example, if &lt;math&gt;V \subset X \times \triangle^1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Here, we identify &lt;math&gt;\triangle^1&lt;/math&gt; with a subscheme of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1&lt;/math&gt; and then, without loss of generality, assume one vertex is the origin 0 and the other is ∞.&lt;/ref&gt; is a closed subvariety such that the intersections &lt;math&gt;V(0), V(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; with the faces &lt;math&gt;0, \infty&lt;/math&gt; are proper, then
&lt;math&gt;d_1(V) = V(0) - V(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and this means, by Proposition 1.6. in Fulton’s intersection theory, that the image of &lt;math&gt;d_1&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the group of cycles rationally equivalent to zero; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CH}_r(X, 0) = &lt;/math&gt; the ''r''-th [[Chow group]] of ''X''.

== Localization theorem ==
{{harv|Bloch|1994}} showed that, given an open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset X&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;Y = X - U&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;z(X, \cdot)/z(Y, \cdot) \to z(U, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;
is a homotopy equivalence. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has pure codimension, then it yields the long exact sequence for higher Chow groups (called the localization sequence).

(1980)&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Haïm Brezis]] and Thierry Gallouet, is an inequality valid in 2 spatial dimensions.   It shows that a function of two variables which is sufficiently smooth is (essentially) bounded, and provides an explicit bound, which depends only logarithmically on the second derivatives.  It is useful in the study of [[partial differential equation]]s.

Let &lt;math&gt;u\in H^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the Brézis–Gallouet inequality states that there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1077">'''COGO''' is a suite of programs used in [[civil engineering]] for solving coordinate geometry problems.

COGO was originally a subsystem of [[MIT]]'s Integrated Civil Engineering System ('''ICES'''), developed in the 1960s. Other ICES subsystems included STRUDL, BRIDGE, LEASE, PROJECT, ROADS and TRANSET, and the internal languages ICETRAN and CDL. Evolved versions of COGO are still widely used.

Some basic types of elements of COGO are points, spirals, lines and horizontal curves (circular arcs).

More complex elements can be developed such as alignments or chains which are made up of a combination of points, curves or spirals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">In [[Computational mathematics|computational]] [[Abstract algebra|algebra]], the '''Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm''' is a method for factoring [[polynomial]]s over [[finite field]]s (also called Galois fields).

The algorithm consists mainly of exponentiation and polynomial [[greatest common divisor|GCD]] computations. It was invented by [[David G. Cantor]] and [[Hans Zassenhaus]] in 1981.

It is arguably the dominant algorithm for solving the problem, having replaced the earlier [[Berlekamp's algorithm]] of 1967. It is currently implemented in many [[computer algebra system]]s.

==Overview==

===Background===
The Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm takes as input a squarefree polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. one with no repeated factors) of degree ''n'' with coefficients in a finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; whose [[irreducible polynomial]] factors are all of equal degree (algorithms exist for efficiently factoring arbitrary polynomials into a product of polynomials satisfying these conditions, for instance, &lt;math&gt;f(x)/Gcd(f(x),f'(x))&lt;/math&gt; is a squarefree polynomial with the same factors as &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so that the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm can be used to factor arbitrary polynomials).  It gives as output a polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in the same field such that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The algorithm may then be applied recursively to these and subsequent divisors, until we find the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; into powers of irreducible polynomials (recalling that the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of polynomials over any field is a [[unique factorisation domain]]).

All possible factors of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are contained within the [[factor ring]]
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\mathbb{F}_q[x]}{\langle f(x) \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;.  If we suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has irreducible factors &lt;math&gt;p_1(x), p_2(x), \ldots, p_s(x)&lt;/math&gt;, all of degree ''d'', then this factor ring is isomorphic to the [[direct product]] of factor rings &lt;math&gt;S = \prod_{i=1}^s \frac{\mathbb{F}_q[x]}{\langle p_i(x) \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;.  The isomorphism from ''R'' to ''S'', say &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, maps a polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt; to the ''s''-tuple of its reductions modulo each of the &lt;math&gt;p_i(x)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(x) &amp; {} \equiv g_1(x) \pmod{p_1(x)}, \\
g(x) &amp; {} \equiv g_2(x) \pmod{p_2(x)}, \\
&amp; {} \  \  \vdots \\
g(x) &amp; {} \equiv g_s(x) \pmod{p_s(x)},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;\phi(g(x) + \langle f(x) \rangle) = (g_1(x) + \langle p_1(x) \rangle, \ldots, g_s(x) + \langle p_s(x) \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.  It is important to note the following at this point, as it shall be of critical importance later in the algorithm:  Since the &lt;math&gt;p_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; are each irreducible, each of the factor rings in this direct sum is in fact a field.  These fields each have degree &lt;math&gt;q^d&lt;/math&gt;.

===Core result===
The core result underlying the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is the following:  If &lt;math&gt;a(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial satisfying:

: &lt;math&gt;a(x) \neq 0, \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;a_i(x) \in \{0,-1,1\}\text{ for }i=1,2,\ldots, s,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the reduction of &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;p_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; as before, and if any two of the following three sets is non-empty:

: &lt;math&gt;A = \{ i | a_i(x) = 0 \}, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;B = \{ i | a_i(x) = -1 \}, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C = \{ i | a_i(x) = 1 \}, &lt;/math&gt;

then there exist the following non-trivial factors of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\gcd(f(x),a(x)) = \prod_{i \in A} p_i(x),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\gcd(f(x),a(x)+1) = \prod_{i \in B} p_i(x),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\gcd(f(x),a(x)-1) = \prod_{i \in C} p_i(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Algorithm===
The Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm computes polynomials of the same type as &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; above using the isomorphism discussed in the Background section.  It proceeds as follows, in the case where the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; is of odd-characteristic.  The process can be generalised to characteristic 2 fields in a fairly straightforward way:  Select a random polynomial &lt;math&gt;b(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b(x) \neq 0, \pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  Set &lt;math&gt;m=(q^d-1)/2&lt;/math&gt; and compute &lt;math&gt;b(x)^m&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, we have (using our now-established notation):

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(b(x)^m) = (b_1^m(x) + \langle p_1(x) \rangle, \ldots, b^m_s(x) + \langle p_s(x) \rangle).&lt;/math&gt;

Now, each &lt;math&gt;b_i(x) + \langle p_i(x)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an element of a field of order &lt;math&gt;q^d&lt;/math&gt;, as noted earlier.  The multiplicative subgroup of this field has order &lt;math&gt;q^d-1&lt;/math&gt; and so, unless &lt;math&gt;b_i(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;b_i(x)^{q^d-1}=1&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i'' and hence &lt;math&gt;b_i(x)^m = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i''.  If &lt;math&gt;b_i(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then of course &lt;math&gt;b_i(x)^m=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence &lt;math&gt;b(x)^m&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of the same type as &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; above.  Further, since &lt;math&gt;b(x) \neq 0, \pm1&lt;/math&gt;, at least two of the sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; and ''C'' are non-empty and by computing the above GCDs we may obtain non-trivial factors.  Since the ring of polynomials over a field is a [[Euclidean domain]], we may compute these GCDs using the [[Euclidean algorithm]].

==Applications==
One important application of the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is in computing [[discrete logarithm]]s over finite fields of prime-power order.  Computing discrete logarithms is an important problem in [[public key cryptography]].  For a field of prime-power order, the fastest known method is the [[index calculus|index calculus method]], which involves the factorisation of field elements.  If we represent the prime-power order field in the usual way – that is, as polynomials over the prime order base field, reduced modulo an irreducible polynomial of appropriate degree – then this is simply polynomial factorisation, as provided by the Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm.

==Implementation in computer algebra systems==
The Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm is implemented in the [[PARI/GP]] computer algebra system as the [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html-stable/Arithmetic_functions.html#factorcantor factorcantor()] function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50451">[[File:Bob Minor peal plaque in SS Peter and Paul's Church, Chatteris, Cambridgeshire.jpg|thumb|Peal board commemorating the ringing of a [[peal]] of Bob Minor in 1910 at St Peter and St Paul Church, [[Chatteris]], Cambridgeshire.]]'''Change ringing''' is the art of ringing a set of [[tuning (music)|tuned]] [[bell (instrument)|bells]] in a controlled manner to produce variations in their striking sequences. This may be by [[method ringing]] in which the ringers commit to memory the rules for generating each change, or by [[call changes]], where the ringers are instructed how to generate each new change by calls from a conductor. This creates a form of bell music which cannot be discerned as a conventional [[melody]].

Change ringing originated following the invention of English [[full circle ringing|full-circle]] tower bell ringing in the early 17th century, when [[bell ringer]]s found that swinging a bell through a much larger arc than that required for swing-chiming gave control over the time between successive strikes of the clapper. Ordinarily a bell will swing through a small arc only at a set speed governed by its size and shape in the nature of a simple pendulum, but by swinging through a larger arc approaching a full circle, control of the strike interval can be exercised by the ringer.  This culminated in the technique of full circle ringing, which enabled ringers to independently change the speeds of their individual bells accurately to combine in ringing different mathematical permutations, known as "changes". 
 
Speed control of a tower bell is exerted by the ringer only when each bell is mouth upwards and moving slowly near the balance point; this constraint and the intricate rope manipulation involved normally requires that each bell has its own ringer. The considerable weights of full-circle tower bells also means they cannot be easily stopped or started and the practical change of interval between successive strikes is limited. This places limitations on the rules for generating easily-rung changes; each bell must strike once in each change, but its position of striking in successive changes can only change by one place.

Change ringing is practised worldwide, but it is by far most common on [[church bells]] in English churches, where it first developed. 
Change ringing is also performed on [[handbell]]s, where conventionally each ringer holds two bells, and chimed on [[carillon]]s and chimes of bells; though these are more commonly used to play conventional melodies.

Today, some towers have as many as sixteen bells that can be rung together, though six or eight bells are more common. The highest pitch bell is known as the ''treble'', and the lowest is the ''tenor''. For convenience, the bells are referred to by number, with the treble being number 1 and the other bells numbered by their pitch&amp;mdash;2,3,4, etc.&amp;mdash;sequentially down the scale. (This system often seems counter-intuitive to musicians, who are used to a numbering that ascends with pitch.) The bells are usually tuned to a [[diatonic]] major [[Scale (music)|scale]], with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) note of the scale.  Some towers contain additional bells so that different subsets of the full number can be rung, still to a diatonic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=David|title=The History and Use of Semitone Bells|url=http://www.inspirewebdesign.com/ringsof12/tower_articles/a_semitones.htm|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, many 12-bell towers have a ''flat sixth'',&lt;ref&gt;This again may seem counter-intuitive to musicians.  A ''flat sixth'' in a 12-bell ring is in fact the flattened 7th of the scale.  A ''sharp second'' bell is a sharpened 11th (or 4th in the upper, incomplete octave) of the scale.  For example, assume the bells are tuned to C-G'.  A flat sixth is B{{music|flat}} allowing F-F' to be a scale.  The sharp second is F'{{music|sharp}}, giving G-G' as the scale.&lt;/ref&gt; which if rung instead of the normal number 6 bell allows 2 to 9 to be rung as light diatonic octave; other variations are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Worcester&amp;numPerPage=10&amp;Submit=++Go++&amp;searchBells=12%2B&amp;searchAmount=%3D&amp;searchMetric=cwt&amp;sortBy=Place&amp;sortDir=Asc&amp;DoveID=WORCESTER Dove entry for]  [[Worcester Cathedral]], a twelve bell tower with 3 semi-tone bells.

[[File:English full circle bell mechanism.png|thumb|Mechanism of a bell hung for English full-circle ringing]]
The bells in a tower reside in the ''bell chamber'' or ''belfry'' usually with [[Louver|louvred windows]] to enable the sound to escape.

The bells are mounted within a ''bellframe'' of steel or wood.  Each bell is suspended from a ''headstock'' fitted on trunnions (plain or non-friction bearings) mounted to the belfry framework so that the bell assembly can rotate. When stationary in the ''down'' position, the [[centre of mass]] of the bell and clapper is appreciably below the centreline of the trunnion supports, giving a [[pendulum|pendulous]] effect to the assembly, and this dynamic is controlled by the ringer's rope. The headstock is fitted with a wooden ''stay'', which, in conjunction with a ''slider'', limits maximum rotational movement to a little less than 370 degrees. To the headstock a large wooden wheel is fitted and to which a rope is attached. The rope wraps and unwraps as the bell rotates backwards and forwards. This is [[full circle ringing]] and quite different from fixed or limited motion bells, which ''chime''.  Within the bell the ''clapper'' is constrained to swing in the direction that the bell swings.  The clapper is a rigid steel or wrought iron bar with a large ball to strike the bell.  The thickest part of the mouth of bell is called the soundbow and it is against this that the ball strikes.  Beyond the ball is a ''flight'', which controls the speed of the clapper.  In very small bells this can be nearly as long as the rest of the clapper.

Below the bell chamber there may be one or more sound chambers, (one of which is likely to house the clock mechanism if the church has one) and through which the rope passes before it drops into the ''ringing chamber'' or room. Typically, the rope's length is such that it falls close to or on to the floor of the ringing chamber. About {{convert|5|ft|m}} from the floor, the rope has a woolen grip called the ''sally'' (usually around {{convert|4|ft|m}} long) while the lower end of the rope is doubled over to form an easily held ''tail-end''.

Unattended bells are normally left hanging in the normal ("down") position but prior to being rung, the bells are ''rung up''.  In the down position, the bells are safe if a person touches them or pulls a rope.  A bell that is up is dangerous to be near, and only expert ringers should ever contemplate entering a bell chamber or touching a rope when the bells are up.  The ringer pulls on the rope and starts the bell swinging.  Each time the bell swings the ringer adds a little more energy to the system, similar to pushing a child's swing.  Eventually there is enough energy for the bell to swing right up and be left over-centre just beyond the balance point with the stay resting against the slider.

Bellringers typically stand in a circle around the ringing chamber, each managing one rope. Bells and their attendant ropes are so mounted that the ropes are pulled in a circular sequence, usually clockwise, starting with the lightest (treble) bell and descending to the heaviest (tenor). To ring the bell, the ringer first pulls the sally towards the floor, upsetting the bell's balance and swinging it on its bearings.  As the bell swings downwards the rope unwinds from the wheel and the ringer adds enough pull to counteract friction and air resistance.  The bell winds the rope back onto the other side of the wheel as it rises and the ringer can slow (or ''check'') the rise of the bell if required.

The rope is attached to one side of the wheel so that a different amount of rope is wound on and off as it swings to and fro.  The first stroke is the ''handstroke'' with a small amount of rope on the wheel.  The ringer pulls on the sally and when the bell swings up it draws up more rope onto the wheel and the sally rises to, or beyond, the ceiling.  The ringer keeps hold of the tail-end of the rope to control the bell.  After a controlled pause with the bell, on or close to its balancing point, the ringer rings the ''backstroke'' by pulling the tail-end, causing the bell to swing back towards its starting position. As the sally rises, the ringer catches it to pause the bell at its balance position.

In English-style ringing the bell is rung up such that the clapper is resting on the lower edge of the bell when the bell is on the stay.  During each swing, the clapper travels faster than the bell, eventually striking the soundbow and making the bell sound. The bell ''speaks'' roughly when horizontal as it rises, thus projecting the sound outwards.  The clapper rebounds very slightly, allowing the bell to ring.  At the balance point, the clapper passes over the top and rests against the soundbow.

In change ringing where the order the bells are struck in is constantly altered, it is necessary to time the swing so that this strike occurs with precise positioning within the overall pattern. Precision of striking is important at all times. To ring quickly, the bell must not complete the full 360 degrees before swinging back in the opposite direction, while ringing slowly the ringer waits with the bell held at the balance, before allowing it to swing back. To achieve this, the ringer must work with the bell's momentum, applying just the right amount of effort during the pull that the bell swings as far as required and no further. This allows two adjacent bells to reverse positions; the quicker bell passing the slower bell to establish a new pattern. Although ringing up certainly involves some physical exertion, actual ringing should rely more on practised skill than mere brute force. Even the smallest bell in a tower is much heavier than the person ringing it.  The heaviest bell hung for full-circle ringing is in [[Liverpool Cathedral]] and weighs {{long ton||82|0|11}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelbellfoundry.co.uk/foundry.htm |title=500 Years of History |publisher=Whitechapel Bell Foundry |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Liverpool&amp;Submit=+Go+&amp;DoveID=LIVERPL|title=Liverpool:Cathedral Church of Christ|work=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers|publisher=Central Council for Church Bell Ringers|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this colossal weight, it can be safely rung by one (experienced) ringer.

(Whilst heavier bells exist—for example [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]—they are generally only chimed, either by swinging the bell slightly or having the bell hung dead and using a mechanical hammer.)

==Changes==
The simplest way to sound a ring of bells is by ringing ''rounds''. This is a repeated sequence of bells descending from the highest to lowest note, which is from the lightest to the heaviest bell. This was the original sequence used before change ringing was developed, and change ringing always starts and ends with this sequence.

Two forms of ringing changes have developed;
#Call changes: where the conductor of the ringing commands each change.
#Method ringing: where after a word of command to start, the changes are rung from memory by the ringers.

===Call change ringing===
{{main|call changes}}
Most ringers begin their ringing career with call change ringing; they can thus concentrate on learning the physical skills needed to handle their bells without needing to worry about "methods". There are also many towers where experienced ringers practise call change ringing as an art in its own right (and even exclusively), particularly in the English county of [[Devon]].

The technique was probably developed in the early 17th century in the early days of change ringing.&lt;ref&gt;Change ringing – the history of an English Art. Vol 3,  W T Cook &amp; Cyril A Wratten. Pub Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, 1994.  P90-93  “A recent examination  of a number of call change ‘peals’ still practised at Totnes in the South Hams …including the ubiquitous ‘Sixty on Thirds’ discloses a remarkable affinity with the seventeenth century Plain Changes described by Duckworth and [[Fabian Stedman|Stedman]].  The avoidance, where possible, of repetition and the use of hunts, half-hunt and extreme changes are all features of their construction, and together suggest a basically uninterrupted descent from the earlier system, unbroken by the intrusion of change ringing..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Call change ringing requires one ringer to give commands to change the order of the bells, as distinct from [[method ringing]], where the ringers memorise the course of bells as part of a continuous pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Bell ringing- the English Art of Change Ringing. Ron Johnson. Pub Viking 1986  P 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Call change instructions====
[[File:Call changes on eight bells WQT.png|thumb|Call changes on eight bells, with the musical rows Whittingtons, Queens and Tittums. This is not a call change 'peal', but an example of calling changes for a short period for musical effect.]]In ''call change ringing'' each different sequence of the bells, known as a "row", is specifically called out by one ringer, the "conductor", who instructs the other ringers how to change their bells' places from row to row. This command is known as a "call".

The change is made at the next  "handstroke" (when the sally on the bell rope is pulled), after the call.  In calling, the conductor usually has a strategy or plan to achieve the desired progression of rows, rather than remembering each call, and an example of these is shown in the example on eight bells. Conductors can space out the calls at will, but each row is normally struck twice at least because of the difficulty of calling continuous changes.

Calls are usually of the form "X to (or after) Y" or "X and Y"; in which X and Y refer to two of the bells by their physical numbers in the tower ('''not''' by their positions in the row). All cause two bells to swap.  The first form is used for ''calling up'' and ''calling down'', and the second form swaps the two bells mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/200010.pdf| title = The Learning Curve: Call changes|work= The Ringing World |date = 6 October 2000|publisher = Central Council Education Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of calling up and down, consider the following sequence of rows, and the calls a conductor would use to call them:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: 5em"
|-
! Row
! Conductor's intent
! Call, if calling Up
! Call, if calling Down
! Call if swapping
|-
| style="text-align:center;"| 1,&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;,4,5,6
| ''to swap bells 2 and 3''
| style="text-align:center;"| "2 to 3"
| style="text-align:center;"| "3 to 1"
| style="text-align:center;"| "2 and 3"
|-
| style="text-align:center;"| 1,3,2,&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;4,5&lt;/span&gt;,6
| ''to swap bells 4 and 5''
| style="text-align:center;"| "4 to 5"
| style="text-align:center;"| "5 to 2"
| style="text-align:center;"| "4 and 5"
|-
| style="text-align:center;"| 1,3,&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;2,5&lt;/span&gt;,4,6
| ''to swap bells 2 and 5''
| style="text-align:center;"| "2 to 5"
| style="text-align:center;"| "5 to 3"
| style="text-align:center;"| "2 and 5"
|-
| style="text-align:center;"| &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;1,3&lt;/span&gt;,5,2,4,6
| ''to swap bells 1 and 3''
| style="text-align:center;"| "1 to 3"
| style="text-align:center;"| "3 to lead"
| style="text-align:center;"| "1 and 3"
|-
| style="text-align:center;"| 3,1,5,2,4,6
|
|
|
|}

Thus it can be seen how these ways of calling differ:

*In ''calling up'', The first-called bell moves after the second called bell. 
*In ''calling down'', The second-called bell moves after the first called bell.
*In ''Swapping'', the bells simply swap position
In all cases, the ringer of the bell immediately above (behind) the swapping pair must also be alert, as that bell follows a new bell after the swap. Rarer forms of change calling may name just one of the moving bells, call the moving bell by position rather than number, or call out the full change.

The example on the right shows called changes eight bells being called using the "down" system. The sequence of calls shown gives three well-known musical rows, which are Whittingtons, Queens, and Tittums.

* '''Whittingtons''' - bell 1 and 2 stay in place, other bells ascend the odds and descend the evens
* '''Queens''' - descending odd bells then descending evens
* '''Tittums''' - interspersed light and heavy bells, giving a "tee-tum, tee-tum...." effect.

===Method ringing===
{{main article|Method ringing}}
Method ringing is the continuously changing form of change ringing, and gets its name from the use of a particular ''method'' to generate the changes.

After starting in repetitive rounds, at a given command, the ringers vary the bells' order, to produce a series of distinct sequences known as ''rows'' or ''changes''. In this way [[permutation]] of the bells' striking order proceeds. For example ''123456'' can become ''214365'' in the next sequence.

The method is committed to memory by each ringer, so that only a few commands are given by the ringer in charge (the conductor). Learning the method does not consist of memorising the individual sequences, but using a variety of techniques such as:
# Memorising the path of the bell, not the numbers of the bells it strikes after. This can be by visualising a tracking line in a method diagram
# or by breaking the line into small "work" units which are joined together.
# and looking for visual signposts, such as when the ringer's bell crosses with another particular bell.

There are thousands of different methods, and Plain Bob Minor, a method on six bells, is shown in the accompanying diagram below.

====Plain hunt====
{{see also|Plain hunt}}
[[File:Plain hunt.png|thumb|The "diagram" of change ringing plain hunt on six bells. Two bells are shown.]]
In method ringing, plain hunt is the simplest form of generating changing permutations in a continuous fashion, and is a fundamental building-block of many change ringing methods. The accompanying diagram shows plain hunt on six bells. The course of two bells only are shown for clarity. Each row in the diagram shows the order of striking after each change.

Plain hunt consists of a plain undeviating course of a bell between the first and last places in the striking order, by moving a place in the sequence at each change, but with two strikes in the first and last position to enable a turn-around as the internal bells change over.

Thus each bell moves one position at each succeeding change, unless they reach the first or last position, where they remain for two changes then proceed to the other end of the sequence. All of the bells are doing this at every change, without any words of command.&lt;ref&gt;Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, "Learning plain hunt" retrieved 20.3.2017 [https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/index.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

This simple rule can be extended to any number of bells, however it repeats the sequence after twice the number of bells hunting.

====Plain Bob====
[[Image:Plain-bob-minor 2.png|200px|right|thumb|The plain course of Plain Bob Minor, shown in red. Note that, for clarity, the row at the bottom of each column is repeated at the top of the next.]]
{{Listen|filename=Bob Minor, Synthesised Bell Sounds.ogg|title=Plain Bob Minor|description=Plain Bob Minor played using synthesised bell sounds. The bells start ringing rounds followed by a plain course of Plain Bob Minor (60 of the 720 changes that are possible on six bells) and finish in rounds again.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
To enable a greater number of changes to be rung without repetition, more advanced methods were developed, many based upon the plain hunt. "Plain Bob" is one of the oldest and simplest of these, and is shown as an example above.

A "plain course" of plain bob minor is shown in [[diagrammatic form]], which has the characteristics;
#all the bells plain hunt, until the treble bell is first, and depending where they are in the pattern, they; 
#perform "dodges" in the 3-4 position 
#or perform dodges in the 5-6 positions, 
#or sit for two blows if they are just above the treble, then go first again.

The red bell track shows the order of "works", which are deviations from the plain hunt.
#3/4 down dodge
#5/6 down dodge
#5/6 up dodge
#3/4 up dodge
#make 2nds place.
And then it repeats. Each bells starts at a different place in this cyclical order. 
A dodge means just that; two bells dodge round each other, thus changing their relationship to the treble, and giving rise to different changes.

The plain bob pattern can be extended beyond the constraints of the plain course of 60 changes, to the full unique 720 changes possible ( this is factorial 6 on 6 bells, which is 1×2×3×4×5×6 = 720 changes). To do this, at set points in the sequences one of the ringers, called the "conductor" calls out commands such as "bob" or "single", which introduce further variations. The conductor follows a "composition" which they have to commit to memory. This enables the other ringers to produce large numbers of unique changes without memorising huge quantities of data, without any written prompts.

Ringers can also ring different methods, with different "works" on different numbers of bells - so there is a huge variety of ways of ringing changes in method ringing.

==Peals and quarter peals==
{{main|Peal}}
[[File:St Martins Birmingham peal board Queen Victoria Law Courts 1887.jpg| thumb| A [[peal board]] recording the details of a notable peal. Thousands of these boards exist in change ringing belfries]]

For some people, the ultimate goal of this system is to ring ''all'' the permutations, to ring a tower's bells in every possible order without repeating – what is called an ''extent'' (or sometimes, formerly, a ''full peal''). The feasibility of this depends on how many bells are involved: if a tower has ''n'' bells, they have ''n''! (read [[factorial]]) possible permutations, a number that becomes quite large as ''n'' grows.

For example, while six bells have 720 permutations, eight bells have 40,320; furthermore, 10! = 3,628,800, and 12! = 479,001,600. Estimating two seconds for each change (a reasonable pace), one finds that while an extent on six bells can be accomplished in half an hour, an extent on eight bells should take nearly twenty-two and a half hours. (When in 1963 ringers in [[Loughborough]] became the only band in history to achieve this feat on tower bells, it took them just under 18 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cccbr.org.uk/rc/long_lengths/40320_plain_bob_major.html Online peal board], from the Central Council records committee {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613195450/http://www.cccbr.org.uk/rc/long_lengths/40320_plain_bob_major.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) An extent on 12 bells would take over thirty years.

Since extents are obviously not always practicable, ringers more often undertake shorter performances. Such ringing starts and ends with rounds, having meanwhile visited only a subset of the available permutations; but ''truth'' is still considered essential — no row can ever be repeated; to do so would make the ringing ''false''. A ''[[peal]]'' is an extended performance; it must last at least 5000 changes on eight or more bells and at least 5040 on seven or fewer bells (5040 being 7!, the length of a full extent on seven). A performance of 1250 (on 8 or more) or 1260 (on 7 or fewer) changes likewise makes a ''quarter peal'' (''quarter'' for short); a peal or a quarter tends to last about three hours or 45 minutes, respectively.

==Changes on handbells==
{{main article|Handbell}}
Change ringing can also be performed on [[handbell]]s, and is quite popular in its own right. Many record-length [[peal]]s, including the longest peal ever rung, are by handbell ringers.

Normally each ringer has a bell in each hand and sit or stand in a circle (like tower ringers). The tower bell terms of ''handstroke'' and ''backstroke'' are retained, referring to an upwards and downwards ring of the bell respectively; and as in towers, the ringing proceeds in alternate rows of handstroke and backstroke.

Occasionally, a technique called ''lapping'', or ''cross and stretch'' is used. Ringers stand or sit in a straight line at a single convenient table on which the bells are placed. They pick up a bell each time they ring it, and then put it down. As the bell sequence changes, however, the ringers physically swap the bells accordingly—so the bells move up and down the table and each row is rung in strict sequence from right to left. Ringers in cross and stretch thus do not have responsibility for their own personal bell, but handle each as it comes.

Some handbell change ringers practice a hybrid of these two methods, known as ''body ringing'': ringers standing in a line each hold one bell, exchanging places in the line so that the changes sound correctly when the bells are rung in sequence from right to left.

==History and modern culture==
Change ringing as we know it today emerged in England in the 17th century. To that era we can trace the origins of the earliest ringing societies, such as the ''Lincoln Cathedral Guild'', which claims to date to 1612&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolncathedral.com/xhtml/default.asp?UserLinkID=62279 |title=Company of Ringers |accessdate=18 April 2007 |work=[[Lincoln Cathedral]] website |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029070725/http://www.lincolncathedral.com/xhtml/default.asp?UserLinkID=62279 |archivedate=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Antient{{sic}}&lt;!--sic, please don't "correct" this spelling--&gt; Society of Ringers of St Stephen'' in Bristol, which was founded in 1620 and lasted as a ringing society until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ststephens.me.uk/web/the_city.htm#ringers |title=THE ANTIENT SOCIETY OF RINGERS |accessdate=18 April 2007 |work=Website of St Stephen's, the parish church for the City of Bristol, England |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703100218/http://www.ststephens.me.uk/web/the_city.htm#ringers |archivedate=3 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recreation began to flourish in earnest in the [[The Restoration|Restoration]] era; an important milestone in the development of method ringing as a careful science was the 1668 publication by Richard Duckworth and [[Fabian Stedman]] of their book ''Tintinnalogia'', which promised in its subtitle to lay down "plain and easie Rules for Ringing all sorts of Plain Changes." Stedman followed this in 1677 with another famous early guide, ''Campanalogia.''

Throughout the years since, the [[group theory|group theoretical]] underpinnings of change ringing have been pursued by [[mathematicians]].  "Changes" can be viewed as permutations; sets of permutations constitute mathematical [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], which in turn can be depicted via so-called [[Cayley graph]]s, which in turn can be mapped onto [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].  &lt;ref&gt;Web pages:

Bells have been installed in towers around the world and many rings in the British Isles have been augmented to ten, twelve, fourteen, or even sixteen bells. Today change ringing is, particularly in England, a popular and commonplace sound, often issuing from a church tower before or after a service or wedding. While on these everyday occasions the ringers must usually content themselves with shorter "touches," each lasting a few minutes, for special occasions they often attempt a quarter-peal or peal, lasting approximately 45 minutes or three hours respectively. If a peal attempt succeeds, towers sometimes mark the occasion with a [[peal board]] mounted on the wall of the ringing chamber; at [[St Peter Mancroft]] in [[Norwich]] there is one documenting what is generally considered to have been the first true peal: 5040 changes of ''Plain Bob Triples'' (a method still popular today), rung 2 May 1715.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cccbr.org.uk/prc/pubs/bellsAndBellringing.php Bells and Bellringing]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219042105/http://www.cccbr.org.uk/prc/pubs/bellsAndBellringing.php |date=December 19, 2011 }}, from the CCCBR.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence there may have been an earlier peal (also Plain Bob Triples), rung January 7, 1690 at [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]] in the [[City of London]] by the [[Ancient Society of College Youths]].&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.ascy.org.uk/his_landmarks.htm Landmarks in the History of the Society], from the ASCY.&lt;/ref&gt; Today over 4000 peals are rung each year.

===Organisation and extent===
The [[Central Council of Church Bell Ringers]], founded in 1891, is dedicated to representing change ringers around the world. Most regional and local ringing guilds are affiliated with the council. Its journal, ''[[The Ringing World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{official website|www.ringingworld.co.uk|The Ringing World}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published weekly since 1911; in addition to news and features relating to bellringing and the bellringing community, it publishes records of achievements such as peals and quarter-peals. Ringers generally adhere to the Council's rules and definitions governing change ringing.

The Central Council, by means of its peal records, also keeps track of record length peals, both on tower bells and handbells. (The record for tower bells remains the 1963 Loughborough extent of Plain Bob Major [40,320 changes]; for handbells it was set in 2007 in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, with 72,000 changes of 100 different Treble Dodging Minor methods, taking just over 24 hours to ring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://peals.co.uk/pealdetails.asp?serno=H2007/0211 | publisher = [[The Ringing World]] | work = peals.co.uk | title = 72000 Treble Dodging Minor (100m) }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) More importantly, perhaps, along with keeping track of the first peal ever rung in a method, the Central Council controls the naming of new methods: it generally allows the first band to ring a method to name it.

Much ringing is carried out by bands of ringers meeting at their local tower to ring its bells. For the sake of variety, though, many ringers like to take occasional trips to make a ''tower grab'' ringing the bells of a less familiar tower. The setting, the church architecture, the chance to ring more bells than usual, the bells' unique tone, their ease or difficulty of ringing, and sometimes even the unusual means of accessing the ringing chamber can all be part of the attraction. The traditional means of finding bell towers, and still the most popular way today, is the book (and now internet database) ''[[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]''.

{{as of|2018|June|30}} there are 7,141 English style rings in ringable condition.  The Netherlands, Belgium, Pakistan, India, and Spain have one each.  The Windward Isles and the Isle of Man have 2 each.  Canada and New Zealand 8 each.  The Channel Isles 11.  Africa as a continent has 13.  Scotland 23, Ireland 38, USA 48, Australia 61 and Wales 227.  The remaining 6,695 (94%) are in England (including three mobile rings).  World-wide there are 985 unringable rings, 930 in England, 55 in Wales and 12 elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = County Lists from Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | accessdate = 20 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of bells===&lt;!--[[Doubles (bells)]] and [[Triples]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
Methods of change ringing are named for the number of working bells, or the bells that switch order within the change. It takes a pair to switch, and commonly the largest bell (the tenor) does not change place. For example, there may be six bells, only five of which work, allowing for only two pairs. A method of ringing for these bells would be called ''doubles''. Doubles is the most common group of methods rung in the [[United Kingdom]], since the majority of [[parish church]]es with bell towers in the UK are fitted with only six bells.

"Plain Bob Doubles" is a method rung on five bells whereas "Plain Bob Triples" is the same method rung on seven working bells.

There are two separate ways to refer to the number of bells. One way is used for even numbers, the other for an odd number.

{{clearboth}}

The name for 9 bells is pronounced "kate-ers" and comes from the French "quatres". The name for 11 bells also comes from the French and is pronounced "sinks" c.f. [[Cinque Ports]].

The names refer to the number of bells which change places in each row.  With three bells only one pair can change, and so it is singles. With seven bells there are clearly three pairs with the one left over not moving this row.

===Named changes===
Mathematical abstraction though each row may be, some rows do have a musical or melodic meaning to the listener. Over the years, a number of these have acquired names — they are ''named changes''. Both the conductors directing call-change ringing and the ''composers'' coming up with plans for a bout of method ringing sometimes like to work their favourite named changes in. The table below lists some popular named changes on eight bells; many of these names are also applicable by extension on more or fewer bells.

| Back rounds or Reverse Rounds&lt;ref&gt;Some sources (e.g., [http://www.heatons.fsnet.co.uk/Ringing/Articles/Named.htm]) define back rounds slightly differently, as 76543218.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| 15263748 ({{Audio|Tittums.ogg|listen}})
| Tittums ''(so named because of the ti-tum ti-tum sound it makes)''
|}

Such names are often humorous; for example, the sequence 14235 on five bells is called ''weasels'' because it is the tune of the refrain to the children's song ''[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]''.  This is particularly effective at the end of ringing down.  The bells are in order, and so if not chimed leave a pause, the sequence becomes: 1..4..23.5 where a dot indicates a pause.

Called changes are listed at [http://www.campaniles.co.uk/maw/callchanges.html MAW Call Change Collection]

===Striking===
Although neither call change nor method ringing produces conventional tunes, it is still the aim of the ringers to produce a pleasant sound. One of the most important aspects of this is ''good striking'' — not only should the bells never ''clash'' by sounding at the same moment, the bells should sound to a perfect rhythm, tapping out a steady beat.

It is the custom to leave a pause of one beat after every alternate row, i.e., after the ringing of each ‘backstroke’ row. This is called 'open handstroke' ringing (or open handstroke leading). In Devon, Cornwall and parts of Yorkshire, this custom is not followed when call-change ringing; instead the bells strike steadily without the pause. This latter custom is known as the ''closed-hand'' or ''cartwheel'' arrangement. However for method ringing the universal practice is to ring with open handstrokes, even in the South West of England.

Striking competitions are held where various bands of ringers attempt to ring with their best striking. They are judged on their number of ''faults'' (striking errors); the band with the fewest faults wins. These competitions are organized on regional and national levels, being particularly popular among the call-change ringers of [[Devon]] where it is customary to include the quality of the rise and lower of the bells as part of the judging criteria. Competitions for method ringers usually start "off the stay"—i.e., the bells are rung up before the competition begins.  At the annual [[National 12 Bell Striking Contest]] the bands are ringing methods and producing a different change approximately every 2.5 seconds, with a gap between bells of 0.21 seconds. To an expert ringer's ear at this level of competition a variation of a tenth of this would be discernible as a striking fault.

In 2016 readers of ''[[The Ringing World]]'' magazine wrote to insist that bell ringing was "an art and a sport", as demonstrated by regular "striking competitions." It was suggested that classification of change ringing as a sport by [[Sport England]] could save it from becoming obsolete. But the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers opposed the move, suggesting that it would jeopardise its relationship with church bodies, since bell ringing should be seen as part of [[Christian worship]], not exercise. The council's president, Chris Mew, said: "Where is the glamour of the sports field and where are the David Beckhams of the belfry?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamieson |first=Sophie |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/12161771/Ding-dong-for-bell-ringers-as-row-breaks-out-over-bid-to-be-classed-as-a-sport.html |title=Ding-dong for bell ringers as row breaks out over bid to be classed as a sport |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and television ==
The [[mystery novel]] ''[[The Nine Tailors]]'' by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (1934) contains a great deal of information on change-ringing. Her fictional [[detective]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], demonstrates his skill at ringing, and the solution to the central puzzle of the book rests in part upon his knowledge of the patterns of change ringing.

[[Connie Willis]], who frequently and overtly [[To Say Nothing of the Dog#The mystery novel|references]] Sayers in ''[[To Say Nothing of the Dog]]'' (1997), features bell ringers in her earlier novel ''[[Doomsday Book (novel)|Doomsday Book]]'' (1992); a group of American women led by a Mrs. Taylor frequently appears practising for or ringing both handbells and changes.

The British television series ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' aired an episode in the fifth season on a series of murders within a bell-ringing team, in "[[Ring Out Your Dead]]".

In the science-fiction novel ''[[Anathem]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]] (2008) changes are rung in a cloistered monastery for mathematicians to signal different ceremonies.

==English bell-ringing terms==
[[File:Half muffled bell.jpg|thumb|English style full circle bell with clapper half-muffled. A leather muffle is put over one side only of the clapper ball. This gives a loud strike, then a muffled strike alternately.
]]
* '''Back''' – at or near last place in a change.
* '''Back bells''' – the heavier bells (so tend to limit the speed).
* '''Backstroke''' (or '''Backstroke home''') – The part of a bell's cycle started by pulling on the ''tail end'' (rope end) in the tower, or with the bells raised ''in hand''; also: the position at which the back bells come into ''rounds'' order at backstroke.
* '''Baldrick''' – the leather lined metal strap from which the ''clappers'' used to be hung.
* '''Band''' – a group of ringers for a given set of bells (or for a special purpose, e.g., a "peal band")
* '''Bearings''' – the load-bearing assembly on which the ''headstock'' (and so the whole bell) turns about its [[gudgeon pins]]. Modern hanging means the bell is ''hung'' on ''ball bearings'', but were traditionally ''plain bearings''.
* '''Bob''' – the commonest type of call in most methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=John|title=Glossary of ringing terms|url=http://jaharrison.me.uk/Ringing/Glossary/B.html|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a class of ''plainmethod'' (in which either ''dodging'' takes place or some bells are not just ''hunting'' or ''place making''); also can mean (usually called the "'''Bob place'''") the appropriate point in the method (e.g. a ''lead end'') to modify the sequence of changes.
* '''Bob caller''' – someone who ''calls'' a ''touch'', but does not check the ringing as a ''conductor'' would.
* '''Bristol start''' – starting to raise in peal by adding an extra bell each time.
* '''Bump the stay''' – allow the bell to swing ''over the balance'', out of control, so the ''stay'' pushes the ''slider'' to its limit, stopping the bell.
* '''Cambridge''' – The ''right place'' ''surprise'' ''method'', one of the ''standard eight'', that is often the first learned.
* '''Canons''' – loops cast onto older bells' crowns.
* '''Cinques''' – (pronounced "sinks") methods for working eleven bells (possibly with a twelfth covering) the name deriving from the practice of swapping five pairs of bells.
* '''Clapper''' – the metal (usually cast iron) rod/hammer hung from a pivot below the ''crown'' of the bell, that strikes the ''soundbow'' of the bell when the bell stops moving.
* '''Clocking''' – causing a bell to sound while down by pulling a hammer against it (as a clock would) or by pulling the ''clapper'' against the side of the bell.
* '''Closed leads''' (also called '''cartwheeling''') – handstroke changes follow backstroke changes with no handstroke gap (unlike open leads)
* '''Come round''' – return to rounds to end a ''touch'' (e.g. "come round at ''handstroke''), or produce rounds prematurely.
* '''Cover''' – a bell (e.g. ''tenor'') ringing at the end of every ''row'', while the other bells ring a ''method''.
* '''Delight''' – a ''treble bob'' ''method'' in which an ''internal place'' is made sometimes, but no every time, the ''treble'' is going from one ''dodge'' to another ("''cross sections''").
* '''Dodge''' – Changing direction for one stroke in bell ringing (although strictly a dodge is taking a retrograde step in the middle of a portion of ''hunting''). '''Dodging practice''' is an exercise where two bells exchange places on every stroke, sometimes taught to aid learners change from ''call changes'' to ''plain hunt''.
* '''Double method''' – a ''method'' where the structure is the same if reversed.
* '''Doubles''' – a method with five working bells, possibly with a sixth ''covering''.
* '''Down''' – EITHER: when the bells are hanging with the mouth lowermost position, OR: moving towards the front (as in "hunting down").
* '''Extent''' – a touch where all possible changes are rung exactly once each; the number of such different rows is N [[factorial]], where N is the number of bells.
* '''Handstroke''' – the stroke when the sally is gripped. 
* '''Hunt''' – move one place at a time up or down (see [[plain hunt]], treble bob hunt, etc.).
* '''Firing'''-   From rounds all the bells are rung at once for a few strokes before returning to rounds.  Done at special occasions such as weddings or New Year. 
* '''Fire out''' – to ring haphazardly, either because ringers accidentally try to ring at once, or deliberately for wedding ringing.
* '''Front''' – at or near the start of a row.
* '''Front bells''' – the smaller bells which are rung first in rounds.
* '''Garter hole''' – the hole in the wheel where the rope passes through.
* '''Lead end''' – the change on which the ''treble'' is ''leading'' (ringing first) at its backstroke.
* '''Little Bob''' – a method in which the ''treble'' ''plain hunts'' between ''lead'' and fourths place.
* '''Line''' – the sequence of places a bell rings in a method, or the diagram describing the method (the convention being that the treble line is shown in red while the others are blue).
* '''Method''' – an agreed/named sequence of changes that forms a ''round block'', See ''plain course''.
* '''Muffling''' For commemorative services such as [[funeral]]s, [[memorial]] services and [[Remembrance Sunday]], the bells are rung ''half-muffled'' with a leather pad on one side of the clapper.  Very rarely ''fully muffled'' with pads both sides.. 
* '''Sally''' – the woollen bulge woven into the rope. It is both an indicator and a help with gripping. 
* '''Slider''' – A device which allows the bell to go over the balance at each end of its swing, but not to over-rotate. 
* '''Stay''' – a device that is attached to the headstock and works in conjunction with the slider.
* '''Tenor''' – the lowest pitched bell in the tower.
* '''Treble''' – the highest-pitched bell in the tower.

[[File:Edward Larsson 1885 I.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Larsson]]'s [[Cipher runes|rune cipher]] resembling that found on the [[:en:Kensington Runestone|Kensington Runestone]]. Also includes runically unrelated [[:en:blackletter|blackletter]] writing style and [[:en:pigpen cipher|pigpen cipher]].]]
In [[cryptography]], a '''cipher''' (or '''cypher''') is an [[algorithm]] for performing [[encryption]] or [[decryption]]&amp;mdash;a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is ''encipherment''. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "[[code (cryptography)|code]]", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially [[classical cryptography]].

Codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input.  There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.

Codes operated by substituting according to a large [[codebook]] which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase.  For example, "UQJHSE" could be the code for "Proceed to the following coordinates." When using a cipher the original information is known as [[plaintext]], and the encrypted form as [[ciphertext]]. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it.

The operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a [[key (cryptography)|key]] (or, in traditional [[NSA]] parlance, a ''cryptovariable''). The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.

Most modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways
* By whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size ([[block cipher]]s), or on a continuous stream of symbols ([[stream cipher]]s).
* By whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption ([[symmetric key algorithm]]s), or if a different key is used for each ([[asymmetric key algorithm]]s). If the algorithm is symmetric, the key must be known to the recipient and sender and to no one else. If the algorithm is an asymmetric one, the enciphering key is different from, but closely related to, the deciphering key. If one key cannot be deduced from the other, the asymmetric key algorithm has the public/private key property and one of the keys may be made public without loss of confidentiality.

==Etymology==
The word "cipher" (minority spelling "cypher") in former times meant "zero" and had the same origin: Middle French as ''{{lang|fr|cifre}}'' and Medieval Latin as ''cifra,'' from the Arabic '''صفر''' ''sifr'' = zero (see [[0 (number)#Etymology|Zero—Etymology]]).  "Cipher" was later used for any decimal digit, even any number.  There are many theories about how the word "cipher" may have come to mean "encoding". In fact the more ancient source of word "Cypher" is the ancient Hebrew; there are more than 100 verses in the Hebrew Bible - Torah using word "Cepher": means (Book or Story telling), and in some of them the word "Cipher" literally means (Counting)-- (Numerical description)-- Example, Book 2 Samuel 24:10, Isaiah 33:18, and Jeremiah 52:25.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

*Encoding often involved numbers.
*The [[Roman Numerals|Roman number system]] was very cumbersome because there was no concept of zero (or empty space).  The concept of zero (which was also called "cipher"), which is now common knowledge, was alien to medieval Europe, so confusing and ambiguous to common Europeans that in arguments people would say "talk clearly and not so far fetched as a cipher".  Cipher came to mean concealment of clear messages or encryption.
**The French formed the word "{{lang|fr|chiffre}}" and adopted the Italian word "{{lang|it|zero}}".
**The English used "zero" for "0", and "cipher" from the word "ciphering" as a means of computing.
**The Germans used the words "Ziffer" (digit) and "Chiffre".
**The Dutch still use the word "cijfer" to refer to a numerical digit.
**The Slovaks, similarly, also use the word "cifra" to refer to a numerical digit.
**The Serbians use the word "cifra", which refers to a digit, or in some cases, any number. Besides "cifra", they use word "broj" for a number.
**The Italians and the Spanish also use the word "cifra" to refer to a number.
**The Swedes use the word "siffra" which refers to a digit and "nummer" to refer to a combination of "siffror".
Ibrahim Al-Kadi concluded that the Arabic word ''sifr'', for the digit zero, developed into the European technical term for encryption.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi, "Cryptography and Data Security: Cryptographic Properties of Arabic", proceedings of the Third Saudi Engineering Conference. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Nov 24-27, Vol 2:910-921., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the decimal zero and its new mathematics spread from the Arabic world to Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], words derived from ''sifr'' and ''zephyrus'' came to refer to calculation, as well as to privileged knowledge and secret codes. According to Ifrah, "in thirteenth-century Paris, a 'worthless fellow' was called a {{lang|fro|'... cifre en algorisme'}}, i.e., an 'arithmetical nothing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Ifrah |title=The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer |location= |publisher=Wiley |year=2000 |isbn=0-471-39340-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cipher was the European pronunciation of sifr, and cipher came to mean a message or communication not easily understood.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim next door : the Qur'an, the media, and that veil thing, Sumbul Ali-Karamali, 2008, pp. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus codes==
{{Main|Code (cryptography)}}
In non-technical usage, a "(secret) [[code (cryptography)|code]]" typically means a "cipher". Within technical discussions, however, the words "code" and "cipher" refer to two different concepts. Codes work at the level of meaning—that is, words or phrases are converted into something else and this chunking generally shortens the message.

An example of this is the [[Commercial code (communications)|Commercial Telegraph Code]] which was used to shorten long telegraph messages which resulted from entering into commercial contracts using exchanges of [[Telegram]]s.

Another example is given by whole word ciphers, which allow the user to replace an entire word with a symbol or character, much like the way Japanese utilize Kanji (Japanese) characters to supplement their language. ex "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" becomes "The quick brown 狐 jumps 过 the lazy 狗".

Ciphers, on the other hand, work at a lower level: the level of individual letters, small groups of letters, or, in modern schemes, individual bits and blocks of bits. Some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system, using [[superencipherment]] to increase the security. In some cases the terms codes and ciphers are also used synonymously to substitution and transposition.

Historically, cryptography was split into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers; and coding had its own terminology, analogous to that for ciphers: "''encoding'', ''codetext'', ''decoding''" and so on.

However, codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to [[cryptanalysis]] and the difficulty of managing a cumbersome [[codebook]]. Because of this, codes have fallen into disuse in modern cryptography, and ciphers are the dominant technique.

==Types==
There are a variety of different types of encryption. Algorithms used earlier in the [[history of cryptography]] are substantially different from modern methods, and modern ciphers can be classified according to how they operate and whether they use one or two keys.

===Historical===
Historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as [[classical cipher]]s. They include simple [[substitution cipher]]s (such as [[Rot 13]]) and [[transposition cipher]]s (such as a [[Rail Fence Cipher]]). For example, "GOOD DOG" can be encrypted as "PLLX XLP" where "L" substitutes for "O", "P" for "G", and "X" for "D" in the message.  Transposition of the letters "GOOD DOG" can result in "DGOGDOO". These simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack, even without plaintext-ciphertext pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saltzman|first=Benjamin A.|title=Ut hkskdkxt: Early Medieval Cryptography, Textual Errors, and Scribal Agency (Speculum, forthcoming)|url=https://www.academia.edu/35034685/Ut_hkskdkxt_Early_Medieval_Cryptography_Textual_Errors_and_Scribal_Agency_Speculum_forthcoming_|journal=Speculum|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simple '''ciphers''' were replaced by [[polyalphabetic substitution]] ciphers (such as the [[Vigenère cipher|Vigenère]]) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter.  For example, "GOOD DOG" can be encrypted as "PLSX TWF" where "L", "S", and "W" substitute for "O".  With even a small amount of known or estimated plaintext, simple polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|loc=p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a [[one-time pad]] though, but the [[One-time pad#Problems|usual disadvantages of one-time pads]] apply.

During the early twentieth century, electro-mechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition, polyalphabetic substitution, and a kind of "additive" substitution.  In [[rotor machine]]s, several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution, while plug boards provided another substitution. Keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires. Although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt, other machines such as the British [[Bombe]] were invented to crack these encryption methods.

===Modern===
Modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria: by type of key used, and by type of input data.

By type of key used ciphers are divided into:
* [[symmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Private-key cryptography]]), where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and
* [[asymmetric key algorithm]]s ([[Public-key cryptography]]), where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

In a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption.  The [[Feistel cipher]] uses a combination of substitution and transposition techniques. Most block cipher algorithms are based on this structure.  In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., [[Rivest Shamir Adleman|RSA]]), there are two separate keys: a ''public key'' is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a ''private key'' is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption.

Ciphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data:
* [[block cipher]]s, which encrypt block of data of fixed size, and
* [[stream cipher]]s, which encrypt continuous streams of data

==Key size and vulnerability==
In a pure mathematical attack, (i.e., lacking any other information to help break a cipher) two factors above all count:

* Computational power available, i.e., the computing power which can be brought to bear on the problem. It is important to note that average performance/capacity of a single computer is not the only factor to consider. An adversary can use multiple computers at once, for instance, to increase the speed of [[exhaustive search]] for a key (i.e., "brute force" attack) substantially.
* [[Key size]], i.e., the size of key used to encrypt a message. As the key size increases, so does the complexity of [[exhaustive search]] to the point where it becomes impractical to crack encryption directly.
Since the desired effect is computational difficulty, in theory one would choose an [[algorithm]] and desired difficulty level, thus decide the key length accordingly.

An example of this process can be found at [http://www.keylength.com/ Key Length] which uses multiple reports to suggest that a symmetric cipher with 128 [[binary digit|bit]]s, an asymmetric cipher with 3072 bit keys, and an [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve cipher]] with 512 bits, all have similar difficulty at present.

[[Claude Shannon]] proved, using information theory considerations, that any theoretically unbreakable cipher must have keys which are at least as long as the plaintext, and used only once: [[one-time pad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">In [[algebra]], the '''continuant''' is a [[multivariate polynomial]] representing the [[determinant]] of a [[tridiagonal matrix]] and having applications in [[generalized continued fraction]]s.

==Definition==
The ''n''-th ''continuant'' &lt;math&gt;K_n(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively by

:&lt;math&gt; K_0 = 1 ; \, &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; K_1(x_1) = x_1 ; \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; K_n(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n) = x_n K_{n-1}(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-1}) + K_{n-2}(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-2}) . \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*The continuant &lt;math&gt;K_n(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by taking the sum of all possible products of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, in which any number of disjoint pairs of consecutive terms are deleted (''Euler's rule''). For example,
*: &lt;math&gt;K_5(x_1,\;x_2,\;x_3,\;x_4,\;x_5) = x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5\; +\; x_3 x_4 x_5\; +\; x_1 x_4 x_5\; +\; x_1 x_2 x_5\; +\; x_1 x_2 x_3\; +\; x_1\; +\; x_3\; +\; x_5.&lt;/math&gt;
:It follows that continuants are invariant with respect to reversing the order of indeterminates: &lt;math&gt;K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n) = K_n(x_n,\;\ldots,\;x_1).&lt;/math&gt;

*The continuant can be computed as the [[determinant]] of a [[tridiagonal matrix]]:
*: &lt;math&gt;K_n(x_1,\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)=
\det \begin{pmatrix} 
x_1 &amp; 1    &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; 0 \\ 
-1  &amp; x_2  &amp; 1 &amp;  \ddots    &amp; \vdots\\
0   &amp; -1   &amp; \ddots &amp;\ddots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots  &amp; \ddots   &amp;\ddots &amp; 1 \\ 
0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp;x_n
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;K_n(1,\;\ldots,\;1) = F_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the (''n''+1)-st [[Fibonacci number]].
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n)}{K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)} = x_1 + \frac{K_{n-2}(x_3,\;\ldots,\;x_n)}{K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Ratios of continuants represent (convergents to) [[continued fraction]]s as follows:
*: &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,x_n)}{K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)} = [x_1;\;x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n] = x_1 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle{x_2 + \frac{1}{x_3 + \ldots}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* The following matrix identity holds:
*: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n) &amp; K_{n-1}(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-1}) \\ K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n) &amp; K_{n-2}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-1}) \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} x_1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\times\ldots\times\begin{pmatrix} x_n &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
**For determinants, it implies that
**:&lt;math&gt;K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n)\cdot K_{n-2}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-1}) - K_{n-1}(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_{n-1})\cdot K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n}) = (-1)^n.&lt;/math&gt;
**and also
**:&lt;math&gt;K_{n-1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_n)\cdot K_{n+2}(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_{n+2}) - K_n(x_1,\;\ldots,\;x_n)\cdot K_{n+1}(x_2,\;\ldots,\;x_{n+2}) = (-1)^{n+1} x_{n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
A generalized definition takes the continuant with respect to three sequences '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''', so that ''K''(''n'') is a polynomial of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In this case the [[recurrence relation]] becomes

:&lt;math&gt; K_0 = 1 ; \, &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; K_1 = a_1 ; \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; K_n = a_n K_{n-1} - b_{n-1}c_{n-1} K_{n-2} . \, &lt;/math&gt;

Since ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; enter into ''K'' only as a product ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; there is no loss of generality in assuming that the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; are all equal to 1.

The extended{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} continuant is precisely the determinant of the tridiagonal matrix

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
a_1 &amp; b_1 &amp;  0  &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
c_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; b_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0  &amp; c_2 &amp; a_3 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{n-1} &amp; b_{n-1} \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; c_{n-1} &amp; a_n
\end{pmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;

In Muir's book the generalized continuant is simply called continuant.

In [[chaos theory]], the '''correlation sum''' is the estimator of the [[correlation integral]], which reflects the mean probability that the states at two different times are close:

:&lt;math&gt;C(\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{\stackrel{i,j=1}{i \neq j}}^N \Theta(\varepsilon - || \vec{x}(i) - \vec{x}(j)||), \quad \vec{x}(i) \in \Bbb{R}^m,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of considered states &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a threshold distance, &lt;math&gt;|| \cdot ||&lt;/math&gt; a norm (e.g. [[Euclidean norm]]) and &lt;math&gt;\Theta( \cdot )&lt;/math&gt; the [[Heaviside step function]]. If only a [[time series]] is available, the phase space can be reconstructed by using a time delay embedding (see [[Takens' theorem]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i) = (u(i), u(i+\tau), \ldots, u(i+\tau(m-1)),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the time series, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the embedding dimension and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the time delay.

The correlation sum is used to estimate the [[correlation dimension]].

The film is separated in nine chapters, which follow this plot:

* '''Chapter 1: Dimension two''' explains [[Earth]]'s coordinate system, and introduces the [[stereographic projection]].
* '''Chapter 2: Dimension three''' discusses how two-dimensional beings would imagine three-dimensional objects.
* '''Chapters 3 and 4: The fourth dimension''' talks about [[four-dimensional]] [[polytope]]s (''polychora''), projecting the regular ones stereographically on the three-dimensional space.
* '''Chapters 5 and 6: Complex numbers''' are about the [[complex number|square root of negative numbers]], [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]]s, and [[fractal]]s.
* '''Chapters 7 and 8: Fibration''' show what a [[fibration]] is. Complex numbers are used again, and there are [[circle]]s and [[torus|tori]] rotating and being transformed.
* '''Chapter 9: Proof''' emphasizes the importance of [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] in mathematics, and proves the circle-conservationess of the stereographic projection as an example.

'''Edward John Nanson''' (13 December 1850 – 1 July 1936) was a [[mathematician]] known for devising [[Nanson's method]] {{ref|meth}}, a variation of the [[Borda count]] using successive elimination down to the winner.

He was born in [[England]] and received his professional education at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] from 1870 to 1874.  In 1875, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Melbourne]], in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] where he immigrated.  Nanson was an election reformer and office bearer of the Proportional Representation League of Victoria who produced several booklets on election methods. He retired from his lifetime appointment in 1922. At the time of his death, he was survived by ten children from two marriages.  The Professor Nanson Prize was named in his honour, which is annually awarded to students for outstanding achievements in pure and applied mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''equipollence''' is a [[binary relation]] between [[line segment#Directed line segment|directed line segment]]s. A line segment ''AB'' from point ''A'' to point ''B'' has the opposite direction to line segment ''BA''. Two directed line segments are '''equipollent''' when they have the same length and direction.

The concept of equipollent line segments was advanced by [[Giusto Bellavitis]] in 1835. Subsequently the term '''vector''' was adopted for a class of equipollent line segments. Bellavitis's use of the idea of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] to compare different but similar objects has become a common mathematical technique, particularly in the use of [[equivalence relation]]s. Bellavitis used a special notation for the equipollence of segments ''AB'' and ''CD'': 
:&lt;math&gt;AB  \bumpeq CD .&lt;/math&gt;

The following passages, translated by Michael J. Crowe, show the anticipation that Bellavitis had of [[Euclidean vector|vector]] concepts:
:Equipollences continue to hold when one substitutes for the lines in them, other lines which are respectively equipollent to them, however they may be situated in space. From this it can be understood how any number and any kind of lines may be ''summed'', and that in whatever order these lines are taken, the same equipollent-sum will be obtained...

:In equipollences, just as in equations, a line may be transferred from one side to the other, provided that the sign is changed...
Thus oppositely directed segments are negatives of each other: &lt;math&gt;AB + BA \bumpeq 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

:The equipollence &lt;math&gt;AB \bumpeq n.CD ,&lt;/math&gt; where ''n'' stands for a positive number, indicates that ''AB'' is both parallel to and has the same direction as ''CD'', and that their lengths have the relation expressed by ''AB'' = ''n.CD''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]], "Giusto Bellavitis and His Calculus of Equipollences", pp 52–4, [[University of Notre Dame Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On a [[great circle]] of a sphere, two directed [[circular arc]]s are equipollent when they agree in direction and arc length. An equivalence class of such arcs is associated with a [[quaternion]] [[versor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(a r) = \cos a + r \sin a ,&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' is arc length and ''r'' determines the plane of the great circle by perpendicularity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">In [[mathematics]], '''exponential equivalence of measures''' is how two sequences or families of [[probability measure]]s are “the same” from the point of view of [[large deviations theory]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(M,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] and consider two one-[[parameter]] families of probability measures on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;(\mu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\nu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;. These two families are said to be '''exponentially equivalent''' if there exist
* a one-parameter family of probability spaces &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Sigma_\varepsilon,P_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;,
* two families of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;-valued random variables &lt;math&gt;(Y_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Z_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;,
such that
* for each &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;P_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-law (i.e. the [[push-forward measure]]) of &lt;math&gt;Y_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mu_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and the &lt;math&gt;P_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-law of &lt;math&gt;Z_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\nu_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;,
* for each &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;math&gt;Y_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are further than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; apart&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-[[measurable set|measurable event]], i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;\big\{ \omega \in \Omega \big| d(Y_{\varepsilon}(\omega), Z_{\varepsilon}(\omega)) &gt; \delta \big\} \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;
* for each &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0}\, \varepsilon \log P_\varepsilon \big( d(Y_\varepsilon, Z_\varepsilon) &gt; \delta \big) = - \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The two families of random variables &lt;math&gt;(Y_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(Z_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; are also said to be '''exponentially equivalent'''.

==Properties==
The main use of exponential equivalence is that as far as large deviations principles are concerned, exponentially equivalent families of measures are indistinguishable.  More precisely, if a large deviations principle holds for &lt;math&gt;(\mu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; with good [[rate function]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\mu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\nu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; are exponentially equivalent, then the same large deviations principle holds for &lt;math&gt;(\nu_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; with the same good rate function &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

The term '''''formalism''''' describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the [[arts]], [[literature]], or [[philosophy]]. A practitioner of formalism is called a '''''formalist'''''.  A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner.  For example, formalists within [[mathematics]] claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone.  This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth.  Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with "the rules of the game," as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules.  In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon [[axiomatic system]]s.

==Religion==
Formalism in religion means an emphasis on [[ritual]] and [[religious observance|observance]] over their meanings.  Within Christianity, the term [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==
{{Main|Legal formalism}}
Formalism is a school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms.  For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that "judges should apply the law, not make it."  To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, ''formalism'' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
{{Main|formalism (art)}}

Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it.  The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant.  Examples of formalist aestheticians are [[Clive Bell]], [[Jerome Stolnitz]], and [[Edward Bullough]].

===Literary criticism===
{{Main|formalism (literature)}}

In contemporary discussions of [[literary theory]], the school of criticism of [[I. A. Richards]] and his followers, traditionally the [[New Criticism]],  has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical [[rhetoric]]. 

[[Russian formalism]] was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on [[fairy tale]]s, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts&lt;!--Linked from 'Theory of art'--&gt;==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, ''Formalist poets'' may be considered as the opposite of writers of [[free verse]]. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.

See for example:
*''[[The Formalist]]'', a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*[[New Formalism]], a movement within the [[poetry of the United States]].

===Film===
{{Main| Formalist film theory}}
In [[film studies]], formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as [[editing]], shot [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise [[graphical]] (as opposed to [[diegetic]]) qualities of the image.  Strict formalism, condemned by [[Realism (arts)|realist]] film theorists such as [[André Bazin]], has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Sergei Parajanov|Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation.  These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].

==Mathematics==
{{Main|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]]. In common usage, ''a'' formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In [[economic anthropology]], formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of [[neoclassical economics]] can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''geometric quotient''' of an [[algebraic variety]] ''X'' with the action of an [[algebraic group]] ''G'' is a [[morphism of varieties]] &lt;math&gt;\pi: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brion|2009|loc=Definition 1.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:(i) For each ''y'' in ''Y'', the fiber &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt; is an orbit of ''G''.
:(ii) The topology of ''Y'' is the [[quotient topology]]: a subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset Y&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open.
:(iii) For any open subset &lt;math&gt;U \subset Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi^{\#}: k[U] \to k[\pi^{-1}(U)]^G&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism. (Here, ''k'' is the base field.)

The notion appears in [[geometric invariant theory]]. (i), (ii) say that ''Y'' is an [[orbit space]] of ''X'' in [[topology]]. (iii) may also be phrased as an isomorphism of sheaves &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_Y \simeq \pi_*(\mathcal{O}_X^G)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if ''X'' is irreducible, then so is ''Y'' and &lt;math&gt;k(Y) = k(X)^G&lt;/math&gt;: rational functions on ''Y'' may be viewed as invariant rational functions on ''X'' (i.e., [[rational-invariant]]s of ''X'').

For example, if ''H'' is a closed subgroup of ''G'', then &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is a geometric quotient. A [[GIT quotient]] may or may not be a geometric quotient: but both are categorical quotients, which is unique; in other words, one cannot have both types of quotients (without them being the same).

== Relation to other quotients ==

A geometric quotient is a [[categorical quotient]]. This is proved in Mumford's geometric invariant theory.

A geometric quotient is precisely a [[good quotient]] whose fibers are orbits of the group.

== Examples ==
* The canonical map &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}^{n+1} \setminus 0 \to \mathbb{P}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a geometric quotient.
* If ''L'' is a [[linearized line bundle]] on an algebraic ''G''-variety ''X'', then, writing &lt;math&gt;X^s_{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; for the set of [[stable point]]s with respect to ''L'', the quotient
::&lt;math&gt;X^s_{(0)} \to X^s_{(0)}/G&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;
:is a geometric quotient.
&lt;!-- A theorem of Rosenlicht says that there is an open dense --&gt;

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be an [[undirected graph]]. The graph entropy of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;H(G)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

::&lt;math&gt;H(G) = \min_{X,Y} I(X ; Y)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is chosen [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly]] from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; ranges over [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent sets]] of G, the joint distribution of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;X\in Y&lt;/math&gt; with probability one, and &lt;math&gt;I(X ; Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mutual information]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;G. Simonyi, "Perfect graphs and graph entropy. An updated survey," Perfect Graphs, John Wiley and Sons (2001) pp. 293-328, Definition 2”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
* Monotonicity. If &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; is a subgraph of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; on the same vertex set, then &lt;math&gt;H(G_1) \leq H(G_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Subadditivity. Given two graphs &lt;math&gt;G_1 = (V, E_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2 = (V, E_2)&lt;/math&gt; on the same set of vertices, the [[Graph operations#Binary operations|graph union]] &lt;math&gt;G_1 \cup G_2 = (V, E_1 \cup E_2)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;H(G_1 \cup G_2) \leq H(G_1) + H(G_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Arithmetic mean of disjoint unions. Let &lt;math&gt;G_1, G_2, \cdots, G_k&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of graphs on disjoint sets of vertices, with &lt;math&gt;n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_k&lt;/math&gt; vertices, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;H(G_1 \cup G_2 \cup \cdots G_k) = \tfrac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i}\sum_{i=1}^{k}{n_i H(G_i)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Additionally, simple formulas exist for certain families classes of graphs.
* Edge-less graphs have entropy &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Complete graph]]s on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices have entropy &lt;math&gt;\lg n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lg&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binary logarithm]].
* Complete balanced [[Multipartite graph|k-partite graphs]] have entropy &lt;math&gt;\lg k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;lg&lt;/math&gt; is the binary logarithm. In particular, complete balanced [[bipartite graphs]] have entropy &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Complete [[bipartite graphs]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices in one partition and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in the other have entropy &lt;math&gt;H\left(\frac{n}{m+n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binary entropy function]].

==Example==
Here, we use properties of graph entropy to provide a simple proof that a complete graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices cannot be expressed as the union of fewer than &lt;math&gt;\lg n&lt;/math&gt; bipartite graphs.

''Proof'' By monotonicity, no bipartite graph can have graph entropy greater than that of a complete bipartite graph, which is bounded by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, by sub-additivity, the union of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; bipartite graphs cannot have entropy greater than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;G = (V, E)&lt;/math&gt; be a complete graph on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices. By the properties listed above, &lt;math&gt;H(G) = \lg n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the union of fewer than &lt;math&gt;\lg n&lt;/math&gt; bipartite graphs cannot have the same entropy as &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed as such a union. &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5030">In [[graph theory]] and [[computer science]], the '''graph sandwich problem''' is a problem of finding a graph that belongs to a particular family of graphs and is "sandwiched" between two other graphs, one of which must be a subgraph and the other of which must be a supergraph of the desired graph.

Graph sandwich problems generalize the problem of testing whether a given graph belongs to a family of graphs, and have attracted attention because of their
applications and as a natural generalization of recognition problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Golumbic|first1=Martin Charles|last2=Trenk|first2=Ann N.
 |title=Tolerance Graphs|publisher=Cambridge|year=2004|contribution=Chapter 4. Interval probe graphs and sandwich problems|pages=63–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem statement==
More precisely, given a vertex set ''V'', a mandatory edge set ''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 
and a larger edge set ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 
a graph ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') is called a ''sandwich'' graph for the pair 
''G''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ''G''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) if 
''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''E'' ⊆ ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
The ''graph sandwich problem'' for property Π is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="gks"&gt;{{citation

:'''Graph Sandwich Problem''' for Property '''Π''':

:'''Instance:''' Vertex set ''V'' and edge sets ''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''V'' × ''V''.

:'''Question:''' Is there a graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'')  such that ''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ''E'' ⊆ ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''G'' satisfies property Π ?

The ''recognition problem'' for a class of graphs (those satisfying a property Π)
is equivalent to the particular graph sandwich problem where 
''E''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, the optional edge set is empty. 

==Computational complexity==
The graph sandwich problem is [[NP-complete]] when Π is the property of being a [[chordal graph]], [[comparability graph]], [[permutation graph]], [[chordal bipartite graph]], or [[chain graph]].&lt;ref name="gks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24340">'''Gödel's ontological proof''' is a formal argument by the mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] (1906–1978) for [[God]]'s existence. More precisely, it presupposes the notion of ''positive'' and ''negative'' properties, and proves the necessary existence of an object which each positive property, but no negative property, applies to.

The argument is in a line of development that goes back to [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109).  St. Anselm's [[ontological argument]], in its most succinct form, is as follows: "God, by definition, is that for which no greater can be conceived. God exists in the understanding. If God exists in the understanding, we could imagine Him to be greater by existing in [[reality]]. Therefore, God must exist." A more elaborate version was given by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716); this is the version that Gödel studied and attempted to clarify with his ontological argument.

Gödel left a fourteen-point outline of his philosophical beliefs in his papers.&lt;ref&gt;In: Wang, Hao. ''A Logical Journey: From Gödel to Philosophy.'' A Bradford Book, 1997. Print. p.316.&lt;/ref&gt; Points relevant to the ontological proof include
:4. There are other worlds and rational beings of a different and higher kind.
:5. The world in which we live is not the only one in which we shall live or have lived.
:13. There is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals with concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most highly fruitful for science.
:14. Religions are, for the most part, bad—but religion is not.

== History ==
The first version of the ontological proof in Gödel's papers is dated "around 1941". Gödel is not known to have told anyone about his work on the proof until 1970, when he thought he was dying. In February, he allowed [[Dana Scott]] to copy out a version of the proof, which circulated privately. In August 1970, Gödel told [[Oskar Morgenstern]] that he was "satisfied" with the proof, but Morgenstern recorded in his diary entry for 29 August 1970, that Gödel would not publish because he was afraid that others might think "that he actually believes in God, whereas he is only engaged in a logical investigation (that is, in showing that such a proof with classical assumptions (completeness, etc.) correspondingly axiomatized, is possible)."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gödel 1995, p. 388. The German original is quoted in Dawson 1997, p. 307. The nested parentheses are in Morgenstern's original diary entry, as quoted by Dawson.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel died January 14, 1978. Another version, slightly different from Scott's, was found in his papers. It was finally published, together with Scott's version, in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The publication history of the proof in this paragraph is from Gödel 1995, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenstern's diary is an important and usually reliable source for Gödel's later years, but the implication of the August 1970 diary entry—that Gödel did not believe in God—is not consistent with the other evidence. In letters to his mother, who was not a churchgoer and had raised Kurt and his brother as freethinkers,&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel argued at length for a belief in an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997, pp. 210–212.&lt;/ref&gt; He did the same in an interview with a skeptical [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], who said: "I expressed my doubts as G spoke [...] Gödel smiled as he replied to my questions, obviously aware that his answers were not convincing me."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 317. The ellipsis is Wikipedia's.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang reports that Gödel's wife, Adele, two days after Gödel's death, told Wang that "Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning."&lt;ref&gt;Wang 1996, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as "baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is ''[[Theism|theistic]]'', not [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] rather than [[Spinoza]]."&lt;ref group=note&gt;Gödel's answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p. 18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p. 112. It's also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p. 6,
who cites Wang 1987.

The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in Gödel's papers. Gödel filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. "Theistic" is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wang's and not Gödel's.

The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads "Baptist Lutheran" where Wang 1996 has "baptized Lutheran". "Baptist Lutheran" makes no sense, especially in context, and was presumably a typo or mistranscription. Wang 1987 has "rel. cong.", which in Wang 1996 is expanded to "religious congregation".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==

The proof uses [[modal logic]], which distinguishes between [[logical truth|''necessary'' truths]] and [[Contingency (philosophy)|''contingent'' truths]]. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many "[[Modal logic#Semantics|possible worlds]]" are considered. A [[truth]] is ''necessary'' if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, a truth is ''contingent'' if it just happens to be the case. For instance, "more than half of this planet is covered by water" is a contingent truth, that relies upon which planet "this planet" is. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a ''[[logically possible|possible]]'' truth.

Furthermore, the proof uses [[higher-order logic|higher-order]] (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, 2002, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a "positive property":&lt;ref group=note&gt;This assumes that it is possible to single out ''positive'' properties from among all properties. Gödel comments that "Positive means positive in the [[moral]] [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] sense (independently of the accidental structure of the world)... It may also mean pure ''attribution'' as opposed to ''privation'' (or containing privation)." (Gödel 1995), see also manuscript in (Gawlick 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; for each property ''φ'', either ''φ'' or its [[negation]] ¬''φ'' must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property ''φ'' implies a property ''ψ'' in each possible world, then ''ψ'' is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is "possibly exemplified", i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3),&lt;ref group=note&gt;Axioms 1, 2 and 3 can be summarized by saying that positive properties form a principal [[ultrafilter]].&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel shows that in ''some'' possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called "God" in the following.&lt;ref group=note&gt;By removing all modal operators from axioms, definitions, proofs, and theorems, a modified version of theorem 2 is obtained saying "∃''x'' ''G''(''x'')", i.e. "There exists an object which has all positive, but no negative properties". Nothing more than axioms 1-3, definition 1, and theorems 1-2 needs to be considered for this result.&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in ''every'' possible world.

To this end, he defines ''essences'': if ''x'' is an object in some world, then a property ''φ'' is said to be an essence of ''x'' if ''φ''(''x'') is true in that world and if ''φ'' necessarily entails all other properties that ''x'' has in that world (definition 2). Requiring positive properties being positive in every possible world (axiom 4), Gödel can show that Godlikeness is an essence of a Godlike object (theorem 3). Now, ''x'' is said to ''exist necessarily'' if, for every essence ''φ'' of ''x'', there is an element ''y'' with property ''φ'' in every possible world (definition 3). Axiom 5 requires necessary existence to be a positive property.

Hence, it must follow from Godlikeness. Moreover, Godlikeness is an essence of God, since it entails all positive properties, and any non-positive property is the negation of some positive property, so God cannot have any non-positive properties. Since necessary existence is also a positive property (axiom 5), it must be a property of every Godlike object, as every Godlike object has all the positive properties (definition 1). Since any Godlike object is necessarily existent, it follows that any Godlike object in one world is a Godlike object in all worlds, by the definition of necessary existence. Given the existence of a Godlike object in one world, proven above, we may conclude that there is a Godlike object in every possible world, as required (theorem 4). Besides axiom 1-5 and definition 1-3, a few other axioms from modal logic{{clarify|reason=They should be stated.|date=August 2016}} were tacitly used in the proof.

From these hypotheses, it is also possible to prove that there is only one God in each world by Leibniz's law, the [[identity of indiscernibles]]: two or more objects are identical (the same) if they have all their properties in common, and so, there would only be one object in each world that possesses property G. Gödel did not attempt to do so however, as he purposely limited his proof to the issue of existence, rather than uniqueness.

There is an ongoing open-source effort to formalize Gödel's proof to a level that is suitable for [[automated theorem proving]] or at least computer verification via [[proof assistant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/FormalTheology/GoedelGod&lt;/ref&gt;  The effort made headlines in German newspapers. According to the authors of this effort, they were inspired by [[Melvin Fitting]]'s book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=David|title=Scientists Use Computer to Mathematically Prove Gödel's God Theorem|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/scientists-use-computer-to-mathematically-prove-goedel-god-theorem-a-928668.html|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Most criticism of Gödel's proof is aimed at its axioms: As with any proof in any logical system, if the axioms the proof depends on are doubted, then the conclusions can be doubted. This is particularly applicable to Gödel's proof – because it rests on five axioms, some of which are questionable. A proof does not necessitate that the conclusion be correct, but rather that by accepting the axioms, the conclusion follows logically.

Many philosophers have questioned the axioms. The first layer of attack is simply that there are no arguments presented that give reasons why the axioms are true. A second layer is that these particular axioms lead to unwelcome conclusions. This line of thought was argued by [[Jordan Howard Sobel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jordan Howard Sobel | authorlink=Jordan Howard Sobel|contribution=Gödel's ontological proof | pages=241–261 | isbn=978-0262200639 | editor=Judith Jarvis Thomson |editorlink=Judith Jarvis Thomson | title=On Being and Saying: Essays for Richard Cartwright | location=Cambridge/MA &amp; London, England | publisher=MIT Press | date=Nov 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that if the axioms are accepted, they lead to a "modal collapse" where every statement that is true is necessarily true, i.e. the sets of necessary, of contingent, and of possible truths all coincide (provided there are [[accessibility relation|accessible]] worlds at all).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Formally, &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow \Box p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' implies &lt;math&gt;\Diamond p \Rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''p'' by [[indirect proof]], and &lt;math&gt;\Box p \Rightarrow \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; holds for all ''p'' whenever there are accessible worlds.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Koons,&lt;ref name="Koons.2005"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Sobel suggested that Gödel might have welcomed modal collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-19-507255-3 | url=https://monoskop.org/images/a/aa/Kurt_G%C3%B6del_Collected_Works_Volume_III_1995.pdf | author=Kurt Gödel |editor1 = Solomon Feferman | editor2= John W.

Rather, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) \Rightarrow \Box \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; should follow first from the existence of God."'' The note might indicate that Gödel was aware of his axioms implying modal collapse.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are suggested amendments to the proof, presented by [[C. Anthony Anderson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/anderson-anthony-c-22some-emendations-of-gc3b6dels-ontological-proof22.pdf | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson | authorlink=Curtis Anthony Anderson | title=Some Emendations of Gödel's Ontological Proof | journal=[[Faith and Philosophy]] | volume=7 | number=3 | pages=291&amp;mdash;303 | date=Jul 1990 | doi=10.5840/faithphil19907325}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued to be refutable by Anderson and Michael Gettings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235417020 | author=Curtis Anthony Anderson and Michael Gettings | contribution=Gödel's ontological proof revisited | editor=Petr Hájek | title=Proc.

Gödel's proof has also been questioned by [[Graham Oppy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments | author=Graham Oppy | authorlink=Graham Oppy | title=Godelian ontological arguments | journal=Analysis | volume=54 | number=4 | pages=226&amp;mdash;230 | date=Oct 1996 | doi = 10.1093/analys/56.4.226 }} &amp;mdash; [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graham_Oppy/publication/31121878_Godelian_ontological_arguments/links/0f3175343e378809ad000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail Longer version (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; asking whether lots of other almost-gods would also be "proven" by Gödel's axioms. This counter-argument has been questioned by Gettings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gettings Michael | year = 1999 | title = Gödel's ontological argument: a reply to Oppy | url = | journal = Analysis | volume = 59 | issue = 264| pages = 309–313 | doi=10.1111/1467-8284.00184}}&lt;/ref&gt; who agrees that the axioms might be questioned, but disagrees that Oppy's particular counter-example can be shown from Gödel's axioms.

Religious scholars such as [[Robert Spitzer (priest)|Fr. Robert J. Spitzer]] have accepted Gödel's proof, calling it "an improvement over the Anselmian Ontological Argument (which does not work)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magiscenter.com/proof-from-godel-theorem-shows-god-exists-through-super-axiom/|title=Godel's Theorem and the Existence of God|date=2017-04-26|work=Magis Center|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, many more criticisms, most focusing on the philosophically interesting question of whether these axioms ''must'' be rejected to avoid odd conclusions. The broader criticism is that even if the axioms cannot be shown to be false, that does not mean that they are true. Hilbert's famous [[Synthetic geometry#Logical synthesis|remark]] about interchangeability of the primitives' names applies to those in Gödel's ontological axioms (''"positive", "god-like", "essence"'') as well as to those in Hilbert's geometry axioms (''"point", "line", "plane"''). According to [[André Fuhrmann]] (2005) it remains to show that the dazzling notion prescribed by traditions and often believed to be essentially mysterious satisfies Gödel's axioms. This is not a mathematical, but merely a theological task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19453127/Homepage/downloads/GoedelExistenzNotwendigkeit.pdf | author=André Fuhrmann | chapter=Existenz und Notwendigkeit &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödels axiomatische Theologie |trans-chapter=Existence and Necessity &amp;mdash; Kurt Gödel's Axiomatic Theology | language=German | pages=349&amp;mdash;374 | editor=W.

In [[mathematics]], a '''homogeneous function''' is one with [[multiplication|multiplicative]] scaling behaviour: if all its arguments are multiplied by a [[Coefficient|factor]], then its value is multiplied by some power of this factor.

For example, a homogeneous function of two variables ''x'' and ''y'' is a real-valued [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt; f(\alpha x,\alpha y)=\alpha^k f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for some constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and all real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  The constant ''k'' is called the '''degree of homogeneity'''.

More generally, if {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''W''}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between two [[vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', and ''k'' is an integer, then ''&amp;fnof;'' is said to be homogeneous of degree ''k'' if
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; f(\alpha \mathbf{v}) = \alpha^k f(\mathbf{v}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
for all nonzero {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; &amp;isin; ''F''}} and {{nowrap|'''v''' &amp;isin; ''V''}}.  When the vector spaces involved are over the [[real numbers]], a slightly less general form of homogeneity is often used, requiring only that ({{EquationNote|1}}) hold for all &amp;alpha;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Homogeneous functions can also be defined for vector spaces with the origin deleted, a fact that is used in the definition of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on [[projective space]] in [[algebraic geometry]].  More generally, if ''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''V'' is any subset that is invariant under scalar multiplication by elements of the field (a "cone"), then a homogeneous function from ''S'' to ''W'' can still be defined by ({{EquationNote|1}}).

==Examples==
[[File:HomogeneousDiscontinuousFunction.gif|thumb|A homogeneous function is not necessarily [[continuous function|continuous]], as shown by this example. This is the function ''f'' defined by &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;xy &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;xy \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;. This function is homogeneous of degree 1, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha x, \alpha y) = \alpha f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for any real numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha, x, y&lt;/math&gt;. It is discontinuous at &lt;math&gt;y = 0, x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Example 1===
The function &lt;math&gt; f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 &lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous of degree 2:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; f(tx, ty) = (tx)^2 + (ty)^2 =  t^2 (x^2 + y^2) =  t^2 f(x,y).
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For example, suppose x = 2, y = 4 and t = 5. Then
* &lt;math&gt; f(x,y) = 2^2 +  4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20 &lt;/math&gt;, and
* &lt;math&gt; f(5x, 5y) = 5^2  ( 2^2 +  4^2) = 25(20) = 500 &lt;/math&gt;.

Any [[linear map]] {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''W''}} is homogeneous of degree 1 since by the definition of linearity
:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha \mathbf{v})=\alpha f(\mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; &amp;isin; ''F''}} and {{nowrap|'''v''' &amp;isin; ''V''}}. Similarly, any [[multilinear]] function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; ... ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''W''}} is homogeneous of degree n since by the definition of multilinearity
:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha \mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\alpha \mathbf{v}_n)=\alpha^n f(\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{v}_n)&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; &amp;isin; ''F''}} and {{nowrap|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{nowrap|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It follows that the ''n''-th [[Gâteaux derivative#Higher derivatives|differential]] of a function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''}} between two [[Banach space]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' is homogeneous of degree ''n''.

===Homogeneous polynomials===
{{main article|Homogeneous polynomial}}
[[Monomials]] in ''n'' variables define homogeneous functions  {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; ''F''}}. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=x^5y^2z^3 \,&lt;/math&gt;
is homogeneous of degree 10 since
:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha x, \alpha y, \alpha z) = (\alpha x)^5(\alpha y)^2(\alpha z)^3=\alpha^{10}x^5y^2z^3 = \alpha^{10} f(x,y,z). \,&lt;/math&gt;
The degree is the sum of the exponents on the variables; in this example, 10=5+2+3.

A homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial made up of a sum of monomials of the same degree. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;x^5 + 2 x^3 y^2 + 9 x y^4 \,&lt;/math&gt;
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Homogeneous polynomials also define homogeneous functions.

Given a homogeneous polynomial of degree ''k'', it is possible to get a homogeneous function of degree 1 by raising to the power 1/''k''. So for example, for every ''k'' the following function is homogeneous of degree 1:

:&lt;math&gt;(x^k+y^k+z^k)^{1/k}&lt;/math&gt;

===Min/max===
For every set of weights &lt;math&gt;w_1,\dots,w_n&lt;/math&gt;, the following functions are homogeneous of degree 1:
* &lt;math&gt;\min(x_1/w_1,\dots,x_n/w_n)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Leontief utilities]])
* &lt;math&gt;\max(x_1/w_1,\dots,x_n/w_n)&lt;/math&gt;

===Polarization===
A multilinear function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''V'' &amp;times; ''V'' &amp;times; ... ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''F''}} from the ''n''-th [[Cartesian product]] of ''V'' with itself to the underlying [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' gives rise to a homogeneous function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''F''}} by evaluating on the diagonal:
:&lt;math&gt;f(v) = g(v,v,\dots,v).&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting function ''&amp;fnof;'' is a polynomial on the vector space ''V''.

Conversely, if ''F'' has characteristic zero, then given a homogeneous polynomial ''&amp;fnof;'' of degree ''n'' on ''V'', the [[polarization of an algebraic form|polarization]] of ''&amp;fnof;'' is a multilinear function {{nowrap|''g'' : ''V'' &amp;times; ''V'' &amp;times; ... ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''F''}} on the ''n''-th Cartesian product of ''V''.  The polarization is defined by:
&lt;math&gt;g(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n) = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{\partial}{\partial t_1}\frac{\partial}{\partial t_2}\cdots \frac{\partial}{\partial t_n}f(t_1v_1+\cdots+t_nv_n).&lt;/math&gt;
These two constructions, one of a homogeneous polynomial from a multilinear form and the other of a multilinear form from a homogeneous polynomial, are mutually inverse to one another. In finite dimensions, they establish an isomorphism of [[graded vector space]]s from the [[symmetric algebra]] of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to the algebra of homogeneous polynomials on ''V''.

===Rational functions===
[[Rational function]]s formed as the ratio of two ''homogeneous'' polynomials are homogeneous functions off of the [[affine cone]] cut out by the zero locus of the denominator. Thus, if ''f'' is homogeneous of degree ''m'' and ''g'' is homogeneous of degree ''n'', then ''f''/''g'' is homogeneous of degree ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' away from the zeros of&amp;nbsp;''g''.

==Non-examples==

===Logarithms===
The natural logarithm &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \ln x&lt;/math&gt; scales additively and so is not homogeneous.

This can be demonstrated with the following examples: &lt;math&gt;f(5x) = \ln 5x = \ln 5 + f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(10x) = \ln 10 + f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(15x) = \ln 15 + f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is because there is no &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\alpha \cdot x) = \alpha^k \cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Affine functions===
Affine functions (the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x + 5&lt;/math&gt; is an example) do not scale multiplicatively.

==Positive homogeneity&lt;!--'Euler's homogeneous function theorem' redirects here--&gt;==
In the special case of vector spaces over the [[real numbers]], the notion of positive homogeneity often plays a more important role than homogeneity in the above sense. A function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : ''V'' \ {0} &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} is positively homogeneous of degree ''k'' if

:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha x) = \alpha^k f(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; &gt; 0}}.  Here ''k'' can be any real number. A (nonzero) continuous function homogeneous of degree ''k'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{0} extends continuously to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if {{nowrap|Re{''k''} &gt; 0}}.

Positively homogeneous functions are characterized by '''Euler's homogeneous function theorem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. Suppose that the function {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0} &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} is [[continuously differentiable]]. Then ''&amp;fnof;'' is positively homogeneous of degree ''k'' if and only if

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla f(\mathbf{x})= kf(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

This result follows at once by differentiating both sides of the equation {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(&amp;alpha;'''y''') = &amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;''('''y''')}} with respect to &amp;alpha;, applying the [[chain rule]], and choosing {{nowrap|&amp;alpha;}} to be 1.  The converse holds by integrating. Specifically, let
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle g(\alpha) = f(\alpha \mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla f(\alpha \mathbf{x})= k f(\alpha \mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
g'(\alpha)
= \mathbf{x} \cdot \nabla f(\alpha \mathbf{x})
= \frac{k}{\alpha} f(\alpha \mathbf{x})
= \frac{k}{\alpha} g(\alpha).
&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g'(\alpha) - \frac{k}{\alpha} g(\alpha) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g(\alpha) = g(1) \alpha^k&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(\alpha \mathbf{x}) = g(\alpha) = \alpha^k g(1) = \alpha^k f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;: ''&amp;fnof;'' is positively homogeneous of degree ''k''.

As a consequence, suppose that {{nowrap|''&amp;fnof;'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] and homogeneous of degree ''k''. Then its first-order partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous of degree ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. The result follows from Euler's theorem by commuting the operator &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; with the partial derivative.

One can specialise the theorem to the case of a function of a single real variable (''n'' = 1), in which case the function satisfies the [[ordinary differential equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) - \frac{k}{x} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
This equation may be solved using an [[integrating factor]] approach, with solution &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) = c x^k&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c = f(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Homogeneous distributions==
{{main article|Homogeneous distribution}}
A continuous function &amp;fnof; on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is homogeneous of degree ''k'' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(tx)\varphi(x)\, dx = t^k \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)\varphi(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
for all compactly supported [[test function]]s &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;; and nonzero real ''t''. Equivalently, making a [[integration by substitution|change of variable]] {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''tx''}}, &amp;fnof; is homogeneous of degree ''k'' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;t^{-n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(y)\varphi(y/t)\, dy = t^k \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(y)\varphi(y)\, dy&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''t'' and all test functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;;. The last display makes it possible to define homogeneity of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. A distribution ''S'' is homogeneous of degree ''k'' if
:&lt;math&gt;t^{-n}\langle S, \varphi\circ\mu_t\rangle = t^k\langle S,\varphi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all nonzero real ''t'' and all test functions &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;;. Here the angle brackets denote the pairing between distributions and test functions, and {{nowrap|&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the mapping of scalar multiplication by the real number ''t''.

==Application to differential equations==
:{{main article|Homogeneous differential equation}}
The substitution ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''/''x'' converts the [[ordinary differential equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;I(x, y)\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} + J(x,y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' and ''J'' are homogeneous functions of the same degree, into the [[Separation of variables|separable differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;x \frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}x}=-\frac{J(1,v)}{I(1,v)}-v.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Information visualization''' or '''information visualisation''' is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from [[scientific visualization]]: "it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/|title=Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers|author=[[Tamara Munzner]]|date=|website=www.cs.ubc.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|240px|Partial map of the Internet early 2005, each line represents two [[IP addresses]], and some delay between those two nodes.]]

The field of information visualization has emerged "from research in [[human-computer interaction]], [[computer science]], [[graphics]], [[visual design]], [[psychology]], and [[business methods]]. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research, [[digital libraries]], [[data mining]], financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing [[production control]], and [[drug discovery]]".&lt;ref name = "BBB03"&gt;Benjamin B. Bederson and [[Ben Shneiderman]] (2003). [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pubs/books/craft.shtml ''The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections''], Morgan Kaufmann {{ISBN|1-55860-915-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information visualization presumes that "visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways."&lt;ref&gt;James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929155753/http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm |date=2008-09-29 }}. National Visualization and Analytics Center. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.), [[statistics]] ([[hypothesis test]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], etc.), [[data mining]] ([[Association rule learning|association mining]], etc.), and [[machine learning]] methods ([[cluster analysis|clustering]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[decision trees]], etc.). Among these approaches,  information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.

== History ==
The modern study of visualization started with [[computer graphics]], which "has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in ''[[Scientific Computing (magazine)|Scientific Computing]]''. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. Scott Owen (1999). [http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperVis/visgoals/visgoal3.htm History of Visualization]. Accessed Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been devoted to the general topics of [[data visualisation]], information visualization and [[scientific visualisation]], and more specific areas such as [[volume visualization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14151">{{See also|Inversion (disambiguation){{!}}Inversion}}

In [[abstract algebra]], the idea of an '''inverse element''' generalises concepts of a [[additive inverse|negation (sign reversal)]] in relation to [[addition]], and a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] in relation to [[multiplication]]. The intuition is of an element that can 'undo' the effect of combination with another given element. While the precise definition of an inverse element varies depending on the algebraic structure involved, these definitions coincide in a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

The word 'inverse' is derived from {{lang-la|[[wikt:inversus|inversus]]}} that means 'turned upside down', 'overturned'.

== Formal definitions ==

=== In a unital magma ===
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]]). If &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;(S,*)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., ''S'' is a unital magma) and &lt;math&gt;a*b=e&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''left inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''right inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. If an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is both a left inverse and a right inverse of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''two-sided inverse''', or simply an '''inverse''', of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. An element with a two-sided inverse in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called '''invertible''' in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. An element with an inverse element only on one side is '''left invertible''', resp. '''right invertible'''. A unital magma in which all elements are invertible is called a [[loop (mathematics)|loop]]. A loop whose binary operation satisfies the [[associative law]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

Just like &lt;math&gt;(S,*)&lt;/math&gt; can have several left identities or several right identities, it is possible for an element to have several left inverses or several right inverses (but note that their definition above uses a ''two-sided'' identity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;). It can even have several left inverses ''and'' several right inverses.

If the operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is [[associative]] then if an element has both a left inverse and a right inverse, they are equal. In other words, in a [[monoid]] (an associative unital magma) every element has at most one inverse (as defined in this section). In a monoid, the set of (left and right) invertible elements is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the [[group of units]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and denoted by &lt;math&gt;U(S)&lt;/math&gt; or ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

A left-invertible element is left-[[cancellation property|cancellative]], and analogously for right and two-sided.

=== In a semigroup ===
{{main|Regular semigroup}}
The definition in the previous section generalizes the notion of inverse in group relative to the notion of identity. It's also possible, albeit less obvious, to generalize the notion of an inverse by dropping the identity element but keeping associativity, i.e., in a [[semigroup]].

In a semigroup ''S'' an element ''x'' is called '''(von Neumann) regular''' if there exists some element ''z'' in ''S'' such that ''xzx'' = ''x''; ''z'' is sometimes called a '''pseudoinverse'''. An element ''y'' is called (simply) an '''inverse''' of ''x'' if ''xyx'' = ''x'' and ''y'' = ''yxy''. Every regular element has at least one inverse: if ''x'' = ''xzx'' then it is easy to verify that ''y'' = ''zxz'' is an inverse of ''x'' as defined in this section. Another easy to prove fact: if ''y'' is an inverse of ''x'' then ''e'' = ''xy'' and ''f'' = ''yx'' are [[idempotent element|idempotent]]s, that is ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''ff'' = ''f''. Thus, every pair of (mutually) inverse elements gives rise to two idempotents, and ''ex'' = ''xf'' = ''x'', ''ye'' = ''fy'' = ''y'', and ''e'' acts as a left identity on ''x'', while ''f'' acts a right identity, and the left/right roles are reversed for ''y''. This simple observation can be generalized using [[Green's relations]]: every idempotent ''e'' in an arbitrary semigroup is a left identity for ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and right identity for ''L&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Howie, prop. 2.3.3, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; An intuitive description of this fact is that every pair of mutually inverse elements produces a local left identity, and respectively, a local right identity.

In a monoid, the notion of inverse as defined in the previous section is strictly narrower than the definition given in this section. Only elements in the Green class  [[Green's relations#The H and D relations|''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] have an inverse from the unital magma perspective, whereas for any idempotent ''e'', the elements of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; have an inverse as defined in this section. Under this more general definition, inverses need not be unique (or exist) in an arbitrary semigroup or monoid. If all elements are regular, then the semigroup (or monoid) is called regular, and every element has at least one inverse. If every element has exactly one inverse as defined in this section, then the semigroup is called an [[inverse semigroup]]. Finally, an inverse semigroup with only one idempotent is a group. An inverse semigroup may have an [[absorbing element]] 0 because 000 = 0, whereas a group may not.

Outside semigroup theory, a unique inverse as defined in this section is sometimes called a '''quasi-inverse'''. This is generally justified because in most applications (e.g., all examples in this article) associativity holds, which makes this notion a generalization of the left/right inverse relative to an identity.

=== ''U''-semigroups ===

A natural generalization of the inverse semigroup is to define an (arbitrary) unary operation ° such that (''a''°)° = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''S''; this endows ''S'' with a type {{langle}}2,1{{rangle}} algebra. A semigroup endowed with such an operation is called a '''''U''-semigroup'''. Although it may seem that ''a''° will be the inverse of ''a'', this is not necessarily the case. In order to obtain interesting notion(s), the unary operation must somehow interact with the semigroup operation. Two classes of ''U''-semigroups have been studied:&lt;ref&gt;Howie p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''I''-semigroups''', in which the interaction axiom is ''aa''°''a'' = ''a''
* '''[[Semigroup with involution|*-semigroups]]''', in which the interaction axiom is (''ab'')° = ''b''°''a''°. Such an operation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], and typically denoted by ''a''*

Clearly a group is both an ''I''-semigroup and a *-semigroup. A class of semigroups important in semigroup theory are [[completely regular semigroup]]s; these are ''I''-semigroups in which one additionally has ''aa''° = ''a''°''a''; in other words every element has commuting pseudoinverse ''a''°. There are few concrete examples of such semigroups however; most are [[completely simple semigroup]]s. In contrast, a subclass of *-semigroups, the [[Semigroup with involution#Drazin|*-regular semigroup]]s (in the sense of Drazin), yield one of best known examples of a (unique) pseudoinverse, the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]]. In this case however the involution ''a''* is not the pseudoinverse. Rather, the pseudoinverse of ''x'' is the unique element ''y'' such that ''xyx'' = ''x'', ''yxy'' = ''y'',   (''xy'')* = ''xy'', (''yx'')* = ''yx''. Since *-regular semigroups generalize inverse semigroups, the unique element defined this way in a *-regular semigroup is called the '''generalized inverse''' or '''Penrose–Moore inverse'''.

=== Rings and semirings ===
{{main|Quasiregular element}}

== Examples ==
All examples in this section involve associative operators, thus we shall use the terms left/right inverse for the unital magma-based definition, and quasi-inverse for its more general version.

=== Real numbers ===
Every [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has an [[additive inverse]] (i.e., an inverse with respect to [[addition]]) given by &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt;. Every nonzero real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has a [[multiplicative inverse]] (i.e., an inverse with respect to [[multiplication]]) given by &lt;math&gt;\frac 1{x}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;). By contrast, [[0 (number)|zero]] has no multiplicative inverse, but it has a unique quasi-inverse, "&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;" itself.

=== Functions and partial functions ===
A function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the left (resp. right) [[inverse function|inverse of a function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (for [[function composition]]), if and only if &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;) is the [[identity function]] on the [[domain of a function|domain]] (resp. [[codomain]]) of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. The inverse of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is often written &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, but [[inverse function#Note on notation|this notation is sometimes ambiguous]]. Only [[bijection]]s have two-sided inverses, but ''any'' function has a quasi-inverse, i.e., the [[full transformation monoid]] is regular. The monoid of [[partial functions]] is also regular, whereas the [[symmetric inverse semigroup|monoid of injective partial transformations]] is the prototypical inverse semigroup.

=== Galois connections ===
The lower and upper adjoints in a (monotone) [[Galois connection]], ''L'' and ''G'' are quasi-inverses of each other, i.e. ''LGL'' = ''L'' and ''GLG'' = ''G'' and one uniquely determines the other. They are not left or right inverses of each other however.

=== Matrices &lt;!-- [[Generalized inverse]] links here.  Please do not change. --&gt; ===
A [[square matrix]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with entries in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is invertible (in the set of all square matrices of the same size, under [[matrix multiplication]]) if and only if its [[determinant]] is different from zero. If the determinant of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is zero, it is impossible for it to have a one-sided inverse; therefore a left inverse or right inverse implies the existence of the other one. See [[invertible matrix]] for more.

More generally, a square matrix over a [[commutative ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is invertible [[if and only if]] its determinant is invertible in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

Non-square matrices of [[full rank]] have several one-sided inverses:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/VideoLectures/detail/lecture33.htm MIT Professor Gilbert Strang Linear Algebra Lecture #33 – Left and Right Inverses; Pseudoinverse.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* For &lt;math&gt;A:m\times n \mid m&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have a left inverse: &lt;math&gt; \underbrace{ (A^\text{T}A)^{-1}A^\text{T} }_{ A^{-1}_\text{left} } A = I_{n} &lt;/math&gt;
* For &lt;math&gt;A:m\times n \mid m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt; we have a right inverse: &lt;math&gt; A \underbrace{ A^\text{T}(AA^\text{T})^{-1} }_{ A^{-1}_\text{right} } = I_{m} &lt;/math&gt;

The left inverse can be used to determine the least norm solution of &lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;, which is also the [[least squares]] formula for [[regression analysis|regression]] and is given by &lt;math&gt;x=(A^\text{T}A)^{-1}A^\text{T}b.&lt;/math&gt;

No [[rank deficient]] matrix has any (even one-sided) inverse.  However, the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]] exists for all matrices, and coincides with the left or right (or true) inverse when it exists.

As an example of matrix inverses, consider:

: &lt;math&gt;A:2\times 3 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

So, as ''m'' &lt; ''n'', we have a right inverse, &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}_\text{right} = A^\text{T}(AA^\text{T})^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; By components it is computed as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  AA^\text{T} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
              1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
              4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
            \end{bmatrix}\cdot
            \begin{bmatrix}
              1 &amp; 4\\
              2 &amp; 5\\
              3 &amp; 6
            \end{bmatrix} =  
            \begin{bmatrix}
              14 &amp; 32\\
              32 &amp; 77
            \end{bmatrix} \\
  (AA^\text{T})^{-1} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}

                     32 &amp; 77
                   \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{54}
                   \begin{bmatrix}
                      77 &amp; -32\\
                     -32 &amp; 14
                   \end{bmatrix} \\
  A^\text{T}(AA^\text{T})^{-1} &amp;= \frac{1}{54}
                   \begin{bmatrix}
                     1 &amp; 4\\
                     2 &amp; 5\\
                     3 &amp; 6
                   \end{bmatrix}\cdot
                   \begin{bmatrix}
                      77 &amp; -32\\
                     -32 &amp; 14
                   \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{18}
                   \begin{bmatrix}
                     -17 &amp; 8\\
                      -2 &amp; 2\\
                      13 &amp; -4
                   \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1}_\text{right}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The left inverse doesn't exist, because

: &lt;math&gt;
  A^\text{T}A = \begin{bmatrix}
             1 &amp; 4\\
             2 &amp; 5\\
             3 &amp; 6
           \end{bmatrix} \cdot
           \begin{bmatrix}
             1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
             4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
           \end{bmatrix} =
           \begin{bmatrix}
             17 &amp; 22 &amp; 27 \\
             22 &amp; 29 &amp; 36\\
             27 &amp; 36 &amp; 45
           \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is a [[singular matrix]], and cannot be inverted.

'''K. V.

He was responsible for bringing to light several of the achievements of the Kerala school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sarma, whose efforts more than of anyone else brought the main texts of Kerala mathematics and astronomy to the attention of the scholarly world, had completed (in association with M. D. Srinivas, M. S. Sriram and K. Ramasubramanian) an English translation of both parts of YB at the time of his death in January 2005, but it is yet to appear."&lt;/ref&gt; He was editor of the Vishveshvaranand Indological Research Series, and published the critical edition of several source works in Sanskrit, including the [[Aryabhatiya]] of [[Aryabhata]]. He was recognised as "the greatest authority on Kerala's astronomical tradition".&lt;ref name=kch1&gt;K. Chandra Hari (25 Oct 2007) [http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/oct252007/1177.pdf Critical Evidence to Fix the Native Place of Āryabhat̟a-I], [[Current Science]] 93(8)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sarma’s father, Sri S. Krishna Aiyer, was an inspector of schools. Sarma studied chemistry and physics at Maharaja’s College of Science in [[Thiruvanathapuram]], receiving his bachelor degree in 1940. He went on to study Sanskrit at the College of Arts, receiving a master’s degree in 1942 from [[Kerala University]]. 
&lt;ref name=SGK&gt; S. G. Kantawala, "K.V. Sarma: An Academic Profile" in S. A. S. Sarma (2000) ''Bibliography of K. V. Sarma'', Sree Sarada Education Society Research Centre, Adyar, Chennai, India&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944 he began his work with [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s at [[Oriental Research Institute &amp; Manuscripts Library]] where he developed his specialties of [[manuscriptology]] and [[textual criticism]].

Sarma joined the [[Sanskrit]] department of the [[University of Madras]] in 1951 as research assistant in the New Catalogues Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/society/repository-of-a-priceless-heritage/article6189972.ece On the K. V. Sarma Research Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 he became Curator of the Vishveshvaranand Research Institute, [[Hoshiarpur]] which had a [[A Vedic Word Concordance]]. Sarma took an interest in the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] and assembled a [[bibliography]]. In 1965 [[Panjab University]] assimilated the Institute and Sarma became a Lecturer in Sanskrit with the University. He was named Reader in 1972.

Sarma's book [[A History of the Kerala School of Hindu Astronomy]] recounted the development of astronomy associated with Kerala. In the preface of ''A History'', Sarma described his research "under the supervision of Prof. Ramaswami Sastri, concurrently with my duties as the Supervising Pundit of the Cataloguing Section of the University Oriental Manuscripts Library, Trivandrum. My intimate association, later, with the compilation of the ''New Catalogus Cataloguum of Sanskrit Works and Authors'' at Madras university also proved to be of great help in my work." 

Sarma became acting-director of Vishveshvaranand Research Institute in 1975, and director/professor in 1978 when he was awarded [[Doctor of Letters]].&lt;ref name=SGK/&gt;

He retired from Panjab University in 1980, but the next year accepted the position of Honorary Professor of Sanskrit at the [[Adyar Library]] Research Center.

He was the author of thirty-five entries in the [[Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1997 | title = Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures | editor1-first=Helaine | editor1-last=Selin | editor1-link=Helaine Selin | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=sarma}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one article&lt;ref&gt;Rationale in Indian Mathematics, pages 3706,7&lt;/ref&gt; he says
:Rationale in Hindu mathematics and astronomy is expressed by the terms ''Yukti'' and ''Upapatti'', both meaning "the logical principles implied". It is characteristic of Western scientific tradition, from the times of Euclid and Aristotle up to modern times, to enunciate and deduce using step-by-step reasoning. Such a practice is almost absent in the Indian tradition, even though the same background tasks, of collecting and correlating data, identifying and analyzing methodologies, and arguing out possible answers have to be gone through before arriving at results.
Sarma then provides the exceptions: five commentaries, the [[Yuktibhasa]] and astronomical commentaries, and [[Ganita-yukti-bhasa]].

Sarma was the author of more than 60 books, and 145 research papers, in addition to other academic writing on [[Sanskrit]] and [[Indology]]. He continued publishing well into his late eighties, his last book being ''Science Texts in Sanskrit in Manuscripts Repositories of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]'', published in 2003.&lt;ref name=plofker/&gt; 

He died on 13 January 2005, having just completed English translations (see [[Ganita-yukti-bhasa]]) of the [[Yuktibhāṣā]] of [[Jyesthadeva]] and the [[Tantrasangraha]] of [[Nilakantha Somayaji]].&lt;ref name=plofker&gt;[[Kim Plofker]] (May 2005) [http://www.cshpm.org/archives/bulletins/36.pdf Obituary notice] in the ''Bulletin of the [[Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of Mathematics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirkman's schoolgirl problem''' is a problem in [[combinatorics]] proposed by Rev. [[Thomas Penyngton Kirkman]] in 1850 as Query VI in ''[[The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary]]'' (pg.48).  The problem states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk twice abreast.&lt;ref name="graham1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|Grötschel|Lovász|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A solution to this problem is an example of a ''Kirkman triple system'',&lt;ref name="mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld |title= Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem |urlname= KirkmansSchoolgirlProblem}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a [[Steiner triple system]] having a ''parallelism'', that is, a partition of the blocks of the triple system into parallel classes which are themselves partitions of the points into disjoint blocks.

There are seven non-[[isomorphic]] solutions to the schoolgirl problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cole|first=F.W.|title=Kirkman parades|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=28|year=1922|pages=435–437|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1922-03599-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these can be visualized as relations between a tetrahedron and its vertices, edges, and faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Falcone|first1=Giovanni|last2=Pavone|first2=Marco|title=Kirkman's Tetrahedron and the Fifteen Schoolgirl Problem|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=118|year=2011|pages=887–900|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.10.887}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An approach using projective geometry of three dimensions over [[GF(2)]] is given below.

==History==
The first solution was published by [[Arthur Cayley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cayley|first=A.|authorlink=Arthur Cayley|title=On the triadic arrangements of seven and fifteen things|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|volume=37|year=1850|pages=50–53|doi=10.1080/14786445008646550}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shortly followed by Kirkman's own solution&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkman|1850}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was given as a special case of his considerations on combinatorial arrangements published three years prior.&lt;ref name="kirkman1847"/&gt; [[J. J. Sylvester]] also investigated the problem and ended up declaring that Kirkman stole the idea from him. The puzzle appeared in several recreational mathematics books at the turn of the century by Lucas,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rouse Ball,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rouse Ball|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahrens,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrens|1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dudeney.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudeney|1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkman often complained about the fact that his substantial paper {{harv|Kirkman|1847}} was totally eclipsed by the popular interest in the schoolgirl problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cummings|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galois geometry==
In 1910 the problem was addressed using [[Galois geometry]] by George Conwell&lt;ref name=GMC&gt;George M. Conwell (1910) "The 3-space PG(3,2) and its Groups", [[Annals of Mathematics]] 11:60–76 {{doi|10.2307/1967582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Galois field]] [[GF(2)]] with two elements is used with four [[homogeneous coordinates]] to form PG(3,2) which has 15 points, 3 points to a line, 7 points and 7 lines in a plane. A plane can be considered a [[complete quadrilateral]] together with the line through its diagonal points. Each point is on 7  lines, and there are 35 lines in all.

The lines of PG(3,2) are identified by their [[Plücker coordinates]] in PG(5,2) with 63 points, 35 of which represent lines of PG(3,2). These 35 points form the surface ''S'' known as the [[Klein quadric]]. For each of the 28 points off ''S'' there are 6 lines through it which do not intersect ''S''.&lt;ref name=GMC/&gt;{{rp|67}}

As there are seven days in a week, the [[wikt:heptad|heptad]] is an important part of the solution:
:When two points as A and B of the line ABC are chosen, each of the five other lines through A is met by only one of the five other lines through B. The five points determined by the intersections of these pairs of lines, together with the two points A and B we designate a "heptad".&lt;ref name=GMC/&gt;{{rp|68}}
A heptad is determined by any two of its points. Each of the 28 points off ''S'' lies in two heptads. There are 8 heptads.  The [[projective linear group]] PGL(3,2) is isomorphic the [[alternating group]] on the 8 heptads.&lt;ref name=GMC/&gt;{{rp|69}}

The schoolgirl problem consists in finding seven lines in the 5-space which do not intersect and such that any two lines always have a heptad in common.&lt;ref name=GMC/&gt;{{rp|74}}

===Spreads and packing===
A [[partition (set theory)|partition]] of points into lines is called a ''{{dfn|spread}}'', and the partition of the spreads of a geometry is called a ''{{dfn|packing}}''.&lt;ref name=JH&gt;{{citation|last=Hirschfeld|first=J.W.P.|authorlink=J. W. P. Hirschfeld|title=Finite Projective Spaces of Three Dimensions|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1985|isbn=0-19-853536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} When [[J. W. P. Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld]] considered the problem in his ''Finite Projective Spaces of Three Dimensions'' (1985), he noted that a solution corresponds to a packing of PG(3,2), essentially as described by Conwell above.&lt;ref name=JH/&gt;{{rp|69}}

== Generalization ==
The problem can be generalized to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; girls, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be an odd multiple of 3 (that is &lt;math&gt;n \equiv 3 \pmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;), walking in triplets for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; days, with the requirement, again, that no pair of girls walk in the same row twice. The solution to this generalisation is a [[Steiner triple system]], an S(2, 3, 6''t'' + 3) with parallelism (that is, one in which each of the 6''t'' + 3 elements occurs exactly once in each block of 3-element sets), known as a ''Kirkman triple system''.&lt;ref name="essays"&gt;{{citation|last= Ball |first= W.W. Rouse |authorlink= W. W. Rouse Ball |author-link2=H.S.M. Coxeter |last2=Coxeter |first2=H.S.M. |title=Mathematical Recreations &amp; Essays |year= 1974 |publisher= [[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn= 0-8020-1844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this generalization of the problem that Kirkman discussed first, while the famous special case &lt;math&gt;n=15&lt;/math&gt; was only proposed later.&lt;ref name="kirkman1847"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirkman|1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete solution to the general case was published by [[D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri]] and [[R. M. Wilson]] in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ray-Chaudhuri|Wilson|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it had already been solved by [[Lu Jiaxi (mathematician)|Lu Jiaxi]] ({{lang-zh|s=陆家羲}}) in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lu|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had not been published at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many variations of the basic problem can be considered.  Alan Hartman solves a problem of this type with the requirement that no trio walks in a row of four more than once&lt;ref name="hartman1980"&gt;{{harvnb|Hartman|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; using Steiner quadruple systems.

More recently a similar problem known as the Social Golfer Problem has gained interest that deals with 20 golfers who want to get to play with different people each day in groups of 4.

As this is a regrouping strategy where all groups are orthogonal, this process within the problem of organising a large group into smaller groups where no two people share the same group twice can be referred to as orthogonal regrouping. However, this term is currently not commonly used and evidence suggests that there is no common name for the process.

The [[Oberwolfach problem]], of decomposing a [[complete graph]] into edge-disjoint copies of a given [[regular graph|2-regular graph]], also generalizes Kirkman's schoolgirl problem. Kirkman's problem is the special case of the Oberwolfach problem in which the 2-regular graph consists of five disjoint triangles.{{sfnp|Bryant|Danziger|2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="758">'''LEX''' is a [[stream cipher]] based on the round transformation of [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]].  LEX provides the same key agility and short message block performance as AES while handling longer messages faster than AES.  In addition, it has the same hardware and software flexibility as AES, and hardware implementations of LEX can share resources with AES implementations. 

Designed by [[Alex Biryukov]], LEX is a Phase 2 Focus candidate for the [[eSTREAM]] project. It is not patented.

A new revision of LEX protects against a [[slide attack]] found in an earlier version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">In [[topology]], '''Lebesgue's number lemma''', named after [[Henri Lebesgue]], is a useful tool in the study of [[compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s. It states:

:If the metric space &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; is compact and an [[open cover]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is given, then there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that every [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; having [[diameter]] less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some member of the cover.

Such a number &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''Lebesgue number''' of this cover. The notion of a Lebesgue number itself is useful in other applications as well.

== Proof ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; be an open cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact we can extract a finite subcover &lt;math&gt;\{A_1, \dots, A_n\} \subseteq \mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;.
If any one of the &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s equals &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then any &lt;math&gt; \delta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; will serve as a Lebesgue number.
Otherwise for each &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1, \dots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;C_i := X \setminus A_i&lt;/math&gt;, note that &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, and define a function &lt;math&gt;f : X \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f(x) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d(x,C_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on a compact set, it attains a minimum &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 
The key observation is that &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of diameter less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq B_\delta(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B_\delta(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;  centered at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; (namely, one can choose as &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; any point in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). Since &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)\geq \delta&lt;/math&gt; there must exist at least one &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d(x_0,C_i)\geq \delta&lt;/math&gt;. But this means that &lt;math&gt;B_\delta(x_0)\subseteq A_i&lt;/math&gt; and so, in particular, &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10087">In [[computability theory]], an '''[[undecidable problem]]''' is a type of [[computational problem]] that requires a yes/no answer, but where there cannot possibly be any computer program that always gives the correct answer; that is, any possible program would sometimes give the wrong answer or run forever without giving any answer. More formally, an undecidable problem is a problem whose language is not a [[recursive set]]; see the article [[Decidable language]].  There are [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many undecidable problems, so the list below is necessarily incomplete. Though undecidable languages are not recursive languages, they may be [[subset]]s of [[Alan Turing|Turing]] recognizable languages: i.e., such undecidable languages may be recursively enumerable.

Many, if not most, undecidable problems in mathematics can be posed as [[word problem (mathematics)|word problems]]: determining when two distinct strings of symbols (encoding some mathematical concept or object) represent the same object or not.

For undecidability in axiomatic mathematics, see [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC]].

==Problems in [[logic]]==
* Hilbert's [[Entscheidungsproblem]].
* [[Type inference]] and [[type checking]] for the second-order [[lambda calculus]] (or equivalent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = J. B. | last = Wells | title = Typability and type checking in the second-order lambda-calculus are equivalent and undecidable | citeseerx = 10.1.1.31.3590 | journal = Tech. Rep. 93-011 | publisher = Comput. Sci. Dept., Boston Univ. | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determining whether a first-order sentence in the [[logic of graphs]] can be realized by a finite undirected graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trahtenbrot | first = B. A. | authorlink = Boris Trakhtenbrot | journal = Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR (N.S.) | mr = 0033784 | pages = 569–572 | title = The impossibility of an algorithm for the decision problem for finite domains | volume = 70 | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trakhtenbrot's theorem]] - Finite satisfiability is undecidable.
* Satisfiability of first order [[Horn clause]]s

==Problems about [[abstract machine]]s==

* The [[halting problem]] (determining whether a [[Turing machine]] halts on a given input) and the [[mortality (computability theory)|mortality problem]] (determining whether it halts for every starting configuration).
* Determining whether a Turing machine is a [[Busy beaver#Non-computability of Σ|busy beaver champion]] (i.e., is the longest-running among halting Turing machines with the same number of states).
* [[Rice's theorem]] states that for all nontrivial properties of partial functions, it is undecidable whether a given machine computes a partial function with that property.
* The halting problem for a [[Minsky machine]]: a finite-state automaton with no inputs and two counters that can be incremented, decremented, and tested for zero.
* Universality of a Nondeterministic [[Pushdown automaton]]: determining whether all words are accepted.

==Problems about [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]==

* The [[mortal matrix problem]]: determining, given a finite set of ''n'' × ''n'' matrices with integer entries, whether they can be multiplied in some order, possibly with repetition, to yield the [[zero matrix]]. This is known to be undecidable for a set of six or more 3 × 3 matrices, or a set of two 15 × 15 matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1404.0644|last1=Cassaigne|first1=Julien|title=Tighter Undecidability Bounds for Matrix Mortality, Zero-in-the-Corner Problems, and More|last2=Halava|first2=Vesa|last3=Harju|first3=Tero|last4=Nicolas|first4=Francois|class=cs.DM|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determining whether a finite set of upper triangular 3 × 3 matrices with nonnegative integer entries generates a free [[semigroup]].
* Determining whether two finitely generated subsemigroups of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') have a common element.

==Problems in [[combinatorial group theory]]==

* The [[word problem for groups]].
* The [[conjugacy problem]].
* The [[group isomorphism problem]].

==Problems in [[topology]]==

* Determining whether two finite [[simplicial complex]]es are [[homeomorphic]].
* Determining whether a finite [[simplicial complex]] is (homeomorphic to) a [[manifold]].
* Determining whether the [[fundamental group]] of a finite simplicial complex is trivial.

==Problems in analysis==
* For functions in certain classes, the problem of determining: whether two functions are equal, known as the zero-equivalence problem (see [[Richardson's theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith O. Geddes, Stephen R. Czapor, George Labahn, ''Algorithms for Computer Algebra'', {{isbn|0585332479}}, 2007, p. 81ff&lt;/ref&gt; the zeroes of a function; whether the indefinite integral of a function is also in the class.&lt;ref name="stall"/&gt; Of course, some subclasses of these problems are decidable. For example, there is an effective decision procedure for the elementary integration of any function which belongs to a field of transcendental elementary functions, the [[Risch algorithm]].) 
* "The problem of deciding whether the definite contour multiple integral of an elementary meromorphic function is zero over an everywhere real analytic manifold on which it is analytic", a consequence of the [[Matiyasevich's theorem|MRDP theorem]] resolving [[Hilbert's tenth problem]].&lt;ref name="stall"&gt;Stallworth, Daniel T. and Fred W. Roush [http://www.ams.org/proc/1997-125-07/S0002-9939-97-03822-7/S0002-9939-97-03822-7.pdf An Undecidable Property of Definite Integrals] ''Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society'' Volume 125, Number 7, July 1997, Pages 2147-2148&lt;/ref&gt;

* Given two context-free grammars, determining whether they generate the same set of strings, or whether one generates a subset of the strings generated by the other, or whether there is any string at all that both generate.
* Determining whether a given initial point with rational coordinates is periodic, or whether it lies in the basin of attraction of a given open set, in a piecewise-linear iterated map in two dimensions, or in a piecewise-linear flow in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Unpredictability and undecidability in dynamical systems|url=http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~simhaweb/iisc/Moore.pdf|first=Cristopher|last=Moore|authorlink=Cristopher Moore|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=64|issue=20|year=1990|pages=2354–2357|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.64.2354|pmid=10041691|bibcode=1990PhRvL..64.2354M}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hungarian name|Lovász László}}
'''László Lovász''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈlaːsloː ˈlovaːs}}; born March 9, 1948) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician, best known for his work in [[combinatorics]], for which he was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics|Wolf Prize]] and the [[Knuth Prize]] in 1999, and the [[Kyoto Prize]] in 2010. He is the current president of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He served as president of the [[International Mathematical Union]] between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathunion.org/Organization/EC/2007-2010.html The IMU Executive Committee 2007-2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229013327/http://www.mathunion.org/Organization/EC/2007-2010.html |date=2007-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lovász was born on March 9, 1948 in the city of [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;Sooyoung Chang (2010) . ''Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians'', Hungarian School: pp. 245-264. {{ISBN|978-981-4282-29-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hier.iif.hu/hu/letoltes.php?fid=tartalomsor/1399 Educatio – "Interjú Lovász László matematikussal" (Biró Zsuzsanna Hanna) 2009/2 valóság pp. 219–240.] (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt; When Lovász was 14 he found a mathematical article written by [[Paul Erdős]] that fascinated him. One year later, he personally became acquainted with Erdős. They became friends and talked about mathematics and other subjects. This experience greatly inspired Lovász in searching for more knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Lovasz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Lovász won gold medals at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (in 1964, 1965, 1966 with two special prizes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=9852 Laszlo Lovasz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovász received his [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidate of Sciences (C.Sc.)]] degree in 1970 at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].  His advisor was [[Tibor Gallai]].

Until 1975, Lovász worked at [[Eötvös Loránd University]], between 1975–1982, he led the Department of Geometry at the [[University of Szeged]]. In 1982, he returned to the Eötvös University, where he created the Department of Computer Science. The former and current scientists of the department include [[György Elekes]], [[András Frank]], [[József Beck]], [[Éva Tardos]], [[András Hajnal]], [[Lajos Pósa (mathematician)|Lajos Pósa]], [[Miklós Simonovits]], [[Tamás Szőnyi]].

Lovász was a professor at [[Yale University]] during the 1990s and was a collaborative member of the [[Microsoft Research Center]] until 2006. He returned to [[Eötvös Loránd University]], [[Budapest]], where he was the director of the Mathematical Institute (2006–2011).

In 2014 he was elected the President of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (MTA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140512064619/http://mta.hu/mta_hirei/lovasz_laszlo-a-magyar-tudomanyos-akademia-uj-elnoke-134141// Magyar Tudományos Akadémia: "Lovász László a Magyar Tudományos Akadémia új elnöke", 2014/05/06] (in Hungarian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovász is married to [[Katalin Vesztergombi]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Hungarian|url=http://nol.hu/kultura/20130712-edes_teher__zseni_az_apam-1399403|title=Édes teher: zseni az apám (interview with László Lovász)|magazine=NOL|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as high school students, he and Vesztergombi both participated in the same program for students gifted in mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Teaching Gifted Learners in STEM Subjects: Developing Talent in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|series=Routledge Research in Achievement and Gifted Education|editor1-first=Keith S.|editor1-last=Taber|editor2-first=Manabu|editor2-last=Sumida|editor3-first=Lynne|editor3-last=McClure|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781317448969|pages=92–93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAgqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Vesztergombi continues to be one of Lovász's frequent research collaborators.

==Awards==
Lovász was awarded the [[Brouwer Medal]] in 1993, the [[Wolf Prize]] in 1999, the [[János Bolyai Creative Prize|Bolyai prize]] in 2007 and Hungary's Széchenyi Grand Prize (2008). He received the Advanced Grant of the [[European Research Council]] (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14128">In the mathematical theory of [[matroid]]s, a '''matroid representation''' is a family of [[vector space|vectors]] whose [[linear independence]] relation is the same as that of a given matroid. Matroid representations are analogous to [[group representation]]s; both types of representation provide abstract algebraic structures (matroids and groups respectively) with concrete descriptions in terms of [[linear algebra]].

A '''linear matroid''' is a matroid that has a representation, and an ''F''-'''linear matroid''' (for a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'') is a matroid that has a representation using a [[vector space]] over ''F''. '''Matroid representation theory''' studies the existence of representations and the properties of linear matroids.

==Definitions==
A (finite) [[matroid]] &lt;math&gt;(E,\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a [[finite set]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (the elements of the matroid) and a [[family of sets|family]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the subsets of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, called the independent sets of the matroid. It is required to satisfy the properties that every subset of an independent set is itself independent, and that if one independent set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is larger than a second independent set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; then there exists an element &lt;math&gt;x\in A\setminus B&lt;/math&gt; that can be added to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; to form a larger independent set. One of the key motivating examples in the formulation of matroids was the notion of [[linear independence]] of vectors in a [[vector space]]: if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set or multiset of vectors, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the family of linearly independent subsets of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(E,\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; is a matroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

More generally, if &lt;math&gt;(E,\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; is any matroid, then a representation of &lt;math&gt;(E,\mathcal{I})&lt;/math&gt; may be defined as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that maps &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, with the property that a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is independent if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent. A matroid with a representation is called a linear matroid, and if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over field ''F'' then the matroid is called an ''F''-linear matroid. Thus, the linear matroids are exactly the matroids that are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the matroids defined from sets or multisets of vectors. The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will be [[bijection|one-to-one]] if and only if the underlying matroid is simple (having no two-element dependent sets).
Matroid representations may also be described more concretely using [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a field ''F'', with one column per matroid element and with a set of elements being independent in the matroid if and only if the corresponding set of matrix columns is linearly independent.
The [[matroid rank|rank function]] of a linear matroid is given by the [[rank (linear algebra)|matrix rank]] of submatrices of this matrix, or equivalently by the [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] of the [[linear span]] of subsets of vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization of linear matroids==
[[File:Vamos matroid.svg|thumb|The [[Vámos matroid]], not linear over any field]]
[[File:Perles configuration.svg|thumb|left|The [[Perles configuration]], linear over the reals but not the rationals]]
Not every matroid is linear; the eight-element [[Vámos matroid]] is one of the smallest matroids that is unrepresentable over all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 170–172, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; If a matroid is linear, it may be representable over some but not all fields.
For instance, the nine-element rank-three matroid defined by the [[Perles configuration]] is representable over the [[real number]]s but not over the [[rational number]]s.

[[Binary matroid]]s are the matroids that can be represented over the [[finite field]] [[GF(2)]]; they are exactly the matroids that do not have the [[uniform matroid]] &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_4&lt;/math&gt; as a [[matroid minor|minor]].&lt;ref name="tutte58"&gt;{{citation

[[Rota's conjecture]] states that, for every finite field ''F'', the ''F''-linear matroids can be characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors, similar to the characterizations described above for the binary and regular matroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Field of definition==
For every [[algebraic number field]] and every [[finite field]] ''F'' there is a matroid ''M'' for which ''F'' is the minimal subfield of its algebraic closure over which ''M'' can be represented: ''M'' can be taken to be of rank 3.&lt;ref name=Wh8718&gt;{{citation | editor-last=White | editor-first=Neil | title=Combinatorial geometries | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications | volume=29 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1987 | isbn=0-521-33339-3 | zbl=0626.00007 | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic set==
The '''characteristic set''' of a linear matroid is defined as the set of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristics]] of the fields over which it is linear.&lt;ref name=Ing71&gt;{{citation | zbl=0222.05025 | last=Ingleton | first=A.W. | chapter=Representation of matroids | pages=149–167 | title=Combinatorial mathematics and its applications.

If the characteristic set of a matroid is infinite, it contains zero; and if it contains zero then it contains all but finitely many primes.&lt;ref name=Ox225&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the only possible characteristic sets are finite sets not containing zero, and cofinite sets containing zero.&lt;ref name=Ox226&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, all such sets do occur.&lt;ref name=Ox228&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related classes of matroids==
A [[uniform matroid]] &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, and its independent sets consist of all subsets of up to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the elements. Uniform matroids may be represented by sets of vectors in [[general position]] in an &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space. The field of representation must be large enough for there to exist &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vectors in general position in this vector space, so uniform matroids are ''F''-linear for all but finitely many fields ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for the [[partition matroid]]s, the direct sums of the uniform matroids, as the direct sum of any two ''F''-linear matroids is itself ''F''-linear.

A [[graphic matroid]] is the matroid defined from the edges of an [[undirected graph]] by defining a set of edges to be independent if and only if it does not contain a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]].

The [[rigidity matroid]]s describe the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of mechanical linkages formed by rigid bars connected at their ends by flexible hinges. A linkage of this type may be described as a graph, with an edge for each bar and a vertex for each hinge, and for one-dimensional linkages the rigidity matroids are exactly the graphic matroids. Higher-dimensional rigidity matroids may be defined using matrices of [[real number]]s with a structure similar to that of the [[incidence matrix]] of the underlying graph, and hence are &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;-linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Like uniform matroids and partition matroids, the [[gammoid]]s, matroids representing [[reachability]] in [[directed graph]]s, are linear over every sufficiently large field. More specifically, a gammoid with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements may be represented over every field that has at least &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[algebraic matroid]]s are matroids defined from sets of elements of a [[field extension]] using the notion of [[algebraic independence]]. Every linear matroid is algebraic, and for fields of characteristic zero (such as the real numbers) linear and algebraic matroids coincide, but for other fields there may exist algebraic matroids that are not linear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15854">In [[mathematics]], a '''function of a motor variable''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with arguments and values in the [[split-complex number]] plane, much as functions of a [[complex variable]] involve ordinary [[complex number]]s. [[William Kingdon Clifford]] coined the term '''motor''' for a kinematic operator in his "Preliminary Sketch of Biquaternions" (1873). He used split-complex numbers for scalars in his [[split-biquaternion]]s. ''Motor variable'' is used here in place of ''split-complex variable'' for euphony and tradition.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = u(z) + j \ v(z) ,\ z = x + j y ,\ x,y \in R ,\quad j^2 = +1,\quad u(z),v(z) \in R.&lt;/math&gt;
Functions of a motor variable provide a context to extend [[real analysis]] and provide compact representation of mappings of the plane. However, the theory falls well short of function theory on the ordinary complex plane. Nevertheless, some of the aspects of conventional complex analysis have an interpretation given with motor variables.

==Elementary functions of a motor variable==
Let '''D''' = &lt;math&gt;\{ z = x + jy : x,y \in R \}&lt;/math&gt;, the split-complex plane. The following exemplar functions ''f'' have domain and range in '''D''':

The action of a [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] &lt;math&gt;u = \exp(aj) = \cosh a + j \sinh a&lt;/math&gt; is combined with [[translation (geometry)|translation]] to produce the [[affine transformation]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = uz + c \ &lt;/math&gt;.  When ''c'' = 0, the function is equivalent to a [[squeeze mapping]].

The squaring function has no analogy in ordinary complex arithmetic. Let
:&lt;math&gt;  f(z) = z^2 \ &lt;/math&gt; and note that &lt;math&gt;f(-1)=f(j)= f(-j) = 1. \ &lt;/math&gt;
The result is that the four quadrants are mapped into one, the [[identity component]]:
:&lt;math&gt;U_1 = \{z \in D : \mid y \mid  &lt; x \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;z z^* = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt; forms the [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus the 
[[multiplicative inverse|reciprocation]]
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = 1/z = z^*/\mid z \mid^2  \text{where}  \mid z \mid^2 = z z^* &lt;/math&gt;
involves the hyperbola as curve of reference as opposed to the circle in C.

On the extended complex plane one has the class of functions called [[Möbius transformation]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac {az + b} {cz + d}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the concept of a [[projective line over a ring]], the projective line P('''D''') is formed and acted on by the group of homographies GL(2,'''D'''). The construction uses [[homogeneous coordinates]] with split-complex number components.

On the ordinary complex plane, the [[Cayley transform#Conformal map|Cayley transform]] carries the upper half-plane to the [[unit disk]], thus bounding it. A mapping of the identity component U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into a rectangle provides a comparable bounding action:
:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac {1}{z + 1/2}, \quad f:U_1 \to T &lt;/math&gt;
where T = {z = x + jy : |y| &lt; x &lt; 1 or |y| &lt; x − 1 when 1&lt;x&lt;2}.

==Exp, log, and square root==
The [[exponential function]] carries the whole plane ''D'' into ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n \over n!} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {x^{2n}} {(2n)!} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {x^{2n+1}} {(2n+1)!} = \cosh x + \sinh x &lt;/math&gt;.
Thus when ''x'' = ''b''j, then e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; is a hyperbolic versor. For the general motor variable ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''j, one has
:&lt;math&gt;e^z = e^a (\cosh b + j \  \sinh b) \ &lt;/math&gt;.

In the theory of functions of a motor variable special attention should be called to the square root and logarithm functions.  In particular, the plane of split-complex numbers consists of four [[Connected component (topology)|connected components]] and the set of singular points that have no inverse: the diagonals ''z'' = ''x'' ± ''x'' j, ''x'' ∈ '''R'''.  The [[identity component]], namely {''z'' : ''x'' &gt; |''y''| }, is the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of the squaring function and the exponential. Thus it is the [[domain (function)|domain]] of the square root and logarithm functions. The other three quadrants do not belong in the domain because square root and logarithm are defined as [[one to one correspondence|one-to-one]] inverses of the squaring function and the exponential function.

Graphic description of the logarithm of '''D''' is given by Motter &amp; Rosa in their article "Hyperbolic Calculus" (1998).

==D-holomorphic functions==
The [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] that characterize [[holomorphic function]]s on a [[domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in the [[complex plane]] have an analogue for functions of a motor variable. An approach to D-holomorphic functions using a [[Wirtinger derivative]] was given by Motter &amp; Rossa:&lt;ref&gt;A.E. Motter &amp; M.A.F. Rosa (1998) "Hyperbolic Calculus", [[Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras]] 8(1):109&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; 
The function ''f'' = ''u'' + j ''v'' is called '''D-holomorphic''' when
:&lt;math&gt;0 \ = \ ({\partial \over \partial x} - j {\partial \over \partial y}) (u + j v)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \ u_x - j^2 v_y + j (v_x - u_y).&lt;/math&gt;
By considering real and imaginary components, a D-holomorphic function satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;u_x = v_y, \quad v_x = u_y.&lt;/math&gt;
These equations were published&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Scheffers]] (1893) "Verallgemeinerung der Grundlagen der gewohnlichen komplexen Funktionen", ''Sitzungsberichte Sachs. Ges. Wiss, Math-phys Klasse'' Bd 45 S. 828-42&lt;/ref&gt; in 1893 by [[Georg Scheffers]], so they have been called "Scheffers' conditions"&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1988) ''Felix Klein &amp; Sophus Lie, The Evolution of the Idea of Symmetry in the Nineteenth Century'', [[Birkhäuser Verlag]], p.&amp;nbsp;203&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparable approach in [[harmonic function]] theory can be viewed in a text by Peter Duren&lt;ref&gt;Peter Duren (2004) ''Harmonic Mappings in the Plane'', pp.&amp;nbsp;3,4, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is apparent that the components ''u'' 
and ''v'' of a D-holomorphic function ''f'' satisfy the [[wave equation]], associated with 
[[D'Alembert]], whereas components of C-holomorphic functions satisfy [[Laplace's equation]].

==La Plata lessons==
At the [[National University of La Plata]] in 1935, J.C. Vignaux, an expert in convergence of [[infinite series]], contributed four articles on the motor variable to the university’s annual periodical.&lt;ref&gt;Vignaux, J.C. &amp; A. Durañona y Vedia (1935) "Sobre la teoría de las funciones de una variable compleja hiperbólica", ''Contribución al Estudio de las Ciencias Físicas y Matemáticas'', pp.&amp;nbsp;139–184, [[Universidad Nacional de La Plata]], República Argentina&lt;/ref&gt; He is the sole author of the introductory one, and consulted with his department head A. Durañona y Vedia on the others. In "Sobre las series de numeros complejos hiperbolicos" he says (p.&amp;nbsp;123):
:This system of hyperbolic complex numbers [motor variables] is the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum of two fields]] isomorphic to the field of real numbers; this property permits explication of the theory of series and of functions of the hyperbolic complex variable through the use of properties of the field of real numbers.
He then proceeds, for example, to generalize theorems due to Cauchy, Abel, Mertens, and Hardy to the domain of the motor variable.

In the primary article, cited below, he considers D-holomorphic functions, and the satisfaction of d’Alembert’s equation by their components. He calls a rectangle with sides parallel to the diagonals ''y'' = ''x''  and  ''y'' = − ''x'', an ''isotropic rectangle'' since its sides are on [[isotropic line]]s.
He concludes his abstract with these words:
:Isotropic rectangles play a fundamental role in this theory since they form the domains of existence for holomorphic functions, domains of convergence of power series, and domains of convergence of functional series.

Vignaux completed his series with a six-page note on the approximation of D-holomorphic functions in a unit isotropic rectangle by [[Bernstein polynomials]].While there are some typographical errors as well as a couple of technical stumbles in this series, Vignaux succeeded in laying out the main lines of the theory that lies between real and ordinary complex analysis. The text is especially impressive as an instructive document for students and teachers due to its exemplary development from elements. Furthermore, the entire excursion is rooted in "its relation to [[Émile Borel]]’s geometry" so as to underwrite its motivation.

==Bireal variable==
In 1892 [[Corrado Segre]] recalled the [[tessarine]] algebra as ''bicomplex numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Baley Price (1991) ''An introduction to multicomplex spaces and functions'', [[Marcel Dekker]] {{isbn|0-8247-8345-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally the subalgebra of real tessarines arose and came to be called the '''bireal numbers'''.

In 1946 U. Bencivenga published an essay&lt;ref&gt;Bencivenga, U. (1946) "Sulla Rappresentazione Geometrica Della Algebre Doppie Dotate Di Modulo", ''Atti. Accad. Sci. Napoli'' Ser(3) v.2 No 7&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[dual number]]s and the split-complex numbers where he used the term bireal number. He also described some of the function theory of the bireal variable. The essay was studied at [[University of British Columbia]] in 1949 when Geoffrey Fox wrote his master’s thesis "Elementary function theory of a hypercomplex variable and the theory of conformal mapping in the hyperbolic plane". On page 46 Fox reports "Bencivenga has shown that a function of a bireal variable maps the hyperbolic plane into itself in such a manner that, at those points for which the derivative of a function exists and does not vanish, [[hyperbolic angle]]s are preserved in the mapping".

G. Fox proceeds to provide the [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] of a bireal variable and discusses [[hyperbolic orthogonality]]. Starting from a different definition he proves on page 57
:Theorem 3.42 : Two vectors are mutually orthogonal if and only if their unit vectors are mutually reflections of one another in one or another of the diagonal lines through 0.
Fox focuses on "bilinear transformations" &lt;math&gt; w = \frac {\alpha z + \beta} {\gamma z + \delta} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta &lt;/math&gt; are bireal constants. To cope with singularity he augments the plane with a single point at infinity (page 73).

Among his novel contributions to function theory is the concept of an ''interlocked system''. Fox shows that for a bireal ''k'' satisfying 
: (''a'' − ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; {{abs|''k''}} &lt; (''a'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
the hyperbolas 
: {{abs|''z''}} = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and {{abs|''z'' − k|}} = b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
do not intersect (form an interlocked system). He then shows that this property is preserved by bilinear transformations of a bireal variable.

==Polynomial factorization==
Two staples of introductory algebra include [[factorization of polynomials]] and the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. With the adoption of motor variables the traditional expectations are countered.&lt;ref&gt;Note that similar adjustments to traditional expectations are necessary for the idea of the [[square root of a matrix]].&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that ('''D''', +, × ) does ''not'' form a [[unique factorization domain]]. Substitute structures for the motor plane were provided by Poodiack and LeClair in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poodiack|first1=Robert D.|last2=LeClair|first2=Kevin J.|title=Fundamental theorems of algebra for the perplexes|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=40|issue=5|pages=322–335|publisher=MAA|date=November 2009|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/college-mathematics-journal/college-mathematics-journal-contents-november-8|jstor=25653773|doi=10.4169/074683409X475643}}&lt;/ref&gt; They prove three versions of the fundamental theorem of algebra where a polynomial of degree ''n'' has ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[root of a function|roots]] counting [[multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]]. To provide an appropriate concept for multiplicity, they construct a matrix which contains all the roots of a polynomial. Furthermore, their method allows derivation of a similar theorem for polynomials with [[tessarine]] coefficients. The article in [[The College Mathematics Journal]] uses the term "perplex number" for a motor variable, and the term "hyperbolic number" for a tessarine. A basic example of the non-unique factorization is
:&lt;math&gt;(z - 1)(z + 1) = z^2 - 1 = (z - j)(z + j)&lt;/math&gt;
exhibiting the set {1, &amp;minus;1, j, &amp;minus;j } of four roots to the second degree polynomial.
Another example is
:&lt;math&gt;(z + 2)(z + 3) = z^2 + 5z +6 = (z + \frac{5}{2} - \frac{1}{2}j)(z + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2}j)&lt;/math&gt;
In general, a [[quadratic function|quadratic polynomial]] with two real roots can be factored in two ways as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a(z + \frac{b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a})(z + \frac{b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) = az^2 + bz +c = a(z + \frac{b}{2a} - \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}j)(z + \frac{b}{2a} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}j)&lt;/math&gt;

==Compactification==
The [[multiplicative inverse]] function is so important that extreme measures are taken to include it in the mappings of [[differential geometry]]. For instance, the [[complex plane]] is rolled up to the [[Riemann sphere]] for ordinary complex arithmetic. For split-complex arithmetic a [[hyperboloid]] is used instead of a sphere: &lt;math&gt;H = \{(x, y, z) : z^2 + x^2 - y^2  = 1 \} .&lt;/math&gt; As with the Riemann sphere, the method is [[stereographic projection]] from ''P'' = (0, 0, 1) through ''z'' = (''x'', ''y'', 0) to the hyperboloid. The line ''L'' = ''Pz'' is parametrized by ''s'' in &lt;math&gt;L =  \{ (s x, s y, 1 - s) : s \in R \}&lt;/math&gt; so that it passes ''P'' when ''s'' is zero and ''z'' when ''s'' is one.

From ''H'' ∩ ''L'' it follows that
&lt;math&gt;(1 - s)^2 + (sx)^2 - (sy)^2 = 1 , \text{ so that} \quad s = \frac {2}{1 + x^2 - y^2} .&lt;/math&gt;

If ''z'' is on the [[null cone]], then ''s'' = 2 and (2''x'', ±2''x'', – 1) is on ''H'', the opposite points (2''x'', ±2''x'', 1) make up the '''light cone at infinity''' that is the image of the null cone under inversion.

Note that for ''z'' with &lt;math&gt;y^2 &gt; 1 + x^2 ,&lt;/math&gt; ''s'' is negative. The implication is that the back-ray through ''P'' to ''z'' provides the point on ''H''. These points ''z'' are above and below the hyperbola conjugate to the unit hyperbola.

The compactification must be completed in P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''R''' with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''w, x, y, z'') where ''w'' = 1 specifies the affine space (''x, y, z'') used so far. Hyperboloid ''H'' is absorbed into the projective conic &lt;math&gt;\{ (w, x, y, z) \in P^3R : z^2 + x^2 = y^2 + w^2 \},&lt;/math&gt; which is a [[compact space]].

[[Walter Benz]] performed the compactification by using a mapping due to Hans Beck. [[Isaak Yaglom]] illustrated a two-step compactification as above, but with the split-complex plane tangent to the hyperboloid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yaglom |first=Isaak M. |authorlink=Isaak Yaglom |others=Abe Shenitzer (translator) |title=A simple non-Euclidean geometry and its physical basis : an elementary account of Galilean geometry and the Galilean principle of relativity |year=1979 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |isbn=0-387-90332-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Emanuello &amp; Nolder performed the compactification by first embedding the motor plane into a [[torus]], and then making it projective by identifying [[antipodal points]].&lt;ref&gt;John A. Emanuello &amp; Craig A. Nolder (2015) "Projective compactification of R&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; and its Möbius Geometry", ''Complex Analysis and Operator Theory'' 9(2): 329–54&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nominal techniques''' are a range of techniques, based on [[nominal sets]], for handling names and binding, e.g. in [[abstract syntax]].  Research into nominal sets gave rise to [[Nominal terms (computer science)|nominal terms]], a metalanguage for embedding object languages with name binding constructs.

'''Quantum fingerprinting''' is a proposed technique that uses a [[quantum computer]] to generate a string with a similar function to the [[cryptographic hash function]].

If unconditional guarantees of security are needed, and if it is impractical for the communicating parties to arrange to share a secret that can be used in a [[Carter–Wegman MAC]], this technique might one day be faster than classical techniques given a [[quantum computer]] with 5 to 10 [[qubit]]s.  However, these circumstances are very unusual and it is unlikely the technique will ever have a practical application; it is largely of theoretical interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">In mathematical [[representation theory]], '''Steinberg's formula''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Steinberg|year=1961|authorlink=Robert Steinberg}}, describes the [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of an [[irreducible representation]] of a semisimple complex [[Lie algebra]] in a [[tensor product]] of two [[irreducible representation]]s.
It is a consequence of the [[Weyl character formula]], and for the Lie algebra [[Special linear Lie algebra|sl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] it is essentially the [[Clebsch–Gordan formula]].

Steinberg's formula states that the multiplicity of the irreducible representation of highest weight ''ν'' in the tensor product of the irreducible representations with highest weights ''λ'' and ''μ'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{w,w^\prime\in W} \epsilon(ww^\prime)P(w(\lambda+\rho)+w^\prime(\mu+\rho)-(\nu+2\rho))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''W'' is the [[Weyl group]], ε is the [[determinant]] of an element of the Weyl group, ρ is the [[Weyl vector]], and ''P'' is the [[Kostant partition function]] giving the number of ways of writing a vector as a sum of positive roots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">In [[type theory]], a type system has the property of '''subject reduction''' (also '''subject evaluation''', '''type preservation''' or simply '''preservation''') if [[evaluation (computer science)|evaluation]] of [[expression (computer science)|expression]]s does not cause their [[type (computer science)|type]] to change. Formally, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;''.

Together with [[progress (type theory)|progress]], it is an important meta-theoretical property for establishing [[type soundness]] of a type system.

The opposite property, if Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'' and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  then Γ ⊢ ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''&amp;tau;'', is called '''subject expansion'''. It often does not hold as evaluation can erase ill-typed sub-terms of an expression, resulting in a well-typed one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3404">'''Thomas Fuller''' (1710 – December 1782), also known as "''Negro Tom''" and the "''Virginia Calculator''", was an [[Slavery|enslaved]] African renowned for his mathematical abilities.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''Calculating Prodigies'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Born in [[Africa]] somewhere between present-day [[Liberia]] and [[Benin]], Fuller was enslaved and shipped to America in 1724 at the age of 14, eventually becoming the legal property of Presley and Elizabeth Cox of [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. Both Fuller and the Coxes were illiterate. The Coxes owned 16 slaves, and appeared to value Fuller the most; he expressed gratitude for not being sold.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0212/021207.html/(page)/3 A wizard in any age]" ''Christian Science Monitor'', February 12, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of his abilities abounded through the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]]. His skill was even used as proof that enslaved Blacks were equal to whites in intelligence, which fueled some pro-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] discussion.

==Documentation of abilities==
When Fuller was about 70 years old, William Hartshorne and Samuel Coates of [[Pennsylvania]] were in Alexandria and, having heard of Fuller's powers, sent for him. They asked him two questions which satisfied their curiosity.

First, when they asked him how many seconds there were in a year and a half, he answered in about two minutes, 47,304,000. Second, when they asked how many seconds a man has lived who is 70 years, 17 days and 12 hours old, he answered in a minute and a half 2,210,500,800. One of the men was working out the problems on paper, and informed Fuller that he was wrong, because the answer was much smaller. Fuller hastily replied, "'Top, massa, you forget de [[leap year]]." When the leap year was added in, the sums matched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/americanmuseumor05care#page/62/ ''Account of a wonderful talent for arithmetical calculation, in an African slave, living in Virginia.''] In: [[The American Museum (magazine)|The American Museum]]: Or, Repository of Ancient and Modern Fugitve Pieces, etc. Prose and Poetical. Vol. 5 (1789), p. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Fuller's perfect answers, it appeared to Hartshorne and Coates that his mental abilities must have once been greater. They wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was gray-headed, and exhibited several other marks of the weakness of old age. He had worked hard upon a farm during the whole of life but had never been intemperate in the use of spirituous liquors. He spoke with great respect of his mistress, and mentioned in a particular manner his obligations to her for refusing to sell him, which she had been tempted to by offers of large sums of money from several persons.

One of the gentlemen, Mr. Coates, having remarked in his presence that it was a pity he had not an education equal to his genius, he said, "No, [[Master (form of address)|Massa]], it is best I had no learning, for many learned men be great fools."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">[[Image:Vertical tangent.svg|thumb|Vertical tangent on the function ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') at ''x''=''c''.]]

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[calculus]], a '''vertical tangent''' is [[tangent]] line that is [[Vertical direction|vertical]].  Because a vertical line has [[Infinity|infinite]] [[slope]], a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[graph of a function|graph]] has a vertical tangent is not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] at the point of tangency.

== Limit definition ==
A function &amp;fnof; has a vertical tangent at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' if the [[difference quotient]] used to define the derivative has infinite limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = {+\infty}\quad\text{or}\quad\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = {-\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first case corresponds to an upward-sloping vertical tangent, and the second case to a downward-sloping vertical tangent.  Informally speaking, the graph of &amp;fnof; has a vertical tangent at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' if the derivative of &amp;fnof; at ''a'' is either positive or negative infinity.

For a [[continuous function]], it is often possible to detect a vertical tangent by taking the limit of the derivative.  If

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a} f'(x) = {+\infty}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

then &amp;fnof; must have an upward-sloping vertical tangent at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''.  Similarly, if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a} f'(x) = {-\infty}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

then &amp;fnof; must have a downward-sloping vertical tangent at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''.  In these situations, the vertical tangent to &amp;fnof; appears as a vertical [[asymptote]] on the graph of the derivative.

== Vertical cusps ==
Closely related to vertical tangents are '''vertical [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]]'''. This occurs when the [[one-sided derivative]]s are both infinite, but one is positive and the other is negative.  For example, if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0^-}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = {+\infty}\quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = {-\infty}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;

then the graph of &amp;fnof; will have a vertical cusp that slopes up on the left side and down on the right side.

As with vertical tangents, vertical cusps can sometimes be detected for a continuous function by examining the limit of the derivative.  For example, if 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^-} f'(x) = {-\infty} \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{x \to a^+} f'(x) = {+\infty}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;
then the graph of &amp;fnof; will have a vertical cusp that slopes down on the left side and up on the right side.  This corresponds to a vertical asymptote on the graph of the derivative that goes to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the left and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the right.

== Example ==
The function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has a vertical tangent at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, since it is continuous and
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} f'(x) \;=\; \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \;=\; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the function
:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
has a vertical cusp at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, since it is continuous,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^-} g'(x) \;=\; \lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}} \;=\; {-\infty}\text{,}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0^+} g'(x) \;=\; \lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}} \;=\; {+\infty}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''WSSUS''' ('''Wide-Sense Stationary Uncorrelated Scattering''') '''model''' provides a [[Statistics|statistical]] description of the transmission behavior of [[wireless]] [[Channel (communications)|channels]].  "Wide-sense [[Stationary process|stationarity]]" means the [[Stationary process#Weak or wide-sense stationarity|second-order moments]] of the channel are stationary, which means that they depends only on the time difference, while "uncorrelated [[scattering]]" refers to the delay &lt;var&gt;τ&lt;/var&gt; due to scatterers.
Modelling of mobile channels as WSSUS (wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering) is rather popular among specialists in recent years.

A commonly used description of time variant channel applies the set of [[Bello functions]] and the theory of stochastic processes.
