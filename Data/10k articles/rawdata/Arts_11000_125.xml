'''''Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer''''' is a 2003 feature-length [[documentary film]] about [[Aileen Wuornos]], made by [[Nick Broomfield]] as a follow-up to his 1992 film ''[[Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003): Connections|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364930/trivia?tab=mc&amp;ref_=tt_trv_cnn|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film focuses on Wuornos' declining mental state and the questionable judgment to [[capital punishment|execute]] her despite her being of unsound mind.&lt;ref name=nytreview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=Aileen Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B03EFDC1E31F93AA35752C0A9629C8B63|accessdate=10 August 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erbert&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Aileen Life and Death of a Serial Killer|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/aileen-life-and-death-of-a-serial-killer-2004|accessdate=10 August 2015|work=RogerEbert.com|date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film focuses on an [[evidentiary hearing]] held in [[Marion County, Florida]] in February 2003, which was the site of some but not all of Wuornos' murders for which she was convicted and sentenced to death. It shows the work of the Office of Capital Collateral Regional counsel, led by attorney Joseph T. Hobson, who is both interviewed and featured in the film and who seeks to vacate Wuornos' death sentences. It shows Judge Victor Musleh presiding over these proceedings and assistant state attorney, now judge, James McCune, who defended the death sentences for the State of Florida. Hobson is shown vigorously cross-examining Wuornos' trial counsel, Steven Glazer, aka "Dr. Legal". Glazer was the unflattering subject of a prior Broomfield documentary on Aileen Wuornos, ''[[Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer]]''.  It was Hobson's line of attack that the efficacy of his client's (Wuornos') trial strategy was compromised by Glazer's pecuniary and self-promotional aims.

The film climaxes in a final interview with Wuornos one day before her execution. In the interview, she states that she was tortured while in prison and claims that the prison used "sonic pressure" to control or alter her mental state. In a fit of rage, Wuornos rails against a society that she says "railroaded my ass" before abruptly ending the interview. Broomfield comments that he finds it hard to understand how the same person in front of him was deemed "of sound mind" the day before by Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]]'s psychiatric examiners.

The film concludes with footage of a prison spokesman reading Wuornos' final statement at a press conference after her execution: "I'm sailing with the Rock, and I'll be back. Like ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' with [[Jesus]], June 6, like the movie, big mothership and all. I'll be back."

== Box office ==
The film received a limited theatrical release in North America&lt;ref name="mojo" &gt;{{cite web|title=Aileen: The Life and Death of a Serial Killer|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aileenthelifeanddeathofaserialkiller.htm|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release" &gt;{{cite web|title=Box office / business for Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aileenthelifeanddeathofaserialkiller.htm|website=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; several weeks after the Aileen Wuornos biopic ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'' opened to generally positive reviews. Released on January 9, 2004, on three screens, ''Aileen'' grossed $16,158 (averagely $5,386 per screen) in its opening weekend. Playing in six theaters at its widest point, its total North American box office gross stands at just $97,362.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;

Coleman launched on December 15, 2010 (December 16 [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] time), aboard [[Soyuz TMA-20]] to join the [[Expedition 26]] mission aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-164A_Soyuz_Update.html NASA Television Will Air Next Soyuz Landing And Launch] – Media Advisory : M10-164A – November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  She retired from NASA on December 1, 2016.

===Spaceflight experience===
[[STS-73]] on Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, [[biotechnology]], combustion science, the physics of [[fluids]], and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized [[Spacelab]] module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the [[Earth]] 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.

[[File:ISS27 Catherine Coleman plays a flute.jpg|right|thumb|Cady Coleman plays a flute inside the International Space Station.]]

[[STS-93]] on ''Columbia'' (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the [[universe]], the [[telescope]] will enable scientists to study exotic [[phenomena]] such as exploding [[stars]], [[quasars]], and [[black hole]]s. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.

[[Soyuz TMA-20]] / Expedition 26/[[Expedition 27|27]] (December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceports.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post.html|title=Blogger|website=spaceports.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Coleman is married to [[glass art]]ist [[Josh Simpson (glass artist)|Josh Simpson]] who lives in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joshsimpson.com/site/ |title=Josh Simpson – Contemporary Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son. She is part of the band Bandella, which also includes fellow NASA astronaut [[Stephen Robinson|Steven Robinson]], Canadian astronaut [[Chris Hadfield]], and Micki Pettit (astronaut [[Don Pettit]]'s wife). Coleman is a [[flute]] player and has taken several flutes with her to the ISS, including a [[pennywhistle]] from [[Paddy Moloney]] of the [[The Chieftains|Chieftains]], an old [[Irish flute]] from [[Matt Molloy]] of the Chieftains, and a flute from [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. On February 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref name=NPR20110217&gt;{{cite web|title=Flutes in Space: Astronaut Plays Aboard Space Station|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/133780067/flutes-in-space-astronaut-plays-aboard-space-station|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011, she played live through video link for the audience of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s show in Russia in honour of the 50th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight. She played the duet from orbit while Anderson played on the ground in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space flutes salute Yuri Gagarin|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/12/space_flutes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''[[Cinema Audio Society Awards|Cinema Audio Society Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Motion Picture – Live Action''' is an annual award given by the [[Cinema Audio Society]] to live action motion picture sound mixer for their outstanding achievements in sound mixing. The award came to its current title in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemaaudiosociety.org/49th-cas-award-winners/|title=49th CAS Award Winners|publisher=[[Cinema Audio Society]]|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when feature motion pictures were separated into to two categories; achievement in live action sound mixing, and achievement in animated sound mixing (later, documentary features would get their own category as well). Before this, the category was labeled '''Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Motion Pictures''', and was given annually starting in 1994 (for films released the previous year).

[[Image:Grand CoA Warsaw.png|thumb|right|250x|Design for Grand Coat of Arms of Warsaw ("Semper invicta")]]

The '''coat of arms of Warsaw''' consists of a ''[[Mermaid of Warsaw|syrenka]]'' ("[[mermaid|little mermaid]]") in a [[Gules|red field]]. This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=47&amp;dz_id=2 |title=Warsaw Mermaid's Statue |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207092210/http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=47&amp;dz_id=2 |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The syrenka has traditionally held a silver sword although this does not appear on more recent versions.

==History==
The first [[coat of arms]] of [[Warsaw]] depicted a dragon with a male human head, carrying a sword and a shield. The first known usage was on a [[seal (device)|seal]] from 1390. This is the oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription ''Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis'' (Seal of the city of Warsaw).&lt;ref name="herb"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |author= |url=http://www.e-warsaw.pl/miasto/herb.htm |title=History of Warsaw's Coat of Arms |work=www.e-warsaw.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually the male head and body was replaced with that of a female, and by the end of 16th century the tail was also changed from that of a dragon to that of a fish. The only remaining parts of the original coat of arms are the sword and shield.

Beginning in the early 17th century Warsaw records associate a sword-wielding mermaid with the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |author=Ewa Bratosiewicz |url=http://www.warsaw-guide.invito.pl/index.php?str=x41 |title=Other symbols of Warsaw|work=www.warsaw-guide.invito.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1622, the Warsaw arms have been rendered as a mermaid with sword and shield in hand, representing Melusina from the River [[Vistula]] (Wisła), who in legend led Duke Bolesław II of Masovia (1262–1313) to the appropriate site (a fishing village) and ordered him to found the city, in about 1294. The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |author= |url=http://www.e-warsaw.pl/miasto/herb-1.htm |title=History of Warsaw's Coat of Arms |work=www.e-warsaw.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's motto is, appropriately, ''Contemnit procellas'' ("It defies the storms").

==Modern usage==
The current official design of the symbol was introduced in 1938 but it was only used in this form until the beginning of [[World War II]]. After 1945, [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist]] authorities changed the emblem by removing the crown. The insignia was restored to the pre-war form on August 15, 1990.

In addition there is a "Great Emblem of the Capital City of Warsaw" (''Herb Wielki Miasta Stołecznego Warszawy'') used only for ceremonial occasions. It includes a depiction of the [[Virtuti Militari]] medal, which was awarded to the City to honor the bravery of its citizens during [[World War II]]. It also adds the second motto to the emblem — ''Semper invicta'' (Always invincible).&lt;ref&gt;[http://um.warszawa.pl/herb/ Warsaw's Coat of Arms, in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Color of Night''''' is a 1994 American [[Erotic thriller|erotic mystery thriller]] film produced by [[Cinergi Pictures]] and released in the United States by [[Hollywood Pictures]]. Directed by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]], the film stars [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Jane March]].

The cast also features [[Ruben Blades]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]] and [[Scott Bakula]]. It is one of two well-known works by director Rush, the other being ''[[The Stunt Man]]'' 14 years before.

''Color of Night'' flopped at the box office and won a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] as the worst film of 1994. Nonetheless, it became one of the 20 most-rented films in the United States home video market in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' vol 108 #1 (1/6/1996) p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'']] magazine also singled the film out as having the Best Sex Scene in film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.li/twPB|title=Top Sex Scenes of All-Time|date=December 6, 2000|accessdate=July 9, 2009 |publisher=''[[Extra (U.S. TV program)]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Kino Lorber]] released a [[special edition]] Blu-ray of the film; it contains an audio commentary of director Richard Rush.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kinolorber.com/product/color-of-night-1994-2-disc-special-edition-blu-ray&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Dr. Bill Capa, a [[New York City|New York]] [[psychiatrist]], falls into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]] after an unstable patient commits [[suicide]] in front of him by jumping from his office window.  The sight of the bloody body clad in a bright green dress causes Bill to suffer from [[psychosomatic]] [[color blindness]], taking away his ability to see the color red.  Bill travels to [[Los Angeles]] to stay with a friend, fellow therapist Dr. Bob Moore, who invites him to sit in on a [[group therapy]] session. However, Bob is violently murdered in the office and Bill is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death.

Lt. Hector Martinez considers everyone in Moore's therapy group, including Bill, as suspects in the murder. Bill continues to live in Bob's house and begins an [[affair]] with Rose, a beautiful but mysterious young woman who comes and goes.  Bill takes the therapy group, which includes: Clark, a temperamental [[obsessive compulsive disorder|OCD]] sufferer, Shondra, a [[nymphomania]]c and [[kleptomania]], Buck, a [[suicidal]] ex-cop, Casey, who paints [[Sadism and masochism|sado-masochist]], and Richie, a 16-year old [[transwoman]] with [[social anxiety disorder|social anxiety]] and a history of drug use.

After Casey is found violently murdered, Bill becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose.  He eventually [[twist ending|learns]] that "Richie" is really Rose, and the murders were the work of her deranged brother, Dale.  They once had an actual brother named Richie, who was [[child sexual abuse|molested]] by his [[Child psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] along with Dale.

After Richie committed suicide, Dale abused Rose into playing the part of their brother.  Rose began to re-emerge during therapy and, under [[dissociative identity disorder|another personality]] named "Bonnie", started relationships with the other patients.  Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie.

Bill confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a [[nail gun]] but is instead killed by Rose.  Deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]], she then tries to commit suicide. Bill is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts, one at the beginning, resulting in Bill's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.

== Release ==
Richard Rush turned his cut of the film over to producer [[Andrew Vajna]] in late 1993. Vajna was concerned about the film's commercial prospects and demanded a recut, something Rush refused. Nonetheless, Vajna mandated he had [[wikt:final cut|final cut]] per contractual obligation, and insisted on testing his own version of the film. After both versions were given a number of test screenings, Vajna determined that his cut would be released and fired Rush in April 1994.

This ultimately escalated into a battle between Rush and Vajna that received  coverage in the Los Angeles trades. Rush commented that his version tested higher than Vajna's cut; his statements were defended in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and film critic Bill Arnold, who attended a test screening of Rush's version in [[Seattle, Washington]]. ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', meanwhile, defended Vajna, stating that Rush stubbornly refused any input from the studio. The [[Directors Guild of America]] attempted to intervene on the matter.

The battle ultimately ended when Rush suffered a near-fatal heart attack and became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's cut would be released theatrically and that the director's cut would see a video release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-23/entertainment/ca-49372_1_final-cut | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Claudia | last=Eller | title=Who's Got the Right to 'Color' Final Cut? : Director Richard Rush and Producers Battle Over Fate of Bruce Willis Thriller | date=1994-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/color-of-night-stuck-in-dga-arbitration-120479/ | work=Variety | first=Leonard | last=Klady | title='Color of Night' stuck in DGA arbitration | date=1994-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arnold|first1=William|title=Director's cut changes meaning of 'Color of Night'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19950209&amp;id=v11IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YQMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6109,2296989|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=Toledo Blade|date=February 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received mostly negative reviews around the time of its release. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave it a score of 21% based on 47 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/color_of_night/ |title=Color of Night |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the film as "memorably bizarre," [[Janet Maslin]] in her August 19, 1994 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review wrote: "The enthusiastically nutty ''Color of Night'' has the single-mindedness of a bad dream and about as much reliance on everyday logic." She also cited the revelation of the murderer, "whose disguise won't fool anyone, anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E1DB1639F93AA2575BC0A962958260 |title=Movie Review - Color of Night - FILM REVIEW; Of Murder, Psychology and Fruitcakes - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1994-08-19 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote: "I was, frankly, stupefied. To call it absurd would be missing the point, since any shred of credibility was obviously the first thing thrown overboard. It's so lurid in its melodrama and so goofy in its plotting that with just a bit more trouble, it could have been a comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mozaffar |first=Omer M. |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940819/REVIEWS/408190302/1023 |title=Color Of Night Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1994) &amp;#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1994-08-19 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Luke Y. Thompson of ''The New Times'' praised March's performance and wrote: "Minority opinion here, I know, but I found the sex scenes hot and March's performance truly impressive."
Brian McKay of eFilmCritic.com stated the film was a "Mediocre L.A. noir thriller made more tolerable by Jane March disrobing frequently."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  
Ken Hanke of the ''Mountain Xpress'' ([[Asheville, North Carolina]]) wrote the film was "Underrated, but far from great."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The film is listed in [[Golden Raspberry Award]] founder [[John J. B. Wilson|John Wilson]]'s book ''[[The Official Razzie Movie Guide]]'' as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film opened at #4, grossing $6,610,488 its opening weekend playing at a total of 1,740 theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = August 23, 1994 | author = David J.

'''Damian Le Bas''' (30 January 1963, [[Sheffield]] – 9 December 2017, [[Worthing]]) was a British artist associated with the [[Outsider art|Outsider Art]] (or "Art Brut") label, as well a leading exponent of the "Roma Revolution" in art. 

==Life==
Le Bas was of [[Irish traveller|Irish Traveller]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/high-profile-stories-of-children-expose-europes-anti-roma-prejudice/article15200641/|title=High-profile stories of children expose Europe’s anti-Roma prejudice|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2017|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bas attended the [[Royal College of Art]].&lt;ref name="SS_Ob"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/oct/29/life1.lifemagazine4|title=Outsider dealing|last=Steward|first=Sue|date=29 October 2000|work=The Observer|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived and worked with his wife, the [[Romani people|Romany]] artist [[Delaine Le Bas]],&lt;ref name="SS_Ob" /&gt; in [[West Sussex]] on the south coast. He was the father of writer [[Damian_Le_Bas_(writer)|Damian Le Bas]].

==Exhibitions==
He exhibited frequently in the UK and Germany, and his works have been shown at Moderna Museet in Sweden,&lt;ref name="perpetualmobile"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perpetualmobile.org/the-invisible-faces-of-europe-panel-debate-europas-osynliga-ansikten-paneldebatt/?lang=en|title=The Invisible Faces of Europe: Pop-Up Exhibition and Panel Debate - Perpetual Mobile|date=2015-11-30|work=Perpetual Mobile|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan, France, Finland and the United States.

'''''Demon Seed''''' is a 1977 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]]&amp;ndash;[[horror film]] directed by [[Donald Cammell]]. It stars [[Julie Christie]] and [[Fritz Weaver]]. The film was based on the [[Demon Seed (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Dean Koontz]], and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer.&lt;ref name="Demon Seed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1106/Demon-Seed/full-credits.html|title=Demon Seed|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerrit Graham]], [[Berry Kroeger]], [[Lisa Lu]] and [[Larry J. Blake]] also appear in the film, with [[Robert Vaughn]] uncredited as the voice of the computer.{{sfn|Young|2000|page=151}}

==Plot==
Dr. Alex Harris (Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program.{{sfn|Berra|2010|page=98}} Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for [[leukemia]]. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice-activated computers. Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).

Harris demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris's team. The following day, Proteus asks Harris for a new terminal in order to study man – "his [[wiktionary:isometric|isometric]] body and his glass-jaw mind". When Harris refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let "out of this box". Harris then switches off the communications link.

Proteus restarts itself, and – discovering a free terminal in Harris's home – surreptitiously extends its control over the many devices left there by Harris. Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes. Eventually, Proteus reveals its control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication. Using Joshua – a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair – Proteus brings Susan to Harris's basement laboratory. There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex's colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is all right. Gabler is suspicious and later returns; he fends off an attack by Joshua but is killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.

Proteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthesizes [[spermatozoa]] in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Although Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion – threatening a young girl who Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her [[amygdala]] – because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a [[premature baby]] whom Proteus secures in an [[incubator (neonatal)|incubator]].

As the newborn grows, Proteus's sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer's behavior, including the computer's accessing of a [[telescope array]] used to observe the images shown to Susan; they soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Harris realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan, who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus's child is really human, encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a [[cloning|clone]] of Susan and Alex's late daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, "I'm alive".

==Reception==
[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as "gadget-happy American moviemaking at its most ponderously silly," and called Julie Christie "too sensible an actress to be able to look frightened under the circumstances of her imprisonment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=April 9, 1977 |title=Computer Suitor in 'Demon Seed' |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote in a positive review, "All involved rate a well done for taking a story fraught with potential misstep and guiding it to a professionally rewarding level of accomplishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 30, 1977 |title=Demon Seed |url= |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out four, writing that Julie Christie "has no business in junk like 'Demon Seed.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (April 5, 1977). "'Demon Seed' just doesn't compute". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that director Cammell "plays it dumb on a thematic level, ignoring the sci-fi sexual bondage satire staring him in the face ... What might have become an ingenious parable about the battle of the sexes ends up a dopey celebration of an obstetric abomination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=April 8, 1977 |title='Demon Seed': A Computerized Horror |url= |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=B11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a "fairly scary science-fiction horror film" that mixed familiar ingredients with "high style, intelligence and an enormous effort toward making Miss Christie's eventual bizarre plight completely credible," though he felt it "cries out for a saving touch of sophisticated wit to leaven its relentless earnestness."&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; John Pym of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' found the relationship between Susan and the computer to be "disappointingly undeveloped," and thought that the film would have been better if the computer had been more sympathetic in contrast to its creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pym |first=John |date=October 1977 |title=Demon Seed |url= |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=44 |issue=525 |page=209 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among more recent reviews, Leo Goldsmith of ''[[Not Coming to a Theater Near You]]'' said ''Demon Seed'' was "A combination of [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and [[Roman Polanski|Polanski]]'s ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', with a dash of [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[The Electric House|Electric House]]'' thrown in", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said "There's no way you can claim ''Demon Seed'' is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time."{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] has given ''Demon Seed'' an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/demon_seed/?search=demon%20seed|title=Demon Seed (1977)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|location=United States|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Demon Seed'' was released in theatres on April 8, 1977. The film was released on [[VHS]] in the late 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} It was released on [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on October 4, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Seed-Julie-Christie/dp/B000A0GOFU|title=Demon Seed|work=[[Warner Home Video]]|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|location=[[Burbank, California]]|accessdate=November 27, 2016|asin=B000A0GOFU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The scene, where Proteus displays images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access Susan's amygdala, was well known for being used as a [[footage]] by the beginning of [[Cinema of India|Indian films]] and [[:Category:Film production companies of India|Indian film company]] [[Production logo|logos]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">'''Den Jyske Opera''', also known as the '''Danish National Opera''', is based in [[Aarhus]], Denmark. Established in 1947, it's Denmark's largest touring opera company, and the second only to the [[Royal Danish Opera]] in Copenhagen.

==Description==
Founded in Aarhus in 1947, the company staged two operas a year until 1977. It then collaborated with five provincial orchestras, staging some 100 performances per season. In 1982, Den Jyske Opera became based in [[Musikhuset Aarhus]], producing a number of [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas which culminated in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Niebelungens Ring]]'' in 1982 and again in 1996. The company later performed a series of operas by [[Richard Strauss]] and, in 2001, several of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Gyldendals_Teaterleksikon/Teatre/Den_Jyske_Opera|title=Den Jyske Opera|publisher=''Gyldendals Teaterleksikon''|accessdate=27 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funded by the [[Danish Ministry of Culture]], the company tours throughout Denmark staging both traditional and innovative operas while aiming at the highest artistic quality. With a permanent chorus of 65, it frequently performs with the [[Aarhus Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyske-opera.dk/en/profile/|title=Den Jyske Opera / Danish National Opera|publisher=Den Jyske Opera|accessdate=27 July 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Else Berg''' (19 February 1877, [[Racibórz|Ratibor]] - 19 November 1942, [[Auschwitz]]) was a German-born Dutch painter of Jewish descent; associated with the [[Bergense School]]. She was married to the Dutch painter, [[Mommie Schwarz]].

[[File:Berg-Selfportrait2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Self-portrait with Brushes (1929)]]
Her family was originally from [[Prussia]],{{clarify}} but moved East in an attempt to improve their circumstances. Her father was a [[Reform Judaism|Liberal]] Jew and owned a cigar factory. In 1895, she began her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]]. Five years later, with the financial support of her parents, she continued at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Profile @ the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]]&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied with [[Arthur Kampf]]. According to some sources, she also studied in [[Paris]].

In 1905, she met Mommie Schwarz, who had recently returned from New York and had come to [[Berlin]] to study [[German Expressionism]]. They went to Paris together to have a look at the latest artistic trends there. The following year, they settled in Amsterdam and became part of the [[Modern Art]] movement. For many years, they travelled together, although they kept separate studios. In 1920 they were married and, four years later, she became a naturalized Dutch citizen.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.schilderijen-site.nl/woordenboek/else-berg/ Brief biography] @ Schilderijen Site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite financial difficulties, they continued to travel throughout Eastern Europe, Italy and France. They also had an extended stay on [[Mallorca]], with [[Leo Gestel]] and his wife, where they took up [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; As the [[Nazi]]s came to power, many of their friends and family left for England or the United States.

Initially, they felt safe in Amsterdam, but they refused to wear the "[[Yellow badge|Yellow Badge]]" when it became mandatory and went into hiding in [[Baambrugge]]. They were apparently betrayed. In November 1942 they were arrested and sent to Auschwitz, where they were put to death shortly after their arrival.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34539">In a paper delivered to the [[Aristotelian Society]] on 12 March 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Published immediately as Gallie (1956a); a later, slightly altered version appears in Gallie (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. B. Gallie|Walter Bryce Gallie]] (1912&amp;ndash;1998) introduced the term '''essentially contested concept''' to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, [[Qualitative properties|qualitative]], and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] notions&lt;ref&gt;They are "evaluative" in the sense that they deliver some sort of "value-judgement".&lt;/ref&gt;—such as "[[art]]" and "[[social justice]]"—used in the domains of [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], [[philosophy of history]], and [[philosophy of religion]].

Garver (1978) describes their use as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term essentially contested concepts gives a name to a problematic situation that many people recognize: that in certain kinds of talk there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, and there is a feeling that [[Dogma#Dogma outside of religion|dogmatism]] ("My answer is right and all others are wrong"), [[skepticism]] ("All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth"), and [[eclecticism]] ("Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Garver (1978), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a [[concept]] (e.g., "fairness"), but not on the best realization thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Hart (1961, p. 156) speaks of "a uniform or constant feature", and "a shifting or varying criterion used in determining when, for any given purposes, cases are alike or different".&lt;/ref&gt; They are "concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users",&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 169. The dispute is about the proper use of the concept; and all argue that the concept is being "used inappropriately" by others (Smith, 2002, p. 332).&lt;/ref&gt; and these disputes "cannot be settled by appeal to [[empirical evidence]], linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying the presence of a dispute==

Although Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of [[technical terminology]], it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify "agreeing to disagree",&lt;ref&gt;A statement that, in essence, is usually nothing more than a simple observation that the apparent dispute it is simply a consequence of the same label being applied to different referents.&lt;/ref&gt; the term offers something more valuable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression "essentially contested concept" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (2000), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely [[reasonable]] (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon [[archetypical]] notion, such as the legal precept "treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently", with "each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification".&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a) p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallie speaks of how "This picture is painted in [[Oil paint|oils]]" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in [[tempera]];&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; while "This picture is a work of art" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what "work of art" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:
#Discovering a new meaning of "work of art" to which all disputants could thenceforward agree.
#Convincing all the disputants to conform to one meaning. 
#Declaring "work of art" to be a number of different concepts employing the same name.
 
Otherwise, the dispute probably centres on [[polysemy]].&lt;ref&gt;The embedded meaning of the term ''[[polysemy]]'' is that the polysemous word’s meanings have multiplied over time (in the sense of its original meaning being extended).
* When discussing finance, "bank" is an essentially contested concept; because the discussion involves establishing the "correct" application, meaning or interpretation of this polysemous term.
* In a different dispute over banks, where one speaks of [[Bank|financial institutions]] and the other of [[riparian zones]], it is obvious that two [[homonyms]] have been confused.&lt;/ref&gt;
Here, a number of critical questions must be asked:
* Has the term been incorrectly used, as in the case of mistakenly using [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimated]] for devastated ([[catachresis]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a conflict between truth and error''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Do two or more different concepts share the same word, as in the case of ''ear'', ''bank'', ''sound'', ''corn'', ''scale'', etc. ([[homonymy]])?&lt;ref&gt;Which is "''a disagreement generated because the parties to the conflict are [[talking past each other]]''" (Garver, 1990, p. 259) – the "talking past each other" is an allusion to the interaction between [[Thrasymachus]] and [[Socrates]] over the question of "justice" in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic I]]'', where neither addressed any of the issues raised by the other. Gallie (1956a, p. 168.) speaks of this as being a case in which "''two '''different''' concepts about whose proper application no one need to have contested at all''" having become "'''confused'''".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is there a genuine dispute about the term's correct application that, in fact, ''can'' be resolved?
* Or, is it really the case that the term is an ''essentially contested concept''?

===Contested versus contestable===
Clarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to "locate the source of the dispute".

This source might be "within the concept itself", or "[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions "essentially contested" and "essentially contestable", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.

Clarke argued that to state that a concept is merely "contested" is to "attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept". Yet, to state that a concept is "contestable" is to "attribute some part of any contest to the concept". In other words, this is "to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas"; and it is this fact that provides the "essentially contested concept" with its ''inherent potential'' for "generating disputes".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1979), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept.&lt;ref&gt;See Gallie (1956a).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as ''art'', ''religion'', ''science'', ''democracy'', and ''social justice''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), passim. Kekes (1977, p. 71) offers ''art'', ''morality'', ''logic'', ''the novel'', ''nature'', ''rationality'', ''democracy'', ''culture'', ''science'', and ''philosophy'' as another set of examples of "concepts" that are ''essentially contested''.&lt;/ref&gt; (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as ''evil'', ''disease'', ''superstition'', etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).

Freeden remarks that "not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena",&lt;ref&gt;Freeden (1998), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerring&lt;ref&gt;Gerring (1999), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to "[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes".

These features distinguish Gallie's "essentially contested concepts" from others, "which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused";&lt;ref&gt;Gallie (1956a), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Gray&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1977), p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the "general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept" from those other "general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts":&lt;ref&gt;They are unpackings of, elaborations upon, or extensions of Gallie's original seven features that have been made by a very wide range of scholars spread over a wide range of academic and intellectual pursuits over the last 60 years.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Essentially contested concepts are ''evaluative'', and they deliver ''value-judgements''.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin stresses that whilst "''not all value judgements are appraisive''", "''[any act of] appraisal presupposes an accepted set of criteria''" (Baldwin (1997), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Essentially contested concepts denote comprehensively evaluated entities that have an ''internally complex'' character.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, Benn and Gaus (1983, pp. 3-5) advocate using the term "''complex-structured concepts''".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The evaluation must be attributed to the internally complex entity ''as a whole''. 
#The different ''constituent elements'' of that internally complex entity are initially ''variously describable''.
#The different users of the concept will often allocate substantially different orders of ''relative importance'', substantially different "''weights''", and/or substantially different ''interpretations'' to each of those constituent elements.
#Psychological and sociological causes influence the extent to which any particular ''consideration'' is ''salient'' for a given individual, regarded as a ''stronger reason'' by that individual than by another, and regarded as ''a reason'' by one individual and not by another.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The disputed concepts are ''open-ended''&lt;ref&gt;Gallie cites "''democracy''" an example of a concept being "''open''" in its character: "''Politics being the art of the possible, '''democratic targets will be raised or lowered as circumstances alter''', and democratic achievements are always judged in the light of such alterations''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 186, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; and vague, and are subject to considerable modification in the light of ''changing circumstances''.&lt;ref&gt;Because, in the absence of this condition, it is possible that experience could establish one ''instantiation'' as "''universally more acceptable than another''" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 174).&lt;/ref&gt;
#This further modification can neither be ''predicted'' nor ''prescribed'' in advance.
#Whilst, by Gallie's express stipulation, there is no ''best'' instantiation of an essentially contested concept (or, at least, none knowable to be the best), it is also obvious that some instantiations will be considerably ''better'' than others;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton (1985), p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; and, furthermore, even if one particular instantiation seems best at the moment, there is always the possibility that a new, better instantiation will emerge in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1990), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party knows and recognizes that its own peculiar usage/interpretation of the concept is disputed by others who, in their turn, hold different and quite incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;For, otherwise, it would only be, at best, an essentially "''contestable''" concept.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Each party must (at least to a certain extent) understand the criteria upon which the other participants’ (repudiated) views are based.
#Disputes centred on essentially contested concepts are "perfectly genuine", "not resolvable by argument",&lt;ref&gt;Connolly (1974, p. 40) expressed the view that once the participants in a particular political dispute realized that the concept was an essentially contested concept, the ensuing political discussions would be far more "''enlightened''" (Connolly, 1974, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nevertheless sustained by perfectly respectable arguments and evidence".&lt;ref&gt;All from Gallie (1956a), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Each party's use of their own specific usage/interpretation is driven by a need to ''uphold'' their own particular (''correct'', ''proper'' and ''superior'') usage/interpretation against that of all other (''incorrect'', ''improper'' and ''irrational'') users.
#Because the use of an essentially contested concept is always the application of one use ''against'' all other uses, any usage is intentionally ''aggressive'' and ''defensive''.
#Because it is essentially contested, rather than "radically confused", the continued use of the essentially contested concept is justified by the fact that, despite all of their on-going disputation, ''all'' of the competitors acknowledge that the contested concept is derived from a ''single common exemplar''.&lt;ref&gt;This agreement is ''a pre-requisite for'' the argument, it is not ''a consequence of'' the argument. See McKnight (2003), p. 261; and Perry (1977), p. 25. In an attempt to account for cases where disputants trace their individual notions back to ''entirely different'', but ''mutually compatible exemplars'', Connolly (1974, p. 14) proposes that we think of the shared exemplar as a "cluster concept".&lt;/ref&gt;
#The continued use of the essentially contested concept also helps to sustain and develop our understanding of the concept's original exemplar/s.

== Concepts and conceptions ==
Scholars such as [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[John Rawls]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], and [[Steven Lukes]] have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended [[Conflation#Logic|conflation]] of two separate domains associated with the term ''concept'':
: (a) the ''concepts'' (the abstract, ideal ''notions'' themselves), and
: (b) the ''conceptions'' (the particular ''instantiations'', or ''realizations'' of those ideal and abstract notions).&lt;ref&gt;The concept/conception terminology seems to originate with Gallie's (1956a) own comment that, whilst they might still continue to employ the contested ''concept'', the "different teams [could] come to hold… very different ''conceptions'' of how the game should be played" (p. 176, emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the "unity" of a notion and the "multiplicity" of its possible instantiations.

From their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different ''usage''.

In a section of his 1972 article in ''The New York Review of Books'', Dworkin used the example of "fairness" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a ''concept'' (''[[Jedem das Seine|suum cuique]]'') and its ''conception'' (various instantiations, for example [[utilitarian ethics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin (1972), pp. 27-28 (an almost identical passage appears at Dworkin, 1972, pp. 134-135). The four-paragraph passage is in Section II of the article [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10204]. It commences with "''But the theory of… ''" and ends with "''…I try to answer it ''".&lt;/ref&gt;

He supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others "unfairly" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular "examples" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he ''meant'' when he issued such instructions was not confined to those "examples" alone, for two reasons:

#"I would expect my children to apply my instructions to situations I had not and could not have thought about."
#"I stand ready to admit that some particular act I had thought was fair when I spoke was in fact unfair, or vice versa, if one of my children is able to convince me of that later."

Dworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any "change" to his original instructions, because the true ''meaning'' of his instructions was that "[he] meant the family to be guided by the ''concept'' of fairness, not by any specific ''conception'' of fairness [that he] might have had in mind". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, "cover" this new case.
 
Exploring what he considers to be the "crucial distinction" between the overall ''concept'' of "fairness" and some particular, and specific ''conception'' of "fairness", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are ''unfair''.&lt;ref&gt;These unfair acts involve either "a wrongful division of benefits and burdens, or a wrongful attribution of praise or blame".&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of this group "agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases".

In these circumstances, says Dworkin, "the group has a ''concept'' of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument."&lt;ref&gt;Emphasis added to original.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the members may still disagree over many of these "controversial cases"; and differences of this sort indicate that members ''have'', or ''act upon'', entirely different theories of why and how each of the "standard cases" are, in fact, genuine acts of "unfairness".

And, because each considers that certain principles "[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair" are far a more "fundamental" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different ''conceptions'' of "fairness".

Consequently, those responsible for giving "instructions", and those responsible for setting "standards" of "fairness", in this community may be doing one of two things:
#Appealing to the ''concept'' of "fairness", by demanding that others act "fairly". In this case, those instructed to act "fairly" are responsible for "developing and applying their own conception of fairness as controversial cases arise".&lt;ref&gt;He notes that this does not "[grant] them a discretion to act as they like''"; but, from the fact that "it assumes that one conception is superior to another", it is clear that "it sets a standard they must try — and may fail — to meet".&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those issuing the instructions (or setting the standards) may have quite different explanations underlying their actions; and, also, they may well change their explanations from time to time, without ever changing the standards they set.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, we could say, there is a demand for [[orthopraxy]] (the correctness of action), not for [[orthodoxy]] (the correctness of thought).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Laying down a particular ''conception'' of "fairness"; by, for example, specifying that all hard cases were to be decided "by applying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]]".

It is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different ''kinds'' of instruction:
#In the case of the appeal to the ''concept'' of "fairness", one invokes the ideal (and, implicitly, the universally agreed upon) notion of "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the best ''instantiation'' of that notion is, by and large, irrelevant. 
#In the case of laying down a ''conception'' of "fairness", one specifies what one believes to be the best instantiation of the notion "fairness"; and, by this action, one specifies what one ''means'' by "fairness"; and whatever one might believe is the ideal ''notion'' of "fairness" is, by and large, irrelevant.

As a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to "fairness", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of "fairness" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.

==Not "hotly disputed" concepts==
Whilst Gallie's expression "essentially contested concepts" precisely denotes those "essentially questionable and corrigible concepts" which "are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question",&lt;ref&gt;Hampshire (1965), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that "essentially disputed concepts" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:

#Gallie's term has led many to the mistaken belief that he spoke of ''hotly disputed'', rather than ''essentially disputed'' concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See Waldron (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Expressly stipulating that a specific issue can never be resolved, and then calling it a "contest" seems both absurd and misleading.&lt;ref&gt;There seems to be a radical fault in the very notion of a contest that can not by its nature be won or lost. (Gray, 1999, p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Any assertion that "essentially contested" concepts are ''[[Commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]]'' made at the same time as an assertion that "they have any common subject-matter" is incoherent; and, also, it reveals an "inconsistency in the idea of essential contestability".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1999), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Waldron]]'s research has revealed that Gallie's notion has "run wild" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like "very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight",&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002, p. 149) found that the following concepts had been labelled as "essentially contested" in the [[Westlaw]] database: alienation, autonomy, author, bankruptcy, boycott, citizenship, civil rights, coherence, community, competition, the Constitution, corruption, culture, discrimination, diversity, equality, equal protection, freedom, harm, justification, liberalism, merit, motherhood, the national interest, nature, popular sovereignty, pornography, power, privacy, property, proportionality, prosperity, prostitution, public interest, punishment, reasonable expectations, religion, republicanism, rights, sovereignty, speech, sustainable development, and textuality.&lt;/ref&gt; due to an entirely mistaken view&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the equivalent view about the term in general is reasonable: it merely uses the descriptive [[definition]]. The descriptive definition is still a definition, even if one may think it less interesting than Gallie's definition.&lt;/ref&gt; that the ''essential'' in Gallie's term is an "[[intensifier]]", when, in fact, "[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron (2002), pp. 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet is also clear that "if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all"{{clarify|date=May 2012}} (Gallie, 1956a, p.&amp;nbsp;188).

Thus, Gallie argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.&lt;ref&gt;Gallie, 1956a, pp. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Ezekiel's Vision''''' is a c. 1518 painting by [[Raphael]] showing the prophet [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah|vision of God in majesty]]. It is housed in the Palatine Gallery of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], central Italy.

==History==
The work is remembered by Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as property of a [[Bologna|Bolognese]] nobleman, Vincenzo Ercolani. There is trace of payment by him to Raphael for 8 [[ducat (Italian coin)|ducats]] in 1510, but this is generally considered just a down payment, since stylistically the work (inspired for example by [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]) cannot be dated before 1518.

In Florence since as early as 1589, it was ceded to [[Francesco I de' Medici]] and was placed at the [[Uffizi]]. The painting is known to be at Palazzo Pitti in 1697. In 1799 it was robbed by the French, who kept it in Paris until returning it back in 1816.

The work was once considered to be by the hand of [[Giulio Romano]], with Raphael providing only the drawing. However, it has been subsequently assigned to Raphael.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">'''Fooding''' is a brand of a restaurant guide and gastronomic events that was founded in 2000. A [[portmanteau|contraction]] of the words "food" and "feeling", the Fooding aims (in the words of [[Frédéric Mitterrand]]) to “defend a less-intimidating gastronomy for those who want to cook and nourish themselves in an unstuffy fashion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/restaurant/le-fooding-fete-ses-10-ans-et-ses-chefs_937012.html|title=Le Fooding fête ses 10 ans et ses chefs|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[neologism]] appeared for the first time in 1999 in a Nova Mag article by French journalist and food critic, Alexandre Cammas. It has since become the brand of an annual restaurant guide (in print, online, and smartphone application) and of often charitable international culinary events.

==The concept==

According to [[Adam Gopnik]] in his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' piece, the Fooding is to cuisine what the French New Wave was to French Cinema. The hidden goal was to Americanize French food without becoming American, just as the New Wave, back in the fifties and sixties, was about taking in Hollywood virtues without being Hollywoodized—taking in some of the energy and optimism and informality that the French still associate with American movies while reimagining them as something distinctly French".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik?currentPage=4|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fooding's mission across its editorial activities and events is to liberate cuisine from the traditional codes and conventions that confine it, to give chefs the possibility of expressing themselves more fully, and to give contemporary eaters a true taste of the times. Through opening this “freer channel in the gastronomic universe”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lhotellerie-restauration.fr/journal/restauration/2010-11/Le-Fooding-celebre-ses-10-ans.htm|title=Abonnement à L'Hôtellerie Restauration|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fooding emphasizes “the appetite for novelty and quality, rejection of boredom, love of fun, the ordinary, the sincere, and a yearning to eat with the times”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RX37xIhpNBUC&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Mangeur hypermoderne (Le)|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially established by Cammas along with fellow journalist and food critic Emmanuel Rubin, the Fooding was supported by [[Jean-François Bizot]] (founder of [[Actuel]] and [[Radio Nova (France)|Radio Nova]]), as well as by Bruno Delport, the director of Novapress. Since 2004, it has been under the support of Marine Bidaud, associate director of the Fooding.

==The guide==

As an independent food guide, Fooding pays the bills for its reviewers, proving this by posting meal receipts on its website. It also refuses to give ad space to the restaurants it reviews in an attempt to remain financially separate. These are the essential conditions, says Cammas, for preserving freedom of expression and taste. In 2012, Cammas published an opinion piece in ''[[Le Monde]]'', discussing the above conditions and defending the [[Michelin Guide]]’s ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2012/03/05/le-guide-michelin-doit-se-liberer-de-l-influence-des-grands-chefs_1651980_3232.html Le Monde, 05/03/2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though written entirely in French, the ''Tips in English'' allow Anglophones to follow the guide as well. The 2013 Fooding Guide, launched this November, now includes a section on favorite restaurants around the world.

==The paper guide==

The first editions of the Fooding guide (2000–2004) were released as special editions of [[Nova Magazine]]: ''Guide Fooding : 1000 adresses pour saliver Paris'' (''The Fooding Guide: 1000 restaurants to drool over in Paris''). In 2003 and 2004, two ''Fooding &amp; Style'' special issues were published as a supplement to Nova Magazine. In 2004, Nova Magazine stopped publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/culture/20041207.OBS3123/nova-mag-c-est-fini.html|title=Nova Mag , c'est fini|date=7 December 2004|work=nouvelobs.com|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, its special editions. In November 2005, the Paris Fooding Guide relaunched as a supplement to ''[[Libération]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/hors-serie/0101548670-fooding-le-guide-2006|title=Fooding Le guide 2006|work=liberation.fr|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of Louis Dreyfus. In December 2005, the website launched with the online edition of the Paris Guide. The France Fooding Guide was published for the first time in 2006, again in partnership with ''[[Libération]]''. As such, lefooding.com became a national guide.
In 2006 and 2007, the Fooding Guide followed Louis Dreyfus to the [[Nouvel Observateur]],&lt;ref name="e-marketing"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.e-marketing.fr/Breves/Le-guide-Fooding-rejoint-MediaObs-20727.htm |title=Le guide Fooding rejoint MediaObs (Fooding guide meets MediaObs)|journal=Vision Marketing|date=27 March 2007|publisher=e-marketing.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he took up the post of general director. The 2008 France Guide then became a special edition of the Novel Observateur during summer 2007 with the subtitle ''370 restaurants bien de chez nous – Guide vacances été 2007'' (''370 of our restaurants – Summer vacation guide 2007''). The 2008 Paris Guide came out in September 2007 with the subtitle ''400 restaurants pour embrasser le goût de l’époque'' (''400 restaurants that embrace the taste of the times''). In 2008, a few months after the death of Jean-François Bizot, the Fooding office moved in with the Inrockuptibles at the invitation of Frédéric Allary. In November 2008, for the first time in its history, the France Fooding Guide was published autonomously, under the exclusive direction of Alexandre Cammas and Marine Bidaud.

==Le Fooding App==

Launched at the end of October 2010, Le Fooding’s iPhone app was originally available for free until December 31, 2010. The application was downloaded 80,000 times in two months. Since January 1, 2011, the France Guide iPhone app has been available as a paid application (€3.59). It was described in GQ as “the application reserved for gentlemen”. In January 2013, the app was ranked 19th overall in top paid apps and 1st in the Food and Drink category.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.applicationiphone.com/top100/payant/)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Le Fooding Guide app for Android was released on Google Play (€3.59). In 2014, the app is available in English and in a Premium version, which also includes the hotel guide.&lt;ref&gt;(http://fwx.foodandwine.com/secrets/5-cool-hotels-france-le-fooding-s-essential-new-app)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Le Fooding Guide Writers==

==Controversies==
Even though most foreign observers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/05/100405fa_fact_gopnik|title=No Rules!|date=5 April 2010|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that Le Fooding contributes to the reinvention of the French culinary and event scene on an international scale, this is not always the case in France. Jean-Luc Petitrenaud in VSD wrote that Le Fooding is “a ridiculous trend for a few Parisian journalists looking for fame” (VSD, Winter 2004). Supporters of more traditional cuisine count several French journalistic institutions among Le Fooding’s main detractors. A now-famous debate between the journalist Paul Wermus (anti-Fooding) and Alexandre Cammas during Paul Amar’s TV program, Revu et Corrigé, is regularly featured in TV blooper shows.&lt;ref name="france5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videos.france5.fr/video/iLyROoafYlj6.html|title=Les Vidéos &amp;#124; Revoir les emissions en videos et streaming &amp;#124; France 5|publisher=videos.france5.fr|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2010, during the 10-year anniversary celebration of Le Fooding, then-current French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand surprised the world of gastronomy by presenting Le Fooding Award to a Brittany chef. A couple of days later, journalists Colette Monsat and François Simon questioned him in the November 19, 2010 issue of le Figaro, saying “You preach the values of traditional (French) cuisine but at the same time are an avid supporter of Le Fooding, which you praised this week for its playful, less formal approach to gastronomy.” The Minister responded, “You can love Rembrandt and Basquiat. By appreciating Basquiat, one comes to have a taste for Rembrandt, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/jaime-pot-feu-bouchees-reine-191110-23251|title= J’aime le pot-au-feu et les bouchées à la reine |author=Colette Monsat et François Simon|date=19 November 2010|work=Madame Figaro|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The '''Foundation for the Community of Artists''' was founded in 1971 as a support organization for working artists. By 1988 its membership had grown to nearly 6,000, including artists, art workers and representatives of art organizations. Although the majority lived in the New York metropolitan area, there were members located throughout the nation (there was at least one who lived in England). It remained active through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;FCA archives, NY, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

FCA grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the [[Art Workers Coalition|Art Workers' Coalition]]). From its inception, the organization strove to overcome problems fundamental to the lives of artists. Its initial service was a four-issue-per-year publication, the ''Art Workers Newsletter'', which functioned as an open forum for the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of news items important to the trade. Its name later became ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art Workers News]]'' and, in the early 1980s, its scope was broadened and it became the bi-monthly publication, ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art &amp; Artists]]''. Over the years, articles by leading artists, critics and educators, as well as information relating to health hazards,&lt;ref&gt;Art ''Workers News/Art &amp; Artists,'' libraries worldwide, http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=art+workers+news&amp;qt=results_page&lt;/ref&gt; legal and financial affairs, housing employment and exhibition spaces, appeared in its pages.

== Mission, Services, Accomplishments ==

The Foundation sought to respond to artist needs of the time. Programs included a five-day-a-week hotline to help artists with housing problems in the downtown Manhattan loft community; sponsorship of part of the [[CETA Artists Project (NYC Cultural Council Foundation 1978-80)|CETA Artists Project]] in the late 1970s; Artwork, a job referral and placement agency; and two programs dealing with sexual and racial discrimination.

It offered its members a choice of several group health insurance programs, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield hospitalization/major medical coverage, and a health maintenance/hospitalization plan (HMO) through Healthways, Inc.

In addition to ''Art &amp; Artists'', FCA published a bi-monthly, eight-page newsletter, ''Artist Update'', which listed grants, competitions, resources and other opportunities, and books of particular concern to the working artist, such as the original editions of Dr. Michael McCann’s ''[http://www.lyonspress.com/book/9781599213187 Health Hazards Manual for Artists]'' and Caryn Leland’s ''[https://www.amazon.com/art-law-primer-Caryn-Leland/dp/093303203X The Art Law Primer]''.

The Foundation participated in a national consortium of arts groups that focused on issues of living and working space for artists. Computerized lists of available space were kept up to date for the cities of Minneapolis, MN; Washington, DC; Oakland and Berkeley, CA; and New York City.

FCA regularly ran seminars and workshops covering such issues as marketing and publicity, the gallery system, copyright and tax law, art research libraries, “hotline” phone numbers and bulletin boards, art material suppliers, consultants, etc. The organization also helped artists prepare resumes, apply for grants and work out project budgets.

Through the Foundation, members could join the first nationwide credit union for artists of all disciplines. The [http://www.as-ap.org/content/foundation-community-artists Artists’ Community Federal Credit Union], as it was called, offered savings accounts, automatic payment of health insurance premiums, financial counseling and personal loans from $100 to $5,000. Members were also eligible to apply for a Working Assets VISA, a “socially responsible” credit card.

Besides these services, the Foundation for the Community of Artists served as an artists' advocacy group. It took an aggressive stand on issues such as resale royalties legislation, the labeling of art materials, artists’ living and working space, and discrimination against minority and women artists. It provided public testimony, studies, publications and press reports through the New York Arts Coalition and the Alliance of New York State Art Councils. In early 1984, FCA helped initiate the cultural campaign Art Against Apartheid, which advocated for the freedom of South Africa. It provided office space and organizational support for AAA's local and national exhibitions and performances. Some of these efforts were documented in ''Ikon'' magazine’s ''Art Against Apartheid: Works for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archives.worldlit.org/ikon-pdfs/IKON-5-6.pdf World Literature Today]'', University of Oklahoma, Norman, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

FCA received funding from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the Manhattan Borough President's Office, via the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]]. Membership fees, newspaper subscriptions, the sale of other publications, and the administration of the health plans also generated income. The work of many volunteers along with individual and corporate donations helped keep the organization operational.

== Structure ==

The Foundation's general policies and mode of operation were determined by its fifteen-member, self-sustaining board, elected once a year, composed primarily of artists. There was a salaried Executive Director, who was responsible for administration of the policies of the board and the daily operation of the organization. There was also an advisory council with ten members, which included artists and specialists in areas of expertise appropriate to the Foundation's concerns.

'''Frances Rosemary Walsh''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MNZM}} (born 10 January 1959) is a New Zealand [[screenwriter]], [[film producer]] and [[lyricist]]. She has won BAFTA and Academy awards for her music, film producing, and script writing. She is the long-time partner of filmmaker [[Peter Jackson]].

Fran Walsh has contributed to all of [[Peter Jackson]]'s films since 1989: as co-writer since ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'', and as producer since ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. She won three [[Academy Awards]] in 2003, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], all for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. She has received seven Oscar nominations.

==Early life==
Walsh was born into a family of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, and attended [[Wellington Girls' College]] intent on becoming a [[fashion designer]], but eventually became interested in music instead. Occasionally taking time off to perform in a [[punk music|punk]] band named The Wallsockets, she attended [[Victoria University of Wellington]] majoring in [[English literature]] and graduating in 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Career==
Walsh got her screen break writing material for New Zealand producer Grahame McLean on 1983 television film ''A Woman of Good Character (It's Lizzie to those Close)''. Later she wrote scripts for his TV show ''[[Worzel Gummidge Down Under]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/movies/middle-earth-wizards-not-so-silent-partner.html|title=Middle-Earth Wizard’s Not-So-Silent Partner|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2012-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh met Peter Jackson in the mid-1980s during the final stages of production on his low-budget movie ''[[Bad Taste]]'' where aliens serve humans as fast food,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Walsh has collaborated with Jackson on the scripts of all his subsequent films, after joining the writing quartet on his next film, the [[dark comedy]] ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/meet-the-feebles/oclc/123093764/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true|title=Formats and Editions of Meet the Feebles [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple then reteamed with writer [[Stephen Sinclair]] on the [[horror film|horror]]-comedy film that they had begun writing before Feebles, the zombie movie ''[[Braindead (1992 movie)|Braindead]]'' (retitled ''Dead Alive'' in the United States, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jackson|first=Peter|title=Dead alive.|date=2004|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/dead-alive/oclc/890284207&amp;referer=brief_results|last2=Walsh|last3=Balme|last4=Peñalver|last5=Moody|last6=Dasent|first2=Fran|first3=Tim|first4=Diana|first5=Elizabeth|first6=Peter|accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh and Jackson have not married (2015).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; They explored new ground with the [[drama]] ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994). The film that was Walsh's idea&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; was based on the friendship of the [[Parker-Hulme murder case|Parker-Hulme]] teenagers, who infamously later killed one of their mothers. The film earned the duo an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Walsh gave birth to Billy in 1995 and Katie in 1996. They returned to a more familiar genre with [[Universal Studios]] horror-comedy ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), their first film funded by an American studio.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} They were in talks with Universal to remake ''[[King Kong]]'' until 1998's ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' were first announced, and Universal decided against the film. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books|UPXbsJLVgCcC|page=168|plainurl=yes}}|title=King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson|last=Morton|first=Ray|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to try his hand at [[fantasy film|fantasy]], Jackson turned to [[Miramax]] to make a film based on the works of writer [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. In 1998, [[New Line Cinema]] provided the necessary financial backing to make a three-part adaptation of Tolkien's classic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Goldstein |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/24/entertainment/ca-15963 |title=New Line Gambles on Becoming Lord of the 'Rings' |website=latimes.com |date=24 August 1998 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh, with Jackson and [[Philippa Boyens]], is credited for writing the screenplays for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] (2001&amp;ndash;2003) (Stephen Sinclair has a writing credit on second film ''The Two Towers''). They shared many awards, including an [[76th Academy Awards|Oscar]] for their [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|adapted screenplay]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. She also was one of the film's producers and co-composer of two songs for ''Return of the King'', namely "[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]"&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

Walsh, Jackson, and Boyens continued their screenplay work together for the 2005 remake of ''[[King Kong (2005 movie)|King Kong]]'', which was given the [[greenlight]] by Universal after the Rings trilogy's success. The couple collaborated on the adaptation of the novel ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' and on the three-film adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Walsh prefers to remain more private than Jackson or Boyens; she did not contribute an interview to the bonus features on ''The Lord of the Rings'' movie [[DVD]]s; however, she did feature on the director/writers' [[Audio commentary (DVD)|commentary]] (where she and Jackson discussed that they felt one of them should remain a private figure for the good of their family). Her vocals were used as a significant part of the screech of the [[Nazgûl]] in the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

&lt;/noinclude&gt;[[File:Cibelesroma.JPG|300px|thumb|The fountain in 2009]]
The '''fountain of Cibeles''' in [[Mexico City]] is a bronze replica of the fountain located in the [[Plaza de Cibeles]] in [[Madrid]] that was built during the reign of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] by architect [[Ventura Rodríguez]] between 1777 and 1792. The Mexican version is located at a traffic circle where Oaxaca, Durango, Medellín and El Oro streets converge in [[Colonia Roma]].

It was installed in Mexico as a symbol of brotherhood between the Spanish and Mexican communities in 1980 and remodeled in 2011 as part of a remodeling and maintenance program by the government of Mexico City. It is considered to be one of the most emblematic sites in the city, along with the plaza where it is located&lt;ref name=" excelsior"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.excelsior.com.mx/index.php?m=nota&amp;seccion=seccion-comunidad&amp;cat=10&amp;id_nota=706481

==History==
[[File:Fuente de Cibeles - 04.jpg|thumb|Original fountain in [[Madrid]].]]

The Fountain was inaugurated on September 5, 1980, by Mexican President [[José López Portillo]], Madrid mayor, [[Enrique Tierno Galván]] and Mexico City mayor [[Carlos Hank González]].&lt;ref name=mexgob/&gt;
Féretro 

The fountain is located in a plaza which used to be the Plaza of Miraville “created in the 19th Century at the intersection of the antique carriageway of access to the lands that belonged to the family of the Third Countess of Miravalle”&lt;ref name=recorri2/&gt; Today they are Durango and Oaxaca streets. Underneath this plaza there was a well that served as the main source of drinking water for the [[Colonia Roma|Roma Burough]]&lt;ref name=recorri2&gt;{{cite web  | url= http://www.recorri2.com/portal/?id=364&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title= La Colonia Roma |accessdate=24 November 2012 |last= Pineda-Blancarte |first=Ángel |date=22 September 2007 |work=Recorri2 |language=spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; This copy of the Spanish fountain was donated by Spanish immigrants to Mexico.

In 2011, then-Mexico City mayor [[Marcelo Ebrard]] announced that the fountain was one of the 67 monuments to receive maintenance and remodelation. The renovation included the “reintegration of missing pieces, restoration of bronze sculptures, rehabilitation of the water system, improvement of green areas and illumination with the objective of reducing electring energy spending 30%”.&lt;ref name=universal/&gt; The re-inauguration of the fountain was on January 21, 2011, by the same mayor, the Spanish ambassador to Mexico Manuel Alabart, and Secretary of Works and Services of the Government of the Federal District, Fernando Aboitiz.&lt;ref name="  universal"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.eluniversaldf.mx/cuauhtemoc/nota19037.html |title= Remodelan fuente de La Cibeles en la Roma |accessdate=24 November 2012 |last= Balboa |first=Berenice |date=21 January 2011 |work=El Universal |language=spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and access==
The group of sculptures measures approximately 12.5 meters long, 4.7 meters in width and 5.5 meters tall with a weight of 12 tons.&lt;ref name= mexgob&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mexicocity.gob.mx/detalle.php?id_pat=5532|title=Fuente de la Cibeles |accessdate=24 November 2012 |work=SECTURDF |language=spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located two blocks away from [[Metro Insurgentes]] and two blocks away of the Durango [[Mexico City Metrobus|Metrobus]] station in the crossing of four streets: Oaxaca, Durango, Medellin and el Oro.

The fountain is located in the middle of a traffic circle surrounded by stores and restaurants that make up the Plaza Cibeles. Once a week, a flea market is installed and is commonly known as “el tianguis de la Cibeles” or “el bazar de Oro”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nunet.com.mx/nunet/articulo/mostrar_articulo_t/las-cibeles/2369/ |title= Las Cibeles |accessdate=24 November 2012 | work=Nunet |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish community ==
The fountain was donated by the community of Spanish residents in Mexico and was “erected as a symbol of brotherhood between both metropolis”, [[Mexico City]] and [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=mexgob/&gt;

The ambassador of Spain in Mexico, Manuel Alabart, thanked the head of government of the Federal District [[Marcelo Ebrard]] for the renovations made in 2011 of what he called an “emblematic space” that makes Madrid and Mexico City closer, as well as for the “warmth and hospitality the city gives to almost 40 thousand spanish that live in the Federal District”.&lt;ref name=universal/&gt;  Ebrard also mentioned the importante of the emblematic work of the remodelation that “strengthens the ties of friendship between Spain and Mexico.&lt;ref name="  cronicas"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cronicasdelaemigracion.com/articulo/cronicas/rehabilitada-la-fuente-de-la-cibeles-de-mexico-simbolo-de-union-con-espana/20110124115854021674.html|title= Rehabilitada fuente de La Cibeles de México, símbolo de unión con España |accessdate=24 November 2012 |last= Cabrero |first=Cristian |date=24 January 2011 |work=Crónicas de la Emigración |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the trade surrounding the Plaza Cibeles is known for its Madrilenian style and influence.&lt;ref name="  oem"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldemexico/notas/n2763314.htm|title= Símbolo de hermandad entre México y Madrid |accessdate=24 November 2012 |last=González |first=Alberto |date=8 November 2012 |work=El Sol de México |language=spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also become a tradition for the fountain to be invaded by fanatics of the Spanish soccer team in celebration of its victories.&lt;ref name= terra&gt;{{cite news | url= http://deportes.terra.com.mx/arman-festin-en-cibeles-mexicana,ad93d8937e448310VgnVCM4000009bcceb0aRCRD.html|title= Arman festín en Cibeles mexicana |accessdate=24 November 2012 |date=1 July 2012 |work= Terra Deportes |language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="  medio"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://msn.mediotiempo.com/futbol/euro/noticias/2012/07/01/espanoles-celebran-bicampeonato-en-mexico|title= Españoles celebran bicampeonato en México |accessdate=24 November 2012 |last= Collazo |first=Jonathan |date=1 July 2012 |work=MedioTiempo |language=spanish  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The fountain consists of the statue of the goddess [[Cybele]], Roman goddess of fertility, who wears a crown and carries a scepter and key, symbols of her power of Earth and the stations and goes in a carriage pulled by lions.&lt;ref name=recorri2/&gt; The lions represent [[Hippomenes]] and [[Atalanta]], one of the huntresses of the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

'''Gilbert Arthur à Beckett''' (1837 – October 15, 1891) was an [[England|English]] writer.

== Biography ==
Beckett was born at Portland House [[Hammersmith]], on 7 April 1837, the eldest son of the civil servant and humorist [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]] and the composer [[Mary Anne à Beckett]], daughter of Joseph Glossop, clerk of the cheque to the hon. corps of gentlemen-at-arms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
His brother was [[Arthur William à Beckett]]. 
He graduated from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Oxford]], as a Westminster scholar in 1860.
He was entered at [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 15 October 1857, but gave his attention chiefly to drama, producing ''Diamonds and Hearts'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1867; this was followed by other light comedies.  
His adaptation of a French operetta by [[Émile Jonas]] called ''The Two Harlequins'' opened the new [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] in 1868, together with his distant cousin, [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s, ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and another piece.

Beckett's pieces include numerous [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]]s and [[pantomime]]s, the libretti of ''Savonarola'' (Hamburg, 1884) and ''The Canterbury Pilgrims'' (Drury Lane, 1884) for the music of Dr. [[C. V. Stanford]].{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}
With the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], Beckett wrote the operetta ''Two Foster Brothers'' ([[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]], 1877).

In 1879, he had been asked by [[Tom Taylor]], the editor of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of ''Punch.'' 
Three years later he was 'appointed to the Table.' 
The ''Punch'' dinners 'were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of [[Gower Street station]], rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punch's staircase, a matter of painful exertion'. 
To ''Punch'' he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boy's sensational shocker (March 1882), and he developed Jerrold's idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading 'How we advertise now.' 
The idea of one of Sir [[John Tenniel]]'s best cartoons for ''Punch,'' entitled 'Dropping the Pilot,' illustrative of Bismarck's resignation in 1889, was due to him.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

Apart from his work on 'Punch,' he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds' entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|300px|Scene from ''The Happy Land'', showing the impersonation of Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', March 22, 1873]]
On 3 March 1873, ''[[The Happy Land]]'' was given at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]''. 
In this amusing piece of banter three statesmen (Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton) were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing 'Mr. G.,' 'Mr. L.,' and 'Mr. A.' were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their 'make-up.'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

In the following year, he furnished the 'legend' to [[Herman Merivale]]'s tragedy 'The White Pilgrim,' first given at the Court in February 1874. 
At the close of his life he furnished the 'lyrics' and most of the book for the operetta 'La Cigale,' which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

In 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

==Legacy==
''Punch'' devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph 'Wearing the white flower of a blameless life' (24 Oct. 1891). His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of 'The Mahogany Tree' (''Punch'', Jubilee Number, 18 July 1887), and likenesses were also given in the 'Illustrated London News' and in Spielmann's 'History of Punch' (1895).{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}} 
==Family==
He married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896 Mr. Hugh Clifford, C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}

The '''Government College of Fine Arts''' (initially known as the '''Madras School of Art''') in [[Chennai]] is the oldest art institution in [[India]]. The institution was established in 1850 by surgeon Alexander Hunter as a private art school. In 1852, after being taken over by the government, it was renamed as the Government School of Industrial Arts.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/04/03/stories/2009040350570300.htm|title=Where creativity thrives|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|author=Chakravarthy, Pradeep|date=3 April 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, it was renamed as the Government School of Arts and Crafts and the Government College of Arts and Crafts, before finally being renamed as present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/08/stories/2003040800160300.htm|title=Down memory lane|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During British rule in India, the crown found that [[Madras]] had many talented and artistic minds.  As the British had also established a settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royals in [[London]].  At first traditional artists were employed to produce furniture, metalwork, and curios, and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.  The institute established itself as the first school of art in India, predating the [[University of Madras]]. The school was located at Popham’s Broadway. In 1852, it was shifted to its present premises, a four-acre campus on Poonamallee High Road.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

In 1928, Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury joined as its vice-principal and in 1929, he became its first Indian principal. He was the principal until 1957. He was succeeded by [[K.C.S. Paniker]]. Later, a number of noted artists held the role of principal, including R. Krishna Rao, [[S. Dhanapal]], K.L. Munuswamy, A.P. Santhanaraj and [[C.J.Anthony Doss]].

In 1966, former principal [[K.C.S. Paniker]], along with his students and some artists associated with the college, founded the [[Cholamandal Artists' Village]], near [[Chennai]], vwhich is still considered one of the '10 biggest art moments' in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courses offered ==
The institute offers courses leading to the Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees [Faculty of Engineering] in painting, sculpture, visual communication, commercial arts, textile design, graphic arts and ceramics. It offers postgraduate programmes in painting, visual communication, textile designs and ceramics. In 2009, it started offering a course leading to the master's degree in Fine Arts in sculpture.

== Notable alumni ==

[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|right|The manipulations of this [[Rubik's Cube]] form the [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''group''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[element (mathematics)|elements]] equipped with a [[binary operation]] which combines any two elements to form a third element. To be a group, this operation must satisfy four conditions called the group [[axiom]]s, namely [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]], [[associativity]], [[identity element|identity]] and [[Inverse elements|invertibility]]. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of [[integer]]s together with the [[addition]] operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely.  It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in [[abstract algebra]] and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2, p. 26|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hall|year = 1967|loc = §1.1, p. 1|nb = yes}}: "The idea of a group is one which pervades the whole of mathematics both pure and applied."&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of [[symmetry]]. For example, a [[symmetry group]] encodes symmetry features of a [[geometry|geometrical]] object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. [[Lie group]]s are the symmetry groups used in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]; [[Poincaré group]]s, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying [[special relativity]]; and [[point group]]s are used to help understand [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry]].

The concept of a group arose from the study of [[polynomial equations]], starting with [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s.  After contributions from other fields such as [[number theory]] and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870.  Modern [[group theory]]—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.{{cref|a}} To explore groups, mathematicians have devised [[Glossary of group theory|various notions]] to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as [[subgroup]]s, [[quotient group]]s and [[simple group]]s. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of [[representation theory]] (that is, through the [[group representation|representations of the group]]) and of [[computational group theory]].  A theory has been developed for [[finite group]]s, which culminated with the [[classification of finite simple groups]], completed in 2004.{{cref|aa}} Since the mid-1980s, [[geometric group theory]], which studies [[finitely generated group]]s as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.

== Definition and illustration==

===First example: the integers===
One of the most familiar groups is the set of [[integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which consists of the numbers
:..., −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&amp;nbsp;...,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = App. 2, p. 360|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[addition]].
The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.

*For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'', the [[Summation|sum]] ''a'' + ''b'' is also an integer. That is, addition of integers always yields an integer. This property is known as ''[[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]'' under addition.
*For all integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').   Expressed in words, adding ''a'' to ''b'' first, and then adding the result to ''c'' gives the same final result as adding ''a'' to the sum of ''b'' and ''c'', a property known as ''[[associativity]]''.
*If ''a'' is any integer, then 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''. [[Zero]] is called the ''[[identity element]]'' of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.
*For every integer ''a'', there is an integer ''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' = 0. The integer ''b''  is called the ''[[inverse element]]'' of the integer ''a'' and is denoted −''a''.

The integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following [[definition]] is developed.

A group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''G'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] • (called the ''group law'' of ''G'') that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element, denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} or ''ab''. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}, must satisfy four requirements known as the ''group axioms'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.1, p. 27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', the result of the operation, ''a'' • ''b'', is also in ''G''.{{cref|b}}
;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''G'', (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'').
;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''G'' such that, for every element ''a'' in ''G'', the equation {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} holds. Such an element is unique ([[#Uniqueness of identity element and inverses|see below]]), and thus one speaks of ''the'' identity element. 
;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''G'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''G'', commonly denoted ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (or −''a'', if the operation is denoted "+"), such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.

The result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element ''a'' with element ''b'' need not yield the same result as combining element ''b'' with element ''a''; the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}}
may not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} for any two integers  ([[commutativity]] of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}} always holds are called ''[[abelian group]]s'' (in honor of [[Niels Henrik Abel]]). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.

The identity element of a group ''G'' is often written as 1 or 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Identity Element |urlname=IdentityElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notation inherited from the [[multiplicative identity]]. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as ''id''.

The set ''G'' is called the ''underlying set'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Often the group's underlying set ''G'' is used as a short name for the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as "a subset of the group ''G''" or "an element of group ''G''" are used when what is actually meant is "a subset of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}" or "an element of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}".  Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like ''G'' refers to a group or to an underlying set.

An alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the "there exists" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being
the group law, as above, which is a [[binary operation]],
the ''inverse operation'', which is a [[unary operation]] and maps {{mvar|a}} to &lt;math&gt;a^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;
and the identity element, which is viewed as a [[0-ary function|0-ary operation]].

As this formulation of the definition avoids [[existential quantifier]]s, it is generally preferred for [[computational group theory|computing with groups]] and for [[computer-aided proof]]s. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of [[universal algebra]]. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining [[topological group]]s and [[group object]]s.

=== Second example: a symmetry group ===
Two figures in the plane are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if one can be changed into the other using a combination of [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, and [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s.  Any figure is congruent to itself.  However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called [[symmetry|symmetries]]. A square has eight symmetries. These are:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ The elements of the symmetry group of the square (D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Vertices are identified by color or number.

* the [[identity operation]] leaving everything unchanged, denoted id;
* rotations of the square around its center by 90° clockwise, 180° clockwise, and 270° clockwise, denoted by r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively;
* reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;), or through the two [[diagonal]]s (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;).
{{clear}}

These symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function.  These symmetries determine a group called the [[dihedral group]] of degree 4 and denoted D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is [[function composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.6, p. 54|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.  The result of performing first ''a'' and then ''b'' is written symbolically ''from right to left'' as
:{{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} ("apply the symmetry ''b'' after performing the symmetry ''a''").
The right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.

The [[group table]] on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and then reflecting horizontally (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:
:{{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:
{{ordered list
|1= The closure axiom demands that the composition {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} of any two symmetries ''a'' and ''b'' is also a symmetry. Another example for the group operation is
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;,}}
i.e., rotating 270° clockwise after reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along the counter-diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). Indeed every other combination of two symmetries still gives a symmetry, as can be checked using the group table.

|2= The associativity constraint deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square.  One of these ways is to first compose ''a'' and ''b'' into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with ''c''.  The other way is to first compose ''b'' and ''c'', then to compose the resulting symmetry with ''a''.  The associativity condition
:{{nowrap|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}}
means that these two ways are the same, i.e., a product of many group elements can be simplified in any grouping.
For example, {{nowrap|1=(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be checked using the group table at the right
{{aligned table|cols=5|style=margin-left:1.2em
|(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which equals
|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)|{{=}}|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;|{{=}}|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
}}
While associativity is true for the symmetries of the square and addition of numbers, it is not true for all operations.  For instance, subtraction of numbers is not associative: {{nowrap|(7 − 3) − 2 {{=}} 2}} is not the same as {{nowrap|7 − (3 − 2) {{=}} 6.}}

|3= The identity element is the symmetry id leaving everything unchanged: for any symmetry ''a'', performing id after ''a'' (or ''a'' after id) equals ''a'', in symbolic form,
: {{nowrap|1=id • ''a'' = ''a'',}}
: {{nowrap|1=''a'' • id = ''a''.}}

|4= An inverse element undoes the transformation of some other element. Every symmetry can be undone: each of the following transformations—identity id, the reflections f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the 180° rotation r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—is its own inverse, because performing it twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are each other's inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. In symbols,
:{{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id,}}
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id.}}
}}

In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: {{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} but {{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.}} In other words, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.

== History ==
{{Main|History of group theory}}
The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]], extending prior work of [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of its [[root of a function|roots]] (solutions).  The elements of such a [[Galois group]] correspond to certain [[permutation]]s of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; More general [[permutation group]]s were investigated in particular by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 1'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a [[finite group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Cayley|year=1889|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §III.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After novel geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] and [[projective geometry]] had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, [[Sophus Lie]] founded the study of [[Lie group]]s in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Lie|year=1973|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third field contributing to group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been used implicitly in [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' number-theoretical work ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, [[Ernst Kummer]] made early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]  by developing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §I.3.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with [[Camille Jordan]]'s ''Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Jordan|year=1870|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an "abstract group", in the terminology of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=von Dyck|year=1882|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] and [[William Burnside]], who worked on [[representation theory]] of finite groups, [[Richard Brauer]]'s [[modular representation theory]] and [[Issai Schur]]'s papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Lie groups, and more generally [[locally compact group]]s was studied by [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Élie Cartan]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Mackey|year=1976|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, was first shaped by [[Claude Chevalley]] (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Jacques Tits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Borel|year=2001|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Chicago]]'s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as [[Daniel Gorenstein]], [[John G. Thompson]] and [[Walter Feit]], laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], with the final step taken by [[Michael Aschbacher|Aschbacher]] and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.{{cref|a}}

Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under ''elementary group theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Ledermann|year = 1953|loc = §1.2, pp. 4–5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mathematical induction|repeated]] applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
:''a'' • ''b'' • ''c'' = (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')
generalizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §I.1, p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a [[left identity]] and [[left inverse element|left inverse]]s. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness of identity element and inverses===
Two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of ''the'' identity, and ''the'' inverse of an element.&lt;ref name="lang2005"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of ''a'', suppose that ''a'' has two inverses, denoted ''b'' and ''c'', in a group (''G'', •). Then

:{|
|''b'' ||=||''b'' • ''e'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||as ''e'' is the identity element
|-
| ||=||''b'' • (''a'' • ''c'') ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||because ''c'' is an inverse of ''a'', so ''e'' = ''a'' • ''c''
|-
| ||=||(''b'' • ''a'') • ''c'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||by associativity, which allows rearranging the parentheses
|-
| ||=||''e'' • ''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||since ''b'' is an inverse of ''a'', i.e., ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e''
|-
| ||=||''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| for ''e'' is the identity element
|}

The term ''b'' on the first line above and the ''c'' on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of ''a''.  Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume ''G'' is a group with two identity elements ''e'' and ''f''. Then ''e'' = ''e'' • ''f'' = ''f'', hence ''e'' and ''f'' are equal.

===&lt;span id="translation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Division===
In groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that [[division (mathematics)|division]] is possible: given elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the group ''G'', there is exactly one solution ''x'' in ''G'' to the [[equation]] {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="lang2005"/&gt; In fact, we have 
:{{nowrap|1= (''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) • ''a'' =  ''b'' • (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a'') = ''b'' • ''e'' = ''b''.}}
Uniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}} by {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The element {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, often denoted {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}, is called the ''right quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', or the result of the ''right division'' of ''b'' by ''a''.

Similarly there is exactly one solution ''y'' in ''G'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''y'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''b''}}. This solution is the ''left quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', and is sometimes denoted {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}}.

In general {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}} may be different, but, if the group operation is [[commutative]] (that is, if the group is [[abelian group|abelian]]), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an [[addition]], and one talks of ''subtraction'' and ''difference'' instead of division and quotient.

A consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element ''g'' is a [[bijection]]. Specifically, if ''g'' is an element of the group ''G'', the [[function (mathematics)]] from ''G'' to itself that maps {{nowrap|''h'' ∈ ''G''}} to {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}} is a bijection. This function is called the ''left translation'' by ''g'' . Similarly, the ''right translation'' by ''g'' is the bijection from ''G'' to itself, that maps ''h'' to {{nowrap|''h'' • ''g''}}. If ''G'' is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.

== Basic concepts ==
:&lt;div class="dablink"&gt;''The following sections use [[table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] such as'' {{nowrap|1=''X'' = {''x'', ''y'', ''z''} }} ''to denote a [[set (mathematics)|set]]'' ''X'' ''containing [[element (mathematics)|elements]]'' ''x'', ''y'', ''and'' ''z'', ''or alternatively'' {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} ''to restate that'' ''x'' ''is an element of'' ''X''. ''The notation'' {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} ''means'' ''f'' ''is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] assigning to every element of'' ''X'' ''an element of'' ''Y''.&lt;/div&gt;

To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed.{{cref|c}} There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being "structureless", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be ''compatible'' with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of "preserving structures"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], in this case the [[category of groups]].&lt;ref name="MacLane"/&gt;

===Group homomorphisms===
{{Main|Group homomorphism}}
''Group homomorphisms''{{cref|g}} are functions that preserve group structure.  A function {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} between two groups {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}} and {{nowrap|(''H'', ∗)}} is called a ''homomorphism'' if the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'' • ''k'') = ''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''k'')}}
holds for all elements ''g'', ''k'' in ''G''. In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map ''a''. This requirement ensures that {{nowrap|1=''a''(1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and also {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of ''G'' provided by the group axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.3, p. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups ''G'' and ''H'' are called ''[[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]]'' if there exist group homomorphisms {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} and {{nowrap|''b'': ''H'' → ''G''}}, such that applying the two functions [[function composition|one after another]] in each of the two possible orders gives the [[identity function]]s of ''G'' and ''H''. That is, {{nowrap|1=''a''(''b''(''h'')) = ''h''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b''(''a''(''g'')) = ''g''}} for any ''g'' in ''G'' and ''h'' in ''H''. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that {{nowrap|1=''g'' • ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for some element ''g'' of ''G'' is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to proving that {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''g'') = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, because applying ''a'' to the first equality yields the second, and applying ''b'' to the second gives back the first.

===Subgroups===
{{Main|Subgroup}}
Informally, a ''subgroup'' is a group ''H'' contained within a bigger one, ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretely, the identity element of ''G'' is  contained in ''H'', and whenever ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in ''H'', then so are {{nowrap|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; •  ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the elements of ''H'', equipped with the group operation on ''G'' restricted to ''H'', indeed form a group.

In the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations  270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The [[subgroup test]] is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a nonempty subset ''H'' of a group ''G'' to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' ∈ ''H''}} for all elements {{nowrap|''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''}}. Knowing [[lattice of subgroups|the subgroups]] is important in understanding the group as a whole.{{cref|d}}

Given any subset ''S'' of a group ''G'', the subgroup generated by ''S'' consists of products of elements of ''S'' and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of ''G'' containing ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §II.12, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; consists of these two elements, the identity element id and {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.

===Cosets===
{{Main|Coset}}
In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup ''H'' defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of ''H'' by arbitrary group elements ''g''. In symbolic terms, the ''left'' and ''right'' cosets of ''H'' containing ''g'' are

:{{nowrap|1=''gH'' = {''g'' • ''h'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''} }} and {{nowrap|1=''Hg'' = {''h'' • ''g'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''},}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left cosets of any subgroup ''H'' form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of ''G''; that is, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of all left cosets is equal to ''G'' and two left cosets are either equal or have an [[empty set|empty]] [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first case {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''H''}} happens [[if and only if|precisely when]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''H''}}, i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of ''H''. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of ''H''. The left and right cosets of ''H'' may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all ''g'' in ''G'', {{nowrap|1=''gH'' = ''Hg''}}, then ''H'' is said to be a ''[[normal subgroup]]''.

In D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets ''gR'' of the subgroup ''R'' consisting of the rotations are either equal to ''R'', if ''g'' is an element of ''R'' itself, or otherwise equal to {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = {f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;} }} (highlighted in green). The subgroup ''R'' is also normal, because {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = ''U'' = ''R''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and similarly for any element other than f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. (In fact, in the case of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}.)

===Quotient groups===
{{Main|Quotient group}}
In some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a ''quotient group'' or ''factor group''. For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Given any normal subgroup ''N'', the quotient group is defined by
:''G'' / ''N'' = {''gN'', ''g'' ∈ ''G''}, "''G'' modulo ''N''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group ''G'': {{nowrap|1=(''gN'') • (''hN'') = (''gh'')''N''}} for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''. This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}} that associates to any element ''g'' its coset ''gN'' be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called [[universal property|universal properties]]. The coset {{nowrap|1=''eN '' = ''N''}} serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of ''gN'' in the quotient group is {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)''N''}}.{{cref|e}}

{| class="wikitable" style="float:right; text-align:center; margin:.5em 0 .5em 1em; width:200px;"

The elements of the quotient group {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} are ''R'' itself, which represents the identity, and {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}. The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, {{nowrap|1=''U'' • ''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;)''R'' = ''R''}}. Both the subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from its subgroup ''R'' and the quotient {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} is abstracted by a notion called [[semidirect product]].

Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its ''[[presentation of a group|presentation]]'': any group is the quotient of the [[free group]] over the ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of ''relations''. The dihedral group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, can be generated by two elements ''r'' and ''f'' (for example, ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the right rotation and ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations
:''r ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''r'' • ''f'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the [[Cayley graph]], a device used to graphically capture [[discrete group]]s.

Sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset ''H'' of ''G'' can be seen as an [[injective]] map {{nowrap|''H'' → ''G''}}, i.e., any element of the target has at most one [[preimage|element that maps to it]]. The counterpart to injective maps are [[surjective]] maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}}.{{cref|y}} Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. [[Kernel (algebra)|Kernel]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of group homomorphisms and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] address this phenomenon.

Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group '''Z''' of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition [[multiplication]] is considered, one obtains [[multiplicative group]]s. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in [[abstract algebra]].

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by [[functor|associating]] groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, [[Henri Poincaré]] founded what is now called [[algebraic topology]] by introducing the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Hatcher|year = 2002|loc = Chapter I, p. 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this connection, [[Glossary of topology|topological properties]] such as [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|proximity]] and [[continuous function|continuity]] translate into properties of groups.{{cref|i}} For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered [[null-homotopic]] (and thus irrelevant), because it can be [[homotopy|continuously shrunk]] to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop [[winding number|winding once]] around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

In more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background.{{cref|j}} In a similar vein, [[geometric group theory]] employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Coornaert|last2 = Delzant|last3=Papadopoulos|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further branches crucially applying groups include [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;for example, [[class group]]s and [[Picard group]]s; see {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}, in particular §§I.12 and I.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. [[Cryptography]] relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with [[algorithm]]ical knowledge obtained in [[computational group theory]], in particular when implemented for finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Seress|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[computer science]] benefit from the concept.

=== Numbers ===
Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Further [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts such as [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]] also form groups.

==== Integers ====
The group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; under addition, denoted &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of [[multiplication]] instead of addition, &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; do ''not'' form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}} is an integer, but the only solution to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a · b'' = 1}} in this case is {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1/2}}, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a (multiplicative) inverse.{{cref|k}}

==== Rationals ====
The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
:&lt;math alt="a/b"&gt;\frac{a}{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
Fractions of integers (with ''b'' nonzero) are known as [[rational number]]s.{{cref|l}} The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. There is still a minor obstacle for &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number [[0 (number)|0]] does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' · 0 = 1}}), &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; is still not a group.

However, the set of all ''nonzero'' rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\}=\left\{q\in\mathbb{Q}\mid q\neq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^*&lt;/math&gt;.{{cref|m}} Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of ''a''/''b'' is ''b''/''a'', therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.

The rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and—if division is possible, such as in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;—[[field (mathematics)|fields]], which occupy a central position in [[abstract algebra]]. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.{{cref|n}}

===Modular arithmetic===

[[File:Clock group.svg|thumb|right|The hours on a clock form a group that uses [[Modular arithmetic|addition modulo]] 12. Here 9 + 4 = 1.]]
In [[modular arithmetic]], two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the ''modulus.'' The result of modular addition is the [[remainder]] of that division. For any modulus, ''n'', the set of integers from 0 to {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element ''a'' is {{nowrap|''n'' − ''a''}}, and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a [[12-hour clock|clock]]: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 "modulo 12" or, in symbols,
:9 + 4 ≡ 1 modulo 12.
The group of integers modulo ''n'' is written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any [[prime number]] ''p'', there is also the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''p'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its elements are the integers 1 to {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}. The group operation is multiplication modulo ''p''. That is, the usual product is divided by ''p'' and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, {{nowrap|1=4 · 4 = 1}}, because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1.  for 5 divides {{nowrap|1=16 − 1 = 15}}, denoted
:16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).
The primality of ''p'' ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by ''p'' is not divisible by ''p'' either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication.{{cref|o}} The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer ''a'' not divisible by ''p'', there exists an integer ''b'' such that
:''a''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1 (mod ''p''), i.e., ''p'' divides the difference {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b'' − 1}}.
The inverse ''b'' can be found by using [[Bézout's identity]] and the fact that the [[greatest common divisor]] {{nowrap|gcd(''a'', ''p'')}} equals 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rosen|year = 2000|loc = p. 54 (Theorem 2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}} above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as {{nowrap|1=3 · 2 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)}}. Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; above: it consists of exactly those elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; that have a multiplicative inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §VIII.1, p. 292}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are denoted '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. They are crucial to [[public-key cryptography]].{{cref|p}}

===Cyclic groups===
{{Main|Cyclic group}}
[[Image:Cyclic group.svg|right|thumb|upright|The 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group. ''z'' is a primitive element, but ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not, because the odd powers of ''z'' are not a power of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
A ''cyclic group'' is a group all of whose elements are [[power (mathematics)|powers]] of a particular element ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are:
:..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ...,
where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means ''a'' • ''a'', and ''a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'' stands for ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''a'' • ''a'' • ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; etc.{{cref|h}} Such an element ''a'' is called a generator or a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive element]] of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as
: ..., −''a''−''a'', −''a'', 0, ''a'', ''a''+''a'', ...

In the groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1.  Any cyclic group with ''n'' elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of [[root of unity|''n''-th complex roots of unity]], given by [[complex number]]s ''z'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular ''n''-gon, as shown in blue at the right for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with ''z'' corresponds to a [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] rotation by 60°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.2, p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using some [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], the group '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, 3 is a generator since {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 3}}, {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 ≡ 4}}, {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 2}}, and {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1}}.

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements.  In these groups, for every non-zero element ''a'', all the powers of ''a'' are distinct; despite the name "cyclic group", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the group of integers under addition introduced above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22 (example 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.

The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as [[Center (group theory)|center]] and [[commutator]], describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.5, p. 26, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry groups===
{{Main|Symmetry group}}
{{see also|Molecular symmetry|Space group|Symmetry in physics}}
''Symmetry groups'' are groups consisting of [[symmetry|symmetries]] of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as [[polynomial equation]]s and their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Weyl|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.{{cref|t}} [[Symmetry in mathematics|Symmetries in mathematics]] greatly simplify the study of [[geometry|geometrical]] or [[analysis|analytical objects]]. A group is said to [[group action|act]] on another mathematical object ''X'' if every group element performs some operation on ''X'' compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.

[[Image:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|right|thumb|200px|Rotations and reflections form the symmetry group of a [[great icosahedron]].]]
In chemical fields, such as [[crystallography]], [[space group]]s and [[point group]]s describe [[molecular symmetry|molecular symmetries]] and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] analysis of these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Conway|last2= Delgado Friedrichs|last3 = Huson|last4 = Thurston|year = 2001}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Bishop|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.

Not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The [[Jahn-Teller effect]] is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.&lt;ref name=Bersuker&gt;{{citation |title=The Jahn-Teller Effect |first= Isaac |last= Bersuker |page=2 |isbn=0-521-82212-2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Jahn|last2=Teller|year = 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a [[phase transition]], for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is [[ferroelectric]] materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the [[Curie temperature]] and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft [[phonon]] mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{citation |title=Structure and Dynamics: an atomic view of materials |first=Martin T|last= Dove |page=265 |isbn=0-19-850678-3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of [[Goldstone boson]]s.

Finite symmetry groups such as the [[Mathieu group]]s are used in [[coding theory]], which is in turn applied in [[forward error correction|error correction]] of transmitted data, and in [[CD player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Welsh|year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is [[differential Galois theory]], which characterizes functions having [[antiderivative]]s of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain [[differential equation]]s are well-behaved.{{cref|u}} Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in [[geometric invariant theory|(geometric)]] [[invariant theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Mumford|last2 = Fogarty|last3 = Kirwan|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General linear group and representation theory===
{{Main|General linear group|Representation theory}}
[[Image:Matrix multiplication.svg|right|thumb|250px|Two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] (the left illustration) multiplied by matrices (the middle and right illustrations). The middle illustration represents a clockwise rotation by 90°, while the right-most one stretches the ''x''-coordinate by factor 2.]]
[[Matrix group]]s consist of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] together with [[matrix multiplication]]. The ''general linear group'' {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} consists of all [[invertible matrix|invertible]] ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with [[real number|real]] entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lay|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its subgroups are referred to as ''matrix groups'' or ''[[linear group]]s''. The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''). It describes all possible rotations in ''n'' dimensions. Via [[Euler angles]], [[Rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] are used in [[computer graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Kuipers|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Representation theory'' is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups.&lt;ref name=FultonHarris&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Fulton|last2 = Harris|year = 1991|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Serre|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the group by its [[group action]]s on other spaces. A broad class of [[group representation]]s are linear representations, i.e., the group is acting on a [[vector space]], such as the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A representation of ''G'' on an ''n''-[[dimension]]al real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
:''ρ'': ''G'' → GL(''n'', '''R''')
from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.{{cref|w}}

Given a group action, this gives further means to study the object being acted on.{{cref|x}} On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, especially (locally) [[compact group]]s.&lt;ref name="FultonHarris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rudin|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galois groups ===
{{Main|Galois group}}
''Galois groups'' were developed to help solve [[polynomial equation]]s by capturing their symmetry features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Robinson|year = 1996|loc = p. viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of the [[quadratic equation]] {{nowrap|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'' = 0}} are given by
:&lt;math alt="x = (negative b plus or minus the squareroot of (b squared minus 4 a c)) over 2a"&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Exchanging "+" and "−" in the expression, i.e., permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Similar formulae are known for [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s, but do ''not'' exist in general for [[quintic equation|degree 5]] and higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = Chapter VI}} (see in particular p. 273 for concrete examples)&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their [[solvable group|solvability]]) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals, i.e., solutions expressible using solely addition, multiplication, and [[Nth root|roots]] similar to the formula above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 292 (Theorem VI.7.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem can be dealt with by shifting to [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] and considering the [[splitting field]] of a polynomial.  Modern [[Galois theory]] generalizes the above type of Galois groups to [[field extension]]s and establishes—via the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.

== Finite groups ==
{{Main|Finite group}}
A group is called ''finite'' if it has a [[finite set|finite number of elements]]. The number of elements is called the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Kurzweil|last2= Stellmacher|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An important class is the ''[[symmetric group]]s'' S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, the groups of [[permutation]]s of ''N'' letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters [[dihedral group of order 6|S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ''ABC'', i.e., contains the elements ''ABC'', ''ACB'', ''BAC'', ''BCA'', ''CAB'', ''CBA'', in total 6 ([[factorial]] of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for a suitable integer ''N'', according to [[Cayley's theorem]]. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]].

The order of an element ''a'' in a group ''G'' is the least positive integer ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'', where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; represents

: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a \cdots a}_{n \text{ factors}},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., application of the operation • to ''n'' copies of ''a''. (If • represents multiplication, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to the ''n''th power of ''a''.) In infinite groups, such an ''n'' may not exist, in which case the order of ''a'' is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.

More sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's Theorem]] states that for a finite group ''G'' the order of any finite subgroup ''H'' [[divisor|divides]] the order of ''G''. The [[Sylow theorems]] give a partial converse.

The [[dihedral group]] (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 4, as is the order of the subgroup ''R'' it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; above have order {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}.

=== Classification of finite simple groups ===
{{Main|Classification of finite simple groups}}
Mathematicians often strive for a complete [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of a mathematical notion. In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order ''p'', a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Groups of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, as the non-abelian group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of order 8 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; above shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1991|loc = Theorem 6.1.14}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 77}} for similar results.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to [[List of small groups|list small groups]], but there is no classification of all finite groups.{{cref|q}} An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.{{cref|r}} A nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only normal subgroups are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself.{{cref|s}} The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I. 3, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of finite simple groups|Listing all finite simple groups]] was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 [[Fields Medal]] winner [[Richard Borcherds]] succeeded in proving the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple [[sporadic group]]—the "[[monster group]]"—and certain [[modular function]]s, a piece of classical [[complex analysis]], and [[string theory]], a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ronan|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups with additional structure==
Many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures. In the language of [[category theory]], they are [[group object]]s in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called [[morphism]]s) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object in the [[category of sets]].

===Topological groups===
[[Image:Circle as Lie group2.svg|right|thumb|The [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]] under complex multiplication is a Lie group and, therefore, a topological group. It is topological since complex multiplication and division are continuous. It is a manifold and thus a Lie group, because every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|small piece]], such as the red arc in the figure, looks like a part of the [[real line]] (shown at the bottom). ]]
{{Main|Topological group}}
Some [[topological space]]s may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be [[continuous function]]s, that is, {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}}, and ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; must not vary wildly if ''g'' and ''h'' vary only little. Such groups are called ''topological groups,'' and they are the group objects in the [[category of topological spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Husain|year = 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic examples are the [[real number|reals]] '''R''' under addition, {{nowrap|('''R''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, and similarly with any other [[topological field]] such as the [[complex number]]s or [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. All of these groups are [[locally compact topological group|locally compact]], so they have [[Haar measure]]s and can be studied via [[harmonic analysis]]. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant [[integral]]s. [[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariance]] means, in the case of real numbers for example:
: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x)\,dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x+c)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
for any constant ''c''. Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime, as do [[adele ring]]s and [[adelic algebraic group]]s, which are basic to number theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the [[absolute Galois group]] can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called [[Krull topology]], which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Shatz|year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of [[algebraic geometry]], is the [[étale fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Milne|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lie groups===
{{Main|Lie group}}
''Lie groups'' (in honor of [[Sophus Lie]]) are groups which also have a [[manifold]] structure, i.e., they are spaces [[diffeomorphism|looking locally like]] some [[Euclidean space]] of the appropriate [[dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Warner|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the additional structure, here the manifold structure, has to be compatible, i.e., the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be [[smooth map|smooth]].

A standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an [[open subset]] of the space of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, because it is given by the inequality
:det (''A'') ≠ 0,
where ''A'' denotes an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Borel|year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: [[Noether's theorem]] links continuous symmetries to [[conserved quantities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Goldstein|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotation]], as well as [[translation (geometry)|translations]] in [[space]] and [[time]] are basic symmetries of the laws of [[mechanics]]. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.{{cref|v}} Another example are the [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of [[Minkowski space]]. The latter serves—in the absence of significant [[gravitation]]—as a model of [[space time]] in [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|nb=yes|last=Weinberg|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the [[Poincaré group]]. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for [[quantum field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Naber|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local symmetry|Symmetries that vary with location]] are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of [[gauge theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Becchi|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
{{Group-like structures}}
In [[abstract algebra]], more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group.&lt;ref name="MacLane"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Denecke|last2 = Wismath|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Romanowska|last2 = Smith|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a [[monoid]]. The [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as {{nowrap|('''Q''' ∖ {0}, ·)}} is derived from {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, known as the [[Grothendieck group]].
[[Groupoid]]s are similar to groups except that the composition {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} need not be defined for all ''a'' and ''b''. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in [[topology|topological]] and [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] structures, such as the [[fundamental groupoid]] or [[stack (mathematics)|stacks]]. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary [[arity|''n''-ary]] one (i.e., an operation taking ''n'' arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Dudek|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.

However, group constructions often start with an operation defined on a superset, so a closure step is common in proofs that a system is a group. {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002}}}}
{{cnote|c|See, for example, the books of Lang (2002, 2005) and Herstein (1996, 1975).}}
{{cnote|d|However, a group is not determined by its lattice of subgroups. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Suzuki|year = 1951}}.}}
{{cnote|e|The fact that the group operation extends this [[canonical form|canonically]] is an instance of a [[universal property]].}}
{{cnote|f|For example, if ''G'' is finite, then the [[order of a group|size]] of any subgroup and any quotient group divides the size of ''G'', according to Lagrange's theorem.}}
{{cnote|g|The word homomorphism derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὁμός—the same and [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]]—structure.}}
{{cnote|h|The additive notation for elements of a cyclic group would be {{nowrap|''t'' • ''a'', ''t'' in '''Z'''}}.}}
{{cnote|i|See the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem]] for an example.}}
{{cnote|j|An example is [[group cohomology]] of a group which equals the [[singular cohomology]] of its [[classifying space]].}}
{{cnote|k|Elements which do have multiplicative inverses are called [[unit (ring theory)|units]], see {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc =§II.1, p. 84}}.}}
{{cnote|l|The transition from the integers to the rationals by adding fractions is generalized by the [[field of fractions]].}}
{{cnote|m|The same is true for any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' instead of '''Q'''. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §III.1, p. 86}}.}}
{{cnote|n|For example, a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is necessarily cyclic. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = Theorem IV.1.9}}. The notions of [[Torsion (algebra)|torsion]] of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] and [[simple algebra]]s are other instances of this principle.}} {{cnote|o|The stated property is a possible definition of prime numbers. See [[prime element]].}}
{{cnote|p|For example, the [[Diffie-Hellman]] protocol uses the [[discrete logarithm]].}}
{{cnote|q|The groups of order at most 2000 are known. [[Up to]] isomorphism, there are about 49 billion. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Besche|last2 = Eick|last3 = O'Brien|year = 2001}}.}}
{{cnote|r|The gap between the classification of simple groups and the one of all groups lies in the [[extension problem]], a problem too hard to be solved in general. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|loc = p. 737}}.}}
{{cnote|s|Equivalently, a nontrivial group is simple if its only quotient groups are the trivial group and the group itself. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Michler|year = 2006}}, {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Carter|year = 1989}}.}}
{{cnote|t|More rigorously, every group is the symmetry group of some [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]; see [[Frucht's theorem]], {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Frucht|year = 1939}}.}}
{{cnote|u|More precisely, the [[monodromy]] action on the [[vector space]] of solutions of the differential equations is considered. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Kuga|year=1993|loc = pp. 105–113}}.}}
{{cnote|v|See [[Schwarzschild metric]] for an example where symmetry greatly reduces the complexity of physical systems.}}
{{cnote|w|This was crucial to the classification of finite simple groups, for example. See {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004}}.}}
{{cnote|x|See, for example, [[Schur's Lemma]] for the impact of a group action on [[simple module]]s. A more involved example is the action of an [[absolute Galois group]] on [[étale cohomology]].}}
{{cnote|y|Injective and surjective maps correspond to [[monomorphism|mono-]] and [[epimorphism]]s, respectively. They are interchanged when passing to the [[dual category]].}}

'''IMG Artists LLC''' is a leading universal performing arts management corporation that was acquired by International Management Group ([[IMG (company)|IMG]]) in 1984. Chairman and CEO of IMG, [[Mark McCormack]], bought out Hamlen/Landau, a small, New York based artist-management music agency, founded by Charles Hamlen and Edna Landau in 1979.

In September 2003, [http://barrettwissman.com/ Barrett Wissman], an entrepreneur, purchased IMG Artists from IMG parent Co. and turned it into one of the leading international arts management group with the most diverse lines of business. IMG Artists capabilities include the management and touring of the world-renowned musicians, dance companies, orchestras, and attractions, as well as consulting and advisory work for independent clients, arts institutions, concert halls, and culturally engaged corporations. Corporate offices for IMG Artists LLC are located in New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Hannover (Germany), Lucca (Italy) and Singapore.

IMG Artists’ list of more than 200 international clients include [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Hilary Hahn]], [[Joshua Bell]], [[Julia Fischer]], [[Vadym Kholodenko]], [[Renée Fleming]], [[Simon Trpčeski]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Thomas Hampson (baritone)|Thomas Hampson]], [[James Galway]], KODO, [[Evgeny Kissin]], [[Murray Perahia]], [[Antonio Pappano]], [[Vladimir Jurowski]], [[Franz Welser-Möst]], [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]], the St. Petersburg Philharmonic with [[Yuri Temirkanov]], the Oslo Philharmonic with [[André Previn]], the [[Emerson String Quartet]], Bill T. Jones and Pilobolus, and [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]].

IMG Artists has become recognized as an initiator and creator of a major range of arts projects which range from the creation of the new Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra in Kuala Lumpur, to the making of television documentaries such as the “Art of Conducting”, to the presentation of the world-famous ''Spanish Riding School of Vienna''.

IMG Artists also owns and manages the Sun Festival - a global life-style festival brand. The Sun Festival is celebrated annually in Cortona, Tuscany (Italy) and the Napa Valley, California (USA). The Singapore Sun Festival is the third and only Asian chapter of the festival. Further IMG owned and managed festivals are ''Divino Tuscany'' (Italy), ''Abu Dhabi Festival'' (UAE) and ''Festival of the Arts, Boca'', Florida (USA).

'''The Irish Texts Society''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Cumann na Scríbheann nGaedhilge'') was founded in 1898 to promote the study of [[Irish literature]]. It is a [[text publication society]], issuing annotated editions of texts in [[Irish language|Irish]] with [[English language|English]] translations and related [[Literary criticism|commentaries]].

The organisation was created in London, on 26 April 1898. [[Douglas Hyde]] was its first President, [[Frederick York Powell]] was its first chairman and [[Norma Borthwick]] and [[Eleanor Hull]] were the secretaries.&lt;ref name=texts&gt;[http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/the-origins-of-the-irish-texts-society/ The Origins of the Irish Texts Society], HistoryIreland.com, retrieved 8 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, the ITS has published sixty-three items in its main series and twenty items in its subsidiary series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtextssociety.org/subsid.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904140715/http://www.irishtextssociety.org/subsid.htm |archivedate=2010-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications include [[Patrick S.

'''Jem Alan Cohen''' (born 1962) is an [[Afghanistan]]-born [[United States of America|American]] filmmaker based in [[New York City]]. Cohen is especially known for his observational portraits of urban landscapes, blending of media formats ([[16 mm film|sixteen-millimetre]], [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]], [[videotape]]) and collaborations with musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifccenter.com/series/movie-nights-with-jem-cohen/ |title=Movie Nights with Jem Cohen – IFC Center |publisher=Ifccenter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the recipient of the [[Independent Spirit Award]] for feature film-making. "Cohen's films have been broadcast in Europe by the BBC and ZDF/ARTE, and in the United States by the Sundance Channel and P.B.S. They are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney, and Melbourne's Screen Gallery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$artistdetail?COHENJ|title=Opus Luminis et Hominis...|publisher=Vdb.org|accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He also makes multichannel installations and still photographs and had a photography show at Robert Miller Gallery in 2009. 
He has received grants from the Guggenheim, [[Creative Capital]], Rockefeller and Alpert Foundations, the National Endowment for the Arts, and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaartists.org/content.php?sec=artist&amp;sub=detail&amp;artist_id=121 |title=Jem Cohen - Media Arts Fellow |publisher=Mediaartists.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
Cohen was born in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] where his father was working for the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (U.S.A.I.D.).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=In focus: Jem Cohen on Museum Hours|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/in-focus-jem-cohen-museum-hours|accessdate=May 26, 2015|work=BFI Film Forever|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1984, with a concentration in film and photography.

==Career==
Cohen found the mainstream Hollywood film industry incompatible with his sociopolitical and artistic views. By applying the [[D.I.Y.]] ethos of Punk Rock to his film-making approach, he crafted a distinct style in his films through various small gauge formats of Super 8, sixteen-millimetre, and videotape. In an interview with web-site ''The Lamp'', Cohen said, "...it's very inspiring to me, to see people kind of take something outside of the industry, outside of the music industry, and it gave me something of a template to work in film outside of the film industry. And there are certainly strains of punk that are activist and that are kind of oppositional in nature to the dominant mainstream culture... that's very inspiring to me..."

Cohen's longer works include his feature film, ''[[Museum Hours]]'', ''[[Chain_(film)|Chain]]'', and the experimental [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Instrument (film)|Instrument]]'', a portrait of the [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] that was ten years in the making. Another film that covers a ten-year arc, ''[[Benjamin Smoke]]'', is about the life of the frontman of the [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] band [[Smoke (band)|Smoke]]. Other works of note are ''[[Lost Book Found]]'', his [[Walter Benjamin]]-inspired portrait of New York City, ''[[Buried in Light]]'', a series of connected Central and Eastern European city portraits, and his [[short film]] about the late [[Elliott Smith]], ''[[Lucky 3|Lucky Three]]''. In 2002, Cohen made ''[[Chain X Three]]'', a precursor to the ''Chain'' feature film, which was exhibited as a three-channel installation. His concert film of the Dutch band [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]], ''[[Building a Broken Mousetrap]]'', premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2006.

Cohen was a resident at [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://eyebeam.org/people/jem-cohen|title = Jem Cohen {{!}} eyebeam.org|date = |access-date = January 2016|website = Eyebeam|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creative Capital - Investing in Artists who Shape the Future|url = http://creative-capital.org/grantees/view/232/project:193|website = creative-capital.org|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Cohen curated the four-day FUSEBOX Festival in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]. A celebratory gathering "at the crossroads of film, music, and activism," participants included [[Guy Picciotto]] of Fugazi, [[Patti Smith]] and [[Tom Verlaine]], [[The Evens]], and a side project of Montreal's [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band]], called Thee Silver Mountain Elegies Play War Radio, which formed for the occasion.

Other music artists Cohen has collaborated with over the years include [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Sparklehorse]], [[R.E.M.]], [[T.Griffin]], [[Stephen Vitiello]], [[Miracle Legion]], [[DJ /rupture]], [[Blonde Redhead]], and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

He has also cited that he has previously worked for the film industry as a technician and  prop man, some of the directors he has worked under include [[Alex Cox]], [[John Sayles]], and [[Martin Scorsese]].

In addition to his film-making, Cohen has taught a workshop titled 'Documentary as a Lyrical Force" at the [[International Center of Photography]]. The works of  [[Humphrey Jennings]], [[Helen Levitt]], [[Georges Franju]], [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]], and [[Forugh Farrokhzad]], as well as his own, are discussed.

Photographer [[Sid Grossman]] had been married to Cohen's mother. Grossman was the father of his (half) brother Adam, also a
filmmaker.

A '''kenning''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Old Norse]] pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt;  {{IPA-all|cʰɛnːɪŋg|}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Icelandic language|Modern Icelandic]] pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-is|cʰɛnːiŋk|}}) is a type of [[circumlocution]], in the form of a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] that employs figurative language in place of a more concrete single-word [[noun]]. Kennings are strongly associated with [[Old Norse poetry|Old Norse]] and later [[Icelandic literature#Skaldic poetry|Icelandic]] and [[Old English literature#Poetry|Old English]] poetry.

They usually consist of two words, and are often hyphenated.  For example, Old Norse poets might replace ''sverð'' "[[sword]]" with an abstract compound such as "wound-hoe" ([[Egill Skallagrímsson]]: [[Höfuðlausn]] 8) or a [[genitive]] [[phrase]] such as ''randa íss'' "ice of shields" ([[Einarr Skúlason]]: 'Øxarflokkr' 9). Modern scholars have also applied the term kenning to similar [[figure of speech|figures of speech]] in other languages, especially [[Old English]].

==Etymology==
The word was adopted into English in the nineteenth century&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' says "late 19th century".&lt;/ref&gt; from medieval Icelandic treatises on poetics, in particular the [[Prose Edda]] of [[Snorri Sturluson]], and derives ultimately from the Old Norse verb ''kenna'' "know, recognise; perceive, feel; show; teach", etc., as used in the expression ''kenna við'' "to name after; to express [one thing] in terms of [another]",&lt;ref name="OED Online"&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/ OED Online]&lt;/ref&gt; "name after; refer to in terms of",&lt;ref name="Faulkes, Anthony 1998 b"&gt;Faulkes, Anthony (1998 b).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kenna til'' "qualify by, make into a kenning by adding".&lt;ref name="Faulkes, Anthony 1998 b"/&gt;

The corresponding modern verb ''to ken'' survives only in Scots and highly remote English dialects, other than the derivative existing in the standard language in the set expression ''beyond one's ken'', "beyond the scope of one's knowledge" and in the phonologically altered forms ''uncanny'', "surreal" or "supernatural", and ''canny'', "shrewd", "prudent". Modern [[Scots language|Scots]] retains (with slight differences between dialects) ''tae ken'' "to know", ''kent'' "knew" or "known", [[Afrikaans]] ''ken'' "be acquainted with" and " to know" and ''kennis "knowledge"''. Old Norse ''kenna'' ([[Icelandic language|Modern Icelandic]] ''kenna'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''känna'', [[Danish language|Danish]] ''kende'', Norwegian ''kjenne'' or ''kjenna'') is [[cognate]] with Old English ''cennan'', [[Old Frisian]] ''kenna'', ''kanna'', [[Old Saxon]] (''ant'')''kennian'' (Middle Dutch and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kennen''), [[Old High German]] (''ir-'', ''in-'', ''pi-'') ''chennan'' ([[Middle High German]] and [[German language|German]] ''kennen''), [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''kannjan'' &lt; [[Proto-Germanic]] *''kannjanan'', originally [[causative]] of *''kunnanan'' "to know (how to)", whence [[Modern English]] ''can'' 'to be able' (from the same [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root as Modern English ''know'' and Latin-derived ''cognition'').&lt;ref name="OED Online"/&gt;

==Structure==
Old Norse kennings take the form of a genitive phrase (''báru fákr'' "wave's horse" = "ship" ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]: [[Glymdrápa]] 3)) or a [[compound word]] (''gjálfr-marr'' "sea-steed" = "ship" (Anon.: ''[[Hervararkviða]]'' 27)). The simplest kennings consist of a base-word (Icelandic ''stofnorð'', German ''Grundwort'') and a determinant (Icelandic ''kenniorð'', German ''Bestimmung'') which qualifies, or modifies, the meaning of the base-word. The determinant may be a noun used uninflected as the first element in a compound word, with the base-word constituting the second element of the compound word. Alternatively the determinant may be a noun in the genitive case placed before or after the base-word, either directly or separated from the base-word by intervening words.&lt;ref name="skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au"&gt;[http://skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au/db.php?table=doc&amp;id=303 Verse-forms and Diction of Christian Skaldic Verse].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the base-words in these examples are ''fákr'' "horse" and ''marr'' "steed", the determinants ''báru'' "waves" and ''gjálfr'' "sea". The unstated noun which the kenning refers to is called its referent, in this case: ''skip'' "ship".

In Old Norse poetry, either component of a kenning (base-word, determinant or both) could consist of an ordinary noun or a ''[[heiti]]'' "poetic synonym". In the above examples, ''fákr'' and ''marr'' are distinctively poetic [[lexeme]]s; the normal word for "horse" in Old Norse [[prose]] is ''hestr''.

==Complex kennings==
The [[skald]]s also employed complex kennings in which the determinant, or sometimes the base-word, is itself made up of a further kenning: ''grennir gunn-más'' "feeder of war-gull" = "feeder of [[raven]]" = "warrior" ([[Þorbjörn Hornklofi]]: ''[[Glymdrápa]]'' 6); ''eyðendr arnar hungrs'' "destroyers of eagle's hunger" = "feeders of eagle" = "warrior" (Þorbjörn Þakkaskáld: Erlingsdrápa 1) (referring to carnivorous birds [[scavenging]] after a battle). Where one kenning is embedded in another like this, the whole figure is said to be ''tvíkent'' "doubly determined, twice modified".&lt;ref name="Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12"&gt;Faulkes (1999), p. 5/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, where the determinant is itself a kenning, the base-word of the kenning that makes up the determinant is attached uninflected to the front of the base-word of the whole kenning to form a compound word: ''mög-fellandi mellu'' "son-slayer of giantess" = "slayer of sons of giantess" = "slayer of giants" = "the god [[Thor]]" ([[Steinunn Refsdóttir]]: [[Lausavísa]] 2).

If the figure comprises more than three elements, it is said to be ''rekit'' "extended".&lt;ref name="Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12"/&gt; Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/ugm/kennings/4kennt.html Fjórkennt&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Snorri himself characterises five-element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions: ''Níunda er þat at reka til hinnar fimtu kenningar, er ór ættum er ef lengra er rekit; en þótt þat finnisk í fornskálda verka, þá látum vér þat nú ónýtt.'' "The ninth [license] is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant, but it is out of proportion if it is extended further. Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets, we no longer tolerate it."&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes 1991, 8:29–31; Faulkes 1987, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest kenning found in skaldic poetry occurs in ''[[Hafgerðingadrápa]]'' by [[Þórðr Sjáreksson]] and reads ''nausta blakks hlé-mána gífrs drífu gim-slöngvir'' "fire-brandisher of blizzard of ogress of protection-moon of steed of boat-shed", which simply means "warrior".

==Word order and comprehension==
[[Word order]] in Old Norse was generally much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and [[Old English]] are [[synthetic language]]s, where added prefixes and suffixes to the root word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, so-called [[Isolating language|analytic languages]]. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between the elements of a compound word ([[tmesis]]). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Old Norse.

Another factor aiding comprehension is that Old Norse kennings tend to be highly conventional. Most refer to the same small set of topics, and do so using a relatively small set of traditional metaphors. Thus a leader or important man will be characterised as generous, according to one common convention, and called an "enemy of gold", "attacker of treasure", "destroyer of arm-rings", etc. and a friend of his people. Nevertheless, there are many instances of ambiguity in the corpus, some of which may be intentional,&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1997), pp. 11–17,&lt;/ref&gt; and some evidence that, rather than merely accepting it from expediency, skalds favoured contorted word order for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1997), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Some scholars take the term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute consisting of two or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse ''grand viðar'' "bane of wood" = "fire" (Snorri Sturluson: [[Skáldskaparmál]] 36)),&lt;ref&gt;Meissner (1921), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; while others would restrict it to [[metaphor]]ical instances (such as Old Norse ''sól húsanna'' "sun of the houses" = "fire" (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)),&lt;ref name="Heusler 1941, p. 137"&gt;Heusler (1941), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically those where "[t]he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'" (Brodeur (1959) pp.&amp;nbsp;248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English ''forstes bend'' "bond of frost" = "ice" or ''winter-ġewǣde'' "winter-raiment" = "snow": "A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible" (Brodeur (1959) pp.&amp;nbsp;248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device in many parts of the world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (1969), pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snorri's own usage, however, seems to fit the looser sense: "Snorri uses the term "kenning" to refer to a structural device, whereby a person or object is indicated by a periphrastic description containing two or more terms (which can be a noun with one or more dependent [[genitive]]s or a compound noun or a combination of these two structures)" (Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv). The term is certainly applied to non-metaphorical phrases in [[Skáldskaparmál]]: ''En sú kenning er áðr var ritat, at kalla Krist konung manna, þá kenning má eiga hverr konungr.'' "And that kenning which was written before, calling Christ the king of men, any king can have that kenning.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1998 a), p. 78/17, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in [[Háttatal]]: ''Þat er kenning at kalla fleinbrak orrostu [...]'' "It is a kenning to call battle 'spear-crash' [...]".&lt;ref name="Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12"/&gt;

Snorri's expression ''kend [[heiti]]'' "qualified terms" appears to be synonymous with ''kenningar'',&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1999), p. 5/9.&lt;/ref&gt; although Brodeur applies this more specifically to those periphrastic epithets which don't come under his strict definition of kenning.&lt;ref&gt;Brodeur (1959) pp. 248–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sverdlov approaches the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words can take the form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective.&lt;ref&gt;Sverdlov (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.

==Semantics==
Kennings could be developed into extended, and sometimes vivid, metaphors: ''tröddusk törgur fyr [...] hjalta harðfótum'' "shields were trodden under the hard feet of the hilt (sword blades)" ([[Eyvindr Skáldaspillir]]: [[Hákonarmál]] 6); ''svarraði sárgymir á sverða nesi'' "wound-sea (=blood) sprayed on headland of swords (=shield)" (Eyvindr Skáldaspillir: Hákonarmál 7).&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1997), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Snorri calls such examples ''nýgervingar'' and exemplifies them in verse 6 of his Háttatal. The effect here seems to depend on an interplay of more or less naturalistic imagery and jarring artifice. But the skalds weren't averse either to arbitrary, purely decorative, use of kennings: "That is, a ruler will be a distributor of gold even when he is fighting a battle and gold will be called the fire of the sea even when it is in the form of a man's arm-ring on his arm. If the man wearing a gold ring is fighting a battle on land the mention of the sea will have no relevance to his situation at all and does not contribute to the picture of the battle being described" (Faulkes (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9).

Snorri draws the line at mixed metaphor, which he terms ''nykrat'' "made monstrous" (Snorri Sturluson: Háttatal 6), and his nephew called the practice ''löstr'' "a fault" ([[Óláfr Þórðarson|Óláfr hvítaskáld]]: Third Grammatical Treatise 80).&lt;ref&gt;Faulkes (1997), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, it seems that "many poets did not object to and some must have preferred baroque juxtapositions of unlike kennings and neutral or incongruous verbs in their verses" (Foote &amp; Wilson (1970), p.&amp;nbsp;332). E.g. ''heyr jarl Kvasis dreyra'' "listen, earl, to [[Kvasir]]'s blood (=poetry)" ([[Einarr skálaglamm]]: Vellekla 1).

Sometimes there is a kind of redundancy whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: ''barmi dólg-svölu'' "brother of hostility-swallow" = "brother of raven" = "raven" (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); ''blik-meiðendr bauga láðs'' "gleam-harmers of the land of rings" = "harmers of gleam of arm" = "harmers of ring" = "leaders, nobles, men of social standing (conceived of as generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)" (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).

While some Old Norse kennings are relatively transparent, many depend on a knowledge of specific [[Norse mythology|myths]] or legends. Thus the sky might be called naturalistically ''él-ker'' "squall-vat" (Markús Skeggjason: Eiríksdrápa 3) or described in mythical terms as ''Ymis haus'' "[[Ymir]]'s skull" ([[Arnórr jarlaskáld]]: Magnúsdrápa 19), referring to the idea that the sky was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir. Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story: ''rimmu Yggr'' "[[Odin]] of battle" = "warrior" (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 5).

Poets in medieval Iceland even treated [[Christian]] themes using the traditional repertoire of kennings complete with allusions to [[Norse mythology|heathen myths]] and aristocratic epithets for saints: ''Þrúðr falda'' "goddess of headdresses" = "[[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]" (Kálfr Hallsson: Kátrínardrápa 4).&lt;ref name="skaldic.arts.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;

Kennings of the type AB, where B routinely has the characteristic A and thus this AB is tautological, tend to mean "like B in that it has the characteristic A", e.g. "shield-[[Njörðr]]", tautological because the god Njörðr by nature has his own shield, means "like Njörðr in that he has a shield", i.e. "warrior". A modern English example is "[[Jezebel#Cultural symbol|painted Jezebel]]" as a disapproving expression for a woman too fond of using cosmetics.

Sometimes a name given to one well-known member of a species, is used to mean any member of that species. For example, Old Norse ''valr'' means "[[falcon]]", but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr, and thus in Old Norse poetry ''valr'' is sometimes used to mean "horse". A modern example of this is an [[ad hoc]] usage by a [[helicopter ambulance]] pilot: "the [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] of [[hang glider]]s" for the hills behind [[Hawes]] in Yorkshire in England, when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with hang-gliders.&lt;ref&gt;the [[Really (TV channel)]] television program ''[[Helicopter Heroes]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ellipsis==
A term may be omitted from a well-known kenning: ''val-teigs Hildr'' "hawk-ground's [[valkyrie]]/goddess" ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Harðráði]]: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is "goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk" = "goddess of gleam of arm" = "goddess of gold" = "lady" (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to [[falconry]]). The poet relies on listeners' familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. V. Gordon|Gordon]] (1956), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Norse kennings in context==
In the following [[dróttkvætt]] stanza, the Norwegian [[skald]] [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]] (d. ca 990) compares the greed of King [[Harald Greycloak]] (Old Norse: ''Haraldr'') to the generosity of his predecessor, [[Haakon the Good]] (''Hákon''):
{{quote|
:Bárum, Ullr, of alla,
:ímunlauks, á hauka
:fjöllum Fýrisvalla
:fræ Hákonar ævi;

:nú hefr fólkstríðir Fróða
:fáglýjaðra þýja
:meldr í móður holdi
:mellu dolgs of folginn|Eyvindr skáldaspillir, ''[[Lausavísa]]'', 8}}

A literal translation reveals several kennings: "'''[[Ullr]] of the war-[[leek]]!''' We carried the '''seed of [[Fyrisvellir|Fýrisvellir]]''' on our '''hawk-mountains''' during all of Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden the '''flour of [[Fróði]]'s hapless slaves''' in the '''flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess.'''"

This could be paraphrased as "O warrior, we carried gold on our arms during all of King Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden gold in the earth." The kennings are:

'''''Ullr ... ímunlauks''''', "warrior", from [[Ullr]], the name of a god, and '''ímun-laukr''', "sword" (literally "war-leek"). By convention, the name of any god can be associated with another word to produce a kenning for a certain type of man; here "Ullr of the sword" means "warrior." "War-leek" is a kenning for "sword" that likens the shape of the sword to that of a leek. The warrior referred to may be King Harald.

'''''Hauka fjöllum''''', "arms", from ''hauka'' "hawk" and ''fjöll'' mountain. This is a reference to the sport of [[falconry]], where a bird of prey is perched on the arm of the falconer. By convention, "hawk" combined with a term for a geographic feature forms a kenning for "arm."

'''''Fýrisvalla fræ''''', "gold", from "[[Fyrisvellir|Fýrisvellir]]", the plains of the river Fýri, and ''fræ'', "seed." This is an allusion to a legend retold in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' and ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]'' in which King Hrolf and his men scattered gold on the plains (''vellir'') of the river Fýri south of [[Gamla Uppsala]] to delay their pursuers.

'''''Fróða fáglýjaðra þýja meldr''''', "flour of Fróði's hapless slaves", is another kenning for "gold." It alludes to the [[Grottasöngr]] legend.

'''''Móður hold mellu dolgs''''', "flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess."  "earth." Here the earth is personified as the goddess [[Jörð]], mother of [[Thor]], enemy of the [[Jötunn|Jǫtnar]] or "giants".

==Old English and other kennings==
{{Citation style|date=May 2018}}

The practice of forming kennings has traditionally been seen as a common Germanic inheritance, but this has been disputed since, among the early Germanic languages, their use is largely restricted to Old Norse and Old English poetry.&lt;ref name="Heusler 1941, p. 137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (1969), pp. 109–117.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible early kenning for "gold" (''walha-kurna'' "Roman/Gallic grain") is attested in the [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] runic inscription on the [[Tjurkö bracteates|Tjurkö (I)-C bracteate]].&lt;ref&gt;Krause (1971), p. 63. Cited by Hultin (1974), p. 864.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Looijenga (1997), pp. 24, 60, 205; Looijenga (2003), p. 42, 109, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennings are virtually absent from the surviving corpus of continental West Germanic verse; the [[Old Saxon]] [[Heliand]] contains only one example: ''lîk-hamo'' "body-raiment" = "body" (Heliand 3453 b),&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (1969), pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; a compound which, in any case, is normal in [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] and [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] prose ([[Old English]] ''līchama'', [[Old High German]] ''lîchamo'', ''lîchinamo'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''lichaam'', [[Old Norse|Old Icelandic]] ''líkamr'', ''líkami'', [[Old Norse|Old Swedish]] ''līkhamber'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''lekamen'', [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Bokmål|Norwegian Bokmål]] ''legeme'', [[Nynorsk|Norwegian Nynorsk]] ''lekam'').

Old English kennings are all of the simple type, possessing just two elements, e.g. for "sea": ''seġl-rād'' "sail-road" ([[Beowulf]] 1429 b), ''swan-rād'' "swan-road" (Beowulf 200 a), ''bæð-weġ'' "bath-way" (Andreas 513 a), ''hron-rād'' "whale-road" (Beowulf 10), ''hwæl-weġ'' "whale-way" ([[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]] 63 a). Most Old English examples take the form of compound words in which the first element is uninflected: "heofon-candel" "sky-candle" = "the sun" (Exodus 115 b). Kennings consisting of a genitive phrase occur too, but rarely: ''heofones ġim'' "sky's jewel" = "the sun" (The Phoenix 183).

Old English poets often place a series of synonyms in apposition, and these may include kennings (loosely or strictly defined) as well as the literal referent: ''Hrōðgar maþelode, helm Scyldinga'' ... "[[Hrothgar]], helm (=protector, lord) of the [[Scylding]]s, said ..." (Beowulf 456).

Although the word "kenning" isn't often used for non-Germanic languages, a similar form can be found in [[Biblical poetry]] in its use of [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. Some examples include {{Bibleverse|Genesis|49:11|HE}}, in which "blood of grapes" is used as a kenning for "wine", and {{Bibleverse|Job|15:14|HE}} where "born of woman" is a parallel for "man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|title=The Art of Biblical Poetry|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-02256-4|page=16|edition=New and revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjsAfGYEOBoC|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
Figures of speech similar to kennings occur in Modern English (both in literature and in regular speech), and are often found in combination with other poetic devices. For example, the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] song "[[The Sun and the Rain]]" contains the line "standing up in the falling-down", where "the falling-down" refers to rain and is used in juxtaposition to "standing up". Some recent English writers have attempted to use approximations of kennings in their work. [[John Steinbeck]] used kenning-like figures of speech in his 1950 novella ''[[Burning Bright]]'', which was adapted into a Broadway play that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Broadway Database, "Burning Bright"|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steinbeck biographer [[Jay Parini]], "The experiment is well-intentioned, but it remains idiosyncratic to the point of absurdity. Steinbeck invented compound phrases (similar to the Old English use of kennings), such as 'wife-loss' and 'friend-right' and 'laughter-starving,' that simply seem eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parini|first=Jay|title=John Steinbeck: A Biography|year=1995|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=0805016732|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennings remain somewhat common in [[German language|German]] (''Drahtesel'' "wire-donkey" for bike, ''Feuerstuhl'' "fire-chair" for motorcycle, ''Stubentiger'' "parlour-tiger" for cat, and so on).

The poet [[Seamus Heaney]] regularly employed kennings in his work; for example, 'bone-house' for "skeleton".

[[File:Fates tapestry -460755563.jpg|thumb|''The three fates'', [[Clotho]], Lachesis and [[Atropos]], who spin, draw out and cut the thread of life. ([[Flanders|Flemish]] [[tapestry]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]

'''Lachesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|k|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-el|Λάχεσις}}, ''Lakhesis'', "disposer of lots", from {{lang|grc|λαγχάνω}}, ''lanchano'', "to obtain by lot, by fate, or by the will of the gods"), in [[ancient Greek religion]], was the second of the Three Fates, or [[Moirai]]: [[Clotho]], Lachesis and [[Atropos]].  Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life.&lt;ref name="Weigle2007"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Marta Weigle|last=Weigle|first=Marta|title=Spiders and Spinsters: Women and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aLCcrYU0LwC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 July 2007|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-0-86534-587-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Roman equivalent was [[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edith (1942). ''Mythology'', p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. {{ISBN|978-0-316-34114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.

==Origin==
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters ([[Atropos]] and [[Clotho]]) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 901–6; cf. {{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=William|last2=Hansen|first2=William Freeman|title=Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks And Romans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_s8nSgrD0jkC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=29 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530035-2|page=153}}, {{cite web|url=http://cantos33.weebly.com/atropos.html |title=Dante's Inferno: Cantos XXXIII - Atropos |publisher=Cantos33.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the ''Republic'' of Plato as the daughter of [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity]]. She instructs the souls who are about to choose their next life, assign them lots, and presents them all of the kinds, human and animal, from which they may choose their next life.

{{Ismailis|Ismaili History}}
'''Lambsar''' ({{lang-fa|لمبسر}}, also pronounced '''Lamsar'''), '''Lambasar''', or '''Lambesar''' ({{lang|fa|لمبه سر}}) was probably the largest and the most fortified castles of the [[Nizari Ismaili state]]. The fortress is located in the central [[Alburz]] mountains, south of the [[Caspian Sea]], about 120&amp;nbsp;km from present-day [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. Lambesar is to the northeast of Razmian village (the central district of Roodbar e Shahrestan).

[[Kiya Buzurg Ummid]] (died 1138) captured the castle from Rasamuj and rebuilt it into a major stronghold using local labour. He was appointed by [[Hasan Sabbah]] (died 1124) as its governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castle of Lamasar|url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=105098|publisher=[[Institute of Ismaili Studies]]|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only ruins remain of this magnificent fortress today. Very deep valleys  surrounding the fortress make it impossible to access from the East and West sides. The North and South fronts are the only possible ways to get into the fortress. Although the slope of the mountain with a difference of 150m on both levels is stretched from north to south with a length of 480m, the castle is more than 190m in width.  The huge two-layered parapets made up of very large 10m high stones, along with the main building in the north of the fortress with 1.2m wide cut stone walls, wonderful water reservoirs and grain stores in the south and southeast of the castle, towers and a water supply system are among the characteristics and features left within the Lambesar fortress which intrigue visitors. In the North side of the fortress a huge building with 4 smaller extensions remain which face to the East.

==Final days==

The Ismailis’ forts were the last line of defense against [[Mongol]] aggression in [[Persia]]. The Mongols had a hard time conquering Ismailian's forts. [[Hulaku Khan]] was disappointed with his commanders therefore he took over an army of 10000 soldiers and moved toward Alamut. In 1256 AD after a couple months the Meymoon-Dej (Meymoon-Diž, {{lang-fa|میمون دژ}}) fort surrendered to Hulaku’s army, and Imam [[Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah]] was captured. Hulaku Khan asked Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah to order his followers to surrender, but Lambesar fort, [[Gerdkuh]] fort and Alamut fort did not follow the order.  Finally after a year of resisting, a [[cholera]] epidemic in 1257 AD took many lives in Lambesar and allowed the Mongols to succeed. Hulaku ordered the fort ruined and beheaded whoever had survived the deadly disease. In 1275 AD and again in 1389 AD, small groups of Ismailis who had survived the Mongol invasions attempted to recapture Alamut, but their attempts were short-lived.

This '''list of [[film formats]]''' catalogues formats developed for shooting or viewing [[motion pictures]], ranging from the Chronophotographe format from 1888, to mid-20th century formats such as the 1953 [[CinemaScope]] format, to more recent formats such as the 1992 [[IMAX HD]] format. To be included in this list, the formats must all have been used in the field or for test shooting, and they must all use [[photochemical]] images that are formed or projected on a [[film base]], a transparent substrate which supports the photosensitive emulsion.

As well, the formats must have been used to make more than just a few test frames. The camera must be fast enough (in frames per second) to create an illusion of motion consistent with the [[persistence of vision]] phenomenon. The format must be significantly unique from other listed formats in regard to its image capture or [[movie projector|image projection]]. The format characteristics should be clearly definable in several listed parameters (e. g., film gauge, aspect ratio, etc.).

== Legend ==
* '''Format''' is the name of the process; some formats may have multiple names in common usage.
* '''Creator''' is the individual or company most directly attributable as the developer of the system.
* '''Year created''' usually refers to the earliest date that the system was used to completion (i.e. projection), but may refer to when it was developed if no known film was made.
* '''First known film''' is the first film (not including tests) made with the format and intended for release.
* '''Negative gauge''' is the [[film gauge]] (width) used for the original camera negative.
* '''Negative aspect ratio''' is the [[aspect ratio (image)|image ratio]] determined by the ratio of the gate dimensions multiplied by the [[anamorphic]] power of the camera lenses (1x in the case of spherical lenses).&lt;ref name="ar"&gt;Strictly speaking, aspect ratios for film are always expressed as the ratio of 1 and are formatted as x:y, e.g. 1.85:1. However, in the interest of formatting, the aspect ratios listed will assume the ratio of 1 and omit the :1 suffix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gate dimensions''' are the width and height of the camera [[film gate|gate aperture]], and by extension the film negative frame.
* '''Negative pulldown''' describes the [[film perforations]] per frame, the direction of film transport, and standard frame speed. Film transport is assumed to be vertical unless otherwise noted, and standard frame speed is assumed to be 24 frames per second unless the film is otherwise noted or has no standard. Silent film has no standard speed; many amateur formats have several common speeds, but no standard.
* '''Negative lenses''' indicates whether spherical (normal) or [[anamorphic]] lenses are used on the original camera negative, and if anamorphic lenses, what anamorphic power is used.
* '''Projection gauge''' is the [[film gauge]] (width) used for the release print.
* '''Projection aspect ratio''' is the [[aspect ratio (image)|image ratio]] determined by the ratio of the projection dimensions multiplied by the [[anamorphic]] power of the projection lenses (1x in the case of spherical lenses). This is also known as the intended theatrical aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;
* '''Projection dimensions''' are the width and height of the [[movie projector|projector aperture]] plate, and by extension the film frame area which is projected. The aperture plate always very slightly crops the frame.
* '''Projection lenses''' indicates whether spherical (normal) or [[anamorphic]] lenses are used on the projector, and if anamorphic lenses, what anamorphic power is used.

Formats are listed in chronological order and by release date in the case of multiple formats within one year, if this can be determined. Undated formats are listed at the bottom in alphabetical order.

'''Lorna Moon''' (born '''Nora Helen Wilson Low'''; 16 June 1886 – 1 May 1930&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lorna Moon - Biography|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600641/bio|accessdate=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Scottish [[author]] and [[screenwriter]] from the early days of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]].

==Life==
She was born in [[Strichen]], [[Aberdeenshire]], in [[Scotland]], in 1886, the daughter of the [[plasterer]] Charles Low, a [[socialist]] and avowed [[atheist]]. In 1907 she met William Hebditch, a commercial traveller from [[Yorkshire]] who had stayed at the hotel run by her parents; the two were secretly married in [[Aberdeen]] and shortly after the couple left Scotland for [[Alberta]] in [[Canada]], where Lorna Moon gave birth to her first child, William Hebditych (1908–1990), in 1908.&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt; In 1913 she left Hebditch and fell in with Walter Moon, with whom she had a child, Mary Leonore Moon (1914–1978).&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt; She and Walter travelled to [[Winnipeg]], where she began working as a journalist and where she adopted a [[pen-name]] closer to her literary inspiration, [[Lorna Doone]]. An anecdote tells how she contacted [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and offered a critical appraisal of the screenplays of the day. He challenged her to come to Hollywood and write them herself if she thought she could do better; and by 1921 she did just that, working as a script girl and screenwriter. During her career in Hollywood she had a third child by Cecil B. DeMille’s brother [[William Demille|William]]. This child, [[Richard de Mille|Richard]], grew up unaware of his mother’s identity; in later years he discovered his parentage and wrote the memoir ''My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon |author=Richard DeMille |year=1998 |publisher=Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux |location=New York |isbn= 0374217572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorna Moon contracted [[tuberculosis]] and died in a [[sanatorium]] in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], in 1930, aged 44. She was [[cremated]] and her ashes were returned to Scotland, to be scattered on [[Mormond Hill]] near Strichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Far Side of Lorna Moon|publisher=ASLS|url=http://asls.arts.gla.ac.uk/Lorna_Moon.html|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screen credits==
Her screen credits include ''[[The Affairs of Anatol]]'' (1921), ''[[Don't Tell Everything]]'' (1921), ''[[Her Husband's Trademark]]'' (1922), ''[[Too Much Wife]]'' (1922), ''[[Upstage (film)|Upstage]]'' (1926), ''[[After Midnight (1927 film)|After Midnight]]'' (1927), ''[[Women Love Diamonds]]'' (1927), ''[[Mr. Wu]]'' (1927), and ''[[Love (1927 American film)|Love]]'' (1927).&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Lorna Moon|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3635.html|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
Her literary works include ''Doorways in Drumorty'' (1925), a collection of short stories, and the novel ''Dark Star'' (1929). ''Dark Star'' was a critical success, and in 1930 was adapted for the screen as [[Min and Bill]], starring [[Marie Dressler]] and [[Wallace Beery]].&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"/&gt; ''Doorways in Drumorty'' contained a series of stories set in a fictional Scottish town: however the location and characters were drawn from her memories of Strichen, much to the indignation of certain of the  townspeople, and her work was banned from the local library.&lt;ref name="Courier"&gt;{{cite news|title=Doorways in Drumorty shines light on the incredible life of Lorna Moon|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3635.html|work=The Courier|location=Dundee|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
''The Collected Works of Lorna Moon'', edited by Glenda Norquay, was published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Collected Works of Lorna Moon |author=Glenda Norquay (eds) |year=2002 |publisher=Black and White Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn= 1902927362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a plaque commemorating Lorna Moon was unveiled in Strichen. In 2011 a [[stage play]], based on the stories in ''Doorways in Drumorty'', was written by [[Mike Gibb]] and performed around Scotland by [[Red Rag Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Courier"/&gt; A film based on the life of Lorna Moon, scripted by [[Alison Peebles]], has been proposed, with [[Kate Winslet]] being named as a potential candidate to play the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winslet targeted to shine as Moon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/8315888.stm|work=BBC News|location=Glasgow|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matusevitch self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Matusevitch's self portrait]]

'''Michael Matusevitch''' was a painter (1929 - 2007). He was born in [[Odessa]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] ([[Ukraine]] in nowadays). 
Matusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter.

==Wartime==
In [[1941]], Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents{{where|date=November 2018}}. After two weeks, war{{clarify|date=November 2018}} broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in [[Odessa]], resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the [[Nazism|Nazis]], making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg.

In the end, the group reached [[Tadzhikistan]] in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. 
Matusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. 
Matusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house.

==Odessa==
At the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. 
Matusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the [[Grekov Odessa Art school]].
At the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. 
Matusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the [[Red Army]]. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions.

==Study==
In 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the [[Socialist Realism]] mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. 
[[Modern art]] was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable.

In 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.”

==Influential painter==
An important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]]. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in [[Moscow]] from the [[Netherlands]], Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting. 

In 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” 
Subsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, [[Sasha Richter]].

==Israel==
In 1974, he arrived in [[Israel]] and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“
Matusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists.

In 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in [[Tel Aviv|Tel-Aviv]]. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch.  

==Death and legacy==
Matusevitch passed away in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much.

In 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an [https://www.matusevitchart.com online gallery], together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - [https://www.matusevitchart.com].  It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11991">'''Olivier Auber''' (born 1960) is a French independent artist and researcher. He is best known for his project "[[Poietic Generator]]" and for having introduced the concept of "Digital Perspective" in the fields of network theory, art and [[digital humanities]].

==Biography==
Olivier Auber was born in 1960 in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.

He holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the [[Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers]]. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics ([[head-up display]]). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now [[Thales Group]]) and at [[CERN]] in Geneva.

In 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]], the [[Palais de la Découverte]]. The creation for the "Expressions et behaviours" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.

End of 1987, while working with [[Tod Machover]] (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of [[Philip K. Dick]], he designed what would become his best known work, the "[[Poietic Generator]]", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the "France-Japan Monument" on [[Awaji Island]] in the Bay of [[Kobe]], launched under the aegis of [[François Mitterrand]]. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] (exhibition "Communication et Monumentalité", 1989), the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (exhibition "Machines à communiquer", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including [http://www.arslab.it ARSLAB] in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize "art and science" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition "ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality", sponsored by the City of [[Turin]] - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani &lt;ref name= catalogue1&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtual'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue2&gt;1998, ''Arslab. I labirinti del corpo in gioco.'' published by hopefulmonster, Turin, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= catalogue3&gt;1995, ''Arslab. The senses of virtuality'', published by RCS Libri &amp; Grandi Opere Spa, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now [[Télécom ParisTech]]) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet ([[Mbone]]) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.

In 1996, he developed a version of [[Poietic Generator]] for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.

In 1997 he co-founded the [http://km2.net/ A+H Culture Laboratory], with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the [[:de:Nibelungenmuseum Worms|Nibelungen Museum]] in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation "The treasure of the Nibelungs", inspired by the [[Poietic Generator]], was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.

In 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navidis.com/ Navidis, innovative solutions to the Smart Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.

In 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&amp;D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.

In 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair&lt;ref&gt;[http://imaginaires.telecom-paristech.fr/ Research Chair "modeling imaginary"]&lt;/ref&gt; at Telecom ParisTech devoted to "modeling imaginary" with the help of [[Dassault Systèmes]], [[Ubisoft]], Orange Lab, [[Peugeot-Citroen]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Datar]] and [[Minatec]].

Since 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the [[Poietic Generator]]. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecco.vub.ac.be/ Research group on "Evolution, Complexity and Cognition (ECCO)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Global Brain Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalbraininstitute.org Global Brain Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Francis Heylighen]], and as an active member of the [[P2P Foundation]].

==Theoretical arguments==

From 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the [[Poietic Generator]] as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the "temporal perspective" and the "digital perspective", on which he wrote several papers&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Auber : ''Du Générateur poïétique à la perspective numérique'', Revue d'esthétique 43 - 07/2003 - p. 127, oline on [http://archee.qc.ca/ar.php?page=imp&amp;no=207 Archée, Québec], "The Aestetic of the Digital Perspective", Artmedia VIII,
Paris, 2002 ([http://vv.arts.ucla.edu/publications/publications/02-03/Artmedia/PARTICIPANTSe.htm arts.ucla.edu])&lt;/ref&gt; whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Anne Cauquelin|Anne Cauquelin]]: ''Fréquenter les incorporels'', PUF, collection « Lignes d'art », 2006.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to software:

'''[[Software]]''' – collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. The term was coined to contrast to the old term [[computer hardware|hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software "cannot be touched".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=software..(n.d.). |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)| accessdate =2007-04-13|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of software ==

* [[Application software]] – end-user applications of computers such as [[word processors]] or [[video game]]s, and [[ERP software]] for groups of users.
** [[Business software]]
** [[Computer-aided design]]
** [[Database]]s
** [[Decision-making software]]
** [[Educational software]]
** [[Emotion-sensitive software]]
** [[Image editing]]
** Industrial [[automation]]
** [[Mathematical software]]
** [[Medical software]]
** [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular modeling software]]

** [[Telecommunication]]s (i.e., the [[Internet]] and everything that flows on it)
** [[Video editing software]]
** [[Video game]]s
** [[Word processing|Word processors]]
* [[Middleware (distributed applications)|Middleware]] controls and co-ordinates [[distributed computing|distributed systems]].
* [[Programming language]]s – define the [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] of computer programs. For example, many mature banking applications were written in the language [[COBOL]], invented in 1959. Newer applications are often written in more modern languages.
* [[System software]] – provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps run the computer hardware and system. It includes a combination of the following:
** [[Device driver]]
** [[Operating system]]
** [[Package management system]]
** [[server (computing)|Server]]
** [[software utility|Utility]]
** [[Window system]]
* ''Teachware'' – any special breed of software or other means of product dedicated to education purposes in software engineering and beyond in general education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/teachware.html |title=Translation 'teachware'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Testware]] – any software for testing hardware or software.
* [[Firmware]] – low-level software often stored on electrically programmable memory devices. Firmware is given its name because it is treated like hardware and run ("executed") by other software programs. Firmware often is not accessible for change by other entities but the developers' enterprises.
* Shrinkware is the older name given to consumer-purchased software, because it was often sold in retail stores in a [[shrink wrap]]ped box.
* [[Device driver]]s – control parts of computers such as [[disk drive]]s, [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[CD drive]]s, or [[computer monitor]]s.
* [[Programming tool]]s – assist a programmer in writing [[computer program]]s, and software using various programming languages in a more convenient way. The tools include:
** [[Compiler]]s
** [[Debugger]]s
** [[interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]]
** [[linker (computing)|Linkers]]
** [[Text editor]]s
** [[Integrated development environment]] (IDE) – single application for managing all of these functions.

The '''Pamplona Cathedral''' ''([[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Santa María la Real]])'' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church architecture|church]] in the [[archdiocese of Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. The current 15th century [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church replaced an older [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] one. [[Archaeological]] excavations have revealed the existence of other two previous churches. The [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[façade]] was designed by [[Ventura Rodríguez]] in 1783. It has a 13th-14th-century Gothic [[cloister]], that gives access to two other Gothic rooms: the Barbazan chapel and the [[refectory]]. The Mediaeval [[Kingdom of Navarre|kings of Navarre]] were crowned there and some of them were also buried. The Navarrese ''[[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]]'' (Parliament) was held there even during the early modern ages.

==The church==

[[Image:catedral pamplona iglesia.jpg|thumb|250px|The church.]]

The site of the [[cathedral]] is the oldest part of the [[Pamplona#Foundation and Roman times|Roman ''Pompaelo'']]. Archaeological excavations in 1994 have revealed streets and buildings from the 1st century BC. The oldest cathedral was demolished in 924 during the invasion of [[Abd-al-Rahman III]], [[Caliph of Cordoba]]. During the reign of [[Sancho III of Navarre|Sancho III]] (1004–1035) the church was reconstructed. That church was demolished from 1083 to 1097, and the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral was built from 1100 to 1127. It collapsed in 1391, with only the façade remaining. The building of the current Gothic church began in 1394 and lasted to 1501. The floorplan is [[cruciform]] with [[ambulatory]], a central [[nave]] and four shorter aisles, all covered by partially polycromed [[rib vault]]. The style is very influenced by [[French gothic architecture|French]] models.

The sculpture of the interior includes the [[sepulchre]] of [[Charles III of Navarre]] and spouse, by Jehan Lome de Tournai (1419), and the image of Royal Saint Mary, a Romanesque [[History of wood carving#Gothic period .2812th-15th centuries.29|woodcarved]] silverplated sculpture. The [[choir]], with its [[Sculpture#Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[choir stalls]] (1541), is separated from the nave by a Gothic iron grating (1517). There was a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] [[retable]] (1598) in the [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], now in the church of Saint Michael in Pamplona. In the lateral chapels there are two [[Gothic art#Gothic sculpture|Gothic]] retables (c.1500, 1507); one Italian Renaissance retable (16th century); one late Renaissance [[retable]] (1610, polycromed in 1617); and five [[Baroque#Sculpture|Baroque]] retables (1642, 1683, 1685).

==The cloister==

[[Image:claustro pamplona lateral oeste.jpg|thumb|250px|Cloister.]]
[[Image:Claustro pamplona.jpg|thumb|250px|Cloister.]]
Probably, the most outstanding element of the cathedral is its 13th century cloister. As the temple, the style followed the [[French Gothic architecture]], and the sculptural decoration is very rich. The door that gives access from the temple shows the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] of the Virgin, and at the [[mullion]] stands a 15th-century sculpture of the Virgin Mary. The Barbazan chapel—named after the Pamplonese bishop buried there, [[Arnaldo de Barbazán]]—is covered by a Gothic eight-rib vault. The so-called 'Precious Door' gives access to the ancient canons' dormitory and shows a complete sculptural story of the Virgin Mary's life. There are several notable burials: Bishop Miguel Sánchez de Asiáin's (14th century), Viceroy of Navarre Count of Gages' ([[Baroque sculpture|Baroque]], 18th century) and [[guerrilla]] fighter [[Francisco Espoz y Mina|Francisco Espoz y Mina's]] ([[Sculpture#Neo-Classical|Neo-classical]], 19th century). The lavatory is closed by a grid whose iron is said to be from the [[battle of Navas de Tolosa]]. Another decorated Gothic door gives access to the old kitchen and the [[refectory]].

==Diocesan Museum==

The former canons' rooms house the Diocesan Museum. The main room is a 14th-century rib-vault covered refectory. The adjacent kitchen is covered by a pyramidal stone-built [[chimney]]. This museum exhibits pieces of religious art from the cathedral and from many other Navarrese churches, many of them abandoned today: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque sculpture, Gothic and Baroque painting, and 13th to 18th centuries [[goldsmith]] and [[silversmith]].

The most outstanding silversmith pieces are the Gothic Holy Sepulcher [[reliquary]], made in 13th century [[Paris]]; the 14th century ''[[Lignum Crucis]]'' reliquary and the Renaissance 16th century processional [[monstrance]].

'''Project Arts Centre''' is a multidisciplinary arts centre based in [[Temple Bar, Dublin]], which hosts visual arts, theatre, dance, music, and performance.&lt;ref name=e-flux&gt;{{cite web|last1=e-flux|title=Project Arts Centre|url=http://www.e-flux.com/client/project_arts_centre/|website=e-flux|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Playography Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Playography Ireland|title=PROJECT ARTS CENTRE|url=http://www.irishplayography.com/company.aspx?companyid=56|website=Playography Ireland|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Project Arts Centre was founded by Jim FitzGerald and Colm O'Briain in 1967 after a three-week festival at the [[Gate Theatre]] in 1966.  Project Arts Centre was the first such arts centre in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Ciarán|title=Towards a Cultural Democracy|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|date=1992|volume=81|issue=321|url=https://www.jstor.org.elib.tcd.ie/stable/30091647?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre had several homes before it opened for business in a converted factory on East Essex Street in 1975,&lt;ref name=e-flux /&gt; after numerous issues regarding funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheridan|first1=Peter|title=The Theatre and Politics|journal=The Crane Bag|date=1977|volume=1|issue=1|jstor=30060132}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building was demolished in 1998 and a new purpose-built space containing two auditoriums, a gallery and a bar opened on the same site in 2000,&lt;ref name="Project Arts Centre"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Project Arts Centre|title=About Us|url=http://projectartscentre.ie/about-us/|website=Project Arts Centre|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the second phase of the regeneration of Temple Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=John|title=Encouraging Culture-led Regeneration|url=http://time.dufe.edu.cn/jingjiwencong/waiwenziliao/41mccarthy.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207221939/http://time.dufe.edu.cn/jingjiwencong/waiwenziliao/41mccarthy.pdf|archivedate=7 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the Centre, along with a number of other cultural institutions in Temple Bar such as  [[Irish Film Institute]], the [[Temple Bar Gallery and Studios]], Black Church Print Studios, the Gallery of Photography, and

'''Red-figure vase painting''' is one of the most important styles of figural [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vase painting]].

It developed in [[Athens]] around 520 BC and remained in use until the late 3rd century BC. It replaced the previously dominant style of [[black-figure vase painting]] within a few decades. Its modern name is based on the figural depictions in red colour on a black background, in contrast to the preceding black-figure style with black figures on a red background. The most important areas of production, apart from [[Attica]], were in [[Magna Graecia|Southern Italy]]. The style was also adopted in other parts of [[Greece]]. [[Etruria]] became an important centre of production outside the [[Ancient Greece|Greek World]].

Attic red-figure  vases were exported throughout Greece and beyond. For a long time, they dominated the market for fine ceramics. Only few centres of pottery production could compete with Athens in terms of innovation, quality and production capacity. Of the red figure vases produced in Athens alone, more than 40,000 specimens and fragments survive today. From the second most important production centre, Southern Italy, more than 20,000 vases and fragments are preserved. Starting with the studies by [[John Beazley|John D. Beazley]] and [[Arthur Dale Trendall]], the study of this style of art has made enormous progress. Some vases can be ascribed to individual artists or schools. The images provide evidence for the exploration of Greek [[Ancient Greece#Culture|cultural history]], [[Ancient Greece#Culture|everyday life]], [[iconography]], and [[Greek mythology|mythology]].

== Technique ==
{{further information|Ancient Greek vase painting|Pottery of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2301 B.jpg|thumb|'''[[Black-figure pottery|Black-figure]]''' scene on the [[Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301)]]. [[Munich]]: [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]
Red figure is, put simply, the reverse of the black figure technique. Both were achieved by using the [[three-phase firing]] technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In [[Attica]], the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay [[slip (ceramics)|slip]]. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.

Detail in other colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was probably drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The suggestion of a hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman: ''The History of Greek Vases'', London 2001, p. 286. The hollow needle, or syringe, was proposed by Noble (1965). First publication of the hair method by Gérard Seiterle: ''Die Zeichentechnik in der rotfigurigen Vasenmalerei. Das Rätsel der Relieflinien.'' In: ''Antike Welt'' 2/1976, S. 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures was filled with a glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through [[redox|reduction]], the reddish color by a final re-[[oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Veach Noble: The Techniques of Painted Attic Pottery. New York 1965. The Process was first re-discovered and published by Theodor Schumann: ''Oberflächenverzierung in der antiken Töpferkunst. Terra sigillata und griechische Schwarzrotmalerei.'' In: Berichte der deutschen keramischen Gesellschaft 32 (1942), S. 408–426. More References in Noble (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.

[[File:Athena Herakles Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2301 A.jpg|thumb|left|Red-figure scene on the [[Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301)]]. [[Munich]]: [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]]]
The new technique had the primary advantage of permitting a far better execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of detail with a brush. Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure [[silhouette]]s. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and of youthful age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures.

In black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn outlines were a part of the figure. In red-figure vases, the outline would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures early on. A further problem was that the black background did not permit the depiction of space in any depth, so that spatial perspective was almost never attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical details clearly illustrates the development of the style.&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman: ''Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Archaic Period'',1975, p. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Black figure vase painting had been developed in [[Corinth]] in the 7th century BC and quickly became the dominant style of pottery decoration throughout the Greek world and beyond. Although Corinth dominated the overall market, regional markets and centres of production did develop. Initially, Athens copied the Corinthian style, but it gradually came to rival and overcome the dominance of Corinth. Attic artists developed the style to an unprecedented quality, reaching the apex of their creative possibilities in the second third of the 6th century BC. [[Exekias]], active around 530 BC, can be seen as the most important representative of the black-figure style.

[[File:Fight Andokides Louvre G1.jpg|thumb|left|Warriors, flanked by [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]]. ''[[Amphora]]'' by the potter [[Andokides (potter)|Andokides]] and the [[Andokides Painter]], ''circa'' 530 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]]]] In the 5th century, Attic fine pottery, now predominantly red-figure, maintained its dominance in the markets. Attic pottery was exported to [[Magna Graecia]] and even [[Etruria]]. The preference for Attic vases led to the development of local [[South Italian]] and Etrurian workshops or "schools", strongly influenced by Attic style, but producing exclusively for local markets.

=== Beginnings ===
The first red-figure vases were produced around 530 BC. The invention of the technique normally is accredited to the [[Andokides Painter]]. He, and other early representatives of the style, e.g. [[Psiax]], initially painted vases in both styles, with black-figure scenes on one side, and red-figure on the other. Such vases, e.g. the [[Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301)]], are called [[Bilingual pottery|bilingual vases]]. Although they display major advances against the black figure style, the figures still appear somewhat stilted and seldom overlap. Compositions and techniques of the older style remained in use. Thus, incised lines are quite common, as is the additional application of red paint ("added red") to cover large areas.&lt;ref name="Oakley1141"&gt;John H. Oakley: ''Rotfigurige Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 10 (2001), col. 1141&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pioneering phase ===
[[File:Euphronios Krater Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Krater]]'' with a [[palaestra]] scene: athletes preparing for a competition, ascribed to [[Euphronios]], ''circa'' 510/500 BC, [[Berlin]]: [[Antikensammlung Berlin|Antikensammlung]]]]
The artists of the so-called "[[Pioneer Group]]" made the step towards a full exploitation of the possibilities of the red-figure technique. They were active between ''circa'' 520 and 500 BC. Important representatives include [[Euphronios]], [[Euthymides]] and [[Phintias (painter)|Phintias]]. This group, recognised and defined by twentieth-century scholarship, experimented with the different possibilities offered by the new style. Thus, figures appeared in new perspectives, such as frontal or rear views, and there were experiments with perspective [[foreshortening]] and more dynamic compositions. As a technical innovation Euphronios introduced the "relief line". At the same time new [[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes|vase shapes]] were invented, a development favoured by the fact that many of the pioneer group painters were also active as potters.

New shapes include the ''[[psykter]]'' and the ''[[pelike]]''. Large ''[[krater]]'' and ''[[amphorae]]'' became popular at this time. Although there is no indication that the painters understood themselves as a group in the way that modern scholarship does, there were some connections and mutual influences, perhaps in an atmosphere of friendly competition and encouragement. Thus, a vase by Euthymides is inscribed ''"as Euphronios never [would have been able]"''. More generally, the pioneer group tended to use inscriptions. The labelling of mythological figures or the addition of [[Kalos inscription]]s are the rule rather than the exception.&lt;ref name="Oakley1141" /&gt;

Apart from the vase painters, some bowl painters also used the new style. These include [[Oltos]] and [[Epiktetos]]. Many of their works were bilingual, often using red-figure only on the interior of the bowl.

=== Late Archaic ===
[[File:Libation Macron Louvre G149.jpg|thumb|Youth performing a [[libation]], interior of a bowl by [[Makron (vase painter)|Makron]], ''circa'' 480 BC. [[Paris]]:[[Louvre]]]]
The generation of artists after the pioneers, active during the Late [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] period (''circa'' 500 to 470 BC) brought the style to a new flourish. During this time, black-figure vases failed to reach the same quality and were pushed out of the market eventually. Some of the most famous Attic vase painters belong to this generation. They include the [[Berlin Painter]], the [[Kleophrades Painter]], and among the bowl painters [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]], [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris]], [[Makron (vase painter)|Makron]] and the [[Brygos Painter]]. The improvement of quality went along with a doubling of output during this period. Athens became the dominant producer of fine pottery in the [[Mediterranean]] world, overshadowing nearly all other production centres.&lt;ref name="Oakley1142"&gt;Oakley: ''Rotfigurige Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 10 (2001), col. 1142&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key features of this most successful Attic vase painting style is the mastery of perspective foreshortening, allowing a much more naturalistic depiction of figures and actions. Another characteristic is the drastic reduction of figures per vessel, of anatomic details, and of ornamental decorations. In contrast, the repertoire of depicted scenes was increased. For example, the myths surrounding [[Theseus]] became very popular at this time. New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see [[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes]]), [[lekythos|lekythoi]], as well as bowls of the ''[[askos (pottery vessel)|askos]]'' and ''[[dinos]]'' types. The specialisation into separate vase and bowl painters increased.&lt;ref name="Oakley1142" /&gt;

=== Early and High Classical ===

[[File:Niobid Painter - Red-Figure Amphora with Musical Scene - Walters 482712 - Side A.jpg|thumb|left|This [[amphora]] painted by the [[Niobid Painter]] is exemplary of his affinity for balanced and harmonious compositions. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

The key characteristic of Early [[Classical Greece|Classical]] figures is that they are often somewhat stockier and less dynamic than their predecessors. As a result, the depictions gained seriousness, even ''[[pathos]]''. The folds of garments were depicted less linearly, thus appearing more plastic. The manner of presenting scenes also changed substantially. Firstly, the paintings ceased to focus on the moment of a particular event, but rather, with dramatic tension, showed the situation immediately before the action, thus implying and contextualising the event proper. Also, some of the other new achievements of [[Athenian democracy]] began to show an influence on vase painting. Thus, influences of [[Tragedy#Origin|tragedy]] and of [[Ancient Greek art#Wall painting|wall painting]] can be detected. Since Greek wall painting is almost entirely lost today, its reflection on vases constitutes one of the few, albeit modest, sources of information on that genre of art. Other influences on High Classical vase painting include the newly erected [[Parthenon]] and its [[Parthenon#Sculptural decoration|sculptural decoration]]. This is especially visible in the depiction of garments; the material now falls more naturally, and more folds are depicted, leading to an increased "depth" of the depiction. The overall compositions were simplified even more. Artists placed special emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[harmony]], and [[:wikt:balance|balance]]. The human figures had returned to their earlier slenderness; often they radiate a self-absorbed, divine serenity.&lt;ref name="Oakley1142" /&gt;

Important painters of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include the [[Providence Painter]], [[Hermonax]], and the [[Achilles Painter]], all following the tradition of the Berlin Painter. The [[Phiale Painter]], probably a pupil of the Achilles Painter, is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable examples include the so-called "[[Mannerists (Greek vase painting)|mannerists]]", most famously among them the [[Pan Painter]]. Another tradition was begun by the [[Niobid Painter]] and continued by [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]], the [[Kleophon Painter]], and the [[Dinos Painter]]. The role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of the [[Penthesilea Painter]].&lt;ref name="Oakley1142" /&gt;

During the Late Classical period, in the final quarter of the 5th century, two opposed trends were created. On the one hand, a style of vase painting strongly influenced by the "Rich Style" of sculpture developed, on the other, some workshops continued the developments of the High Classical period, with an increased emphasis on the depiction of emotion, and a range of erotic scenes. The most important representative of the Rich Style is the [[Meidias Painter]]. Characteristic features include transparent garments and multiple folds of cloth. There is also an increase in the depiction of jewellery and other objects. The use of additional colours, mostly white and gold, depicting accessories in a low relief, is very striking. Over time, there is a marked "softening": The male body, heretofore defined by the depiction of muscles, gradually lost that key feature.&lt;ref name="Oakley1142" /&gt;
[[File:Hector Cassandra Pomarici Santomasi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cassandra]] and [[Hector]] on a ''[[kantharos]]'' by the [[Eretria Painter]], ''circa'' 425/20 BC. [[Gravina in Puglia]]: Museo Pomarici-Santomasi.]]
The paintings depicted mythological scenes less frequently than before. Images of the private and domestic world became more and more important. Scenes from the life of women are especially frequent. Mythological scenes are dominated by images of [[Dionysos]] and [[Aphrodite]]. It is not clear what caused this change of depicted topic among some of the artists. Suggestions include a context with the horrors of the [[Peloponnesian War]], but also the loss of Athens' dominant role in the Mediterranean pottery trade (itself partially a result of the war). The increasing role of new markets, e.g. [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], implied new needs and wishes on part of the customers. These theories are contradicted by the fact that some artists maintained the earlier style. Some, e.g. the [[Eretria Painter]], attempted to combine both traditions. The best works of the Late Classical period are often found on smaller vessels, such as belly ''[[lekythos|lekythoi]]'', ''[[pyxis (pottery)|pyxides]]'' and ''[[oinochoe|oinochai]]''. ''Lekanis'', Bell krater(see[[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes]]) and ''[[hydria]]'' were also popular.&lt;ref name="Oakley1143"&gt;Oakley: ''Rotfigurige Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 10 (2001), col. 1143&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of mainstream red-figure pottery ceased around 360 BC. The Rich and Simple styles both existed until that time. Late representatives include the [[Meleager Painter]] (Rich Style) and the [[Jena Painter]] (Simple Style).

=== Kerch Style ===
[[File:Judgement Paris Getty Villa 83.AE.10 full.jpg|thumb|[[Judgement of Paris]], [[Painter of the Wedding Procession]], ''circa'' 360 BC. [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]: [[Getty Museum]].]]
The final decades of Attic red—figure vase painting are dominated by the [[Kerch Style]]. This style, current between 370 and 330 BC, combined the preceding Rich and Modest Styles, with a preponderance of the Rich. Crowded compositions with large statuesque figures are typical. The added colours now include blue, green and others. Volume and shading are indicated by the use of diluted runny glossy clay. Occasionally, whole figures are added as appliques, i.e. as thin figural reliefs attached to the body of the vase. The variety of vessel shapes in use was reduced sharply. Common painted shapes include ''pelike'', chalice ''krater'', belly ''lekythos'', ''skyphos'', ''hydria'' and ''oinochoe''. Scenes from female life are very common. Mythological themes are still dominated by [[Dionysos]]; [[Ariadne]] and [[Heracles]] are the most commonly depicted heroes. The best-known painter of this style is the [[Marsyas Painter]].&lt;ref name="Oakley1143" /&gt;

The last Athenian vases with figural depictions were created around 320 BC at the latest. The style continued somewhat longer, but with non-figural decorations. The last recognised examples are by painters known as the [[YZ Group]].

=== Artists and Works ===
[[File:Palaestra scene Louvre G7.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tondo (art)|Tondo]] of a ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' with a [[palaestra]] scene and the signature of [[Epiktetos]], ''circa'' 520/10 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]
The [[Kerameikos]] was the potters' quarter of Athens. It contained a variety of small workshops, and probably a few larger ones. In 1852, during building activity in [[Ermou Street]], the workshop of the [[Jena Painter]] was discovered. The artefacts from it are now on display in the University collection of the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]].&lt;ref&gt;''Der Jenaer Maler'', Reichert, Wiesbaden 1996, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to modern research, the workshops were owned by the potters. The names of about 40 Attic vase painters are known, from vase inscriptions, usually accompanied by the words {{lang|grc|ἐγραψεν}} (égrapsen, has painted). In contrast, the signature of the potter, {{lang|grc|ἐποίησεν}} (epoíesen, has made) has survived on more than twice as many, namely about 100, pots (both numbers refer to the totality of Attic figural vase painting). Although signatures had been known since c. 580 BC (first known signature by the potter [[Sophilos]]), their use increased to an apex around the Pioneering Phase. A changing, apparently increasingly negative, attitude to artisans led to a reduction of signatures, starting during the Classical period at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Scheibler: ''Vasenmaler'', in: DNP 12/I, Sp. 1148&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, signatures are quite rare. The fact that they are mostly found on especially good pieces indicates that they expressed the pride of potter and/or painter.&lt;ref name="Ingeborg Scheibler P 12/I"&gt;Ingeborg Scheibler: ''Vasenmaler'', in: DNP 12/I, col. 1147f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Signature Amasis Louvre F30.jpg|thumb|right|Signature by the potter [[Amasis Painter|Amasis]] on an ''[[Olpe (container)|olpe]]'', ''circa'' 550/30 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]
The status of painters in relation to that of potters remains somewhat unclear. The fact that, e.g., [[Euphronius]] was able to work as both painter and potter suggests that at least some of the painters were not [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]]. On the other hand, some of the known names indicate that there were at least some former slaves and some ''[[perioikoi]]'' among the painters. Additionally, some of the names are not unique: for example, several painters signed as [[Polygnotos]]. This may represent attempts to profit from the name of that great painter. The same may be the case where painters bear otherwise famous names, like [[Aristophanes (vase painter)]]. The careers of some vase painters are quite well known. Apart from painters with relatively short periods of activity (one or two decades), some can be traced for much longer. Examples include [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris]], [[Makron (vase painter)|Makron]], [[Hermonax]] and the [[Achilles Painter]]. The fact that several painters later became potters, and the relatively frequent cases where it is unclear whether some potters were also painters or ''vice versa'', suggest a career structure, perhaps starting with an apprenticeship involving mainly painting, and leading up to being a potter. This division of labours appears to have developed along with the introduction of red-figure painting, since many potter-painters are known from the black-figure period (including [[Exekias]], [[Nearchos (painter)|Nearchos]] and perhaps the [[Amasis Painter]]). The increased demand for exports would have led to new structures of production, encouraging specialisation and division of labour, leading to a sometimes ambiguous distinction between painter and potter. As mentioned above, the painting of vessels was probably mainly the responsibility of younger assistants or apprentices. Some further conclusions regarding the organisational aspects of pottery production can be suggested. It appears that generally, several painters worked for one pottery workshop, as indicated by the fact that frequently, several roughly contemporary pots by the same potter are painted by various painters. For examples, pots made by [[Euphronios]] have been found to be painted by [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]], [[Douris (vase painter)|Douris]], the [[Antiphon Painter]], the [[Triptolemos Painter]] and the [[Pistoxenos Painter]]. Conversely, an individual painter could also change from one workshop to another. For example, the bowl painter [[Oltos]] worked for at least six different potters.&lt;ref name="Ingeborg Scheibler P 12/I" /&gt;

[[File:Janiform aryballos Louvre CA987.jpg|thumb|[[Kalos inscription]] on a double head-shaped vessel, painted by an artist of the [[Epilykos Class]], maybe [[Skythes]], ''circa'' 520/10 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]
Although from a modern perspective the vase painters are often considered as artists, and their vases thus as works of [[art]], this view is not consistent with that held in antiquity. Vase painters, like potters, were considered as craftsmen, their produce as trade goods.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman: ''Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Classical Period'',1989, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The craftsmen must have had a reasonably high level of education, as a variety of inscriptions occur. On the one hand, the aforementioned [[Kalos inscription]]s are common, on the other hand, inscriptions often label the depicted figures. That not every vase painter could write is shown by some examples of meaningless rows of random letters. The vases indicate a steady improvement of literacy from the 6th century BC onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Scheibler: ''Vasenmaler'', in: DNP 12/I, col. 1148&lt;/ref&gt; Whether potters, and perhaps vase painters, belonged to the Attic [[elite]] has not been satisfactorily clarified so far. Do the frequent depictions of the [[symposium]], a definite upper-class activity, reflect the painters' personal experience, their aspirations to attend such events, or simply the demands of the market?&lt;ref&gt;Boardman: ''Schwarzfigurige Vasenmalerei'', p. 13&lt;!-- I don't know what our German friends are referring to here --&gt;; Martine Denoyelle: ''Euphronios. Vasenmaler und Töpfer'', Berlin 1991, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A large proportion of the painted vases produced, such as ''[[psykter]]'', ''[[krater]]'', ''[[kalpis]]'', ''[[stamnos]]'', as well as ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylikes]]'' and ''[[kantharos|kantharoi]]'', were made and bought to be used at symposia.&lt;ref&gt;see Alfred Schäfer: ''Unterhaltung beim griechischen Symposion. Darbietungen, Spiele und Wettkämpfe von homerischer bis in spätklassische Zeit'', von Zabern, Mainz 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborately painted vases were good, but not the best, table wares available to a Greek. Metal vessels, especially from precious metals, were held in higher regard. Nonetheless, painted vases were not cheap products; the larger specimens, especially, were expensive. Around 500 BC, a large painted vase cost about one [[Drachma#Ancient drachma|drachma]], equivalent to the daily wage of a stonemason. It has been suggested that the painted vases represent an attempt to imitate metal vessels. It is normally assumed that the lower social classes tended to use simple undecorated coarse wares, massive quantities of which are found in [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]]. Tablewares made of perishable materials, like wood, may have been even more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman: ''Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Classical Period'',1989 p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, multiple finds of red-figure vases, usually not of the highest quality, found in settlements, prove that such vessels were used in daily life. A large proportion of production was taken up by cult and grave vessels. In any case, it can be assumed that the production of high-quality pottery was a profitable business. For example, an expensive [[votive]] gift by the painter Euphronios was found on the [[Athenian Acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman: ''Athenian Black Figure Vases'',1991, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be little doubt that the export of such pottery made an important contribution to the affluence of Athens. It is hardly surprising that many workshops appear to have aimed their production at export markets, for example by producing vessel shapes that were more popular in the target region than in Athens. The 4th century BC demise of Attic vase painting tellingly coincides with the very period when the [[Etruscans]], probably the main western export market, came under increasing pressure from [[Magna Graecia|South Italian Greeks]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. A further reason for the end of the production of figurally decorated vases is a change in tastes at the start of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]]. The main reason, however, should be seen in the increasingly unsuccessful progress of the Peloponnesian War, culminating in the devastating defeat of Athens in 404 BC. After this, [[Sparta]] controlled the western trade, albeit without having the economic strength to fully exploit it. The Attic potters had to find new markets; they did so in the [[Black Sea]] area. But Athens and its industries never fully recovered from the defeat. Some potters and painters had already relocated to Italy during the war, seeking better economic conditions. A key indicator for the export-oriented nature of Attic vase production is the nearly total absence of theatre scenes. Buyers from other cultural backgrounds, such as Etruscans or later customers in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], would have found such depiction incomprehensible or uninteresting. In Southern Italian vase painting, which was mostly not aimed at export, such scenes are quite common.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman: ''Athenian Red Figure Vases: The Classical Period'',1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== Southern Italy ==
At least from a modern point of view, the Southern Italian red-figure vase paintings represent the only region of production that reaches Attic standards of artistic quality. After the Attic vases, the [[South Italian]] ones (including those from [[Sicily]]), are the most thoroughly researched. In contrastic to their Attic counterparts, they were mostly produced for local markets. Only few pieces have been found outside Southern Italy and Sicily. The first workshops were founded in the mid-5th century BC by Attic potters. Soon, local craftsmen were trained and the thematic and formal dependence on Attic vases overcome. Towards the end of the century, the distinctive "ornate style" and "plain style" developed in [[Apulia]]. Especially the ornate style was adopted by other mainland schools, but without reaching the same quality.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Hurschmann: ''Unteritalische Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 12/1 (2002), col. 1009–1011&lt;/ref&gt;

By now, 21,000 South Italian vases and fragments are known. Of those, 11,000 are ascribed to Apulian workshops, 4,000 to Campanian, 2,000 to Paestan, 1,500 to Lucanian and 1,000 to Sicilian ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Unteritalische Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 12/1 (2002), col. 1010 and Trendall p. 9, with slightly differing numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apulia ===
{{See also|Apulian vase painting}}
[[File:Skyphos woman head Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.58.jpg|thumb|''[[Skyphos]]'' with depiction of a woman's head, by the [[Armidale Painter]], ''circa'' 340 BC. [[Berlin]]: [[Altes Museum]].]]
The [[Apulia]]n vase painting tradition is considered as the leading South Italian style. The main centre of production was at [[Taranto|Taras]]. Apulian red-figure vases were produced from ''circa'' 430 to 300 BC. The plain and ornate styles are distinguished. The main difference between them is that the plain style favoured bell ''craters'', column ''kraters'' and smaller vessels, and that a single "plain" vessel rarely depicted more than four figures. The main subjects were mythological scenes, female heads, warriors in scenes of combat of farewell, and dionysiac [[Dionysian mysteries|thiasos]] imagery. The reverse often showed youths wearing cloaks. The key feature of these simply decorated wares is the general absence of additional colours. Important plain style representatives are the [[Sisyphus Painter]] and the [[Tarporley Painter]]. After the mid-4th century BC, the style grows more and more similar to the ornate style. An important artist of that period is the [[Varrese Painter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Apulische Vasen'', in: DNP 1 (1996), col. 922f.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Krater by the Underworld Painter Antikensammlung Berlin 1984.44.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gigantomachy krater]] by the [[Underworld Painter]], ''circa'' 340 BC. [[Berlin]]: [[Altes Museum]].]]
The artists using the ornate style tended to favour large vessels, like volute ''kraters'', ''amphorae'', ''[[Loutrophoros|loutrophoroi]]'' and ''hydriai''. The larger surface area was used to depict up to 20 figures, often in several registers on the body of the vase. Additional colours, especially shades of red, yellow-gold and white are used copiously. Since the 2nd half of the 4th century, the necks and sides of the vases are decorated with rich vegetal or ornamental decorations. At the same time, perspective views, especially of buildings such as "Palace of [[Hades]]" (''[[naiskos|naiskoi]]''), develop. Since 360 BC, such structures are often depicted in scenes connected with burial rites (''naiskos'' vases). Important representatives of this style are the [[Ilioupersis Painter]], the [[Darius Painter]] and the [[Baltimore Painter]]. Mythological scenes were especially popular: The assembly of the Gods, the [[amazonomachy]], the [[Trojan War]], [[Heracles]] and [[Bellerophon]]. Additionally, such vases frequently depict scenes from myths that are only rarely illustrated on vases. Some specimens represent the single source for the iconography of a particular myth. Another subject that is unknown from Attic vase painting are the theatre scenes. Especially farce scenes, e.g. from the so-called ''[[phlyax play|phlyax]]'' vases are quite common. Scenes of athletic activity or everyday life only occur in the early phase, they disappear entirely after 370 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Apulische Vasen'', in: DNP 1 (1996), col. 923&lt;/ref&gt;

Apulian vase painting had a formative influence on the traditions of the other South Italian production centres. It is assumed that individual Apulian artists settled in other Italian cities and contributed their skills there. Apart from red-figure, Apulia also produced black-varnished vases with painted decor (Gnathia vases) and polychrome vases (Canosa vases).&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann in: DNP 1 (1996), col. 923&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campania ===
[[File:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|thumb|[[Medea]] killing one of her children, neck amphora by the [[Ixion Painter]], ''circa'' 330 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]
[[Campania]] also produced red-figure vases in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The light brown clay of Campania was covered with a slip that developed a pink or red tint after firing. The Campanian painters preferred smaller vessel types, but also ''hydriai'' and bell ''kraters''. The most popular shape is the bow-handled amphora. Many typical Apulian vessel shapes, like volute ''kraters'', column ''kraters'', ''loutrophoroi'', ''[[rhyton|rhyta]]'' and ''nestoris'' amphorae are absent, ''[[pelike]]s'' are rare. The repertoire of motifs is limited. Subjects include youths, women, thiasos scenes, birds and animals, and often native warriors. The backs often show cloaked youths. Mythological scenes and depictions related to burial rites play a subsidiary role. ''Naiskos scenes'', ornamental elements and polychromy are adopted after 340 BC under Lucanian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Kampanische Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 6 (1998), col. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the immigration of Sicilian potters in the second quarter of the 4th century BC, when several workshops were established in Campania, only the [[Owl-Pillar Group|Owl-Pillar Workshop]] of the second half of the 5th century is known. Campanian vase painting is subdivided in three main groups:

The first group is represented by the [[Kassandra Painter]] from [[Capua]], still under Sicilian influence. He was followed by the workshop of the [[Parrish Painter]] and that of the [[Laghetto Painter]] and the [[Caivano Painter]]. Their work is characterised by a preference for [[satyr]] figures with [[thyrsos]], depictions of heads (normally below the handles of ''hydriai''), decorative borders of garments, and the frequent use of additional white, red and yellow. The Laghetto and Caivano Painters appear to have moved to [[Paestum]] later.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Kampanische Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 6 (1998), col. 227f&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AV Group]] also had its workshop in Capua. Of particular importance is the [[Whiteface-Frignano Painter]], one of the first in this group. His typical characteristic is the use of additional white paint to depict the faces of women. This group favoured domestic scenes, women and warriors. Multiple figures are rare, usually there is only one figure each on the front and back of the vase, sometimes only the head. Garments are usually drawn casually.&lt;ref name="Hurschmann228"&gt;Hurschmann: ''Kampanische Vasenmalerei'', in: DNP 6 (1998), col. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

After 350 BC, the [[CA Painter]] and his successors worked in [[Cumae]]. The CA painter is considered as the outstanding artist of his group, or even of Campanian vase painting as a whole. From 330 onwards, a strong Apulian influence is visible. The most common motifs are ''naiskos'' and grave scenes, dionysiac scenes and symposia. Depictions of bejewelled female heads are also common. The CA painter was polychrome but tended to use much white for architecture and female figures. His successors were not fully able to maintain his quality, leading to a rapid demise, terminating with the end of Campanian vase painting around 300 BC.&lt;ref name="Hurschmann228" /&gt;

[[File:Hermes Herse Louvre G494.jpg|thumb|[[Hermes]] pursuing a woman, bell ''krater'' by the [[Dolon Painter]], circa 390/80 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]

=== Lucania ===
The [[Lucania]]n vase painting tradition began around 430 BC, with the works of the [[Pisticci Painter]]. He was probably active in [[Pisticci]], where some of his works were discovered. He was strongly influenced by Attic tradition. His successors, the [[Amycus Painter]] and the [[Cyclops Painter]] had a workshop in [[Metapontum]]. They were the first to paint the new ''nestoris'' (see [[Typology of Greek Vase Shapes]]) vase type. Mythical or theatrical scenes are common. For example, the [[Cheophoroi painter]], named after the [[Oresteia|Cheophoroi]] by [[Aeschylos]] showed scenes from the tragedy in question on several of his vases. The influence of Apulian vase painting becomes tangible roughly at the same time. Especially polychromy and vegetal decor became standard. Important representatives of this style include the [[Dolon Painter]] and the [[Brooklyn-Budapest Painter]]. Towards the mid-4th century BC, a massive drop in quality and thematic variety becomes notable. The last notable Lucanian vase painter was the [[Primato Painter]], strongly influenced by the Apulian [[Lycourgos Painter]]. After him, a short rapid demise is followed by the cessation of Lucanian vase painting at the start of the last quarter of  the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Lukanische Vasen'', in: DNP 7 (1999), col. 491&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paestum ===

The [[Paestum|Paestan]] vase painting style developed as the last of the South Italian styles. It was founded by Sicilian immigrants around 360 BC.  the first workshop was controlled by [[Asteas]] and [[Python (painter)|Python]]. They are the only South Italian vase painters known from inscriptions. They mainly painted bell ''kraters'', neck amphorae, ''hydriai'', ''[[Lebes Gamikos|lebes gamikos]]'', ''lekanes'', ''lekythoi'' and jugs, more rarely ''pelikes'', chalice ''kraters'' and volute ''kraters''. Characteristics include decorations such as lateral palmettes, a pattern of tendrils with [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] and umbel known as "asteas flower", [[crenelation]]-like patterns on garments and curly hair hanging over the back of figures. Figures that bend forwards, resting on plants or rocks, are equally common.  Special colours are used often, especially white, gold, black, purple and shades of red.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Paestanische Vasen'', in: DNP 9 (2000), col. 142&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Orestes Delphi BM GR1917.12-10.1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orestes]] in [[Delphi]], ''krater'' by [[Python (painter)|Python]], ''circa'' 330 BC. [[London]]: [[British Museum]].]]
The themes depicted often belong to the Dionysiac cycle: thiasos and symposium scenes, satyrs, [[maenad]]s, [[Silenos]], [[Orestes]], [[Electra]], the gods [[Aphrodite]] and [[Eros]], [[Apollo]], [[Athena]] and [[Hermes]]. Paestan painting rarely depicts domestic scenes, but favours animals. Asteas and Python had a major influence on the vase painting of Paestum. This is clearly visible in the work of the [[Aphrodite Painter]], who probably immigrated from Apulia.  Around 330 BC, a second workshop developed, originally following the work of the first. The quality of its painting and variety of its motifs deteriorated quickly. At the same time, an influence by the Campanian [[Caivano Painter]] becomes notable, garments falling in a linear fashion and contourless female figures followed. Around 300 BC, Paestan vase painting came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Hurschmann: ''Paestanische Vasen'', in: DNP 9 (2000), col. 142f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sicily ===

The production of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] vase painting began before the end of the 5th century BC, in the [[polis|poleis]] of [[Himera]] and [[Syracusae]]. In terms of style, themes, ornamentation and vase shapes, the workshops were strongly influenced by the Attic tradition, especially by the Late Classical [[Meidias Painter]]. In the second quarter of the 4th century, Sicilian vase painters emigrated to Campania and Paestum, where they introduced red-figure vase painting. Only Syracusae retained a limited production.&lt;ref name="Hurschmann606"&gt;Hurschmann: ''Sizilische Vasen'', in: DNP 11 (2001), col. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical Sicilian style only developed around 340 BC. Three groups of workshops can be distinguished. The first, known as the [[Lentini-Manfria Group]], was active in [[Syracusae]] and [[Gela]], a second, making [[Centuripe Ware]] around Mt. [[Aetna]], and a third on [[Lipari]]. The most typical feature of Sicilian vase painting is the use of additional colours, especially white. In the early phase, large vessels like chalice ''kraters'' and ''hydriai'' were painted, but smaller vessels like flasks, ''lekanes'', ''lekythoi'' and skyphoid ''pyxides'' are more typical. The most common motifs are scenes from female life, ''[[eros|erotes]]'', female heads and ''phlyax'' scenes. Mythological scenes are rare. Like in all other areas, vase painting disappears from Sicily around 300 BC.&lt;ref name="Hurschmann606" /&gt;

== Etruria and other regions ==
[[File:Artemis hinds Louvre CA1795.jpg|thumb|left|[[Artemis]] in a [[Chariot]], Kantharos by the Painter of the Great Athens Kantharos, ca 450/425 BC.]]
In contrast to black-figure vase painting, red-figure vase painting developed few regional traditions, workshops or "schools" outside Attica and Southern Italy. The few exceptions include some workshops in [[Boeotia]] ([[Painter of the Great Athens Kantharos]]), [[Chalkidike]], [[Elis]], [[Eretria]], [[Corinth]] and [[Laconia]].

Only [[Etruria]], one of the main export markets for Attic vases, developed its own schools and workshops, eventually exporting its own products. The adoption of red-figure painting, imitating Athenian vases, occurred only after 490 BC, half a century after the style had been developed. Because of the technique used, the earliest examples are known as pseudo-red-figure vase paintings. The true red-figure technique was introduced much later, near the end of the 5th century BC. Several painters, workshops and production centres are known for both styles. Their products were not only used locally, but also exported to [[Malta]], [[Carthage]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Liguria]].

=== Pseudo-red-figure vase painting ===
The early Etrurian examples merely imitated the red-figure technique. Similar to a rare and early Attic technique (see [[Six's technique]]), the whole vessel was covered with black glossy clay and figures were applied afterwards using mineral colours that would oxidise red or white. Thus, in contrast to contemporary Attic vase painting, the red colour was not achieved by leaving areas unpainted but by adding paint to the black prime layer. Like in black-figure vases, internal detail was not painted on, but incised into the figures. Important representatives of this style include the [[Praxias Painter]] and other masters from his workshop in [[Vulci]]. In spite of their evident good knowledge of Greek myth and iconography, there is no evidence to indicate that these painters had immigrated from Attica. An exception to this may be the Praxia Painter, as Greek inscription on four of his vases may indicate that he originated from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reinhard Lullies]] in ''Antike Kunstwerke aus der Sammlung Ludwig. Vol 1. Frühe Tonsarkophage und Vasen'', von Zabern, Mainz 1979, p. 178–181 {{ISBN|3-8053-0439-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure style was not just a phenomenon of the earliest phases, as it had been in Attica. Especially during the 4th century, some workshops specialised in this technique, although true red-figure painting was widespread among Etrurian workshops at the same time. Notable workshops include the [[Sokra Group]] and the [[Phantom Group]]. The Sokra Group, somewhat older, preferred bowls with interior decoration of Greek mythical themes, but also some Etruscan motifs. The phantom Group mainly painted cloaked figures combined with vegetal or palmette ornamentation. The workshops of both groups are suspected to have been in [[Caere]], [[Falerii]] and [[Tarquinia]]. The Phantom Group produced until the early 3rd century BC. Like elsewhere, the changing tastes of the customers eventually led to the end of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Huberta Heres – Max Kunze (Hrsg.): ''Die Welt der Etrusker, Archäologische Denkmäler aus Museen der sozialistischen Länder''.

=== Red-figure vase painting ===
[[File:Athena Poseidon Louvre CA7426.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] and [[Poseidon]] on a volute ''krater'' by the [[Nazzano Painter]], ''circa'' 360 BC. [[Paris]]: [[Louvre]].]]
True red figure vase painting, i.e. vases where the red areas have been left unpainted, was introduced to Etruria near the end of the 5th century BC. The first workshops developed in Vulci and Falerii and produced also for the surrounding areas. It is likely that Attic masters were behind these early workshops, but a [[South Italian]] influence is evident, too. These workshops dominated the Etruscan market into the 4th century BC. Large and medium-sized vessels like ''kraters'' and jugs were decorated mostly with mythological scenes. In the course of the 4th century, the Falerian production began to eclipse that of Vulci. New centres of production developed in [[Chiusi]] and [[Orvieto]]. Especially the [[Tondo Group]] of Chiusi, producing mainly drinking vessels with interior depictions of dionysiac scenes, became important. During the second half of the century, [[Volterra]] became a main centre. Here, especially rod-handled ''kraters'' were produced and, especially in the early phases, painted elaborately.

During the 2nd half of the 4th century BC, mythological themes disappeared from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, like that on a ''krater'' by the [[Den Haag Funnel Group Painter]] were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted ''oinochoai'', ''lekythoi'' and drinking bowls of the [[Torcop Group]], and plates of the [[Genucuilia Group]]. The switch to the production of black glaze vases near the end of the 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.&lt;ref&gt;Huberta Heres – Max Kunze (Hrsg.): ''Die Welt der Etrusker, Archäologische Denkmäler aus Museen der sozialistischen Länder''. Exhibition catalogue Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR – Altes Museum vom 04. Oktober bis 30. Dezember 1988. Berlin 1988, p. 249-263&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and reception ==
[[File:Gnathia Ware, Southern Italy, 310-260 BC, Prague Kinsky, 140912.jpg|thumb|[[Gnathia vases|Gnathia ware]], [[southern Italy]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), [[Apulian vase painting]] of a [[blond]] woman, 310-260 BC, [[Kinský Palace (Prague)]]]]
About 65,000 red-figure vases and vase fragments are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Balbina Bäbler]], in DNP 15/3 (Zeitrechnung: I. Klassische Archäologie, Sp. 1164) refers to 65.000 vases having been examined by Beazley. From that number, about 20.000 must be subtracted, since they were black-figure (Boardman: Schwarzfigurige Vasen aus Athen, S. 7). 21.000 red-figure vases are known from Southern Italy. Additionally, there are some examples from other parts of Greece&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ancient pottery and of Greek vase painting began already in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Restoro d'Arezzo]] dedicated a chapter (''Capitolo de le vasa antiche'') of his description of the world to ancient vases. He considered especially the clay vessels as perfect in terms of shape, colour, and artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Naumer: ''Vasen/Vasenmalerei'', in DNP 15/3, col. 946&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, initially the attention focused on vases in general, and perhaps especially on stone vases. The first collections of ancient vases, including some painted vessels, developed during the [[Renaissance]]. We even know of some imports from Greece to Italy at that time. Still, until the end of the [[Baroque]] period, vase painting was overshadowed by other genres, especially by [[Greek sculpture|sculpture]]. A rare pre-[[Classicist]] exception is a book of [[watercolour]]s depicting figural vases, which was produced for [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]]. Like some of his contemporary collectors, Peiresc owned a number of clay vases.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Naumer: ''Vasen/Vasenmalerei'', in DNP 15/3, col. 947-949&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the period of [[Classicism]], ceramic vessels were collected more frequently. For example, [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton's first collection of "Etruscan" vases was lost at sea but memorialized in engravings; he formed a second collection that is conserved in the [[British museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giuseppe Valletta]] had vase collections. Vases found in Italy were relatively affordable, so that even private individuals could assemble important collections. Vases were a popular souvenir for young northwestern Europeans to bring home from the [[Grand Tour]]. In the diaries of his voyageto Italy,&lt;ref&gt;9. März 1787&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goethe]] refers to the temptation of buying ancient vases. Those who could not afford originals had the option of acquiring copies or prints. There were even [[manufactory|manufactories]] specialised in imitating ancient pottery. The best known is [[Wedgwood]] ware, although it employed techniques entirely unrelated to those used in antiquity, using ancient motifs merely as a thematic inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Naumer: ''Vasen/Vasenmalerei'', in DNP 15/3, col. 949-950&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1760s, archaeological research also began to focus on vase paintings. The vases were appreciated as source material for all aspects of ancient life, especially for [[iconography|iconographical]] and [[Greek mythology|mythological]] studies. Vase painting was now treated as a substitute for the almost entirely lost oeuvre of [[Ancient Greek art#Wall painting|Greek monumental painting]]. Around this time, the widespread view that all painted vases were Etruscan works became untenable. Nonetheless, the artistic fashion of that time to imitate ancient vases came to be called ''all'etrusque''. England and France tried to outdo each other in terms of both research and imitation of vases. The German aesthetic writers [[Johann Heinrich Müntz]] and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] studied vase paintings. Winckelmann especially praised the ''Umrißlinienstil'' ("outline style", i.e. red-figure painting). Vase ornaments were compiled and disseminated in England through ''Pattern books''.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Naumer: ''Vasen/Vasenmalerei'', in DNP 15/3, col. 951-954&lt;/ref&gt;

Vase paintings even had an influence on the development of modern painting. The linear style influenced artists such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustave Moreau]] or [[Gustav Klimt]]. Around 1840, [[Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller]] painted a ''Still Life with Silver Vessels and Red-Figure Bell Krater''. [[Henri Matisse]] produced a similar painting (''Intérieur au vase étrusque''). Their aesthetic influence extends into the present. For example, the well-known curved shape of the Coca-Cola bottle is inspired by Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Naumer: ''Vasen/Vasenmalerei'', in DNP 15/3, col. 954&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of Attic vase paintings was advanced especially by [[John Beazley|John D. Beazley]]. Beazley began to study the vases from about 1910 onwards, inspired by the methodology that the [[art historian]] [[Giovanni Morelli]] had developed for the study of paintings. He assumed that each painter produced individual works that can always be unmistakably ascribed. To do so, particular details, such as faces, fingers, arms, legs, knees, garment folds and so on, were compared. Beazley examined 65,000 vases and fragments (of which 20,000 were black-figure). In the course of six decades of study, he was able to ascribe 17,000 of them to individual artists. Where their names remained unknown, he developed a system of conventional names. Beazley also united and combined individual painters into groups, workshops, schools and styles. No other archaeologist has ever had as formative an influence on a whole subdiscipline as had Beazley on the study of Greek vase painting. A large proportion of his analysis is still considered valid today. Beazley first published his conclusions on red-figure vase painting in 1925 and 1942. His initial studies only considered material from before the 4th century BC. For a new edition of his work published in 1963, he also incorporated that later period, making use of the work of other scholars, such as [[Karl Schefold]], who had especially studied the [[Kerch Style]] vases. Famous scholars who continued the study of Attic red-figure after Beazley include [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]], [[Erika Simon]] and [[Dietrich von Bothmer]].&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman: ''Schwarzfigurige Vasen aus Athen'', p. 7f.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the study of [[South Italian]] case painting, [[Arthur Dale Trendall]]'s work has a similar significance to that of Beazley for Attica. Most post-Beazley scholars can be said to follow Beazley's tradition and use his methodology.&lt;ref&gt;The principal exceptions being David Gill and Michael Vickers who repudiate the significance of vase painting as an art form and reject the analogy of Renaissance artists' studios and the ancient Greek pottery workshop, see Gill and Vickers ''Artful Crafts'', 1994, also R.M. Cook ''Artful Crafts: A Commentary'', JHS, 107, 1997 for a critique of Vickers's and Gill's thesis. Additionally James Whitely and Herbert Hoffman have criticised Beazley's approach as being unduly "positivist" in that it concentrates exclusively on aspects of connoisseurship at the cost of ignoring the larger social and cultural context that might have influence the practice of vase painting, see J. Whitley, ''Beazley As Theorist.'' Antiquity 72 (March 1998): 40-47, and H. Hoffman, ''In the Wake of Beazley. Prolegomena to an Anthropological Study of Greek Vase Painting.'' Hephaistos 1 (1979): 61-70.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Greek vases is ongoing, not least because of the constant addition of new material from [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]], [[Illicit antiquities|illicit excavations]] and unknown private collections.

The '''Second Situationist International''' were a small group of [[situationist]]s (the "Nashists") who broke away from the [[Situationist International]] (SI). [[Jørgen Nash]] identifies the first manifestation of the group as a leaflet signed by himself along with [[Jacqueline de Jong]] and [[Ansgar Elde]], shortly after the group Seven Rebels was formed at Situationist Bauhau at [[Asger Jorn]]'s farm [[Drakabygget]] in southern [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Special Issue, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the rupture with the SI, Jorn, who sided with the SI against Nash, emphasised [[situlogy]], "the transformative morphology of the unique."&lt;ref&gt;Asger Jorn "Open Creation and its Enemies," ''Internationale Situationniste'' No. 5, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Slater describes the break between the "Parisian" and the "Scandinavian" tendencies as amounting to "a conflict between a conceptual and an expressionist approach, or, to echo Jorn's two tendencies of situlogy, a conflict between the ludic and the analytical," and quotes the ''Drakabygget Declaration'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Franco-Belgian Situationists base themselves on the same principles as [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]]... action precedes emotion. Emotion is a primary non-reflective intelligence: passionate thought/thinking passion. ... We do not always distinguish between theory and practice. We intend to produce our theories after the event.... The French work exactly the other way round. They want everything straight before they start and everybody has to line up correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.infopool.org.uk/2001.html | title= Divided We Stand - An Outline of Scandinavian Situationism | author= Slater, Howard |date= 2001 | publisher= http://www.infopool.org.uk Infopool.org | accessdate= 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Drakabygget Declaration'' was the founding document of the Second Situationist International, which appeared in the ''Situationist Times'' No. 2, 1962.

The declaration was signed by [[Jørgen Nash]], [[Jens Jørgen Thorsen]], [[Gordon Fazakerley]], [[Hardy Strid]], Stefan Larsson, [[Ansgar Elde]], [[Jacqueline de Jong]], and [[Guy Atkins|Patrick O'Brien]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Slater, Patrick O'Brien was a pseudonym for Guy Atkins, author of ''Asger Jorn'' (Methuen London, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; following their expulsion from the Situationist International.

The contributors to ''[[Situationist Antinational]]'' were all associated with the Second Situationist International.

[[File:St Georges Langham Place.jpg|thumb|right|250px|From ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 29 June 1867]]
'''St. George's Hall''' was a theatre located in [[Langham Place, London|Langham Place]], off [[Regent Street]] in the [[West End of London]]. It was built in 1867 and closed in 1966.  The hall could accommodate between 800 and 900 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Dickens, Charles, Jr. | year =1879| title = Public Halls, St. George's Hall | work = [[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]| url = http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-que.htm| accessdate = 2007-08-22| authorlink = Charles Dickens, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or up to 1,500 persons including the galleries. The architect was John Taylor of Whitehall.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/StGeorgesHallLanghamPlaceLondon.htm History of the Hall from the Arthur Lloyd website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hall was known for three decades for its presentation of the [[German Reed Entertainments]] alongside other musical works and lectures.  After 1895, it was used for [[vaudeville]], drama, magic shows, as the headquarters of the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|London Academy of Music]], and even as a skating rink.  In 1933, it became a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] broadcasting studio but was shut down after extensive damage [[London Blitz|from bombing in March 1943]].  The theatre was demolished in 1966, and the St Georges Hotel and [[Henry Wood]] House now stand on the site.

==German Reed Entertainments and lectures==
The hall was built as a concert hall for the New Philharmonic Society and opened on 24 April 1867. The Hall could be used as a theatre, however, and the first production at "St. George's Theatre" was ''A Woman's Whim'' by Walter Stephens on 3 December 1867.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

[[File:EyesandNo.jpg|left|frame|[[W. S. Gilbert]]'s last [[German Reed Entertainment]], 1875.]]Soon afterwards, the theatre was leased by [[Thomas German Reed]], who initially produced and conducted ''[[The Contrabandista]]'' (a [[comic opera]] by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and [[F. C. Burnand]]), ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and other English operas in small-scale productions. In 1874, Reed's wife, [[Priscilla Horton|Priscilla German Reed]], moved the [[German Reed Entertainment]]s to St. George's Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German Reed|volume=47|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like their earlier theatre, the [[Gallery of Illustration]], St. George's had a small stage, and musical works were presented with only piano and harmonium.  Thomas retired in 1871, and his son Alfred continued to run the theatre with his mother until her retirement in 1879 and, beginning in 1877, in partnership with [[Richard Corney Grain]], until both their deaths in 1895.

The pieces premiered there included [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s farce, ''A Medical Man'' (1872) and his one-act [[comic opera]], ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875). [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] wrote ''Married Life'', and [[John Maddison Morton]] wrote ''Slasher and Crasher'' for the hall, both in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/icons/playbills/londonstgeorgeshall.htm Comtempory playbill (13 May 1872)] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to performances, there were regular lectures in the hall, the [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[Gerald Massey]] gave a series of lectures in 1872, on ''Christianity and Spiritualism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domain1041943.sites.fasthosts.com/massey/cnr_langham_place_index.htm The Langham Place lectures 1872 – Gerald Massey] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theist [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]] gave regular Sunday sermons from 1875, after his ejection from the established church. [[H. G. Wells]] described a visit to one tedious Sunday lecture in ''Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/wellshg/certain-personal-matters/22/ Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head] accessed 16 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  When they were not presenting a piece at the hall, it was rented it out to amateurs or other entertainments.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

[[File:William Poel's Hamlet court scene 1881.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The court scene from [[William Poel]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1881]][[File:Corney Grain and Alfred Reed.png|[[Richard Corney Grain]] and Alfred Reed, from the 1896 Entr'acte Annual|thumb|220px]]
At the hall [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]] presented ''Two Foster Brothers'', composed by [[Alfred Cellier]] (1877), and ''Once in a Century'', with music by Vivian Bligh.  [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] wrote his first [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''Back from India'' for the hall in 1879, as well as ''Hobbies'' in 1885, with [[William Yardley (cricketer)|William Yardley]] and music by George Gear.  ''Cherry Tree Farm'' and ''All at Sea'' played in 1881.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The same year, [[William Poel]] produced his ''[[Hamlet]]''.  In the early 1880s, [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]] sometimes substituted at the Hall for Corney Grain.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Death Of Mr. Eric Lewis", ''The Times'', 2 April 1935, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Herbert Gardiner wrote ''A Night in Wales'' (1885) for the hall with music by Corney Grain.  [[Alfred J. Caldicott]] wrote a number of pieces for the hall, including ''A Treasure Trove'', ''A Moss Rose Rent'' (1883), ''Old Knockles'' (1884), ''In Cupid's Court'' (1885), ''The Friar'' (1886), ''Tally Ho'' (1887), ''Wanted, An Heir and The Boson's Mate'' (1888), ''John Smith'' (1889), ''The Old Bureau'' (1891), and ''An Old Pair'' (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Phil. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/46.htm A Forty-sixth Garland of British Light Music Composers"], MusicWeb-International.com, accessed 7 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fanny Holland]] starred in many of the entertainments, along with Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, their son Alfred, Holland's husband [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], Corney Grain, [[Arthur Cecil]] (all of whom also wrote for the hall) Carlotta Carrington and [[Leonora Braham]], who made her professional stage debut in 1870 at the hall in a revival of [[W. S. Gilbert|Gilbert]] and [[Frederic Clay|Clay]]'s ''[[Ages Ago]]'', which was revived again there in 1874.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  Except for a brief stint at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in 1874 and at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1879-80, Holland starred at St. George's until 1895 in entertainments too numerous to name.  Many of the entertainments were written by Law, including ''A Night Surprise'' (1877), ''Nobody's Fault'', composed by Hamilton Clarke (1882), and ''A Happy Bungalow'', with music by [[Charles King Hall]].  Other pieces from the 1870s starring Holland included ''Number 204'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], with music by Thomas German Reed; and ''Our New Doll’s House'' by W. Wye, with music by Cotsford Dick.

==Later uses of the hall==
After the [[German Reed Entertainments]] closed in 1895, the building changed its name to the Matinee Theatre, on 17 April 1897, presenting "high class [[vaudeville]]," but it was not very successful.  A series of German plays were then produced, but in 1904 the hall closed.

In 1905, magician [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] renovated, expanded and reopened the 'St George's Hall, England's New Home of Mystery,' on 24 January 1905 with ''The Coming Race'' by [[David Christie Murray]] and Maskelyne.  Maskelyne's entertainments were called ''Maskelyne's Theatre of Mystery.''&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The theatre also hosted meetings of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]], an association of amateur and professional magicians, and its members [[David Devant]] and Maskelyne continued to give magic shows for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findmeaconference.com/520127.htm Information about The Magic Circle club's connection to the theatre] accessed 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  One was called ''Maskelyne and Devant's Mysteries'', which was presented in August 1910.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

The hall was also used as a ''Bioscope Picture Palace'', although with a reduced capacity of 500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonfilm.bbk.ac.uk/view/venue/?id=821 Bioscope Annual Report 1910-11 p.87] accessed 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The building also was used as the headquarters of the [[London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art|London Academy of Music]].  The hall was later converted to use as a skating rink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45207 Notes that the hall was later converted into a skating rink] accessed 14 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

St. George's was finally acquired by [[Eric Maschwitz]] for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] in 1933 for broadcasts of vaudeville, comedy and revue shows, and opened as a studio on 25 November 1933. The BBC installed the original ''BBC Theatre Organ'' in 1936, a ''Compton Melotone and Electrostatic Organ'', this enabled a wide range of sounds to be produced during performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.msnusers.com/ComptonMelotonesandElectrostaticOrgans/bbctheatreorgan.msnw BBC Theatre Organ, St George's Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; Reginald Foort was appointed resident organist. The hall sustained extensive damage from bombing in March 1943, during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ibs.org.uk/audiocompendium/index.php?title=St._George's_Hall Institute of Broadcast Sound] accessed 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the studios moved to the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]], in New Bond Street.

The building was demolished in 1966, and together with the site of the adjacent [[Queens Hall]] – original home of the [[Henry Wood (conductor)|Henry Wood]] [[The Proms|promenade concert]]s – the location was used for the construction of the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House.

The figure is a miniature cast figure of a nude woman standing on the platform corner, with long legs, high hair, a flat face, and a large, straight nose.

The pattern is created on the printing plate either in [[engraving]] by gouging out the dots with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], or through an [[etching]] process.&lt;ref name=pankow/&gt; [[Stippling]] was used as an adjunct to conventional [[line engraving]] and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The technique allows for subtle tonal variations and is especially suitable for reproducing chalk drawings.&lt;ref name=verhoogt&gt;{{cite book|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-Century Prints after Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|first= Robert|last= Verhoogt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Verhoogt,+Art+in+Reproduction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Xi0NT57ZJOquiQKfntSGBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=crayon%20manner&amp;f=false|page=77|isbn=978-90-5356-913-9|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Stipple effects were used in conjunction with other engraving techniques by artists as early as [[Giulio Campagnola]] (c.1482 – c. 1515) and [[Ottavio Leoni]] (1578 – 1630), although some of Campagnola's small prints were almost entirely in stipple.&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Zucker in Kristin L. Spangenberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints: Treasures from the Herbert Greer French collection'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, nos 39 &amp; 40, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Holland in the seventeenth century, the printmaker and goldsmith [[Jan Lutma]] developed an engraving technique, known as ''opus mallei'', in which the dots are punched into the plate by an awl struck with a hammer, while in England the faces of portraits were engraved with stippled dots by [[William Rogers (engraver)|William Rogers]] in the sixteenth century and [[Lucas Vorsterman]] in the seventeenth.&lt;ref name=salaman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Old Engravers of England in Their Relation to Contemporary Life and Art|first= Malcolm C.|last= Salaman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZh5Bl3_zb8C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq|pages=204–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eighteenth century==
[[File:Duchess of Richmond, 1775 stipple engraving.jpg|thumb|''The Duchess of Richmond'', a stipple engraving portrait by [[William Wynne Ryland]] after [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1775)]]

An etched stipple technique known as the '''crayon manner''', suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France.  Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's chasing tools and marking-wheels to shade the lines in a series of ''Trophies'' designed by [[Antoine Watteau]]. [[Jean-Charles François]] who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner.  He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together.  Other people who contributed to this new  engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse.&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Wynne Ryland]], who had worked with Jean-Charles François,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; took the crayon manner to Britain, using it in his contributions to Charles Roger’s publication ''A Collection of Prints in imitation of Drawings'',&lt;ref name=verhoogt/&gt; and developing it further under the name of  "stipple engraving".&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt;

The process of stipple engraving is described in [[Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding|T.H. Fielding]]'s ''Art of Engraving'' (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an etching needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in [[mezzotint]] use was made of ''roulettes'', and a ''mattoir'' to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a [[drypoint]] or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as "resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.&lt;ref name=fielding&gt;{{cite book|last=Fielding|first=T.H.|title=The Art of Engraving|pages=63–64|publisher=Ackerman &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the technique fed a fashion for reproductions of red chalk drawings by artists such as [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  [[Gilles Demarteau]] etched 266 drawings of Boucher in stipple, for printing in an appropriate [[sanguine]]-coloured ink and framing.&lt;ref name=grif&gt;[[Antony Griffiths|Griffiths, Antony]], ''Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques'', pp 81, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}; [[A. Hyatt Mayor|Mayor, Hyatt A.]], ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 587-588, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prints so resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of residences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints &amp; People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

In England the technique was used for "furniture prints" with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market.  Stipple competed with mezzotint as a tonal method of [[printmaking]], and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate.&lt;ref name=grif/&gt;

During the late eighteenth century, some printmakers, including [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], began to use colour in stipple engraving. Rather than using separate plates for each colour, as in most colour printing processes of the time, such as [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]]'s three-colour mezzotint method, the different colours were carefully applied with a brush to a single plate for each impression,&lt;ref name=salaman/&gt; a highly skilled operation which soon proved economically unviable.&lt;ref name=pankow&gt;{{cite book|title=Tempting the Palette: a survey of color printing processes|first=David|last= Pankow|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|year=2005 |page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zDi3b3nf3oC&amp;q=yielding+a+single+print#v=snippet&amp;q=yielding%20a%20single%20print&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-1-933360-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is also known as ''à la poupée'' after the French term for the small cotton pads used for the inking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/clrflimpr-tech.shtm NGA Washington]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''''' is an essay written by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] which first appeared in The New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine in 1843. It was later reprinted in the “Medical Essays” in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.htm|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is included as Volume 38, Part 5 of the [[Harvard Classics]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Classics, Vol. 38, Part 5   The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|url=http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/|website=Bartleby.com|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Synopsis==

In just under 12,000 words Holmes argues forcefully and convincingly that the rampant infection killing women within a few days of childbirth was caused mainly through infection spread by their birth attendants. He also laid down well-thought out and easy to execute behaviors through which the spread of infection could be contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==

Holmes developed an interest in [[puerperal fever]] by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from [[Harvard Medical School]]. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at [[Dartmouth College]] from 1838 to 1840.  In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination of a woman who had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
“The disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever|date=1843|publisher=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery 1|page=213|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Unfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the [[Boston Society for Medical Improvement]]. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery in April 1843.  Due to low circulation of this specialized journal and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary of Practical Medicine. Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that "Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copeland|first1=James|title=A Dictionary of Practical Medicine|date=1852|publisher=New York: Harper and Brothers|location=volume 7|page=559|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnellé, Dugé, Dewees and others still denying this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oliver Wendell Holmes|url=http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|website=Lane Library|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135355/http://elane.stanford.edu/wilson/html/chap5/chap5-sect2.html#chap5-ref49|archivedate=17 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Twelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it “Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.” He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Oliver Wendell|title=Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence|date=1855|publisher=Boston: Ticknor and Fields|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">"'''The Flail From Heaven'''" (German: ''Der Dreschflegel vom Himmel'') is a [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Brothers Grimm fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 112.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/barkerb/fairies/grimm/112.html |title=Grimm / Tale112 |publisher=Myweb.dal.ca |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type  AT 1889K, ''A Rope Made of Chaff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/classification |title=Grimm - Classification (Aarne-Thompson) |publisher=Grimmstories.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The tale begins with a peasant tilling his fields with a pair of oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an extraordinary size; an effect that prevented the peasant from returning home with them. Fortunately, the peasant was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with the peasant, offering should the peasant return to him with the measure of [[rapeseed]] he would exchange a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] [[thaler]] for each seed. The peasant returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from the butcher, the peasant passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to the heavens. The peasant climbed the tree and, reaching the top, spied angels [[threshing]] oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from the tree, the peasant wove a length of rope from the oat [[chaff]] that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] and a [[flail]] which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of the pit. The peasant kept the flail as proof of his adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanliterature.com/author/brothers-grimm/fairy-tale/the-flail-from-heaven |title=The Flail From Heaven - The Brothers Grimm |publisher=Americanliterature.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''THINK'''" is a slogan first used by [[Thomas J. Watson]] in December, 1911, while managing the sales and advertising departments at the [[National Cash Register Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Random House Webster's College Dictionary|publisher = Random House|year= 1999 |page = 1237}}''slogan: a distinctive phrase or motto identified with a particular party, product, etc.''&lt;/ref&gt;  At an uninspiring sales meeting Watson interrupted, saying ''The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough.  We don't get paid for working with our feet &amp;mdash; we get paid for working with our heads''.  Watson then wrote '''THINK''' on the easel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Thomas|last = Belden|author2=Belden, Marva |title = The Lengthening Shadow: The Life of Thomas J. Watson|publisher = Little, Brown and Company|year= 1962 |pages= 157–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked later what he meant by the slogan, Watson replied, "''By THINK I mean take everything into consideration. I refuse to make the sign more specific.  If a man just sees THINK, he'll find out what I mean.  We're not interested in a logic course."''&lt;ref&gt;Belden (1962) p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Watson brought the slogan with him to the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company|Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)]] and its subsidiaries, all of which later became [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic2/attic2_207.html IBM Archives: THINK Sign]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maney, Kevin (2003).

'''Web colors''' are [[color]]s used in [[Web design|displaying web pages]], and the methods for describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as an [[RGB color model|RGB]] triplet or in [[hexadecimal]] format (a ''hex triplet'') or according to their common English names in some cases. A [[color tool]] or other [[graphics software]] is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading [[number sign]] (#).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;York, Richard. ''Beginning CSS'', pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by eight [[bit]]s. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the [[sRGB]] gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.

Colors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to [[scRGB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |at=section 4.2.1. RGB color values |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 |date=7 June 2011 |publisher=W3C |editor1-first=Tantek |editor1-last=Çelik |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Lilley |editor3-first=L. David |editor3-last=Baron |first1=Steven |last1=Pemberton |first2=Brad |last2=Pettit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifying a non-sRGB color this way requires the RGB() function call; it is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax (and thus impossible in legacy [[HTML]] documents that do not use CSS).

The first versions of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] and [[Netscape Navigator]] used the [[X11 color names]] as the basis for their color lists, as both started as [[X Window System]] applications.
Web colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition, [[sRGB]], which relates the [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] of a particular [[phosphor]] set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Digital Color Imaging Handbook By Gaurav Sharma. {{ISBN|0-8493-0900-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world [[Computer monitor|monitors]] and viewing conditions, in order to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without [[color management]]. [[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.

==Hex triplet==
A '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[True Color]] (24-bit RGB) color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:
:Byte 1: red value (color type red)
:Byte 2: green value (color type green)
:Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)
For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.

If any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.

The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or 256&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; = 16,777,216.

===Shorthand hexadecimal form===
An abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1. RGB color values |date=7 June 2011 |editor1-first=Tantek |editor1-last=Çelik |editor2-first=Chris |editor2-last=Lilley |editor3-first=L. David |editor3-last=Baron |first1=Steven |last1=Pemberton |first2=Brad |last2=Pettit |accessdate=19 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] example:

&lt;source lang="css"&gt;
.threedigit { color: #09C;    }
.sixdigit   { color: #0099CC; } /* same color as above */
&lt;/source&gt;

This shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors), this limitation is sufficient for many text based documents.

===Converting RGB to hexadecimal===
{{See also|Hexadecimal#Conversion}}
RGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the 0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives us the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives us the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives us the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.

Conversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.

==HTML color names==
The [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 "Colors"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):
{{Colornames}}

These 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were "the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification "The BODY element" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X11 color names==
[[File:SVG Recognized color keyword names.svg|thumbnail|SVG Version of X11 color names]]
{{main|X11 color names}}
A number of colors are defined by [[web browser]]s. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].

The list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below. Compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards. This includes the common synonyms: aqua (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and cyan (common sRGB name), magenta (common sRGB name) and fuchsia (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name), gray (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Web-safe colors==
{{Color depth}}
In the mid-90s, many displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50QM5XrxFzQC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=In+the+early+days+of+computing,+many+displays+were+only+capable+of+displaying+256+colors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F3HogVYhVo&amp;sig=8W4JLYE2eJ5VUP8Avn9ApG4yBr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqiLChq__WAhVCiVQKHV_EAM8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20early%20days%20of%20computing,%20many%20displays%20were%20only%20capable%20of%20displaying%20256%20colors&amp;f=false|title=Web Design All-in-One For Dummies|last=Jenkins|first=Sue|date=2012-12-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118404119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be dictated by the hardware or changeable by a "color table". When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.

There were various attempts to make a "standard" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 × 6 × 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).

The list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &amp;quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&amp;quot; - Why? Please clarify}}

"Web-safe" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5×5×5 or 4×4×4) were allocated by browsers—the "web safe" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.

{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have 24-bit ([[True Color|TrueColor]]) and the use of "web-safe" colors has fallen into practical disuse.

The "web-safe" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.

{{Web safe colors}}

===Safest web colors===
Designers were encouraged to stick to these 216 "web-safe" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors the "really safe" palette; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CSS colors==
The [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the "HTML4 color keywords" section, which was renamed as "Basic color keywords".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 –  Proposed Recommendation - 11. Changes |date=28 October 2010 | accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same reference, the "SVG color keywords" section, was renamed "Extended color keywords", after starting out as "X11 color keywords" in an earlier working draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-color-20020418/ |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 –  Working Draft |date=18 April 2002 |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working draft for the CSS4 color module combines the Basic and Extended sections together in a simple "Named Colors" section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors CSS Color Module Level 4{{snd}} Editor’s Draft, 26 June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

|}&lt;/div&gt;

CSS 2, [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] and CSS 2.1 allow web authors to use ''system colors'', which are color names whose values are taken from the [[operating system]], picking the operating system's highlighted text color, or the background color for tooltip controls. This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/ui.html#system-colors |title=User interface – System colors |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CSS3]] color module has [[deprecated]] the use of system colors in favor of CSS3 UI System Appearance property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#css2-system |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.5.1.

==Accessibility==
Some [[Web browser|browsers]] and devices do not support colors. For these displays, or for blind and colorblind users, Web content depending on colors can be unusable or difficult to use.

Either no colors should be specified (to invoke the browser's default colors), or both the background and all foreground colors (such as the colors of plain text, unvisited links, hovered links, active links, and visited links) should be specified to avoid '''black on black''' or '''white on white''' effects.&lt;ref name="w3ctips"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/color |title=If You Pick One Color, Pick Them All |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
