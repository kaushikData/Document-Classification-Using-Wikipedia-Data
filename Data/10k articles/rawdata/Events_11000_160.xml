The '''1914 Jubilee Exhibition''' took place in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], [[Norway]], from May to October 1914. It marked the centennial anniversary of the [[Norway in 1814|1814]] [[Constitution of Norway|constitution]] and focused on industry and agriculture. The main location was the grounds of [[Frogner Manor]] (the site of the current [[Frogner Park]]), in addition to a subsection on shipping at [[Skarpsno]] at [[Frognerkilen]]. The exhibition opened on 15 May, and was closed on 11 October 1914. The total number of visitors was more than 1.5 million. On 11 October, the final day, more than 100,000 visitors visited the exhibition.&lt;ref name=obl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Frognerparken |encyclopedia=[[Oslo byleksikon]] |editor1=Arstal, Aksel |editor1-link=Aksel Arstal|editor2=[[Carl Just|Just, Carl]] |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo|edition=2|year=1966 |origyear=1938 |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khist5-413&gt;{{cite book|title=Kristianias historie |volume=5|first=S.

==Planning==
The idea for the exhibition is credited to architect [[Torolf Prytz]], in a proposal to the board of ''Kristiania haandverks- og industriforening'' in 1907. Prytz became chairman of the planning committee, and later also chairman of the exhibition.&lt;ref name=hio/&gt; Various location alternatives were discussed, including [[Hovedøya]], but it was finally decided on Frogner. In August 1911 the Kristiania [[city council]] granted a funding of {{NOK|300,000}} to the exhibition, in addition to extra funding for street modifications.&lt;ref name=khist5-413/&gt;

==Exhibition pavilions==

The park area was designed by architect [[Josef Nickelsen]], and leading architects were [[Henrik Bull]], [[August Nielsen]], [[Rudolf Emanuel Jacobsen]] and [[Adolf Jensen (architect)|Adolf Jensen]].&lt;ref name=obl/&gt;&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; The exhibition showcased developments in Norway over the last 100 years.&lt;ref name=hio/&gt; Among the pavilions were the Industry Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/industrihallen.1914.html  |title=Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914: Industrihallen |publisher=arc! |first=Geir Tandberg |last=Steigan |language=Norwegian |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Machinery Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/maskinhallen.1914.html|title=Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914: Maskinhallen |language=Norwegian |publisher=arc! |first=Geir Tandberg |last=Steigan |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; restaurants, and more than hundred other buildings.&lt;ref name=obl/&gt;&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; Two locomotives were on display, one constructed at [[Hamar Jernstøperi og Mekaniske Verksted]], the other at [[Thunes Mekaniske Verksted]].&lt;ref name=hio/&gt; [[Kværner|Kværner Bruk]] won a gold medal for their contributions, which included construction elements of the Machinery hall. [[Lilleborg]]'s [[soap bubble]] fountain, which was placed in the Industry Hall, attracted some attention.&lt;ref name=hio/&gt; A department of agriculture included a farm with barn and living house, in addition to separate exhibition buildings for forestry and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/bondegard.1914.html |title=Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914: Bondegården |last=Steigan |first=Geir Tandberg|publisher=Arc!|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the exhibitions was a village with 80 inhabitants brought in from [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]];&lt;ref name=obl/&gt;&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; it was called the Congo Village.&lt;ref name=villageinOslo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/041022/en-afrikansk-landsby-i-oslo|title=En afrikansk landsby i Oslo |work=ABC Nyheter |language=Norwegian |first=Sverre Bjørstad |last=Graff |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other amusements were a 700 meter long [[roller coaster]], the Tanagra theatre, and ''Lilleputbanen''.&lt;ref name=khist5-413/&gt; Another display was [[Hjalmar Welhaven]]'s large collection of skis.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hjalmar Welhaven |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Ole Petter|last=Bjerkek |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Hjalmar_Welhaven/utdypning|language=Norwegian |accessdate=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A maritime department was located in Frognerkilen, at Skarpsno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/sjofart.1914.html |title=Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914: Sjøfarts- og fiskeriutstillingen, Skarpsno |publisher=arc! |language=Norwegian |first=Geir Tandberg |last=Steigan |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisia.no/arc/historisk/oslo/bygninger/sjofart.1914.html |title=Arkitektur og historie i Oslo: Jubileumsutstillingen i Kristiania, 1914  |publisher=arc! |language=Norwegian |first=Geir Tandberg |last=Steigan |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the pavilions were demolished after the exhibition, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

==Events==
The exhibition opened on 5 May 1914, and was met with great interest from the public. Among the performances in "Sangerhallen" was [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''Kongekvadet'', and a new cantata written by [[Nils Collett Vogt]] with music by [[Christian Sinding]]. Actor [[Johan Fahlstrøm]] recited the national hymn "[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]".  The exhibition was declared open by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]]. In the evening a dinner was given for 1,400 invited guests, which included 300 mayors from various municipalities.&lt;ref name=khist5-413/&gt;

Several large gatherings took place during the exhibition period. At one assembly the restaurant served dinner for 4,000 guests. On [[Independence Day (United States)|4 July]] a dinner was served for 2,600 guests.&lt;ref name=khist5-413/&gt; In July the exhibition faced some unexpected problems. A tram strike reduced the accessibility drastically. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] the Tyrolean orchestra and a German brass band had to leave, heading for the front. On 8 August the number of visitors was below 2,000 for the first time, but from then on the daily number of visitors increased again. On 4 October there were 30,000 visitors. On the closing day, Sunday, 11 October, there were more than 100,000 visitors, and a [[fireworks]] ceremony ended the exhibition.&lt;ref name=khist5-413/&gt; During the whole period, the exhibition had total of about 1.5 million visits.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

==The Congo Village-exhibition==
[[File:Jubileumsutstillingen 1914 OB.F08939d.jpg|thumb|left |200 px |From the Kongo village.]]
The Kongo village was regarded as popular and exotic; "the public appeared as they were mesmerized. All day they could stand and stare at the activities of the around 80 aborigins"; spectators "let themselves [[Hypnosis|mesmerize]] by the fantastic African village", according to Sverre Bjørstad Graff. (At the time there probably&lt;ref name="villageinOslo"/&gt; were not any Africans who lived in [[Oslo]], but at traveling fairs (''Tivoli'') Africans were occasionally encountered.)

The exhibition also led to a heated newspaper debate.&lt;ref name="villageinOslo"/&gt; During the planning stage of the exhibition, a ''[[Dagbladet]]'' article said that it would be preferable with a large open-air theatre in the entertainment area rather than a "gang of filthy, begging rascals from the [[fever swamp]]s of [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]]".&lt;ref name="villageinOslo"/&gt;

[[Benno Singer]] was the man behind this exhibition, and he "clearly knew what was required to catch the public's attention", according to Graff.&lt;ref name="villageinOslo"/&gt;

The village's inhibitants were from [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name=Botch&gt;{{cite news|title=Rasisme.

Untalented art and lack of insight gives an odor of deceit to the botch|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2014-05-28|author=Birame Diouf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions to the Congo Village include the 2014 "construction of a copy of the Congo Village that stood in [[Frogner Park]] in 1914", according to ''[[Dagbladet]]''. The constructors of the 2014 "village", will be artists [[Mohammed Ali Fadlabi]] and [[Lars Cuzner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/03/28/kultur/meninger/kronikk/kongolandsbyen/rasisme/32541855/ Eg er rasist, men ...]&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=November 2016}}

{{BC year in topic|559}}

The year '''559 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 195 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=3488&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=1&amp;bibId=8693069 | last=Webster | first= Noah | title= An American dictionary of the English language; exhibiting the origin, orthography, pronunciation, and definitions of words | editor= N.

In [[Intelligence agency|intelligence organizations]], '''agent handling''' is the management of so-called [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agents]] (called secret agents or spies in common parlance), principal agents, and agent networks (called "[[Asset (intelligence)|assets]]")  by [[intelligence officer]]s  typically known as '''case officers'''.

==Human intelligence==
A primary purpose of intelligence organizations is to penetrate a target with a human agent, or a network of human agents. Such agents can either infiltrate the target, or be recruited "in place". Case officers are professionally trained employees of intelligence organizations that manage human agents and human agent networks. Intelligence that derives from such human sources is known by the abbreviation [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]]. 

Sometimes, agent handling is done indirectly, through "principal agents" that serve as proxies for case officers. It is not uncommon, for example, for a case officer to manage a number of principal agents, who in turn handle agent networks, which are preferably organized in a [[Clandestine cell system|cellular fashion]]. In such a case, the principal agent can serve as a [[Cut-out (espionage)|"cut-out"]] for the case officer, buffering him or her from direct contact with the agent network. 

Utilizing a principal agent as a cut-out, and ensuring that the human agent network is organized in a cellular fashion, can provide some protection for other agents in the network, as well as for the principal agent, and for the case officer in the event that an agent in the network is compromised. Assuming that standard principles of intelligence [[tradecraft]] have been strictly observed by the principal agent and the agents in the network, compromised agents will not be able to identify the case officer, nor the other members of the network. Ideally, agents may work side by side in the same office, and conduct their [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] collection activities with such discipline, that they will not realize that they are both engaged in espionage, much less members of the same network. 

Since an agent can sometimes identify his or her principal agent, however, or reveal information under [[interrogation]] that can lead to the identification of a principal agent, the protection provided by cellular network organization can be time-sensitive. 

If principles of intelligence tradecraft have not been strictly observed, it is also possible that compromised agents can reveal information that exposes other members of the network. In the real world of espionage, human lapses are very much the norm, and violations of the principles of tradecraft are common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is for this reason that agents are ideally trained to resist interrogation for a defined period of time. 

If an agent is able to resist interrogation for a defined period of time, the odds improve that other members of the network can be alerted to the compromise.

==Case officer==
A case officer is an intelligence officer who is a trained specialist in the management of agents and agent networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/case+officer case officer], thefreedictionary.com, retrieved 4 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Case officers manage human agents and human intelligence networks. Case officers spot potential agents, recruit prospective agents and train agents in [[tradecraft]]. Case officers emphasize the elements of tradecraft that enable the agent to acquire needed information, and enable the case officer to communicate with and supervise the agent. Most importantly, case officers train agents in methods of avoiding detection by host nation counter-intelligence organizations.

==Agents, spotting, and recruitment==
By definition, an "agent" acts on behalf of another, whether another individual, an organization, or a foreign government. Agents can be considered either witting or unwitting, and in some cases, willing or unwilling. Agents typically work under the direction of a principal agent or a case officer. When agents work alone, and are not members of an agent network, they are termed "singletons".

The identification of potential agents is termed "agent spotting" (also termed "talent spotting"). Identifying potential agents, and investigating the details of their personal and professional lives, involves the granular verification of their [[Credential|bona fides]]. Such activities can include uncovering personal details that leave potential agents vulnerable to [[coercion]], [[blackmail]], or other inducements, such as sexual approaches. 

Approaches to potential agents can be multitudinous and considerable time can pass before the potential agent is maneuvered into a position where a recruitment "pitch" can be hazarded.

==Training==
Agent training often includes techniques of tradecraft such as clandestine [[communication]], including [[cryptography]], the use of [[one-time pad]]s, the construction of [[concealment device]]s, and the employment of [[dead drop]]s. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, [[surveillance]] and [[countersurveillance]], photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop ''cover for status'', and ''cover for action'', meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. More advanced agent training can include resistance to [[interrogation]].

The '''Android Developer Challenge''' (ADC) was launched by [[Google]] in 2008, with the aim of providing awards for high-quality mobile applications built on the Android platform. In November 2009, the winners of Android Developers Challenge II were selected after two rounds of scoring by thousands of Android users as well as an official panel of judges. The overall winners of ADC II were [https://web.archive.org/web/20111020023820/https://market.android.com/details?id=com.inizz SweetDreams], What the Doodle!? and WaveSecure.

== History ==
Android is a software stack for mobile devices that includes an [[operating system]], [[middleware]] and key applications. The Android [[Software development kit|SDK]] provides the tools and [[API]]s necessary to begin developing applications that run on Android-powered devices. Android Developer Challenge was a competition for the most innovative applications for Android. Google offered US$10 million in prizes, distributed between ADC I and ADC II.

All entries were judged by a panel of experts in the fields of mobile devices, cellular telecommunications, software development or technology innovation. Google selected the judges from the member organizations of the [[Open Handset Alliance]], Google and mobile experts.

== Android Developer Challenge I ==
The Android Developer Challenge was first announced in January, with submissions being accepted from 2 January to 14 April 2008. With participants from over 70 countries and a total of 1,788 entries, the ADC was an immediate success, and the Android Developers' blog reported a submission rate of 170+ submissions per hour on 14 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/ |title=Android Developers Blog |publisher=Android-developers.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers from the United States accounted for one-third of the total applications while the rest came from countries such as Germany, Japan, China, India, Canada, France, UK, and many others. The entries represented a diverse range of application areas, including games, social-networking applications, utilities and productivity and developer tools.

A panel of over 100 judges received judging packets and laptops that were preloaded with all the submissions, for a consistent, fair environment to judge the submissions. After three weeks of rigorous analysis, the judges released a list of 50 first round winners, who were then eligible to participate in the final round. These 50 most promising entries, announced on 5 May 2008, each received a $25,000 award to fund further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/05/top-50-applications.html | work = Android Developers Blog | title = The Top 50 Applications | first = Jason | last = Chen | date = 12 May 2008 | accessdate = 2009-09-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090925051155/http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2008/05/top-50-applications.html| archivedate= 25 September 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3168326017.html | title = Android Developer Challenge announces first-round winners | work = Linux for Devices | first = Eric | last = Brown | date = 13 May 2008 | access-date = 2010-04-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514204010/http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3168326017.html | archive-date = 2008-05-14 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The finalists were then given a deadline of 30 June 2008 to submit their applications for the final round.

== Android Developers Challenge II ==
ADC II was announced on 27 May 2009.,&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/android/adc/ |title=Android Developer Challenge |accessdate=2008-01-11 |work=Google Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling developers to submit their apps to one of ten specially-designated ADC II categories in August. The categories were: 
*Education/Reference
*Games: Casual/Puzzle
*Games: Arcade/Action
*Social Networking
*Lifestyle
*Productivity/Tools
*Media
*Entertainment
*Travel
*Misc

Applicants were allowed to submit their applications to a single category only. The winners were selected after two rounds of scoring by thousands of Android users as well as an official panel of judges.

=== Eligibility ===
The ADC II contest was open only to applications that had not been made publicly available through the Android Market prior to August 1, 2009. Additionally, applications that were entered in the ADC I contest were ineligible for the ADC II contest, regardless whether they were winning apps. Similarly, updated versions of applications entered in the ADC 1 contest were ineligible for ADC II.

=== First Round, ADC II ===
In September 2009, users of Android-powered handsets that could access the Android Market were able to obtain a special ADC II judging application from the Android Market. With this app, they could download, test, and rank applications submitted to the challenge. Users choosing to participate in the review process downloaded submitted apps randomly and rated them along a number of criteria, resulting in a final score for each app. The results from this first round generated the top 20 applications in each of the 10 categories (200 apps total), which went into the second round. The first round of the ADC II closed on 6 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/10/adc-2-round-1-scoring-complete.html | title = ADC 2 Round 1 Scoring Complete | work = Android Developers Blog | first = Eric | last = Chu | date = 6 October 2009 | accessdate = 3 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091101174228/http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/10/adc-2-round-1-scoring-complete.html| archivedate= 1 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first-round winners were announced on 5 November 2009.

=== Second Round, ADC II ===
Voting for the second round opened on the same day and ended on November 25. Android users were able to download the final top 20 applications in each category and evaluate them in the same manner as during the First Round using the ADC 2 judging app. At the end of the voting period, applications in each category were ranked, with the community vote constituting 40% of the final judging score. Along with the public ranking, a team of Google-selected judges evaluated the applications. Their scores constituted 60% of the final score.

Google announced the top winners of ADC II on November 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://code.google.com/android/adc/gallery_winners.html | title = ADC 2 Overall Winners | work = Android Developer Challenge | publisher = Google | accessdate = 5 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110104052927/http://code.google.com/android/adc/gallery_winners.html| archivedate= 4 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/11/android_develop_2.html | title = Android Developer Challenge 2 Winners Announced | work = BusinessWeek | first = Olga | last = Kharif | date = 30 November 2009 | accessdate = 5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with SweetDreams, What the Doodle!? and [[WaveSecure]] being nominated the overall winners of the challenge.

{{Unreferenced|date=January 2008}}

{{IndicText}}
{{Sikh practices}}
'''Antam Sanskar''' refers to the [[funeral rite]]s in originally Hinduism and then later in Sikhism also. ''Antam'' (or ''Antim'') means "final", while ''[[sanskar]]'' means "rite".

In [[Sikhism]], [[death]] is considered a natural process and God's will or [[Hukam]]. To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part of the cycle of human life of "coming and going" ( ਆਵਣੁ ਜਾਣਾ, Aaavan Jaanaa)  which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ਮੋਖੁ ਦੁਆਰੁ, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God. Sikhs thus believe in [[reincarnation]]. The [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] itself is not subject to death. Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life, a Sikh tries always to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.

== Sikh practices around death ==

[[Cremation]] is the preferred method of disposal, although if it is not possible any other methods such as burial or submergence at sea are acceptable. As there is no grave a memorial to the dead or [[gravestone]], etc. is discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell, the person's soul was their real essence. 

=== Before death ===
At a Sikh's death-bed, relatives and friends should read [[Sukhmani Sahib]], the Psalm of Peace, composed by the fifth [[Guru Arjan]] Dev, or simply recite "[[Waheguru]]" to console themselves and the dying person. When a death occurs, they should exclaim "Waheguru, Waheguru, Waheguru" (the Wonderful Lord). 

If the death occurs in a hospital, the body is taken to the funeral parlor or home before the funeral. In preparation for cremation (usually the day before or day of the cremation), the body is first washed while those present recite the Gurmantar Waheguru or [[Mool Mantar]]. Then the body is lovingly dressed with clean clothes complete with the [[Five Ks]] (in case of baptized Sikhs). 

=== The day of the cremation ===

On the day of the cremation, the body is taken to the [[Gurdwara]] or home where [[Shabda|Shabad]]s (hymns) from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the Sikh Scriptures, are recited by the congregation, which induce feeling of consolation and courage. [[Kirtan]] may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite "Waheguru". This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an [[Ardas]] is said before the body is taken to the cremation site.

At the point of cremation, a few Shabads are sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. Then the [[Kirtan Sohila]] (night time prayer) is recited and finally [[Ardas]] called the "Antim Ardas" ("Final Prayer") is offered. The eldest son or a close relative generally starts the cremation process – light the fire or press the button for the burning to begin. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.

The ashes are later collected and disposed by immersing them in the nearest river. Sikhs do not erect monuments over the remains of the dead.

After the cremation ceremony, there may be another service at the [[Gurdwara]], the Sikh place of worship, call the [[Sahaj Paath]] [[Bhog]] Ceremony.

== Sahaj Paath Bhog Ceremony ==

After the death of a Sikh, the family of the deceased may undertake a non-continuous reading of the entire [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] (Sahaj Paath). This reading ([[Paath]]) is timed to conclude within ten days of the death of the person. The reading may be undertaken at home or in the Gurdwara and usually takes place on the day of the cremation. The conclusion of this ceremony called the [[Bhog]] Ceremony marks the end of the mourning period. 

Generally, all the relatives and friends of the family gather together for the Bhog ceremony on the completion of the reading of [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. Musicians sing appropriate Shabad hymns, [[Salok]]s of the ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur are read, and Ramkali Saad, the Call of God, is recited. After the final prayer, a selected reading or Hukam is taken, and [[Karah Parshad]] is distributed to the congregation. Normally food from the Guru's kitchen, [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]], is also served.

The '''''Bayreuth Festspielhaus''''' or '''Bayreuth Festival Theatre'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayreuther-festspiele.de/documents/_the_bayreuth_festival_theatre_341.html|title=The Bayreuth Festival Theatre|work=The history of the Bayreuth Festival|publisher=Bayreuther Festspiele GmbH|accessdate=25 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021011654/http://bayreuther-festspiele.de/documents/_the_bayreuth_festival_theatre_341.html|archive-date=21 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|link=no|'''Bayreuther Festspielhaus'''}}, {{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ʁɔʏ̯tɐ ˈfɛstʃpiːlˌhaʊ̯s|pron}}) is an [[opera house]] north of [[Bayreuth]], Germany, built by the 19th-century German composer [[Richard Wagner]] and dedicated solely to the performance of his stage works. It is the venue for the annual [[Bayreuth Festival]], for which it was specifically conceived and built. Its official name is '''{{lang|de|Richard-Wagner-Festspielhaus}}'''.

==Design==
Wagner adapted the design of the ''Festspielhaus'' from an unrealised project by [[Gottfried Semper]] for an opera house in [[Munich]], without the architect's permission, and supervised its construction.  [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] provided the primary funding for the construction. The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 22 May 1872, Wagner's 59th birthday. The building was first opened for the premiere of the complete four-opera cycle of {{lang|de|[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]}} (''The Ring of the Nibelung''), from 13 to 17 August 1876.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Rheingold'' and ''Die Walküre'', the first two operas of the cycle, had premiered individually at the National Theatre in Munich in 1869 and 1870 respectively; the 1876 opening of the Festspielhaus was both the premiere of the latter two operas, ''Siegfried'' and ''Götterdämmerung'', and the first time all four were performed together as a cycle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the entry façade exhibits the typical late-19th-century ornamentation, while the remainder of the exterior is modest and shows mostly undecorated bricks. The interior is mainly wood and has a [[reverberation time]] of 1.55 seconds.&lt;ref name="Barron"&gt;Barron, Michael, ''Auditorium Acoustics and Architectural Design'' (2nd edition).  Spon Press (Abingdon, UK), {{ISBN|0-203-87422-6}}, p. 352 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The Festspielhaus is a carpenter's building; in fact, it is the largest free-standing timber structure ever erected. Unlike the traditional opera house design with several tiers of seating in a horseshoe shaped auditorium, the Festspielhaus's seats are arranged in a single steeply-shaped wedge, with galleries or boxes along the back wall only. This is also known as [[continental seating]]. Many contemporary movie theaters have adopted this style of seating, which gives every seat an equal and uninterrupted view of the stage. The capacity of the Festspielhaus is 1,925 and has a volume of 10,000 cubic metres.&lt;ref name="Barron"/&gt;

The Festspielhaus features a double [[proscenium]], which gives the audience the illusion that the stage is further away than it actually is.  The double proscenium and the recessed orchestra pit create – in Wagner's term – a "mystic gulf" between the audience and the stage.  This gives a dreamlike character to performances, and provides a physical reinforcement of the mythic content of most of Wagner's operas. The architecture of Festpielhaus accomplished many of Wagner's goals and ideals for the performances of his operas including an improvement on the sound, feel, and overall look of the production.

The Festpielhaus was originally planned to open in 1873, but by that time Wagner had barely raised enough money to put up the walls of his theatre. He began to raise money by traveling and putting on concerts in various cities and countries throughout Europe. There are, however, some documents concerning the donation and aid (900 [[thaler]]) to Wagner for that matter by the [[Sultan]] Abdülaziz of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/abdulaziz-wagnere-para-yardimi-yapti-38522031&lt;/ref&gt; Even after Ludwig began funding the project, Wagner had to continue putting on concerts to keep the building project financially afloat. The tours were very taxing on Wagner's health and would eventually be a key element to his death later on in 1883.

==Orchestra pit==

A significant feature of the Festspielhaus is its unusual [[orchestra pit]]. It is recessed under the stage and covered by a hood, so that the orchestra is completely invisible to the audience. This feature was a central preoccupation for Wagner, since it made the audience concentrate on the drama onstage, rather than the distracting motion of the conductor and musicians. The design also corrected the balance of volume between singers and orchestra, creating ideal acoustics for Wagner's operas, which are the only operas performed at the Festspielhaus. However, this arrangement has also made it the most challenging to conduct in, even for the world's best conductors. Not only is the crowded pit enveloped in darkness, but the acoustic reverberation makes it difficult to synchronise the orchestra with the singers. Conductors must therefore retrain themselves to ignore cues from singers.

The orchestra layout deployed at Bayreuth is unusual in three ways:

# The first violins are positioned on the right-hand side of the conductor instead of their usual place on the left side. This is in all likelihood because of the way the sound is intended to be directed towards the stage rather than directly on the audience. This way the sound has a more direct line from the first violins to the back of the stage where it can be then reflected to the audience.
# Double basses, cellos and harps (when more than one used, e.g. ''Ring'') are split into groups and placed on either side of the pit
# The rest of the orchestra is located directly under the stage. This makes communication with the conductor vital as most of the players are unable to see or hear the singers, but creates the huge, rich sounds Wagner sought to compose.

==Bayreuth Festival==
The Festspielhaus remains the venue of the annual Bayreuth Festival, during which Wagner's later operas, such as the ''Ring'' cycle and ''[[Parsifal]]'', are given on a repertory basis.

==Recent history==
[[File:Bayreuth Festspielhaus 2014-05-25.jpg|thumb|In 2014, photos printed on canvas hide the scaffolding around the Festspielhaus.]]
In early 2012, Katharina Wagner mentioned the need for repairs to the building, with mention specifically of roof leaks and crumbling of the red brick facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.operatoday.com/content/2012/02/bayreuth_festsp.php |first=Frank|last= Cadenhead |title=Bayreuth's Festspielhaus Needs Repairs |publisher=Opera Today |date=2 February 2012|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, funding for restoration was announced at a level of approximately 30M €, primarily from public funding shared between [[Germany]] and the state of [[Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infranken.de/regional/bayreuth/Geld-fuer-Sanierung-des-Bayreuther-Festspielhauses-kann-fliessen;art213,662136 |title=Geld für Sanierung des Bayreuther Festspielhauses kann fließen |author= |date=2014-03-20 |work=Fränkischen Tag |accessdate=26 July 2014|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the German national government and the Bavarian state government holding majority shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dw.de/calm-after-the-storm-as-bayreuth-festival-opens/a-17804285 | title=Calm after the storm as Bayreuth Festival opens | work=Deutsche Welle | author=Rick Fulker | date=2014-07-23 | accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brigade 93''' is one of many [[militias]] that formed in the wake of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. It is based in Bani Walid, a former stronghold of the [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/libya-gaddafi-bani-walid_n_1226960.html |title=Libya: Gaddafi Loyalists Seize Bani Walid |work=Huffington Post |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2012|location=Benghazi|first1=Rami|last1=Al-Shaheibi|first2=Maggie|last2=Michael|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militia is mainly composed of those still loyal to Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57364781/qaddafi-loyalists-take-over-bani-walid/ |title=Qaddafi loyalists take over Bani Walid|work=CBS News |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2012|agency=Associated Press|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brigade is named after the [[1993_Libyan_coup_attempt#Political_unrest_during_the_1990s|1993 attempted coup]] against Gaddafi by members of the [[Warfalla]] tribe. Salem al-Ouaer, a member of the Warfalla tribe who sided with Gaddafi during the coup, is believed to head the militia.

In January 2012, the brigade was involved in the [[2012 Bani Walid insurgency|green-revolution in Bani Walid]]. On 25 of January, their unexpected uprising led to the retreat of the NTC forces from Bani Walid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orLoycZw9AM|title=Gaddafi Loyalists kick the NTC out of Bani Walid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weapons  and equipment==
The brigade was said to possess heavy weapons, including 106 mm anti-tank guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting erupts in Libya's Bani Walid|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/01/2012123182559826642.html|accessdate=28 January 2012|date=24 January 2012|work=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Club100''' is a UK-based "hire kart" karting championship. All karts use identical [[Birel]] chassis and TKM 2 stroke engines and are provided by the club to an equal standard, putting all competitors on a level playing field.

== History ==

The first Club100 championship was held in 1993. Initially it was a 6 round sprint championship held at [[Buckmore Park]] and has since grown into a multi-event series held all over the country at some of the UK's top karting circuits.

In 1995, the sprint championship was split up into two weight categories. 1997 saw the creation of the first endurance championship and this has grown into 4 separate championships for rookies, intermediates, clubman and premier level teams. 2004 saw the creation of the Clubman endurance championship that was a level between intermediate and premier level. In 2007, the sprints were split up again and a separate premier championship was created to accommodate the monopoly the top drivers held. The first winter championship was also held that year with all rounds being held at Rye House. In 2011, the sprint championship was split up further and 2 clubman championships were created (heavyweight and lightweight classes) as a stepping stone to the premier series. The format of the Open championship was changed from 3 hour endurance races for teams to a 60-minute format for individuals or teams of 2. The Advance Leisure series moved to a similar format with two 30 minute races.

Since 1999 the club has been managed by John Vigor. In 2006, he bought all the rights to Club100 from Playscape and moved the base of operations from Streatham in London to [[Rye House Kart Circuit|Rye House]] in Hoddesdon. In 2011 the base was moved to Sittingbourne, just next to the Bayford Meadows kart circuit.

The '''Curse of Billy Penn''' was a [[Sports-related curses|curse]] used to explain the failure of major [[Sports in Philadelphia|professional sports teams based in Philadelphia]] to win championships since the March&amp;nbsp;1987 construction of the [[One Liberty Place]] skyscraper, which exceeded the height of [[William Penn (Calder)|William Penn's statue]] atop [[Philadelphia City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Does the Curse of Billy Penn Continue to Haunt Philadelphia?|date=June 12, 2007|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118165107120832442|first=Jim|last=Chairusmi|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curse ended on October&amp;nbsp;29, 2008, when the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] won the [[2008 World Series]], a year and four months after a statuette of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam during the June 2007 topping-off of the [[Comcast Center (office building)|Comcast Center]].&lt;ref name="TallestBuilding"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matza|first=Michael|title=Lifting the curse of William Penn|date=October 22, 2008 |work=philly.com|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20081022_Lifting_the_curse_of_William_Penn.html|accessdate=2009-01-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203105408/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20081022_Lifting_the_curse_of_William_Penn.html|archivedate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atop [[Philadelphia City Hall]] stands a statue of [[William Penn]], the city founder and original proprietor of the then-British [[colony]] of [[Pennsylvania]] (meaning "Penn's Woods").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appleby|first=J Ph.D.|year=2005|title=The American Vision|publisher=Glencoe|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, a "gentlemen's agreement" stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no building in the city which would rise above this statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|publisher=Fox Sports|title=Major League Baseball on Fox: Game 5 of 2008 World Series|date=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended in March&amp;nbsp;1987, when a modern steel-and-glass [[skyscraper]], [[One Liberty Place]], opened three blocks away.  One Liberty Place is taller than City Hall by 397&amp;nbsp;feet (121&amp;nbsp;m), rising 945&amp;nbsp;feet (288&amp;nbsp;m) in height compared to the height of Penn's hat on City Hall, 547&amp;nbsp;feet (167&amp;nbsp;m). Its sister skyscraper, [[Two Liberty Place]], at 848&amp;nbsp;ft (258&amp;nbsp;m), followed in 1990.

Philadelphia sports teams had enjoyed a run of success. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] won the [[1980 World Series]] and the [[1983 National League Championship Series|1983 National League pennant]]; the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] won back-to-back [[Stanley Cup]]s in {{scfy|1974}} and {{scfy|1975}}, and appeared in the finals in {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1980}}, {{scfy|1985}}, and {{scfy|1987}}; the [[National Football League]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] appeared in [[Super Bowl XV]] following the 1980 season, losing to the [[Oakland Raiders]]; and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] swept the [[1983 NBA Finals]], as well as making the finals in {{nbafy|1977}}, {{nbafy|1980}}, and {{nbafy|1982}}. Before 1980, the Phillies had appeared in only two other World Series, in {{wsy|1915}} and {{wsy|1950}}, and the Eagles had won no [[National Football Conference|NFC]] conference championships since the 1966 agreement that had created the Super Bowl, while the 76ers won NBA titles in both Philadelphia and in their previous incarnation, the [[Syracuse Nationals]].  The Villanova Wildcats won the 1985 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball tournament, in one of the most famous upsets in sports history. Construction on One Liberty Place began in 1985, two years after the last championship season in Philadelphia.

In the 1980&amp;nbsp;season, all four teams reached the championship round of their respective leagues. Ultimately, only the Phillies would win a championship that year.

{{nowrap|After One Liberty Place}} opened, Philadelphia's franchises began a pattern of failures to win a world championship. The [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] lost the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] twice, in {{scfy|1987}} to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in seven games (although the Oilers were heavily favored), two months after One Liberty Place opened, and in {{scfy|1997}}, in a four-game sweep by the [[Detroit Red Wings]] which was considered a collapse as the Flyers had home-ice advantage and had dominated the previous three playoff series en route to meeting the Red Wings. The [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] upset the [[Atlanta Braves]] to win the NLCS, but then lost the [[1993 World Series]] in six games to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], with the Series ending on [[Joe Carter]]'s [[walkoff]] 3-run home run. The [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] lost the [[2001 NBA Finals]] to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in five games, although the defending champion Lakers were favored despite the Sixers having league MVP [[Allen Iverson]]. The [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] lost three straight NFC Championship games from the 2001 through 2003 seasons, before reaching [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] after the 2004 season, only to lose to the [[New England Patriots]] by three points.

In fact, the only years that Philadelphia's franchises reached their league's championship round after One Liberty Place opened were years that [[United States presidential inauguration|U.S. presidents were inaugurated]], except for the Flyers in 1987,&lt;ref name="Philadelphia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two cities that could use a CUP|date=June 2, 2010|first=Ken|last=Warren|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and losses during such years date back to the 76ers loss in {{nbafy|1977}}.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia"/&gt; When the [[Philadelphia Flyers|Flyers]] played for the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|2010 Stanley Cup]], ''[[Ottawa Citizen|The Ottawa Citizen]]'' reported that the main reason for that lengthy championship drought was because the only years the city's teams played for championships during that time were years [[United States presidential inauguration|presidents were inaugurated]].&lt;ref name="Philadelphia"/&gt; The city's teams had lost championships during such years, beginning with the 76ers themselves in {{nbafy|1977}}.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt; The exceptions were the Phillies in {{wsy|1983}} and the Flyers in {{scfy|1987}}.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia/&gt;

In addition, losses in semifinal rounds had occurred eight times since the opening of One Liberty Place. Five of these semi-final eliminations were by the Flyers, in [[1989 Stanley Cup playoffs|1989]], [[1995 Stanley Cup playoffs|1995]], [[2000 Stanley Cup playoffs|2000]], [[2004 Stanley Cup playoffs|2004]] and [[2008 Stanley Cup playoffs|2008]]. The 2000 team was one win away from a [[2000 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance, after leading the eventual champion [[New Jersey Devils]] 3-1 before losing three straight (including Games 5 and 7 at home), the 2004 team lost Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual champion [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], and the 2008 team lost to their cross-state rival [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in five games. The Eagles accounted for the other three conference-final losses; they lost the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship Game (the winner of which meets the winner of the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]'s corresponding game in the [[Super Bowl]]) three years in a row from {{nfly|2001}} to {{nfly|2003}}, thus becoming the first NFL team to do this in either conference since the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of {{nfly|1980}}–{{nfly|1982}}, losing the last two at home after posting the best record in the NFC. No other team in NFL history had lost back-to-back conference title games at home since the NFL began its practice in 1975 of awarding home-field advantage in postseason play based on regular-season record. The Eagles lost the 2001 NFC Championship game on the road to the St. Louis Rams 29-24, the 2002 NFC Championship game at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27-10, and the 2003 NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14-3. The Rams and Panthers would both lose to the New England Patriots in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]I, while the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII over the Oakland Raiders.

During the period of the alleged Curse of Billy Penn, Philadelphia sports fans were infamous for rude and unsportsmanlike behavior. Fans pelted national TV broadcasters with snowballs, ice, and beer during a Cowboys-Eagles game in 1989 known as "[[Bounty Bowl#Bounty Bowl II|Bounty Bowl II]]". On Nov. 10, 1997, an Eagles fan shot a flare gun across the field into the stands during a nationally televised Monday night game against the San Francisco 49ers. In 1999, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' blamed the fans' behavior on their teams' longtime poor quality of play, as seen in the 40-year championship drought for the Eagles and the 76ers' 1972-1973 season, which was the worst in NBA history at 9-73.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626235947/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/1999/10/11/philly_fans_ap 'There's no excuse for what we did': Philadelphia fans criticized for reaction to Irvin injury], ''Sports Illustrated'', 1999-10-14.

The curse was also said to include [[Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania|Bensalem-Township]]-based [[thoroughbred]] racehorse [[Smarty Jones]], who saw his bid for [[horse racing]]'s [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] disappear when he finished second in the 2004 [[Belmont Stakes]] behind 36-1 longshot [[Birdstone]] after victories in the [[Kentucky Derby]] and [[Preakness Stakes]]. The curse has also been blamed for the death of the thoroughbred horse [[Barbaro (horse)|Barbaro]], who was owned and bred by a couple from [[West Grove, Pennsylvania]], a borough right outside Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buschel|first1=Bruce|title=Walking Broad: Looking for the Heart of Brotherly Love|date=August 1, 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlV6d6iI7hUC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=barbaro+curse+of+billy+penn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uuFhtZX9xv&amp;sig=cJNVNGdt5zAwnRrdwa0i60H79tQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwB2oVChMIjeH5qqHDyAIVwzs-Ch2hFA3G#v=onepage&amp;q=barbaro%20curse%20of%20billy%20penn&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stamm|first1=Dan|title=The Day That Smarty Jones Failed Us|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/Smarty-Jones-Anniversary.html|accessdate=15 October 2015|agency=NBC Philadelphia|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Barbaro won the 2006 Kentucky Derby, his leg was dramatically shattered two weeks later during the 2006 Preakness Stake, leading to the horse's death.

Although the curse was not generally considered as extending to college sports, two Philadelphia-area college basketball teams, the [[St. Joseph's Hawks]] (in Philadelphia) and the [[Villanova Wildcats]] (in [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]]), which had successful seasons in 2004 and 2006, respectively, failed to reach the [[Final Four]] of the NCAA Basketball Tournament.  Both were eliminated in the fourth-round [[Elite Eight]] matches, with St. Joe's, first seed in the East Regional, losing in a close match to [[Oklahoma State]], and Villanova, first seed in the Minneapolis Regional, falling to eventual NCAA-champion [[University of Florida|Florida]]. Villanova won the national championship in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]], two years before the Liberty Place opening. A third Philadelphia-area team, the [[Temple Owls]] (in Philadelphia) has also lost five times in the Elite Eight (1988, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2001).

Villanova ended the college basketball drought for the Philadelphia teams with a national championship in [[2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|2016]] and 2018.

The curse, however, was apparently not extended to professional teams outside the four major sports. The then–[[Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)|Philadelphia Wings]] of the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] ([[Box lacrosse|indoor]] lacrosse winter league) won six titles between 1989 and 2001, before moving in 2014, and the now-defunct [[Philadelphia Barrage]] of the [[Major League Lacrosse|MLL]] (outdoor summer lacrosse league) won three championships (2004, 2006, and 2007). The [[American Hockey League|AHL]]'s [[Philadelphia Phantoms]], the Flyers' top minor-league affiliate from 1996 to 2009, won the [[Calder Cup]] championship in 1998 and 2005. Additionally, the [[Philadelphia KiXX]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2001–2008)|MISL]] won their league's championship in 2002 and 2007.  The [[Arena Football League (1987–2008)|AFL]]'s [[Philadelphia Soul]] won [[ArenaBowl XXII]] in 2008 and [[ArenaBowl XXIX]] in 2016. The [[Philadelphia Freedoms]], a tennis team in the [[World Team Tennis]] league, also won titles in 2001 and 2006. One exception was the [[Philadelphia Charge]], a women's soccer team in the now-defunct [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]], which did not win a championship during the three years the WUSA existed, from 2001 to 2003.

==Decoration of Penn's statue==
In spite of the Curse, when Philadelphia sports teams have reached their league's championship round, Penn's statue has sometimes been decorated to support that team's success. For example, after the Phillies won the [[1993 National League Championship Series|1993&amp;nbsp;National League pennant]], Penn was fitted with an oversized red Phillies baseball cap; when the Flyers went to the [[1997&amp;nbsp;Stanley Cup Finals]], the city adorned Penn with an orange-torso-with-white-shoulders Flyers jersey (at the time, the combination was the Flyers' road jersey).

When the Sixers faced the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] in the [[2001&amp;nbsp;NBA Finals]], Penn's statue was not decorated.  [[Pat Croce]], president and part-owner of the Sixers, said he would have "decked out" the statue had the Sixers won but not before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Bernard J. | last=Scally | date=November 11, 2006 | title=Are Philadelphia sports teams cursed by the city founder? | journal=RoxReview.com | url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17470917&amp;BRD=1680&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=40301&amp;rfi=6 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031537/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17470917&amp;BRD=1680&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=40301&amp;rfi=6 | archivedate=September 30, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn's statue was also left untouched when the Eagles went to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in [[2004 NFL season|2005]].

==The Curse lifted==
On June 18, 2007, ironworkers helped raise the final beam in the construction of the [[Comcast Center]] at 17th Street  and [[Pennsylvania Route 3#Philadelphia|John F. Kennedy Boulevard]] in [[Center City Philadelphia|downtown Philadelphia]]. In an attempt to end the curse, workers John Joyce and Dan Ginion attached a small figurine of William Penn to the beam, along with the traditional American flag and small evergreen tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holcomb|first=Henry J.|title=Comcast Center topped off|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/multimedia/8055132.html|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first William Penn figurine was stolen, it was replaced with a smaller 4-inch figure.&lt;ref name="TallestBuilding"/&gt;

On October&amp;nbsp;29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies won the [[2008 World Series]] in five games against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], ending the alleged Curse. It was the first major league professional sports title for the city of Philadelphia since the [[1983 NBA Finals|1983 NBA Championship]]. During the TV coverage of parade which occurred two days later, Comcast aired an ad congratulating the Phillies which featured the small figurine of William Penn standing at the top of the Comcast Center.

On Monday, November 27, 2017, the day of the "topping out" of the new [[tallest building in Philadelphia]] the [[Comcast Technology Center]], ironworkers once again placed a new William Penn figurine atop the building's highest beam in hopes to ward off the curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/business/comcast/comcast-ironworkers-billy-penn-eagles-nfl-new-tower-20171130.html|title=Ironworkers plant Billy Penn atop new Comcast tower to help Eagles avoid curse - Philly|work=Philly.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/The-Comcast-Technology-Center-Is-Phillys-Tallest-Building-and-Yes-Theres-a-Mini-Billy-Penn-Up-There-461105383.html|title=Yes, There's a Billy Penn Statue on Philly's New Skyscraper|work=NBC 10 Philadelphia|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2018, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl LII]] 41-33 to win their first Super Bowl in team history, and first championship since the [[1960 NFL Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wesseling|first=Chris|title=Philadelphia Eagles knock off Patriots, win Super Bowl|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000914459/article/philadelphia-eagles-knock-off-patriots-win-super-bowl|publisher=National Football League|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death from laughter''' is a rare form of [[death]], usually resulting from [[cardiac arrest]] or [[asphyxiation]], caused by a fit of [[laughter]]. Instances of death by laughter have been recorded from the times of [[ancient Greece]] to the modern day.

== Pathophysiology ==
Death may result from several pathologies that deviate from [[benignity|benign]] [[laughter]]. [[Infarction]] of the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]] in the brain may cause pathological laughter.&lt;ref name="Gondim"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gondim FA, Parks BJ, Cruz-Flores S |title='Fou rire prodromique' as the presentation of pontine ischaemia secondary to vertebrobasilar stenosis |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=802–804 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11723208 |pmc=1737630 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.71.6.802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laughter can cause [[atonia]] and [[collapse (medical)|collapse]] ("gelastic [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]"),&lt;ref name="pmid18493621"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiss AL, Hoeft F, Tenforde AS, Chen W, Mobbs D, Mignot EJ |title=Anomalous hypothalamic responses to humor in cataplexy |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e2225 |year=2008 |pmid=18493621 |pmc=2377337 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002225 |editor1-last=Greene |editor1-first=Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18538031"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishida K, Hirota SK, Tokeshi J |title=Laugh syncope as a rare sub-type of the situational syncopes: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=197 |year=2008 |pmid=18538031 |pmc=2440757 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-197 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2/1/197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14592259"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Totah AR, Benbadis SR |title=Gelastic syncope mistaken for cataplexy |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=77–8 |date=January 2002 |pmid=14592259 |doi=10.1016/S1389-9457(01)00113-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389945701001137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17976409"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lo R, Cohen TJ |title=Laughter-induced syncope: no laughing matter |journal=Am.

'''Maëlys de Araujo''' (5 November 2008 – 27 August 2017) was a French child who was last seen alive in the early morning of 27 August 2017 at a wedding in the [[Chambéry]] region of South-Eastern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41441850|title=Mothers in plea to French kidnap suspect|date=29 September 2017|publisher=|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remains were found on 14 February 2018 when Nordahl Lelandais, who admitted to killing her, led investigators to the area where he had disposed of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43065000|title=Remains of missing French girl found|date=14 February 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=14 February 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E_Emeri&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emeri|first1=Évelyne|title=France - Affaire Maëlys: dans les pas du monstre|url=https://www.lematin.ch/monde/affaire-maelys-monstre/story/12896034|accessdate=16 March 2018|work=lematin.ch|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/affaire-maelys-six-mois-d-enquete-sur-les-traces-de-la-fillette-disparue-14-02-2018-7558989.php|title=Le corps de la petite Maëlys retrouvé  : retour sur six mois d’enquête|work=leparisien.fr|date=14 February 2018|access-date=11 October 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maëlys de Araujo was last seen at a wedding in [[Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Isère]] at approximately 3:00&amp;nbsp;am on 27 August 2017. After a DJ working at the wedding announced that she was missing, guests immediately started looking for her, and after an hour of searching, a police report was filed. In the months that followed, police interviewed 250 wedding guests. Along with local volunteers, they also searched the dense woodland around the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Joshua|title=Mum's agony after daughter, 8, vanishes without trace at wedding party|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/this-wait-unbearable-mums-agony-11267809|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=Mirror.co.uk|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordahl_Lelandais Nordahl Lelandais], an ex-soldier who attended the wedding, was taken into custody in September 2017 after traces of De Araujo's DNA were found in his [[Audi A3]] car. Two police dogs fell seriously ill after searching the car. Lelandais had reportedly used a strong detergent to clean it a few hours after De Araujo disappeared. A car wash CCTV camera recorded him cleaning the car for more than two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man charged over missing wedding girl|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41144230|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/21/france-investigate-links-alps-murder-al-hilli-family-suspected/|title=France to reopen Alps murder investigation of al-Hilli family after possible serial killer charged|first=Henry|last=Samuel|date=21 December 2017|publisher=|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCTV footage showed Lelandais leaving the wedding venue with a "small, frail figure in a white dress" in the passenger seat of his car shortly before De Araujo was reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fears for girl missing at French wedding|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41081166|accessdate=1 January 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lelandais' mobile phone was in airplane mode around this time, and then reconnected after 39 minutes, when he returned to the wedding alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murder of Maëlys: 39 minutes in airplane mode, the time for Nordahl L. to kill the child?|url=http://archyworldys.com/murder-of-maelys-39-minutes-in-airplane-mode-the-time-for-nordahl-l-to-kill-the-child/|accessdate=2 March 2018|work=Archys World News|date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2018, Lelandais admitted to killing De Araujo, and led the police to where he had hidden her body. He told prosecutors he had killed her "involuntarily" but refused to elaborate further. The autopsy established that the girl had suffered a fractured jaw, possibly from a violent blow to the face. Lelandais has been held in custody since 16 February 2018, in a psychiatric unit in a prison in [[Bron]], just outside [[Lyon]].

==Link to other cases==
Prosecutors investigating De Araujo's death suspected that Lelandais is a [[serial killer]]. On 21 December 2017, he was charged with the killing of Arthur Noyer, a 23-year-old soldier who vanished after hitchhiking from a disco in [[Chambéry]] on 12 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bremner|first=Charles|title=Nordahl Lelandais, suspect in Maëlys de Araujo murder case, 'may be serial killer'|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nordahl-lelandais-suspect-in-maelys-de-araujo-murder-case-may-be-serial-killer-0prtwmqbj|work=The Times|date=21 December 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that Lelandais's cell phone had been in the same area at the same time as Noyer's. Lelandais's [[Audi A3]] car was identified in the area on surveillance cameras. An analysis of his computer found he had searched for "decomposition of a human body" on the internet two weeks after Noyer disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bar|first=Roni|url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium.MAGAZINE-people-have-a-right-to-vanish-france-said-then-came-a-serial-killer-1.6410907|title=People Have a Right to Disappear, France Said.

Other cases that may be linked to Lelandais include those of Jean-Christophe Morin and Ahmed Hamadou, who vanished from a festival in Fort de Tamié in 2011 and 2012 respectively.

"'''Detroit Rock City'''" is a song by the [[Americans|American]] hard rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], featured on their [[1976 in music|1976]] album ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]''. The song was written by [[Paul Stanley]] and producer [[Bob Ezrin]].

The song is one of the bands most popular and is a [[classic rock]] staple. It is also seen as one of the more technical songs musically in the band's canon. The guitar solo is famous for its [[Flamenco]] style and being a duet between Stanley and [[Ace Frehley]], it has since been a large influence on [[Rock music|rock]] music and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], in particular [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Pantera]].

==Song information==
The song, recorded and released as a single in 1976, was the third single from Kiss's album ''Destroyer'' and was planned to be their last in support of the album. As a single, it did poorly in sales and radio play (other than in [[Detroit]]), and failed to chart in the U.S. even though it would prove to be a fan favorite. It came as a surprise that the B-side "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]", a ballad written and sung by drummer [[Peter Criss]], wound up catching on in different markets in the [[United States]], so the single was reissued with "Beth" as the A-side and "Detroit Rock City" as the B-side.

While the song briefly references Detroit, the real-life incident which inspired the lyric evidently did not take place there. "I had the basic riff of the song, the 'Get up, get down' part," Stanley recalls, "but I didn't know what the song was about except it was about Detroit. And then I remembered on the previous tour, I think it was in Charlotte, somebody had gotten hit by a car and killed outside the arena. I remember thinking how weird it is that people's lives end so quickly. People can be on their way to something that's really a party and a celebration of being alive and die in the process of doing it. So that became the basis for the lyric."&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, David and Ken Sharp, ''KISS: Behind the Mask - The Official Authorized Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''Destroyer'', the song segues into "King of the Night Time World", via the sounds of a car crash. The songs were played together on the Destroyer tour.

During the ''Rock And Roll Over'' tour, Stanley changed the lyric, "I know I'm gonna die, why?" to "I know I'm gonna die, and I don't care!" The song was #6 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs and is featured on the album ''Heavy Metal – The First 20 Years''. "Detroit Rock City" was based on an earlier song that Kiss performed only in concert called "Acrobat".

[[Radio 92.9]] '''EarthFest''' is a free music festival that features both national and local acts. The concert averages 125,000 people yearly, hosts 14 bands on 3 stages, and is the largest radio station "Earth" or "Green" related event in [[New England]].

==Background==
The Radio 92.9 EarthFest concert is a free music festival that is hosted yearly on the Esplanade in downtown [[Boston, MA]]. The concert was created to demonstrate how everyday individuals can reduce their environmental impact. The concert is supported by a variety of sponsors such as [[Whole Foods Market]], [[Subaru]], [[MetroPCS]], and [[Boston Globe]]. These sponsors, along with the 51 other sponsors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myradio929.com/EarthFest/Sponsorship.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; set up booths and offer free items to promote their products and demonstrate to concert attendees how their products will aid both the individual, and the environment as a whole. The Radio 92.9 EarthFest concert will celebrate its 23rd event on Saturday May 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.celebrateboston.com/earthfest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with the main outdoor stage on the [[Hatch Shell]], EarthFest offers a smaller stage in an area known as ''Kid's Planet'', which is set up for families and a younger audience. Notable performers in years past have been [[KT Tunstall]], [[The Fray]], [[Los Lonely Boys]], and [[Shawn Mullins]]. Each year the concert will host 14 bands that range from locally to nationally known. Most recently, in 2012, the Earthfest Audience was estimated to be over 200,000 people by state police.

'''Enkutatash''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]]: እንቁጣጣሽ) is the first day of the [[New Year]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It occurs on Meskerem 1 on the [[Ethiopian calendar]], which is 11 September (or, during a [[leap year]], 12 September) according to the [[Gregorian calendar]].

This holiday is based on the [[Ethiopian calendar]], which was fixed to the [[Julian calendar]] in 25 BC by [[Emperor Augustus of Rome]] with a start date of 29 August J.C., thus establishing the New Year on this day.  The date marks the approximate end of the "rainy season".  It has also been associated traditionally with the return of the [[Queen of Sheba]] to Ethiopia following her visit to [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]] in ca. 980 BC.

Large celebrations are held around the country, notably at the Ragual Church on [[Entoto]] mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Time and dates in Ithiopia [sic] |url=http://www.rastaites.com/Ethiopia/newyear.htm |publisher=Rasta Ites |accessdate=29 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101174453/http://www.rastaites.com/Ethiopia/newyear.htm |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to InCultureParent, "after attending church in the morning, families gather to share a traditional meal of ''injera'' (flat bread) and ''wat'' (stew). Later in the day, young girls donning new clothes, gather daisies and present friends with a bouquet, singing New Year’s songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Enkutatash (Ethiopian New Year): September 11  | url=http://www.incultureparent.com/?p=6806| publisher=InCultureParent | date=7 September 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ethiopian Tourism Commission, "Enkutatash is not exclusively a religious holiday. Modern Enkutatash is also the season for exchanging formal new year greetings and cards among the urban sophisticated – in lieu of the traditional bouquet of flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Ethiopian Festivals | author=Ethiopian Tourism Commission | url=http://www.tourismethiopia.org/pages/detail/detailfestival.asp | date=16 November 2002 | accessdate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian counting of years begins in the year 8 of the [[common era]]. This is because the common era follows the calculations of Dionysius, a 6th-century monk, while the [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]] countries continued to use the calculations of Annius, a 5th-century monk, which had placed the Annunciation of Christ exactly 8 years later. For this reason, on Enkutatash in the year 2016 of the Gregorian calendar, it became 2009 in the Ethiopian calendar.

The '''European Production Series''' was a [[touring car racing]] series which ran for a single season in 2011. Intended to be a support series to the [[World Touring Car Championship]], the European Production Series ran over the six European rounds of the WTCC. The series did not put together a grid for 2012, and was not re-established.

==Background==
The European Production Series was created as a support series for the European rounds of the [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC). It was launched in December 2010 by WTCC driver [[Jordi Gené]], V-Line Org (organisers of the Spanish Endurance Cup) and [[Sunred Engineering|Sunred]] team manager Ian Planas. It was approved by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) as an International Series. Planas was the president of the organising committee, with Gené and V-Line's Francesc Gutiérrez as stewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ep-series.com/pdfs/reglamentos/sportingreg_ep-series11.pdf|title=European Production Series - 2011 Sporting Regulations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series supporedt six rounds of the [[2011 World Touring Car Championship season|2011 WTCC season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=5654|title=New endurance series to be run alongside WTCC|first=Johann|last=Meissner|date=23 December 2010|accessdate=30 January 2010|work=TouringCarTimes|publisher=Mediaempire Stockholm AB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Forgery Act 1861''' (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 98) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (as it then was). It consolidated provisions related to [[forgery]] from a number of earlier [[statutes]] into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act,&lt;ref&gt;Greaves. The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts (1861) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the [[criminal law consolidation Acts 1861]]. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier consolidation Act, the [[Forgery Act 1830]] (11 Geo 4 &amp; 1 Will 4 c 66) (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Edward Davis]]. [[The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 &amp; 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100: Edited with Notes, Critical and Explanatory]]. Butterworths. 1861. Pages vi and vii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR6&amp;output=html Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of it was repealed by the [[Forgery Act 1913]], and today forgery is mostly covered by the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]] and the [[Identity Documents Act 2010]]. However three offences under the 1861 Act remain in force today (in sections 34, 36 and 37). These deal with forgery of registers of births, marriages and deaths, and with impersonation of a [[surety]].

This Act was repealed for [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] by the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]], s.30 &amp; Sch., Pt.I, so far as unrepealed, except ss. 34, 36, 37 &amp; 55.
It was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0003.html#sec3 section 3(1)] of, and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sched1.html#sched1 Schedule 1] to, the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]].

Certain kinds of forgery used to be [[high treason]] until this Act downgraded them to [[felony|felonies]].

The Act does not apply to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Section 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==As to forging Her Majesty's Seals==

'''Section 1 - Forging the Great Seal, Privy Seal, etc.'''

This section made it a [[felony]] to forge the great seal, privy seal, the [[Royal sign manual]] etc.. This had previously been [[high treason]] under the [[Forgery Act 1830]]. The 1861 Act reduced the penalty from death to penal servitude for life.

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]]. It was however replaced with section 5 of that Act, which made similar provision.

==As to forging transfers of stock etc==

'''Section 2 - Forging transfer of certain stock, and power of attorney relating thereto'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

This section was repealed by section 33(3) of, and Part I of the Schedule 3 to, the [[Theft Act 1968]].

'''Section 4 - Forging attestation to power of attorney for transfer of  stock etc.'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

'''Section 5 - Making false entries in the books of the public funds'''

This section was repealed by the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]].

'''Section 6 - Clerks of the Bank making out false dividend warrants'''

This section was repealed by the [[Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981]].

==As to forging India bonds==

'''Section 7 - Forging an East India Bond'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

==As to forging exchequer bills etc==

'''Section 8 - Forging exchequer bills, bonds and debentures etc.'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

'''Section 9 - Making plates etc. in imitation of those used for exchequer bills etc.'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

'''Section 10 - Making paper in imitation of that used for exchequer bills

etc.'''

This section was repealed as to England and Ireland by section 20 of, and Part I of the Schedule to, the [[Forgery Act 1913]].

'''Section 11 - Having in possession paper, plates or dies to be used for exchequer bills'''

'''IMSA GT''' was a [[sports car racing]] series organized by [[International Motor Sports Association]]. Races took place primarily in the United States, and occasionally in Canada.

==History==
The series was founded in 1969 by John and Peggy Bishop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130822/grand_am/130829929 |title=Peggy Bishop, wife of IMSA founder, dies - Autoweek Racing Grand-Am news |publisher=Autoweek |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill France, Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand-Am, American Le Mans to merge series|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/120905/grand-am-american-le-mans-merger/index.html|publisher=nascar.com|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racing began in 1971, and was originally aimed at two of [[FIA]]'s stock car categories, running two classes each; the [[grand tourer|GT]] ([[Group 3 (racing)|Groups 3]] and [[Group 4 (racing)|4]]) and [[touring car racing|touring]] ([[Group 1 (racing)|Group 1]] and [[Group 2 (racing)|2]]) classes. The first race was held at [[Virginia International Raceway]]; it was an unexpected success, with both the drivers and the handful of spectators who attended.&lt;ref name="01-06imsablog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex62.typepad.com/imsablog/2006/01/do_you_want_to_.html |title=IMSA blog: Do you want to know about GT racing in the 70s |publisher=Alex62.typepad.com |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following year,  John Bishop brought in sponsor [[R. J. Reynolds]], and in 1975 introduced a new category: All American Grand Touring (AAGT). In 1977, the series went through a series of major changes. IMSA permitted [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] cars to compete for the first time, as well as introducing a new category: GTX, based on [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] rules. In 1981, after Bishop decided to not follow FIA's newly introduced [[Group C]] rules, he introduced the GTP class for [[sports prototype]]s. In 1989, Bishop sold off his organization. After a period of decline in the early 1990s, the sports car category was introduced in 1993 to replace the GTP category in 1994.

After a period of multiple ownerships, the organization was eventually renamed Professional Sports Car Racing (PSCR). In 1999, PSCR decided to drop their own championship series in order to sanction a new series: the [[American Le Mans Series]]. Despite having various official names, the GT series was known commonly as the "IMSA series", as it had been the organization's dominant series.

[[File:IMSAGTO1987.JPG|thumb|right|[[Robin McCall]] in the Hoerr Racing GTO Oldsmobile (1987)]]
The 1971 season was the first racing season, and lasted six races. The early years of the series featured GT cars, similar to the European [[Group 2 (racing)|Group 2]] and [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] classes, divided into four groups:

*'''GTO''' - Grand touring-type cars with engines of 2.5L displacement or more,&lt;ref name="01-06imsablog" /&gt; the letter ''O''  meaning "over 2.5L". The GTO class was dominated by Corvettes, then by Shelby Mustangs, and then various factory teams consisting of [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]]s, [[Datsun 280ZX|280zx]]s, [[Toyota Celica|Celica]]s and finally, [[Nissan 300ZX|300ZX]]s.
*'''GTU''' - Grand touring-type cars with engines of 2.5L displacement or less, the letter ''U'' meaning "under 2.5L". The GTU group was dominated by [[Porsche 914-6 GT]]s, and SA22 [[Mazda RX-7]]s (1978–1985) through the end of the 1980s.
*'''TO''' - Touring-type cars, such as the Chevrolet Camaro with engines of 2.5L or more displacement
*'''TU''' - Touring-type cars with engines of 2.5L or less displacement

In essence, these groups had been absorbed from the [[Trans Am Series]]. Trans Am would quickly become a support series for IMSA GT.

==History of the top series in the GT Championship==

===Camel GT era===
The first champions were [[Peter H. Gregg]] and [[Hurley Haywood]], in a [[Porsche 914-6 GT]]U. Common winners in these early years of IMSA were the [[Porsche 911 Carrera RSR]], and the [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] became the title sponsor during the second season, with the series becoming known as the Camel GT Challenge Series. The sponsor's corporate decal had to be displayed and clearly visible on the left and right sides of all racecars, and Camel's corporate logo patch was also required to be on the Nomex driver suit's breast area, featuring [[Joe Camel]] smiling and smoking a cigarette while driving a race car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Mark Windecker |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1973/Mid-Ohio-1973-07-15-0000.jpg |title=Mid-Ohio 6 Hours 1973 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, all cars were identified with a category tag, stating which category they competed in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Mark Windecker |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1973/Mid-Ohio-1973-07-15-023.jpg |title=Mid-Ohio 6 Hours 1973 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the middle of the 1975 season on, all cars within the series had to have a rectangular ''IMSA GT'' decal, which incorporated its logo on the left, followed by a large GT tag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Gene Felton Restorations |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1975/Mid-Ohio-1975-08-24-032.jpg |title=Laguna Seca 100 Miles I 1975 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as a Joe Camel decal.

Starting fields of 30 or more competitors were not unusual during this era. One of the premiere race events was the Paul Revere 250, which started at midnight of the Fourth of July. The race was conducted entirely at night. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

In 1975 a new category, All American Grand Touring (AAGT), was introduced to counteract the Porsche dominance in GTO.&lt;ref name="prototypes"&gt;[[Prototypes: The History of the IMSA GTP Series]], J. A. Martin &amp; Ken Wells, David Bull Publishing, {{ISBN|1-893618-01-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the [[Bob Sharp (racing driver)|Bob Sharp Racing]] team used a loophole in the rules to build a [[Datsun 280ZX]] inside the U.S. with a V8 engine from a [[Nissan President]].  The car was not a success, however, and it became obsolete when the new GTP category was created.&lt;ref name="shipway"&gt;Essential Datsun Z 240Z to 280Zx: The Cars and Their Story 1969-83, Colin Shipway, Motorbooks International, {{ISBN|1-870979-51-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; TU would be phased out in 1976, TO the following year.

Turbochargers were not permitted until the middle of the 1977 season. They were allowed following protests by Porsche's motorsport department, after inspecting [[Al Holbert]]'s AAGT winning [[Chevrolet Monza]], which had won two titles. Prior to 1977, Porsche privateers struggled with obsolete 911 Carrera RSRs against the AAGT cars.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;930 to 935: The Turbo Porsches, John Starkey, Renwick &amp; Starkey Ltd. {{ISBN|0-9665094-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engine sizes were determined by IMSA officials, who had devised a set of rules to determine fair competition, using a displacement versus minimum weight formula. Turbochargers were taken into account as well as rotary power, fuel injection, and many other engine features.&lt;ref name="1987gto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex62.typepad.com/imsablog/2007/02/gto_the_big_ste.html |title=IMSA blog: GTO : the big step ahead |publisher=Alex62.typepad.com |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the new premier class known as GTX (Grand Touring Experimental, which was based on [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]'s [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]]), brought on the absolute dominance of the [[Porsche 935]]. The 935 became the most successful car in the series. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The most successful driver of the 1970s was [[Peter Gregg (racing driver)|Peter Gregg]], who won championships in 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979. Twin turbos were outlawed at the end of the 1982 season after [[John Paul, Sr. (racing driver)|John Paul Sr.]] and [[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul Jr.]] dominated in a modified 935.

===GT spaceframe era===

In 1984, all GT cars were required to display a large square decal to identify which category the car competed in. A GTU car, for instance, would have a black ''U'' on white,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Mark Windecker |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1984/Daytona-1984-02-05-007.jpg |title=Daytona 24 Hours 1984 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a GTO car, a white ''O'' on black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Mark Windecker |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1984/Daytona-1984-02-05-0001.jpg |title=Daytona 24 Hours 1984 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All others had standard IMSA GT decals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Fred Lewis Photos |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1984/Daytona-1984-02-05-009.jpg |title=Daytona 24 Hours 1984 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant change to the rules during the 1980s was the 2.5 liter limit being increased to 3.0 liters, with the maximum 6.0 liter limit still in place.&lt;ref name="1987gto" /&gt; 3.0L cars were required to weigh {{convert|1900|lb|abbr=on}}, whereas 6.0L cars had to weigh no less than {{convert|2700|lb|abbr=on}}. In an effort to equalize the competition, two-valve turbocharged cars were required to weigh 15% more, and four-valve turbocharged cars 20% more. Electronic fuel injection became common, while [[Ground effect (cars)|ground effect]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s were still prohibited.&lt;ref name="1987gto" /&gt;

Steering, braking, transmission, and suspension were left up to the constructor. Bigger, more powerful engines were permitted under homologation rules.&lt;ref name="1987gto" /&gt; The number of valves, ports, and spark plugs were not allowed to be modified from the original configuration.

The [[All American Racers|AAR]] [[Toyota]] team suddenly encountered a daunting problem with the rules when, with Toyota's introduction of the new, fourth generation, [[Toyota Celica|Celica]] for the US market, and the team's first entry into the top-flight GTO category (despite not having won a single GTU title&lt;ref name="imsaaar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex62.typepad.com/imsablog/2006/07/all_american_ra.html |title=IMSA blog: All American Racers : part 1, the GT cars |publisher=Alex62.typepad.com |date=2006-07-27 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the team faced the distinct possibility that they would be required to race a front-wheel-drive car, until they managed to persuade IMSA to change the rules, thereby permitting cars to race with something other than their original [[drivetrain]], and therefore with a redesigned chassis. To AAR's delight, IMSA did change the rules, and the car was converted to rear wheel drive.&lt;ref name="sportcomp" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allamericanracers.com/celicas.html |title=The Angriest Celicas by Matthew Hayashibara, Sports Compact Car, September 1999 |publisher=Allamericanracers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One outstanding feature of the car was the [[Toyota T engine|4T-GT]]E engine, from its [[Safari Rally]]-winning, [[Group B]] predecessor, producing around {{convert|475|hp|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="1987gto" /&gt; Piloted by the likes of [[Chris Cord]], [[Willy T. Ribbs]], and [[Dennis Aase]], the car was dominant in its class right up until the team's move to GTP. Utilizing the same engine, it became dominant once again. Other teams would follow this example, with notable cars such as the [[Chevrolet Beretta]] (in the Trans-Am series) and the [[Mazda MX-6]] (in IMSA GTU).&lt;ref name="sportcomp" /&gt;

The Celica was one of just a few cars that had broken away from its production GT derivatives of the earlier years. With a full [[spaceframe]] chassis, they became serious race cars. By 1987, the category became dominated by factory teams, with testing sessions becoming common, and rules tailored to welcome them in rather than turn them away. Otherwise, the cars were required to closely resemble their showroom counterparts, though fenders could be widened, increasing the [[Axle track|track]] up to {{convert|79|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name="1987gto" /&gt;

There were no restrictions on body materials, as most teams favored removable, easy to repair fiberglass (meaning one of the only remaining panels from a car's production counterpart was the steel roof structure).

Another car that exploited the rules was the [[Audi]] [[Audi 90|90]]. With its advanced [[Quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|Quattro four-wheel-drive]] system, the car had the potential to dominate during the 1989 season. The car performed well, but faced heavy competitions from two factory teams; the [[Roush Racing]] [[Mercury Cougar|Mercury Cougar XR7]], and Clayton Cunningham Racing's [[Nissan 300ZX]], which took seven wins out of fifteen. Audi stayed away from the early season endurance classics (Daytona and Sebring), and had two cars drop out of the race in two different rounds,&lt;ref name="wspr89imsamake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/tableimsagtomakes.html#1989GTO |title=1989 IMSA GTO makes |publisher=WSPR Racing |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby costing them both the manufacturer's and driver's titles, [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] driving.

Another manufacturer to experience a run of wins was [[Mazda]]. After some success by the [[Mazda RX-2]] and [[Mazda RX-3]], the [[Mazda RX-7]] won its class in the IMSA [[24 Hours of Daytona]] race an amazing ten years in a row, starting in 1982. It also won eight IMSA GTU championships in a row from 1980 through 1987.  The car went on to win more IMSA races in its class than any other model of automobile, with its one hundredth victory on September 2, 1990.&lt;ref name="rx7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex62.typepad.com/imsablog/2006/02/mazda_rx7_winni.html |title=IMSAblog: Mazda RX7 : winningest car ever |publisher=Alex62.typepad.com |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GTP era===
[[File:Eaglemk3-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eagle MkIII|Toyota Eagle Mk.III]] GTP class car]]
In 1981, purpose-built GTP cars (Grand Touring Prototypes) appeared in the championship, and were similar to the new FIA [[Group C]] cars which would be introduced to the [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]] from 1982. The main difference between the two categories was that the former had no emphasis on fuel consumption which was highlighted by [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]] saying "Race fans do not come to races to watch an economy run.".&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; [[Brian Redman]] was the first GTP champion, driving a [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] T600 with a Chevrolet engine. [[March Engineering|March]] also fielded prototypes, with [[Al Holbert]] winning the 1983 championship with a Chevrolet powered car, changing to Porsche power later in the season; and [[Randy Lanier]] a year later with Chevrolet power. 1984 also saw the introduction of the [[Porsche 962]], which dominated the series from '85 to '87. [[Nissan]] then took control of the series in 1988, but faced challenges from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Porsche]], and [[Toyota]] throughout the next three years. Toyota was quickest in 1992 and 1993, at the end of the GTP era, as [[Dan Gurney]]'s [[All American Racers]] team campaigned the [[Eagle Mk III]], a car so dominant that it has been blamed for the demise of the class. Along with the GTP cars, the Camel Lights cars, a smaller capacity, non-turbocharged, lower powered prototype category was introduced in 1985. [[Argo Racing Cars|Argo]] Racing Cars was the first 'Lights' Champions, followed by [[Spice Engineering|Spice]] Engineering. Other well known participants were the [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga]], [[Royale Racing Cars|Royale]], [[Alba Engineering|Alba]], Fabcar, and Kudzu.

Starting with the 1986 season, the GTP category had their own decal, which was similar to the IMSA GT side decal, with a ''P'' being added to denote their category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Fred Lewis Photos |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1986/Daytona-1986-02-02-0004.jpg |title=Daytona 24 Hours 1986 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camel Lights cars also used the same decal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Photo by courtesy of: Michael O. Crews |url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/1986/Daytona-1986-02-02-006.jpg |title=Daytona 24 Hours 1986 |publisher=Racing Sports Cars |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many other manufacturers in the GTP class, such as URD Rennsport, [[Spice Engineering|Spice]], [[Chevrolet Intrepid|Intrepid]] or [[Gebhardt]], and in the early 1990s, Mazda.

===Fall of GTP===
Following a successful heart surgery in 1987, Bishop began to rethink his priorities. He was approached by Mike Cone and Jeff Parker, owners of [[Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|Tampa Race Circuit]]. In January 1989, Bishop and France sold the series to Cone and Parker. The new owners relocated the IMSA headquarters from [[Connecticut]] to [[Tampa Bay]].&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; Bishop would stand down as president in favor of Mark Raffauf, who was his deputy, and its representative on the ACCUS board.&lt;ref name="endur"&gt;Endurance Racing 1982-1991, Ian Briggs, Osprey Automotice, {{ISBN|1-85532-228-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cone and Parker sold it to businessman Charles Slater. Both lost millions attempting to revive the sagging TV ratings.&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt;

By 1992, there were a number of factors that led to the decline of the GTP category. Porsche concentrated on its [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] program when critics stated that the [[Zuffenhausen]] marque should have built a followup to its [[Porsche 962|962]].&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; Back in 1988, Al Holbert realized that the 962 was beginning to feel dated. He proposed a followup open-top Porsche powered racer which would also be sold to customer teams. That project never got off the ground due to Holbert's death in an aircraft accident later in the year.&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; For some, much of the blame was on the organization for allowing the Japanese "works" teams to dominate the series. Under Bishop's original vision, privateers and "works teams" were able to race equally. Privateer teams walked away, while the Japanese economy started to go downhill. These factors led Nissan and Mazda to leave the series. Critics predicted that the decreased variety of cars would disappoint race fans, and in fact, it did finally kill the series in 1993.&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; GTP cars ran their last race on October 2, 1993 at [[Phoenix International Raceway]].&lt;ref name=ferraris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferraris-online.com/Articles/CarMag_9312.shtml |title=The Last Race |accessdate=2007-05-15 |author=Michael Strahan |date=December 1993 |work=Car Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTP category was credited for many innovations in the U.S., including [[antilock brakes]], [[traction control system|traction control]], and [[active suspension]].&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; Dave Cowart and Kemper Miller's [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] sponsored team of the early 1980s would innovate race team hospitality, practices which were subsequently adopted by virtually every other team.&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt; For those that competed, GTP was recognized for its [[camaraderie]] among drivers, especially rivals. But [[Hans-Joachim Stuck|Hans Stuck]], commenting in the [[foreword]] of the book ''"Prototypes: The History of the IMSA GTP Series"'', sarcastically compared the series' camaraderie to Formula One's lack of such.&lt;ref name="prototypes" /&gt;

===World Sports Cars===

With rising costs and factory teams walking away from the series, which meant diminishing entries and diminishing profit, IMSA introduced a new [[prototype]] category for in 1993: World Sport Car (WSC). WSC replaced GTP and Camel Lights' closed-top cars for the following year. The WSC cars were open-top, flat-bottomed sports-prototypes with production engines, as opposed to racing versions of production engines from GTP cars.

The WSC cars made their debut at the [[Grand Prix of Miami (sports car racing)|Miami Grand Prix]] with the sole entry of Brent O'Neill. The car finished last among the cars that were still running. After skipping the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], the category would compete for the remainder of the season in non-Championship rounds, with no more than four cars entering each race. In 1994 Camel was replaced by [[Exxon]] as the title sponsor. However, as the WSC cars took over as the leading category, their reliability would be tested at the opening round at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Two cars started on the front row, with eight WSC cars competing. Two cars finished the race, with the leading WSC car finishing ninth behind GT cars. A WSC car would score its first podium finish at Sebring with a second, and third place behind a Daytona winning GTS class Nissan 300ZX. That led to a rule change for the latter category, as they would be barred from using engines that were originally for GTP cars. At the inaugural round for WSC cars at [[Road Atlanta]], the new [[Ferrari 333 SP]] would make its debut amongst mass media fanfare, and win its debut race. The car brand regularly achieving podium finishes every round after that, [[Oldsmobile]], won the manufacturer's title over [[Ferrari]] by four points.

In 1995, a new rival for Ferrari appeared in the [[Riley &amp; Scott]] Mk III. The car would make its debut at Daytona, but would retire after the eleventh lap due to engine failure. Ferrari would help the category score an overall win at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and would take the manufacturer's title. The Ferrari 333 SP and the R&amp;S cars (Oldsmobile / Ford) were the dominant entries in the series from 1995 until the demise of IMSA at the end of 1998.

In 1996, Slater sold the organization to [[Roberto Muller]] (ex-CEO of [[Reebok]]) and [[Wall Street]] financier Andy Evans, who was also an IndyCar owner, and owner-driver of the [[Team Scandia|Scandia]] WSC team. Evans and VP of marketing Kurtis Eide were responsible for the name change to Professional Sports Car Racing.

In 1992, the long running category American Challenge stepped into the GT series. It became known as the GTO category when the former GTO category was renamed GTS (Grand Touring Supreme). The move was prompted by sponsor Exxon, who wanted the series named after its sub-brand of fuel.&lt;ref name="wspr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/imsa/nf_imsa_home.html |title=WSPR-Racing.com |publisher=WSPR-Racing.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, in a bid to move closer to the European [[BPR Global GT Series]], the GT category would undergo another major reformatting. GTS became known as GTS-1, and GTU became known as GTS-2. In 1997, there was another category addition: GTS-2 became GTS-3. The new GTS-2 category was introduced to allow for the existing GT2 cars.

===End of an era===
Under tremendous pressure from team owners and management, Evans sold the series to PST Holdings, Inc., a group led by Raymond Smith, formerly the chief financial officer of Sports Car. Other owners included Dough Robinson and Tom Milner. In 2001 [[Don Panoz]] purchased PSCR to solidify the sanction for Panoz's [[American Le Mans Series]] (ALMS) which had been sanctioned by PSCR since 1999. Panoz renamed the sanctioning organization IMSA, and it was the official sanctioning body of the American Le Mans Series, the Star Mazda series, and the [[Panoz]] GT Pro series.  The ALMS uses regulations based on those of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], but in 2005 the relationship between Panoz and the Le Mans organizers, [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest|ACO]],  became problematic.

A breakaway series formed in 1998 involving the [[Sports Car Club of America]], and was running under the name of the [[United States Road Racing Championship]]. It was headed by a group of competitors that wanted to keep the rules within the United States. After failing by 1999, a new U.S.-based series was started with the full support of [[NASCAR]]'s [[Bill France, Jr.|France]] family named the [[Grand American Road Racing Association]], operating the headlining [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]. The series struggled early on, but after the introduction of the [[Daytona Prototype]] class, proved to be a popular competitor to the more international ALMS, attracting some pro drivers and teams, featuring large fields, and producing close competition. Much like the split from 1996 to 2008 between [[Champ Car]] and the [[Indy Racing League|IRL]], critics say this split was detrimental to the sport as a whole. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Grand AM and ALMS merged in 2014 under IMSA sanction and France family ownership to create the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]].

After the series' demise, a U.S.-based [[historical racing]] organization, Historic Sportscar Racing, created a new series to put GTP and Group C cars that had been stored away back onto the track. The series was called HSR ThunderSport. Its creation sparked a similar revival series in Europe, as well as another series in the UK called Group C/GTP Racing.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

An '''inauthentic text''' is a computer-generated expository document meant to appear as genuine, but which is actually meaningless.  Frequently they are created in order to be intermixed with genuine documents and thus manipulate the results of search engines, as with [[Spam blog]]s.  They are also carried along in email in order to fool [[spam filter]]s by giving the spam the superficial characteristics of legitimate text.

Sometimes nonsensical documents are created with computer assistance for humorous effect, as with [[Dissociated press]] or [[Flarf poetry]].  They have also been used to challenge the veracity of a publication&amp;mdash;[[MIT]] students submitted papers generated by a computer program called [[SCIgen]] to a conference, where they were initially accepted.  This led the students to claim that the bar for submissions was too low.

With the amount of computer generated text outpacing the ability of people to humans to curate it, there needs some means of distinguishing between the two.  Yet automated approaches to determining absolutely whether a text is authentic or not face intrinsic challenges of semantics.  [[Noam Chomsky]] coined the phrase "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" giving an example of grammatically-correct, but semantically incoherent sentence; some will point out that in certain contexts one could give this sentence (or any phrase) meaning.

The first group to use the expression in this regard can be found below from [[Indiana University]].  Their work explains in detail an attempt to detect inauthentic texts and identify pernicious problems of inauthentic texts in cyberspace.  The site has a means of submitting text that assesses, based on supervised learning, whether a corpus is inauthentic or not.  Many users have submitted incorrect types of data and have correspondingly commented on the scores. This application is meant for a specific kind of data; therefore, submitting, say, an email, will not return a meaningful score.

{{Campaignbox Civil Wars of the Early Caliphates}}
The '''Kharijite Rebellion''' was a major [[Kharijite]] uprising against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] between 866 and 896. Centered in the districts of [[Mosul]] and [[Diyar Rabi'a]] in the province of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|al-Jazira (upper Mesopotamia)]], the rebellion lasted for approximately thirty years, despite numerous attempts by both the central government and provincial authorities to quell it. It was finally defeated in 896 after the caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] (r. 892–902) undertook several campaigns to restore caliphal authority in the region.

The uprising was initially led by a local Kharijite named Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari. Following Musawir's death in 877, he was eventually succeeded by Harun ibn 'Abdallah al-Bajali, who remained in command until the end of the rebellion.

==Background==
{{Main |Kharijites|Anarchy at Samarra}}
The Kharijite movement was a prominent religious sect in early [[Islam]]ic history, known for its members' fanaticism and staunch opposition to the Muslim ruling establishment. The Kharijites' views on the nature of the [[caliphate]] caused them to reject the legitimacy of the rule of the [[Alids]], [[Umayyads]] and [[Abbasids]] alike, and over the course of the seventh through ninth centuries they were responsible for numerous rebellions against the established government. Few of these attempts proved to be successful, but the Kharijites' continual presence in many [[Divisions of the world in Islam|Muslim-held]] regions meant that they were a near-constant source of trouble for the caliphs' governors.&lt;ref&gt;Levi Della Vida, pp. 1074-77&lt;/ref&gt;

In the caliphal province of [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|al-Jazira]], [[Sufri]] Kharijism had enjoyed a strong following since the late seventh century, particularly among the [[Arab people|Arabs]] of the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe. Between 750 and 865 more than a dozen Kharijite revolts were launched in this region, although most of them were easily put down by the Abbasid government. The most recent uprising had occurred in 862, approximately four years before Musawir's revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Vaglieri, pp. 39-40; Madelung, pp. 766-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 861 the Abbasid Caliphate [[Anarchy at Samarra|entered a period of severe weakness]], during which the central government in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] was paralyzed by a vicious struggle between the caliphs and the military establishment for control. Over the course of the 860s the government was repeatedly beset with financial difficulties, riots in the capital and rebel movements in multiple provinces. These problems were exacerbated in 865, when the rival caliphs [[al-Musta'in]] and [[al-Mu'tazz]] [[Caliphal Civil War (865-866)|fought a civil war]] in central Iraq, which left thousands dead and caused major economic damage to the region. Even after the end of the war in early 866, the instability continued unabated, with troop riots repeatedly occurring in both Samarra and [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 90-104; Waines, pp. 299-303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of the rebellion==
According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-Athir]], the immediate cause of the rebellion was the authorities' arrest and detention of a young man in [[Hdatta|al-Haditha]]. This individual was a son of Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid, who was a [[Dehqan#Islamic Era|''dihqan'']] of the town of [[Bawazij|al-Bawazij]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; When he learned of his son's incarceration, he responded angrily to the news and gathered a number of supporters, who [[Bay'ah|pledged allegiance]] to him. The group marched on al-Haditha and entered it; the [[shurta|chief of police]] there was forced to go into hiding, and Musawir's son was freed from prison.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 186-87; Weil, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for Musawir quickly grew, with [[Bedouin]] Arabs and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] of the region flocking to his side. Following an aborted advance on the district capital of Mosul,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 187; Weil, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; the rebels advanced south toward the [[Khurasan Road]] between Baghdad and [[Hulwan]] in autumn 867. When the [[Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah ibn Tahir|governor of Baghdad]] sent two commanders to protect the road, Musawir engaged one of them in battle, killing him and several hundred of his men, and forced the other one to retreat back to Baghdad. He then followed up on this victory by proceeding to Hulwan, where he fought and killed more than four hundred of its defenders.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 147-49; Ibn al-Athir, p. 190; Weil, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 868, in response to the growing power of the rebels, the deputy governor of Mosul raised an army and headed for Musawir in the vicinity of the [[Zab River (disambiguation)|Zab River]]s. The two sides encountered each other in May 868, and engaged in battle in the middle of a valley. After heavy fighting the rebels emerged victorious; the loyalist army suffered heavy casualties and the deputy governor fled to [[Erbil|Irbil]]. This victory increased Musawir's authority in the region,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 195; Weil, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year he undertook an expedition against Mosul itself. Due to the weakness of the defenders he was able to enter the city without opposition. He remained in Mosul for a short time, during which he conducted the [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]], and then withdrew to al-Haditha.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 205; Weil, p. 417; Honigmann and Bosworth, p. 900&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the next several years, Musawir remained active within a large portion of the district of Mosul, together with part of northern Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 195, 219; Weil, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenants were sent to administer the areas under his control; they established garrisons and collected [[kharaj|taxes]] from local residents.&lt;ref&gt;Vaglieri, p. 40; al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 24; Ibn al-Athir, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Travel through the region became difficult for government agents, who risked being captured and killed by Musawir's partisans. He also received support from nearby Arab and Kurdish tribes, who sympathized with his cause and fought against the government.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 136, 158; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 238, 248, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbasid campaigns against Musawir==
[[File:Abbasids Ninth Century.svg|thumb|right|400px|The Kharijite rebellion spanned the reigns of four caliphs, from al-Mu'tazz to al-Mu'tadid]]
Beginning in 867, the Abbasid government in Samarra undertook a series of military campaigns in an effort to suppress the Kharijite rebellion. These operations began under the caliph [[al-Mu'tazz]] (r. 866–869), whose forces however had little success against the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ya'qubi, p. 614, who states (in summary form) that al-Mu'tazz was prompted to action after Musawir expelled the governor of Mosul, marched in the direction of Surra Man Ra'a (Samarra) and occupied the town of al-Muhammadiyyah, "three [[Parasang|''farsakh'']]s from the palaces of the caliph"&lt;/ref&gt; He initially sent the officers Satikin&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 147. Satikin was an officer in the service of [[Bugha al-Saghir]]; al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and Khutarmish against Musawir; the latter was defeated in the district of [[Jalula]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 151; Ibn al-Athir, p. 192; Weil, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; In September 868 Nushara ibn Tajibak, a lieutenant in [[Salih ibn Wasif|Salih ibn Wasif's]] service, managed to inflict a defeat on Musawir and killed a large number of his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 146, 155; Ibn al-Athir, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, [[Yarjukh]] was sent against the rebel, but he was defeated and forced to flee to Samarra.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the overthrow and death of al-Mu'tazz, his successor [[al-Muhtadi]] (r. 869–870) continued the campaigns. Upon receiving reports in January 870 that Musawir was attacking the town of [[Iski Mosul|Balad]], the caliph ordered the commanders [[Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir|Musa ibn Bugha]], [[Muflih al-Turki|Muflih]] and [[Bayakbak]] to proceed against him; a political crisis in the capital, however, resulted in this expedition's postponement. After a delay of several months, Musa and Bayakbak reassembled their troops and departed for al-Jazira on April 6. The army set up a base at [[Sinn, Iraq|al-Sinn]] and Muflih proceeded to pursue Musawir, eventually engaging the rebel on a mountain near al-Haditha. The battle proceeded poorly for Musawir, whose forces were weakened from a recent battle against a dissident Kharijite, and he eventually ordered a retreat. Muflih then advanced to various cities in Diyar Rabi'a, in an effort to reestablish order.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 87, 90-91. Halfway through al-Tabari's account of the fight between the caliphal army and Musawir, he switches the name of the commander from Muflih to Musa. Ibn al-Athir, p. 219, gives sole credit to Muflih as the commander during the battle, but dates the fight to after Mu'tamid's ascension. He also adds the detail that the campaigns against Musawir in this year were prompted after Musawir's seizure of parts of Iraq had hindered the ability of the government to pay the troops' salaries, causing the army to clamor for action against the Kharijites. Al-Mas'udi, v. 8: p. 8, claims that the campaign took place after Musawir had approached Samarra with an army and caused a measure of disorder around the capital.&lt;/ref&gt;

The caliphal forces remained at al-Sinn for some time, but in early June Musa and Muflih were made aware of a plot by al-Muhtadi to either have them assassinated or imprisoned; they immediately responded by abandoning al-Jazira and withdrawing toward the Khurasan Road.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 91-92, 95, 96; Ibn al-Athir, p. 220; Weil, pp. 418-19&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Khanaqin]] Musa encountered Musawir, who had a strong numerical advantage, but in spite of this the Kharijites were routed and suffered severe losses.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 112; Ibn al-Athir, p. 227. Weil, p. 465, sourcing [[Ibn Khaldun]], claims that Musawir was actually the winner of this battle&lt;/ref&gt; After al-Muhtadi was deposed on June 17 and replaced with [[al-Mu'tamid]] (r. 870–892), Muflih resumed his offensive against the Kharijites. He initially succeeded in forcing Musawir to abandon al-Haditha, but he was unsuccessful in his attempts to defeat the rebel and eventually returned to Samarra in August, allowing Musawir to regain his authority in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 116; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 219-20, 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Muflih again went on campaign in around early 872; he proceeded to [[Tikrit|Takrit]] and fought some Arab tribesmen that were reportedly sympathetic to Musawir.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 136; Ibn al-Athir, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, [[Masrur al-Balkhi]] undertook two expeditions against Musawir; in the first, he installed a lieutenant in al-Haditha and captured a number of Kharijites, bringing them back to Samarra; in the second, he advanced to al-Bawazij and defeated Musawir in combat, capturing a number of his followers in the process, before departing for the capital around the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: p. 148; Ibn al-Athir, p. 238, who however presents a different order of events; Weil, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; Masrur undertook further campaigns in 874 and 875, both times in response to the killing of government officials by Musawir's followers; on the latter occasion he was assisted by al-Mu'tamid's brother [[Al-Muwaffaq|Abu Ahmad]] (the future al-Muwaffaq).&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 158, 164; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 248, 259; Weil, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musawir's death and succession disputes==
Musawir died in ca. 877, shortly after he had set out from al-Bawazij to meet yet another government army. Following his death, the Kharijites sought to find someone to succeed him. They initially called upon Muhammad ibn Khurzad of [[Shahrizor|Shahrazur]] to assume the leadership, but he turned down their request, so they turned to another man named Ayyub ibn Hayyan al-Wariqi al-Bajali and gave the oath of allegiance to him instead.

Ibn Khurzad subsequently regretted his decision and requested that he be reconsidered as leader, but the Kharijites refused to go back on their choice. In response, Ibn Khurazd gathered a number of men loyal to him and attacked Ayyub ibn Hayyan, killing him. Following this, the Kharijites threw their support behind Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yahya al-Wariqi, but he ended up being killed by Ibn Khurzad as well. The Kharijites finally selected Harun ibn 'Abd Allah al-Bajali, who soon gained a large number of supporters. Ibn Khurzad decided not to fight against Harun, and the latter assumed Musawir's former position within the district of Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 272-73; Weil, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Harun's apparent victory in the succession dispute, however, his relationship with Ibn Khurzad remained poor. In ca. 881 Ibn Khurzad decided to make a move against Harun; he gathered his supporters and advanced against him. Harun assembled his own followers in response, and the two sides encountered each other near Mosul. In the ensuing battle, Harun was defeated and two hundred of his men were killed. He soon regained control of the situation, however, by soliciting the support of the local [[Taghlib]] Arabs and writing offers to Ibn Khurzad's followers, urging them to defect to his side. Most of them agreed to do so, and Ibn Khurzad's position quickly deteriorated as a result. He was eventually killed in Shahrazur, and Harun became the undisputed head of the Kharijite rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 306-07; Weil, pp. 466-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Kharijites under Harun==
Under Harun's command, the Kharijites continued their activities in the area around Mosul. They subdued numerous villages and rural districts adjacent to the [[Tigris River]], putting deputies over these territories and levying taxes and tithes from the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 306-07&lt;/ref&gt; Harun also established an alliance with [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]], a Taghlibite chieftain and the eponymous founder of the [[Hamdanid dynasty]], and over the course of the next several years the two leaders jointly conducted a number of campaigns within the Mosul district.&lt;ref&gt;Canard, "Hamdanids," p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

In ca. 885 Harun and Hamdan decided to march on Mosul; they entered the city and Harun led the people in the prayers in the [[Jama Masjid|Friday Mosque]]. News of this incident was reported to Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 37: p. 150; Ibn al-Athir, p. 345; Weil, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, the district began to suffer from raiding activities by the [[Shayban (tribe)|Banu Shayban]]; in response, Harun and Hamdan assembled their forces in an effort to stop them. The two leaders met and advanced against the Arabs, but the Shaybanis defeated them in battle and forced them to fall back.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Harun undertook another advance against Mosul four years later, after he received word that [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj]], the city's governor, had killed a local Kharijite. He summoned his followers in al-Haditha and marched against the city, intending to attack its people in revenge. The city notables, however, managed to convince Harun to back down after they disassociated themselves from the governor's actions and apologized for the killing.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 358; Weil, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;

In ca. 892, Harun and Hamdan entered into an alliance with the inhabitants of Mosul, after the latter had rebelled against their governor, [[Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundaj]], and expelled his deputy from the city. The deputy turned to the Banu Shayban for assistance, prompting them to enter the district in force. Harun, Hamdan, and a number of Mosuli volunteers banded together to fight the Shaybanis and expel them from the region. The two sides met in the vicinity of the city, and after engaging each other in battle the Mosulis won an initial victory. The Shaybanis, however, regrouped and returned to the battlefield; the Mosulis, who had taken to looting after the engagement, were caught by surprise. Many of them were killed and the Shaybanis won the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 369; Weil, pp. 467-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, an internal dispute broke out among the Kharijites, and many of them decided to reject Harun's leadership. The leader of the dissidents was one Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydah, a member of the [[Banu Zuhayr]] from the village of [[Qabratha]], who gathered a number of supporters from the tribal Arabs and began collecting taxes for himself. He also built a fortress at [[Sinjar]] and put his son in charge of it, leaving a large amount of his plunder there. In response, Harun marched toward the fortress with over a thousand men and laid siege to it. The Banu Zuhayr within the fortress eventually agreed to submit after they were granted a guarantee of safe-conduct; the gates were opened to Harun's men, and Muhammad's son and a several of his followers were beheaded. Harun then advanced against Qabratha, where Muhammad himself was stationed. In the ensuing battle Harun's forces were at first forced to fall back, but they subsequently rallied and defeated the dissidents, killing a large number of them. Muhammad fled to [[Diyarbakır|Amid]], but was captured by its governor [[Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani|Ahmad ibn 'Isa al-Shaybani]] and sent to Baghdad, where he was [[flaying|flayed]] on the caliph's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, p. 375; Weil, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the rebellion==
In October 892 the caliph al-Mu'tamid died and was succeeded by his nephew [[al-Mu'tadid]]. At the time of his ascension, al-Mu'tadid was already an experienced military commander, having previously campaigned against both the [[Zanj Rebellion|Zanj rebels]] in southern Iraq and the [[Tulunids]] in [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]]. The new caliph immediately strove to reestablish the central government's control over the core provinces of the Abbasid Caliphate, which under his predecessors had slipped into the hands of autonomous governors and rebel groups. Included among his objectives was the resubjugation of al-Jazira, which was a major source of grain for the capital. Toward this end, he personally undertook several campaigns against the various factions in al-Jazira, in an effort to break their hold over the region and force them to recognize his authority.&lt;ref name="Kennedy760"&gt;Kennedy, p. 760&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Mu'tadid's first campaign in al-Jazira, in 893, was directed against the Banu Shayban in the region of the Zab Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 7-8; Ibn al-Athir, p. 374; Weil, p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; In January 895 he again advanced into the province; this time, his intended target was Hamdan ibn Hamdun, due to the latter's association with Harun and the Kharijites. After first battling against some tribal Arabs and Kurds in the region, al-Mu'tadid proceeded toward Hamdan's fortress at [[Mardin]]. Hamdan decided to flee and the defenders quickly surrendered to the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 15-17; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 377; Weil, pp. 489-90&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mu'tadid then returned to Mosul and sent an order to Hamdan to submit to him, but when Hamdan ignored the summons he sent his commanders [[Wasif Mushgir]] and [[Nasr al-Qushuri]] against him. Hamdan's forces were quickly defeated by Wasif and he himself was compelled to flee; eventually, however, he surrendered to the caliph's forces and was put under guard.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 20-22; Ibn al-Athir, p. 379; Weil, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hamdan's surrender, the caliph turned his focus to Harun himself. Nasr al-Qushuri wrote a threatening latter to the Kharijite, in an attempt to convince him to submit; Harun, however, wrote back a defiant response, rejecting Nasr's demands. When al-Mu'tadid was shown the letter, he appointed [[al-Hasan ibn Ali Kurah]] over Mosul and charged him with combatting the Kharijites. After crossing the Zab, al-Hasan encountered Harun and the two armies began a grueling engagement. The battle finally ended in defeat for the Kharijites; Harun fled to the desert and some of his followers surrendered to the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Athir, pp. 380-81; Weil, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 896 al-Mu'tadid again departed for the district of Mosul, in order to campaign against Harun. On this occasion he was joined by Hamdan ibn Hamdun's son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan|al-Husayn]], who had peaceably submitted to the caliph during the latter's struggle against his father. Al-Mu'tadid himself advanced to Takrit, while he dispatched al-Husayn and Wasif Mushgir to pursue Harun. Al-Husayn met the rebel near the Tigris and routed his forces; Harun attempted to flee, but al-Husayn pursued him and eventually caught up to him, together with one hundred of his followers. Despite a plea by Harun to refrain from fighting, al-Husayn ordered his men to attack; the Kharijites were again defeated and Harun himself was captured.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 38: pp. 27-28; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 384-85; al-Mas'udi, v. 8: p. 168; Weil, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Abbasid Caliphate 900.png|thumb|right|300px|The Abbasid Caliphate in 900, after the defeat of the Kharijites. Provinces under the control of al-Mu'tadid are in dark green]]
Al-Husayn brought Harun to al-Mu'tadid, who sent a dispatch announcing the victory to Baghdad. He then marched back to the capital with Harun in custody, reaching it on May 9. To celebrate the capture of the Kharijite, the streets of Baghdad were decorated and the caliph's army was assembled before the city gate. The caliph himself then entered the city and proceeded to his palace. Al-Husayn and other army commanders were rewarded with [[Khalat|robes of honor]], after which they rode in triumph through the city. Harun was put on display; mounted on an elephant, he was forced to sit in a woman's litter and wear humiliating clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, v. 38: p. 29; Ibn al-Athir, p. 385; al-Mas'udi, v. 8: pp. 168-69; Weil, pp. 490-91. Ibn al-Athir claims that Harun was subsequently crucified. Rosenthal, p. 15, however, claims that he survived his capture, and died in prison in ca. 917.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reward for al-Husayn's capture of Harun, al-Mu'tadid agreed to pardon his father Hamdan and release him from custody. Al-Husayn and his brothers were subsequently appointed to various posts, including a number of governorships in al-Jazira. In the following century the Hamdanids succeeded in establishing a de facto independent state in al-Jazira and northern Syria, with al-Husayn's nephews [[Nasir al-Dawla]] and [[Sayf al-Dawla]] ruling over Mosul and [[Aleppo]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Canard, "Hamdanids," pp. 126-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat of the Kharijites, al-Mu'tadid continued his efforts to regain control of al-Jazira. In 899 he captured Amid from [[Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani]],&lt;ref&gt;Canard, "Isa b. al-Shaykh," p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of his reign in 902 most of the province was back under the central government's authority.&lt;ref name="Kennedy760" /&gt; Kharijite rebel activity in the province subsequently tapered off, with only one further revolt in 929 being recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Vaglieri, p. 40; Madelung, p. 767&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Killing Jesus: A History''''' is a 2013 book by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]], referred to in the book as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. It is the follow-up to ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' and ''[[Killing Lincoln]]''. ''Killing Jesus'' was released September 24, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly/1114668114?ean=9780805098549 |title=Killing Jesus: A History |author=Bill O'Reilly |isbn=9780805098549|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Henry Holt and Company]]. The book was a commercial success, debuting at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2013|bestseller list]] and remaining on the list for 52 weeks. Popular reviews of the book were mixed, with both Christian and non-Christian reviewers faulting the book for its tedious writing and its claims of historical objectivity. Scholars and historians have extensively criticized the book for its inaccurate, politically-motivated portrayal of Jesus as a "[[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] Son of God", its uncritical approach to [[primary source]]s, its omission of some of Jesus' teachings, and its oversimplified, sensationalist portrayal of history. Like both its predecessors, the book was adapted into a [[Killing Jesus (miniseries)|television miniseries with the same name]] for [[National Geographic Channel]].

==Writing and research==
According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'', while writing ''Killing Jesus'', O'Reilly and Dugard found that sources were far less plentiful than for the previous books in their ''Killing...'' series.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vernon |first1=Wes |title=BOOK REVIEW: 'Killing Jesus' |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/25/book-review-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=The Washington Times |publisher=The Washington Times, LLC |date=25 September 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the Internet was "a treasure",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; but complained that the information on various websites was "contradictory",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; that "hearsay was often quoted as truth",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; and that information from one website was frequently shown to be unreliable when checked against information from more reliable sources.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; Bill O'Reilly stated that he believes the book was [[divine inspiration|inspired]] by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book begins with "A Note to Readers" by Bill O'Reilly, which promises, "...this is not a religious book. We do not address Jesus the Messiah, only as a man who galvanized a remote area of the Roman Empire and made very powerful enemies while preaching a philosophy of peace and love." After a lengthy quotation from the conservative journalist [[Vermont C. Royster]], the introduction concludes: "But the incredible story behind the lethal struggle between good and evil has not been fully told. Until now." The first chapter begins with a [[novel]]istic description of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] from {{bibleverse|Matthew|2:16–2:18|9}}. The remaining portion of the chapter focusses on [[Herod the Great]], the king of Judaea, the politics of his reign, the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and the birth of Jesus. A lengthy footnote at the end of the chapter defends the historical accuracy of the [[canonical gospels]] and their traditional attributions to [[Matthew the Apostle]], [[John Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist]], and [[John the Apostle]].

The second chapter describes the life of the Roman general and dictator [[Julius Caesar]], his conquests, his seduction by the Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic queen]] [[Cleopatra]], and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his eventual assassination]]. Chapter Three summarizes the aftermath of Caesar's murder, the [[Battle of Philippi]], the [[Second Triumvirate]], the [[Octavian]]'s defeat of [[Mark Antony]] and Cleopatra in the [[Battle of Actium]], and Octavian's ascension to the title of ''[[Roman emperor|emperor]]''. The fourth chapter returns to the life of Jesus, describing his worried parents looking for him after he has gone missing during a trip to [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]]. It describes some of the politics of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]], heavily emphasizing the idea that the Jews were victims of Roman totalitarian oppression. Chapter Five describes the [[finding in the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|Luke|2:41-52|9}}, the architecture of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]], and the government and political background of [[Galilee]].

[[File:Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', who are shown in a [[black and white]] photograph on page 219 of ''Killing Jesus'']]

Chapter Six describes the preaching of [[John the Baptist]], the arrival of [[Pontius Pilate]] in Judaea, the [[baptism of Jesus]], and John the Baptist's arrest. Chapter Seven describes the alleged debaucheries of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] at [[Capri]], described by the Roman historian [[Seutonius]], accepting all of them as historical. Chapter Eight narrates the [[Cleansing of the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|John|2:13-16|9}}, Jesus's meeting with [[Nicodemus]] from {{bibleverse|John|3:1–21|9}}, and the beginning of his ministry. Chapter Nine details the calling of the apostles, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the [[anointing of Jesus]] from {{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|9}}. Following [[Sacred tradition|Catholic tradition]] rather than the gospels, the authors identify the unnamed "sinful woman" in this passage as [[Mary Magdalene]]. The chapter concludes with the [[Beheading of St John the Baptist|beheading of John the Baptist]]. Chapter Ten entails Jesus's conflicts with the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] and concludes with a characterization of [[Judas Iscariot]].

Chapter Eleven describes Pontius Pilate's governance of Judaea and Chapter Twelve [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Jesus's entry to Jerusalem]]. In Chapter Thirteen, Jesus cleanses the Temple again and [[Cursing the fig tree|curses the fig tree]]. In Chapter Fourteen, he [[Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary|goes to the house of Mary and Martha]], proclaims the [[Golden Rule]], tells the Pharisees to "[[Render unto Caesar]]", weeps over Jerusalem, and predicts his own death. Chapter Fifteen has the betrayal of Judas and Chapter Sixteen has the [[Last Supper]], the [[Agony in the Garden]], and the [[arrest of Jesus]]. Chapters Seventeen through Nineteen describe Jesus's [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]]. Chapter Twenty-One has the account of the [[women at the tomb]]. The "Afterward" describes [[Sources for the historicity of Jesus#Non-Christian sources|non-Christian mentions of Jesus]], the [[Apostles#Deaths|fates of the Apostles according to Catholic tradition]], as well as what happened to Tiberius, [[Caligula]], [[Caiaphas]], [[Herod Antipas]], Jerusalem, and the [[History of early Christianity|early Christian movement]].

Upon its publication, ''Killing Jesus'' debuted at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-10-13/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Hardcover : Non-Fiction Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on the list for 52 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/|title=Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Killing Jesus'' surpassed the sales of the book ''[[Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]'' by [[Reza Aslan]], a professor of creative writing, which had been published only a few months before.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt; Of its sales success, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The most popular titles in the Washington area have a distinctly biblical glow: for the second week in a row, ''Killing Jesus'' by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard is No. 1. This is the third in their spectacularly successful assassination series, following ''Killing Kennedy'' and ''Killing Lincoln''."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles |first=Ron |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/10/13/an-answer-to-publishers-prayers/ |title=An answer to publishers’ prayers |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=13 October 2013|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the concurrent popularity of other religion-related books, the article concludes, "Publishers have long known that religion sells. Even in Washington."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Popular reviews===

In its fall books preview, ''[[USA Today]]'' called it "a suspenseful thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/interactive/2764697/ |title=Fall preview: This season's 30 coolest books |website=USA Today |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the book by Erik Wemble in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that ''Killing Jesus'' and its predecessors "may not advance the scholarship on their respective topics, but who'll take issue with millions of Americans getting a quick-read tutorial on history via O’Reilly?"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wemble |first1=Erik |title=Bill O’Reilly and ‘Killing Jesus’: So it is! |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/11/bill-oreilly-and-killing-jesus-so-it-is/?noredirect=on |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=Nash Holdings, LLC |date=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Wemble complained that the book's writing was full of annoying verbal [[tic]]s.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; In particular, Wemble criticizes O'Reilly's constant countdown of how much time the person he is writing about has left to live&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and his use of the phrase "so it is..." at the beginnings of sentences.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble calls the phrase a "a four-word clump of throat-clearing mumbo-jumbo"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and states that another reviewer counted roughly sixteen or so occurrences of it in ''Killing Jesus''.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble speculates that O'Reilly may have intended this phrase as "a retroactive cliché, a little riff that would sound impressive in a book about antiquity."&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt;

In the book, O'Reilly and Dugard state that they are only including events that can be proven as historical fact,&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; a claim which has drawn criticism from both critics of Christianity and evangelical Christians.&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A 2013 review by Dan Delzell for ''[[The Christian Post]]'' criticizes this statement for implying that not everything in the gospels can be proven as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delzell |first1=Dan |date=1 October 2013|title=Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing Jesus' Spiritualizes the Historical Christ |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/bill-oreillys-killing-jesus-spiritualizes-the-historical-christ-105658/ |website=The Christian Post |publisher=Christian Media Corp. |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the reviewer insists that everything in the gospel accounts is demonstrably factual and that O'Reilly's selective omission of stories found in the gospels from his book is tantamount to "cut[ting] Christ in half."&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A review by Tim Chaffey from [[Answers in Genesis]] criticizes the book for deliberately omitting several of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus's miracles]] and glossing over others.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaffey |first1=Tim |date=20 November 2013|title=''Killing Jesus: A History'' by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard |url=https://answersingenesis.org/reviews/books/killing-jesus-a-history-by-bill-oreilly-and-martin-dugard/ |website=''answersingenesis.com'' |publisher=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticized the book for its "graphic description of sexual activity"&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt; and for portraying [[Mary Magdalene]] as a repentant prostitute, an idea that is not based on the Bible.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt;

In an article for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[Robert M.

[[Candida Moss]], a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the [[University of Notre Dame]], criticizes the book for its many historical inaccuracies in two articles written in September and October 2013 for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' and [[CNN]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moss |first1=Candida |title=Five things Bill O'Reilly flubs in ''Killing Jesus'' |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/04/five-things-bill-oreilly-gets-wrong-in-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=CNN Belief Blog |publisher=Cable News Network |date=4 October 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss states that, although O'Reilly and Dugard do attempt to separate between fact and fiction, they do so inconsistently and accordingly to their previously held beliefs.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; In her ''Daily Beast'' article, she states: "...without a method, ''Killing Jesus'' has all the critical rigor of your local church's [[Nativity play]]."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; She notes that O'Reilly and Dugard accept late, unsubstantiated legends about the fates of the apostles after the period covered by the New Testament as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They also uncritically accept the legend formalized in the fifth century by [[Pope Gregory I]] about Mary Magdalene having previously been a prostitute, which is not supported by the New Testament or any early Christian writings,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but ignore the statement actually recorded in the gospels that Mary Magdalene was one of the people funding Jesus's ministry.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They include statements from John the Baptist accusing tax collectors of overcharging people,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but omit all reference to Jesus's repeated injunctions to "support the poor, orphans, and widows"&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; as well as to the saying, "whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise" ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:11|9}}).&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

[[File:Rubens tribute money.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Tribute Money (Rubens)|The Tribute Money]]'' (1612–1614) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. One of many recurring criticisms of the book is its portrayal of the [[Pharisees]] as what [[Candida Moss]] calls "self-righteous bloviators", a view which is no longer supported by mainstream scholars.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;]]

In her CNN article, Moss cites the example of how they omit the line "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", which {{bibleverse||Luke|23:34|9}} attributes to Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|as he was being crucified]], because, as O'Reilly later said in a [[CBS]] interview, it is impossible to speak audibly while a person is being crucified.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She then points out that they chose ''not'' to omit the line "It is finished", also attributed to Jesus while he was on the cross, in {{bibleverse||John|19:30|9}}.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss suggests that perhaps "there [is just] something about the word 'forgiveness' that sticks in [their throats]".&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also criticizes them for taking everything written by Roman historians like [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] completely at face value, as though these writers were totally unbiased.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also particularly criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard's portrayal of the Pharisees as "self-righteous bloviators",&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; stating that modern Biblical scholars no longer view them this way,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; and that this portrayal is, ironically, based more on the stereotype of Roman Catholics promoted by [[Protestants]] during the [[Reformation]] and [[Early Modern Period]] than on actual ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

Moss states that ''Killing Jesus'''s description of the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] converting to "Christianity" is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]]&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; because, at the time, Christianity was still a Jewish sect and the word "Christian" was not even coined until near the end of the first century.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Instead, she says "the first generation of Jesus' followers lived and died as Jews."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss also notes O'Reilly and Dugard's unusual interpretations of various passages,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; such as {{bibleverse||Luke|3:17|9}}, which O'Reilly and Dugard apparently interpret to mean that [[John the Baptist]] told the Pharisees that they will either "burn ''or'' be condemned to Hell."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She concludes: "Apart from the methodological problems, the entire book is written in the style of a novel, not a history book. We hear the thoughts of Herod as he orders the execution of the male children of Bethlehem, for instance. It's entertaining, but it's historical fan fiction, not history."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

In an article from November 2013, Joel L. Watts, author of ''Mimetic Criticism and the Gospel of Mark'', calls ''Killing Jesus'' nothing more than "an attempt at agenda-driven drivel produced for the lowest common denominator."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Joel L. |date=25 November 2013|title=Review of Killing Jesus: A History |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-l-watts/review-of-killing-jesus_b_3984134.html |work=HuffPost |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "I wish I had my day back."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; In addition to raising many of the same accuracy concerns as Moss, Watts also criticizes the book for imputing post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of [[individualism]] to ancient Galileean Jews&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and for referring to the [[Sadducees]] (who believed that the [[Torah]] was the only authoritative scripture and opposed the more progressive theology promoted by the Pharisees) as "liberals".&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He also criticizes a statement that the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] had been established "500 years" before Jesus, when, in reality, many of the books in the Hebrew Bible were not written until after that point&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and the canon of the Hebrew Bible was still debated long after Jesus's death.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; Watts accuses the authors of being arrogant and dismissive of the opinions of actual experts.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He determines that "they destroy context and literary construction to, and I can only assume this based on the evidence of reading the book, hide the actual message of the Gospels."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;

[[File:Tea Party - Pennsylvania Avenue.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Numerous scholars have criticized ''Killing Jesus'' for its anachronistic portrayal of Jesus as an advocate of "smaller government and lower taxes" similar to the supporters of the United States [[Tea Party movement]] (''protest pictured''), rather than the first-century Galilean Jew he really was.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;]]

A December 2013 review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by Selina O'Grady, author of ''And Man Created God: Kings, Cults, and Conquests at the Time of Jesus'', remarks that, "Everyone creates God in their own image, so it's not surprising that [[Fox News|Fox television]]'s aggressively conservative down-home-let's-hear-it-for-the-ordinary-guy talk show host should have created a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] son of God. Jesus, the little guy, is an enemy of the big corrupt tax-oppressing [[Roman empire]], which is itself just a version of [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]], only even more venal and sexually depraved. This Jesus is a tax-liberating rebel who incurs the wrath of the Jewish and Roman powers by threatening their joint fleecing of the people. As a member of the populist right, he is not, of course, in favour of redistribution: Bill O'Reilly's Jesus does not tell the rich to give away their money to the poor."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Grady|first=Selina|title=Killing Jesus: A History by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard – review: The right-wing talk show host gives us salacious gossip, gory details and a Tea Party Son of God|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/18/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly-review|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticizes ''Killing Jesus'' for its "bodice-ripping treatment of history",&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; stating that the book oversimplifies, sensationalizes, and misrepresents the historical events it purports to describe.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; According to O'Grady, ''Killing Jesus'' presents the Romans, Jewish elites, and Pharisees as categorically "bad" and "ordinary Jews" as "good", without any background or nuance.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; O'Grady also criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard for relying almost entirely on the gospels&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ignoring the centuries' worth of books written by Biblical scholars about the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

During a Q&amp;A session following a 2014 lecture at [[Dickinson College]] on "Jesus and the Historian", [[Bart D. Ehrman]], James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], laughed at his own mention of ''Killing Jesus'', commenting "Bill O'Reilly! ''There's'' a source you trust about the historical Jesus. Hah! Aye yai yai."&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ehrman |first1=Bart D. |author-link=Bart D.

Ehrman |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2016 book ''Jesus Before the Gospels'', Ehrman was less overtly hostile, merely commenting that O'Reilly is "obviously... not a New Testament scholar."&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ehrman |first1=Bart D. |title=Jesus Before the Gospels: How the Earliest Christians Remembered, Changed, and Invented their Stories of the Savior |date=2016 |publisher=HarperOne |location=New York City, New York |isbn=978-0-06-228520-1 |page=22 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the lecture and the book, Ehrman implicitly criticizes O'Reilly's portrayal of the historical Jesus as an advocate of "smaller government and lower taxes."&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt; In the book, though, he adds, "It is easy to see how this view of Jesus might resonate with a wide swath of our population today."&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt;

[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] picked up the television adaptation of ''Killing Jesus'', just as it had for ''[[Killing Lincoln]]'' and ''[[Killing Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nat Geo Adapting Bill O’Reilly’s 'Killing Jesus'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nat-geo-adapting-bill-o-430662|first=Michael|last=O'Connell|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, it was announced ''Killing Jesus'' was being adapted into a four-hour miniseries, and [[Walon Green]] has been tapped to write and executive produce the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/03/national-geographics-killing-jesus-to-expand-to-4-hours-walon-green-to-write-701056/|title=National Geographic’s ‘Killing Jesus’ To Expand To 4 Hours, Walon Green To Write| first=Nellie| last=Andreeva| website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also returning as executive producers are [[Ridley Scott]], [[David W.

In August 2014, [[Christopher Menaul]] was attached to direct the miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/christopher-menaul-to-direct-killing-jesus-mini-for-nat-geo-ridley-scott-815800/|title=Christopher Menaul To Direct 'Killing Jesus' For Nat Geo &amp; Ridley Scott|author=The Deadline Team|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its premiere airing, the film was watched by 3.7 million viewers, averaging a 1.0 rating among adults in the 25-54 demographic. The viewership surpassed the record previously held by ''[[Killing Kennedy (film)|Killing Kennedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/killing-jesus-nabs-nat-geo-785319 | title='Killing Jesus' Nabs Nat Geo Ratings Record With 3.7 Million Viewers | last=O'Connell | first=Michael | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=March 30, 2015 | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maglio2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/killing-jesus-national-geogaphic-channel-tv-ratings-killing-kennedy/ | title='Killing Jesus' Slays Nat Geo Record With 3.7 Million Viewers | last=Maglio | first=Tony | publisher=[[TheWrap]] | date=March 30, 2015 | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on ''[[Yahoo TV]]'' by Ken Tucker said of the film, "Rendered without much embellishment and acted with firmly controlled vigor, ''[[Killing Jesus (film)|Killing Jesus]]'', a TV adaptation of the bestselling book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, is a fine retelling of the story of Jesus Christ as a historical figure.

A review by Neil Genzlinger in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, panned the film,&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Genzlinger |first1=Neil |title=Review: 'Killing Jesus,' Biblical Tale Retold, Softer on Its Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/television/review-killing-jesus-biblical-tale-retold-softer-on-its-politics.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 March 2015 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring, "It's a costume pageant devoid both of the reverence that has made some previous film versions work and of the intrigue that might provide a secular ''[[Game of Thrones]]''-like appeal. More effort went into the jewelry and headwear than into the storytelling."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt; The same review compared the miniseries unfavorably with the book, stating, "The book tried to put Jesus' story in the broader context of the politics and practices of the day, but here the account is largely pared down to the biblical rendition, with Jesus casting out a demon, preventing the stoning of a woman accused of adultery and delivering the touchstone teachings that all Christians know by heart."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt;

A '''laptop battle''' is a competitive event for an [[electronic musician]] to match their skills against others. Competition rules limit equipment to a [[laptop computer]] and an external [[pointing device]] ([[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]). Some competitions allow external hardware, usually a single [[MIDI controller]] (this set-up is very similar to those used for [[live PA]]). There are typically three or four rounds, following a single elimination bracket or similar structure. Each round consists of a number of head-to-head matches between two randomly selected participants. Rules vary, but typically the competitors are allowed two to three minutes on stage to play their individual compositions. Stage presence is often a key element for judging, in addition to technical finesse and an ability to engage the audience.

A panel of judges decide which contestant advances to the next round, single elimination style. Usually, there are no restrictions on the type of material performed other than it must be the competitor's original creation. This aids in providing a distinction from DJ battles, wherein competitors play music created by others. Musical genres vary widely, with tendencies towards [[intelligent dance music]], [[Glitch (music)|glitch]], experimental [[electronica]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]], [[House music|house]], and [[Power noise|technoid]].

Various local and national laptop battles have garnered the attention of electronic music and sound design production sponsors, such as [[Ableton]], [[Mackie]], and [[Native Instruments]]. Sponsor products are often included in competition prizes. Laptop Battles are becoming a worldwide phenomenon with battles organized in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, and Italy.

== Formats ==

All formats vary in length of rounds (usually 2–3 minutes) and competition bracket style (single or double elimination). Some battles also include alternating sets by each performer, such as two 2-minute sets each. Mouse and keyboard rules may vary as well, and sometimes will allow for a USB version of the peripheral if the on-board peripheral is disabled or unused on the laptop.

===Laptop only===

This format was used in the 2006 Atlanta Laptop Battle I, II, and III.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070825152852/http://www.zeroplate.com/laptop/2005/09/battle-one.html]

This format only allows the following equipment:
*One laptop
*One external sound card

===Single MIDI controller===

This format was used for the 2006 US National Finals,[http://www.laptopbattle.org/index.php?x=RULES] the 2006 Atlanta Laptop Battle Finals, and the Laptop Battle UK competitions.

This format has the following restrictions:
*One laptop computer
*One external sound card
*One [[MIDI controller]]
*All equipment must fit in a 2' x 2' square

===Exhibition matches===

This format was featured in the 2007 Atlanta Preliminaries I Laptop Battle.[https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3739648805299846529&amp;postID=7069418744439527380] It involves two competitors not included in the single- or double-elimination tournament structure, and may include more experienced performers or the judges from the ongoing laptop battle. This format is unique in that the actual sonic material utilized in the battle is limited, and performers have a limited amount of time to create their pieces.

This format has the following restrictions:
*One laptop computer
*One external sound card
*One MIDI controller
*All equipment must fit in a 2' x 2' square
*Preparation is limited to a specific window of time before the match
*Source material is limited to supplied samples, which are not available to the performers until the preparation window

The '''Lithuanian Crusade''' was a series of campaigns by the [[Teutonic Order]] and the [[Livonian Order]], two crusading [[military order (society)|military order]]s, to convert the pagan [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] into [[Roman Catholicism]]. The Livonian Order settled in [[Riga]] in 1202 and the Teutonic Order arrived to [[Culmerland]] in 1230s. They first conquered other neighboring [[Baltic tribes]] – [[Curonians]], [[Semigallians]], [[Latgalians]], [[Selonians]], [[Old Prussians]] (see [[Livonian Crusade]] and [[Prussian Crusade]]). The first raid against the [[Lithuanians]] and [[Samogitia]]ns was in 1208 and the Orders played a key role in Lithuanian politics, but they were not a direct and immediate threat until 1280s. By that time the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was already an established state and could offer organized defense. Thus for the next hundred years the Knights organized annual destructive ''reise'' (raids) into the Samogitian and Lithuanian lands but without great success: border regions in Samogitia and [[Suvalkija]] became sparsely inhabited wilderness, but the Order gained very little territory. The Grand Duchy finally [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted to Christianity in 1386]], when Grand Duke [[Jogaila]] accepted baptism from Poland before his wedding to reigning [[Jadwiga of Poland|Queen Jadwiga]] and coronation as [[Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|King of Poland]]. However, the baptism did not stop the crusade as the Order publicly challenged sincerity of the conversion at the Papal court. Lithuania, together with its new powerful ally Poland, defeated the Order in the decisive [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410, which is often cited as the end of the Lithuanian Crusade. The final peace was reached by the [[Treaty of Melno]] (1422).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8846">The '''Lithuanian Liberty League''' or '''LLL''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos laisvės lyga}}) was a [[Soviet dissidents|dissident organization]] in the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and a political party in independent [[Republic of Lithuania]]. Established as an underground resistance group in 1978, LLL was headed by [[Antanas Terleckas]].&lt;ref name=kace/&gt; Pro-independence LLL published anti-Soviet literature and organized protest rallies. While it enjoyed limited popularity in 1987–1989, it grew increasingly irrelevant after the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|independence declaration in 1990]].&lt;ref name=v112/&gt; It registered as a political party in November 1995&lt;ref name=buga/&gt; and participated in parliamentary elections without gaining any seats in the [[Seimas]].

==First political rallies==
[[File:Vilnius St Anns church.jpg|thumb|Square next to the [[St. Anne's Church, Vilnius|St. Anne's Church]], where the first protest took place on 23 August 1987]]
[[File:Lithuania Vilnius Maironio gatve.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to the protest of 23 August 1987]]
On 23 August 1987, the 48th anniversary of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], LLL organized the first anti-Soviet rally that was not forcibly dispersed by the police.&lt;ref name=kace/&gt; The event tested the limits of ''[[glastnost]]'' and other liberal Soviet reforms and is often cited as one of the first signs of the Lithuanian independence movement. The rally took place near [[St. Anne's Church, Vilnius]] and attracted some 500&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;–1,000&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; participants. While the police monitored the event and reportedly [[KGB]] agents took pictures and video of the protesters, the speakers were not interrupted.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Demands raised at the event included publication of the Pact, [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] of [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania|those deported into Siberia]], and greater rights to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]], the official Soviet news agency, labeled the event as a "hate rally" and participants as "aggressive extremists."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Other major rallies took place on February 16, 1988, the anniversary of the [[Act of Independence of Lithuania]], and on other sensitive dates from the [[history of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=ivas/&gt;

==Removal of Songaila==
On 28 September 1988, the League organized an unsanctioned rally to commemorate the [[German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation]] in the [[Cathedral Square, Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Activists of more moderate reform movement [[Sąjūdis]] clearly distanced themselves from the event. The protesters were met by police and security forces from [[Minsk]].&lt;ref name=l155/&gt; The peaceful protest soon broke out into a 3-hour riot. The protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, which responded by employing batons. Around 25 people were arrested. When the police suddenly left the scene, the peaceful protest continued for another hour and a half.&lt;ref name=l155&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In the early morning of September 29, policemen beat and arrested a group of dissidents on a [[hunger strike]] near [[Vilnius Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=l157&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The group, under leadership of Algimantas Andreika, protested the treatment of political prisoners. Outraged by such an unprovoked attack, LLL organized a follow-up rally the same day.&lt;ref name=l157/&gt; Activists of Sąjūdis, including its leader [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], not only participated in the rally but also aggressively questioned the Soviet authorities how such an incident fit into the official program of ''[[glastnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that Sąjūdis actively supported and advocated on behalf of LLL. The arrested people were released the same day. In the following weeks the activists called for the resignation of [[Ringaudas Songaila]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), pp. 163, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The calls reached Moscow, which approved Songaila's replacement with [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] on October 19, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with Sąjūdis==
Due to LLL's uncompromising agenda of full independence,&lt;ref name=v111/&gt; the organization did not enjoy widespread support among the skeptic Lithuanian society.&lt;ref name=v110/&gt; More prominent scientists, artists, and other activists joined [[Sąjūdis]] reform movement, which had more moderate agenda and was established with permission from the Soviet authorities. The relationship between the two organizations was complex. While both organizations shared similar goals, LLL was more willing to confront and Sąjūdis preferred to compromise.

In the public opinion, dissidents were discredited, brought fear of arrest or other persecution, and were seen as people without a future.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinavičius (2008), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of LLL saved Sąjūdis from the "extremist" label.&lt;ref name=v110&gt;Vardys (1997), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a violent suppression of one of the LLL's rallies, both organizations grew closer together. When Sąjūdis opted for open membership, dissidents were free to join its ranks and in fact became its left wing.&lt;ref&gt;Senn (1995), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The League played an important role by marking all more sensitive dates from the [[history of Lithuania]] with protest rallies or declarations thus stirring up suppressed collective memory and revising [[Soviet propaganda|official Soviet versions]] of the events.&lt;ref name=budr/&gt; It also helped to radicalize the independence movement, hastening political reforms and declaration of independence.&lt;ref name=v112&gt;Vardys (1997), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brown described her background in her 1997 autobiography, ''Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Madeline Duncan|title=Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson|year=1997|publisher=Conservatory Press|isbn=9780941401067}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, she was raised in a middle-class Catholic household in [[Dallas, Texas]], where her father was a utility company supervisor and her mother was a housewife.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She stated that she attended [[W. H. Adamson High School]].&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Brown said at the age of 19 she married James Glynn Brown, a [[childhood sweetheart]] and neighborhood [[soda jerk]], whom she divorced in 1955.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man claims to be son of Johnson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EiNDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xawMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3426%2C5635046|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=Altus Times|date=June 19, 1987|agency=UPI|location=Altus, Oklahoma|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Victoria Advocate"/&gt; She described her husband as a veteran of the [[United States Marine Corps]] whose "war experiences had shattered his nerves, and turned him into a hopeless, physically abusive drunkard".&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Brown said that he "was eventually institutionalized in a veteran's hospital for 'chronic paranoid schizophrenia'".&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; According to Brown, she left her husband in 1948 while he was in the hospital, returning to Dallas with her two-month-old son, Jimmy Glynn Brown.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Victoria Advocate"/&gt; She said that she was subsequently hired that same year by [[Glenn Advertising]] and was promoted to [[media buyer]] whose responsibilities including purchasing [[radio advertising]] time.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

==Initial allegations: affair with LBJ==
On November 5, 1982, Brown spoke at a [[news conference]] held at the [[Dallas Press Club]], alleging that she had an extramarital relationship with Johnson for almost twenty years.&lt;ref name=Harlan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; She said that the affair began in 1948 after a party at the [[Adolphus Hotel]] in Dallas and lasted until 1967.&lt;ref name=Harlan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' also published the allegations under the headline "Dallas Woman Claims She Was LBJ's Lover", noting that spokespeople for [[Lady Bird Johnson]] and the Johnson family rejected the claims.&lt;ref name=Harlan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; Brown's statement, in which she said she wanted to "clear the record", came three weeks after published reports of an affair between Johnson and Alice Glass.&lt;ref name=Harlan/&gt;

==Paternity suit and subsequent allegations: Child with LBJ==

===Paternity suit filed===
On June 18, 1987, Brown's second son, Steven Mark Brown (December 27, 1950 - September 28, 1990), filed a $10.5 million lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in a [[Texas District Courts|Texas district court]] alleging that the former [[first lady]] and two friends of President Johnson, Jesse Kellam of Austin and Jerome T. Ragsdale of Dallas, had conspired to deprive him of a share of the Johnson estate.&lt;ref name="Altus Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Victoria Advocate"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Jesse "J.C."

===Interview with ''People'' magazine ===
The August 5, 1987 issue of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine detailed additional claims made by Madeleine and Steven Brown.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;

In the 1940s, the Johnsons owned a radio station in Austin, [[KLBJ-AM|KTBC]], run by Jesse Kellam.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wheeler/&gt; Madeleine Brown claimed that she attended a KTBC reception in 1948 while working for a Dallas advertising agency and was introduced to Johnson through Kellam.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She reported that Johnson flirted with her during this initial encounter and that she was "dazzled" by him.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; According to Brown, Kellam immediately asked her to another reception three weeks later at the Adolphus Hotel.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; It was at that meeting, she said, that her long affair with Johnson began after he invited her up to his apartment in the hotel.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Brown said that Johnson insisted the affair be kept secret, and she alleged that Kellam functioned as a go-between who arranged for Johnson and her to meet.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; ''People'' magazine reported that she claimed her relationship with Johnson was "[[physical intimacy|purely physical]]" and had discovered that he had other mistresses.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; According to Brown, she told Johnson in April 1950 that she was pregnant and he assured her he would provide for her needs.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She claimed that Kellam told her a few days later that she would be contacted by attorney Jerome Ragsdale.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Brown alleged that after the birth of Steven in 1950, Ragsdale provided her with "a six-room house for $15,000, complete with a live-in maid", and paid the various charge cards he supplied to her.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She said her physician told her that he would note her husband, James Glynn Brown, as the father.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;

According to Brown, she continued to meet with Johnson throughout the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She told ''People'' that for five years, at Kellam's urging, she had a "[[sham marriage|paper marriage]]" to a Dallas businessman with whom she never lived.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She said that years after they divorced, she was told by a friend that the man had committed suicide.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; According to Brown, she was on her way to see Johnson in Austin when she heard about the assassination of Kennedy over the radio, then turned around.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She said that a few weeks later Kellam instructed her to meet the new President of the United States in their usual place.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Brown told ''People'' that her sexual relationship with Johnson abruptly ended in 1967 after she was badly injured in a car accident in which her son, Steven, was at the wheel.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; She said she had one last meeting with Johnson in 1969 at the [[Shamrock Hotel]] in [[Houston, Texas]], in which they had a two-hour discussion which she described as their first "real conversation".&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Brown said that in 1973 Kellam telephoned her to say that Johnson had died.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;

Brown stated that she was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack in February 1987 and, expecting to die, called Steven to her [[deathbed confession|bedside in order to confess]] hiding the true identity of his father from him.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; According to ''People'', despite the name of his mother's first husband on his birth certificate, Steven had been "wracked by uncertainty" about who was his true father and "had come to suspect a lawyer friend of the family was actually his father".&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Steven's mother said that she had no love letters from Johnson and that the few people who could corroborate her story were dead.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; According to Brown, she came forward with the paternity claim to assist Steven in claiming his inheritance.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; Discussing the purpose of the lawsuit, Steven said: "In a public forum, sooner or later the truth comes out. That's what's important to me. I want my last name changed to Johnson, the way it ought to be."&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt; He maintained that he wanted money from the former first lady in order to provide for two nephews.&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;

Shortly after the interview, entertainment writer [[Harry Haun]] said that Brown's claims in ''People'' "stirred up such a hornet's nest of book publishers and movie producers that the woman will indeed write a book about".&lt;ref name=Haun&gt;{{cite news|last=Haun|first=Harry|title=Cool Theaters Can't Offset Trashy Movies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gkNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8wIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7031%2C5788549|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The Blade|date=August 5, 1987|location=Toledo, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haun wrote that literary agent [[Scott Meredith]] had been enlisted to handle the book and film rights.&lt;ref name=Haun/&gt;

===Paternity suit dismissed===
In 1989, Steven Brown's suit against Lady Bird Johnson was dismissed after he failed to show in court.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaver County Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=General Who Helped Build Nuclear Force|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8bUiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2354%2C156754|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=Beaver County Times|date=October 2, 1990|agency=AP|location=Beaver, Pennsylvania|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1990, at age 39,&lt;ref name="Beaver County Times"/&gt; from [[lymphatic cancer]].&lt;ref name=Brower/&gt;

==Later allegations: LBJ and the assassination of JFK==
After the paternity claims, Brown made other allegations suggesting that there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, including the charge that Johnson had foreknowledge of a plot.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benson|first=Michael |title=Who's Who in the JFK Assassination: An A-to-Z Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YovjRf2NYQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003|origyear=1993 |publisher=Citadel Press Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8065-1444-2 |pages=61, 223, 491 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabinowitz|first=Dorothy|title=Character Assassination|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB107714336725933104?mod=googlewsj|accessdate=February 6, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 19, 2004|authorlink=Dorothy Rabinowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, she briefly appeared in investigative columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]'s syndicated program, ''American Expose: Who Murdered JFK'', and said: "In the fall of 1963 I was in the Carousel Club with other advertising people, and [[Jack Ruby]] was saying that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] had been in the club and he had been bragging that he had taken a shot at Major General [[Edwin Walker]]".&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Interviews with Brown implicating Johnson also appeared in an episode of ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' in February 1992, and in a 2003 episode of Nigel Turner's documentary ''[[The Men Who Killed Kennedy]]'', titled "The Guilty Men."&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt;

Brown claimed to have been present at a party in [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]]'s Dallas home on the evening prior to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] that was attended by Johnson as well as other famous, wealthy, and powerful individuals including, [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[H. L. Hunt]], [[George R. Brown|George Brown]], and [[John J. McCloy|John McCloy]].&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; According to Brown, Johnson had a meeting with several of the men after which he told her: "After tomorrow, those goddamn Kennedys will never embarrass me again. That's no threat. That's a promise."&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, Madeleine D. 1997 p. 166"&gt;Brown, Madeleine D.

''Assassination Science'', (Chicago: Catfeet Press, 1998), pp. 368-369. {{ISBN|0-8126-9366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brown said that on New Year's Eve 1963, she met with Lyndon Johnson at the [[Driskill Hotel]] in [[Austin, Texas]], and that Johnson confirmed the conspiracy to kill Kennedy, insisting that "Texas oil and ... renegade intelligence bastards in Washington" had been responsible.&lt;ref name="Brown, Madeleine D. 1997 p. 189"&gt;Brown, Madeleine D. (1997), ''Texas in the Morning: The Love Story of Madeleine Brown and President Lyndon Baines Johnson'', Conservatory Press, p. 189. {{ISBN|0-941401-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nigel. The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 9, "The Guilty Men", 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown alleged that Johnson did not attempt to stop the assassination because he hated Kennedy and had an intense desire to be President.&lt;ref name="Benson"/&gt; Brown also said that she witnessed Oswald meeting with Ruby in the Carousel Club prior to the assassination, but did not specify how long before the assassination this meeting had occurred.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

In the years following Brown's allegations, her story has received national attention and several conspiracy authors have cited her claims as evidence of a conspiracy in the case of the JFK assassination.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;

==Allegations challenged==
In November 2012, ''The Dallas Morning News'' published an article by [[Hugh Aynesworth]] describing David Perry's efforts to disprove Brown's allegations.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; Perry, a former [[insurance investigator]] turned conspiracy [[debunker]], had placed his investigation of her claims on his website in an article entitled "Texas in the Imagination" the previous month.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Dave|title=Texas in the &lt;s&gt;Morning&lt;/s&gt; Imagination|url=http://dperry1943.com/browns.html|work=dperry1943.com/|accessdate=February 6, 2013|date=October 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Perry, he and his wife met Brown at a social function a few years after she made her original allegations as to the JFK assassination but did not find her story to be believable.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; He said he initially decided to investigate Brown's conspiracy claim of Johnson and other notable individuals attending a party at Murchison's house.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; Perry pointed to evidence placing key figures outside of Dallas on the evening of November 21, 1963, including Johnson (with Kennedy in Houston and in Fort Worth), Murchison (in East Texas), and Hoover (in Washington, D.C.).&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; He said that while Nixon was in Dallas at that time, a writer for ''The Dallas Morning News'' had placed him at a bottlers convention in the downtown area.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;

Investigating the paternity claims of Brown and her son, Perry found a report of the son's dismissed lawsuit against Lady Bird Johnson in ''The Dallas Morning News'' as well as information indicating a prior conviction for Brown on forgery charges.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt; In 1989, Brown was convicted of forging the will of an elderly relative, who had died the previous year, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name=Aynesworth/&gt;&lt;ref name="BROWN v.

The '''Nine Years' War''' (1688–97)—often called the '''War of the Grand Alliance''' or the '''War of the League of Augsburg'''&lt;ref&gt;Older texts may refer to the war as the '''War of the Palatine Succession''', the '''War of the English Succession''', or in North American historiography as '''King William's War'''. This varying nomenclature reflects the fact that contemporaries – as well as later historians – viewed the general conflict from particular national or dynastic viewpoints.&lt;/ref&gt;—was a conflict between Louis XIV of France and a European coalition of the Holy Roman Empire (led by Austria), the Dutch Republic, Spain, England and Savoy.  It was fought in Europe and the surrounding seas, North America and in India. It is sometimes considered the first [[global war]]. The conflict encompassed the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] and [[Jacobite risings]] in Scotland, where [[William III of England|William III]] and [[James II of England|James II]] struggled for control of England and Ireland, and a campaign in colonial North America between French and English settlers and their respective Indigenous allies, today called '''[[King William's War]]''' by Americans.

[[Louis XIV of France]] had emerged from the [[Franco-Dutch War]] in 1678 as the most powerful monarch in Europe, an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] ruler who had won numerous military victories. Using a combination of aggression, annexation, and quasi-legal means, Louis XIV set about extending his gains to stabilize and strengthen France's frontiers, culminating in the brief [[War of the Reunions]] (1683–84). The [[Truce of Ratisbon]] guaranteed France's new borders for twenty years, but Louis XIV's subsequent actions—notably his [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (the revocation of the Edict of Nantes) in 1685— led to the deterioration of his military and political dominance. Louis XIV's decision to cross the [[Rhine]] in September 1688 was designed to extend his influence and pressure the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into accepting his territorial and dynastic claims. Leopold I and the German princes resolved to resist, and when the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and William III brought the Dutch and the English into the war against France, the French King faced a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing his ambitions.

The main fighting took place around France's borders in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Rhineland]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and [[Catalonia]]. The fighting generally favoured Louis XIV's armies, but by 1696 his country was in the grip of an economic crisis. The Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic) were also financially exhausted, and when Savoy defected from the Alliance, all parties were keen to negotiate a settlement. By the terms of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) Louis XIV retained the whole of [[Alsace]] but was forced to return [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to its ruler and give up any gains on the right bank of the Rhine. Louis XIV also accepted William III as the rightful King of England, while the Dutch acquired a Barrier fortress system in the Spanish Netherlands to help secure their borders. With the ailing and childless [[Charles II of Spain]] approaching his end, a new conflict over the inheritance of the [[Spanish Empire]] embroiled Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

==Background 1678–87==
In the years following the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78) [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France – now at the height of his powers – sought to impose religious unity in France, and to solidify and expand his frontiers. Louis XIV had already won his personal glory by conquering new territory, but he was no longer willing to pursue an open-ended militarist policy of the kind he had undertaken in 1672, and instead relied upon France's clear military superiority to achieve specific strategic objectives along his borders. Proclaimed the 'Sun King', a more mature Louis – conscious he had failed to achieve decisive results against the Dutch – had turned from conquest to security, using threats rather than open war to intimidate his neighbours into submission.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV, along with his chief advisor [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], his foreign minister [[Charles Colbert, marquis de Croissy|Colbert de Croissy]], and his technical expert, [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], developed France's defensive strategy.&lt;ref name=lynn37&gt;Lynn, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Vauban had advocated a system of impregnable fortresses along the frontier that would keep France's enemies out. To construct a proper system, however, the King needed to acquire more land from his neighbours to form a solid forward line. This rationalisation of the frontier would make it far more defensible while defining it more clearly in a political sense, yet it also created the paradox that while Louis's ultimate goals were defensive, he pursued them by hostile means.&lt;ref name=lynn37/&gt; The King grabbed the necessary territory through what is known as the ''[[War of the Reunions|Réunions]]'': a strategy that combined legalism, arrogance, and aggression.&lt;ref name=lynn161&gt;Lynn, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reunions===
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Retrato equestre de Luís XIV, Rei de França.jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian Portrait of Louis XIV (1638–1715) by [[René-Antoine Houasse]]. The 'Sun King' was the most powerful monarch in Europe.]]

The [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678) and the earlier [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648) provided Louis XIV with the justification for the Reunions. These treaties had awarded France territorial gains, but because of the vagaries of the language (as with most treaties of the period) they were notoriously imprecise and self-contradictory, and never specified exact boundary lines. This imprecision often led to differing interpretations of the text resulting in long-standing disputes over the frontier zones – one gained a town or area and its 'dependencies', but it was often unclear what these dependencies were.&lt;ref name=lynn37/&gt; The machinery needed to determine these territorial ambiguities was already in place through the medium of the [[Parlement]]s at [[Metz]] (technically the only '[[Chambers of Reunion|Chamber of Reunion]]'), [[Parlement of Besançon|Besançon]], and a superior court at [[Breisach]], dealing respectively with [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], [[Franche-Comté]], and [[Alsace]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 499. Although not technically belonging to France, Louis XIV had integrated Lorraine into his kingdom after occupying it in 1670.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, these courts usually found in Louis XIV's favour.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France – Old Regime France,'' 182&lt;/ref&gt; By 1680 the disputed [[County of Montbéliard]] (lying between Franche-Comté and Alsace) had been separated from the [[History of Württemberg|Duchy of Württemberg]], and by August, Louis XIV had secured the whole of Alsace with the exception of [[Strasbourg]]. The Chamber of Reunion of Metz soon laid claims to land around the [[Three Bishoprics]] of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and most of the Spanish [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]. The fortress of [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] itself was subsequently blockaded with the intention of it becoming part of Louis XIV's defensible frontier.&lt;ref name="childs11"&gt;Childs (1991), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.png|thumb|upright|left|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I (1640–1705), artist unknown]]

On 30 September 1681, French troops also seized Strasbourg and its outpost, [[Kehl]], on the right bank of the [[Rhine]], a bridge which Holy Roman Empire ("Imperial") troops had regularly exploited during the latter stages of the Dutch War.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; By forcibly taking the Imperial city the French now controlled two of the three bridgeheads over the Rhine (the others being Breisach, which was already in French hands, and [[Philippsburg]], which Louis XIV had lost by the Treaty of Nijmegen). On the same day that Strasbourg fell French forces marched into [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was not taken through the process of the Reunions but had earlier been purchased from the [[Ferdinand Charles, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat|Duke of Mantua]], which, together with the French possession of [[Pinerolo]], enabled France to tie down Victor Amadeus II, the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]], and threaten the Spanish [[Duchy of Milan]] (''see map below'').&lt;ref&gt;Piedmont was now hemmed in by two massive French-occupied fortresses: Casale on the eastern flank, and, on its western edge, Pinerolo, annexed by France fifty years earlier in defiance of the 1631 [[Treaty of Cherasco]].&lt;/ref&gt; All Reunion claims and annexations were important strategic points of entry and exit between France and its neighbours, and all were immediately fortified by Vauban and incorporated into his fortress system.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Reunions were carving territory from the frontiers of future Germany, while annexations were establishing French power in Italy. Yet by seeking to construct his impregnable border, Louis XIV so alarmed the other European states that he made the war he sought to avoid inevitable: his fortresses not only covered his frontiers, they projected French power.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Only two statesmen might hope to oppose Louis XIV: William of Orange, [[Stadtholder]] of the United Provinces of the Dutch Republic and the natural leader of Protestant opposition; and Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], obvious leader of anti-French forces in the Holy Roman Empire and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; But while William and Leopold I wanted to act, effective opposition in 1681–82 was out of the question: [[History of Amsterdam#The "Golden Age" (1585-1672)|Amsterdam]]'s [[Vroedschap|burghers]] wanted no further conflict with France; moreover, Leopold I and William were fully aware of the current weaknesses, not only of Spain, but also the Empire, whose important German princes from [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Bavaria]] and, significantly, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William I of Brandenburg]], remained in French pay.&lt;ref name="mckayscott38"&gt;McKay; Scott: p. 38. Frederick William would not move against France. With French aid he hoped to conquer [[Pomerania]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting on two fronts===
{{Main article|Great Turkish War|War of the Reunions}}
Since Leopold I's intervention in the Franco-Dutch War Louis XIV had considered the Emperor his most dangerous enemy; yet the French king had little reason to fear him.&lt;ref name=mckayscott38/&gt; Leopold I was weak, and was in grave danger along his [[Royal Hungary|Hungarian]] borders where the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] were threatening to overrun all central Europe from the south. Louis had encouraged and assisted the Ottoman drive against Leopold I's [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands, and had assured the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] that he would not support the Emperor. He had also urged [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of Poland (unsuccessfully) not to side with Leopold I, and pressed the malcontent princes of [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Transylvania]] and Hungary to join with the Sultan's forces and free their territory from Habsburg rule.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Turks besieged [[Vienna]] in the [[Battle of Vienna|spring of 1683]] Louis did nothing to help the defenders.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 18. To [[John Baptist Wolf]], Louis's determination to break the power of Leopold I was a sign that the French King's ultimate aim was European hegemony. With the Austrian Habsburgs defeated France would be the only power capable of driving the Turks from Germany whose princes, perhaps, would reward Louis XIV by electing him, or one of his progeny, to be the Holy Roman Emperor. To the historian [[John A. Lynn|John Lynn]] this is a compelling argument but not absolutely conclusive: distracting the Austrians by encouraging the Turks was an old French stratagem, and does not in itself prove Louis XIV's lust for universal monarchy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking advantage of the Ottoman threat in the east Louis XIV invaded the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]] on 1 September 1683 and renewed the siege of Luxembourg, which had been abandoned the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;With the growing Ottoman threat in the east, Louis XIV, the Most Christian King, had deemed it impolitic, cynically to some, for him to continue the assault in 1682, which could be seen as aiding the infidel.&lt;/ref&gt; The French required of the Emperor and [[Charles II of Spain]] a recognition of the legality of the recent Reunions, but the Spanish were unwilling to see any more of their holdings fall under Louis's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain's military options were highly limited, yet the Ottoman [[Battle of Vienna|defeat before Vienna]] on 12 September had emboldened them. In the hope that Leopold I would now make peace in the east and come to their assistance, Charles II declared war on France on 26 October. However, the Emperor had decided to continue the Turkish war in the Balkans and, for the time being, compromise in the west. With Leopold I unwilling to fight on two fronts; with a strong neutralist party in the Dutch Republic tying William's hands; and with the Elector of Brandenburg stubbornly holding to his alliance with Louis, there was no possible outcome but complete French victory.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[War of the Reunions]] was brief and devastating. With the fall of [[Kortrijk|Courtrai]] in early November 1683, followed by [[Diksmuide|Dixmude]] in December and Luxembourg in June 1684, Charles II was compelled to accept Louis XIV's peace deal.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 167–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Truce of Ratisbon]] (Regensburg) signed on 15 August by France on one side and the Emperor and Spain on the other, rewarded the French with Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the Reunion gains (Courtrai and Dixmude returned to Spain). The resolution was not a definitive peace, but only a truce for 20 years. Yet Louis had sound reasons to feel satisfied: the Emperor and German princes were fully occupied in Hungary—while in the Dutch Republic, William of Orange remained isolated and powerless, largely because of the pro-French mood in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persecution of the Huguenots===
[[File:King William III of England, (1650-1702).jpg|thumb|upright|William of Orange (1650–1702), portrayed here as King William III of England by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]].]]

At Ratisbon in 1684 France had been in a position to impose its will on Europe; however, after 1685 its dominant military and diplomatic position began to deteriorate. One of the main factors for this diminution was Louis XIV's revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the subsequent dispersal of France's [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community.&lt;ref name = wolf35&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 200,000 [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, and Germany, spreading tales of [[Dragonnade|brutality]] at the hands of the monarch of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The direct effect on France of the loss of this community is debatable, but the flight helped destroy the pro-French group in the Dutch Republic, not only because of their Protestant affiliations, but with the exodus of Huguenot merchants and the harassment of Dutch merchants living in France, it also greatly affected Franco-Dutch trade.&lt;ref name="wolf36"&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution had another effect on Dutch public opinion – the conduct of the Catholic King of France made them look more anxiously at [[James II of England|James II]], now the Catholic King of England. Many in [[The Hague]] believed James II was closer to his cousin Louis XIV than to his son-in-law and nephew William, thus engendering suspicion, and in turn hostility, between the two states.&lt;ref&gt;Miller: ''James II,'' 144. James II's mother [[Henrietta Maria]] was the sister of Louis XIV's father [[Louis XIII]]; William's mother, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]], was James II's sister.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis's seemingly endless territorial claims, coupled with his Protestant persecution, enabled William of Orange and his party to gain the ascendancy in the Republic and finally lay the groundwork for his long-sought alliance against France.&lt;ref name=mckay40&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg 4.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (1620–88). He was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], who proved to be one of William of Orange's most loyal allies.]]

Although James II had permitted the Huguenots to settle in England, he had enjoyed an amicable relationship with his co-religionist Louis XIV, realising the importance of the friendship for his own Catholicising measures at home against the suspicions of his Protestant majority.&lt;ref&gt;Miller: ''James II,'' 145&lt;/ref&gt; But the Huguenot presence gave an immense boost to anti-French discourse, and they joined forces with elements in England already highly suspicious of James.&lt;ref&gt;Simms: ''Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire,'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, conflicts between French and English commercial interests in North America had caused severe friction between the two governments: the French had grown antagonistic towards the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[New England]] colonies, while the English looked upon French pretensions in [[New France]] as encroaching upon their own possessions. This rivalry had spread to the other side of the world where [[East India Company|English]] and [[French East India Company|French]] East India companies had already embarked upon hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in Germany reacted negatively to the persecution of the Huguenots, disabusing the Protestant princes of the idea that Louis XIV was their ally against the intolerant practices of the Catholic Habsburgs.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]] answered the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by promulgating the [[Edict of Potsdam]], and invited the fleeing Huguenots to [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]]. But there were motivations other than religious adherence that disabused him (and other German Princes) of his allegiance to France. Louis XIV had pretensions in the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in the name of his sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]], threatening further annexations of the Rhineland.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Frederick-William, spurning his French subsidies, ended his alliance with France and reached agreements with William of Orange, the Emperor, and, temporarily putting aside his differences over [[Pomerania]], with King [[Charles XI of Sweden]].&lt;ref name = wolf36/&gt;

The consequences of the flight of the Huguenots in southern France brought outright war in the [[Alps|Alpine]] districts of [[Piedmont]] in the [[Duchy of Savoy]] (a northern Italian state nominally part of the Empire). From their fort at Pinerolo the French were able to exert considerable pressure on the Duke of Savoy and force him to persecute his own Protestant community, the [[Waldensians|Vaudois]] (Valdesi). This constant threat of interference and intrusion into his domestic affairs was a source of concern for Victor Amadeus, and from 1687 the Duke's policy became increasingly anti-French as he searched for a chance to assert his aspirations and concerns. This criticism for Louis XIV's regime was spreading all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; The Truce of Ratisbon, followed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, was a cause of suspicion as to Louis's true intentions; many were also fearful of the King's supposed designs on universal monarchy – the uniting of the Spanish and German crowns with that of France. In response, representatives from the Emperor, the south German princes, Spain (motivated by the French attack in 1683 and the imposed truce of 1684), and Sweden (in their capacity as princes within the Empire) met in [[Augsburg]] to form a defensive league of the Rhine in July 1686. [[Pope Innocent XI]] – angered in part at Louis's failure to go on crusade against the Turks – gave secret support.&lt;ref name=simms35&gt;Simms, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude: 1687–88==
[[File:Louvois1.jpg|thumb|upright|Louvois (1641–1691), Louis XIV's belligerent secretary of state at the height of his powers, by [[Pierre Mignard]].]]

The [[League of Augsburg]] had little military power – the Empire and its Allies in the form of the [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] were still busy fighting the Ottoman Turks in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the petty princes were reluctant to act due to the fear of French retaliation. Nevertheless, Louis XIV watched with apprehension Leopold I's advances against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Habsburg victories along the [[Danube]] at [[Buda]] in September 1686,&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'' (Morrow Quill Paperbacks: New York, 1977) p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Battle of Mohács (1687)|Mohács]] a year later&lt;ref&gt;Lord Kinross, ''The Wars of Louis XIV: 1667–1714'', p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; had convinced the French that the Emperor, in alliance with Spain and William of Orange, would soon turn his attention towards France and retake what had recently been won by Louis's military intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Louis XIV sought to guarantee his territorial gains of the Reunions by forcing his German neighbours into converting the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent settlement. However, a French ultimatum issued in 1687 failed to gain the desired assurances from the Emperor whose victories in the east made the Germans less anxious to compromise in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max_II._Emanuel.png|thumb|left|upright|Max Emanuel (1662–1726) by [[Joseph Vivien]].]]

Another testing point concerned the pro-French Archbishop-Elector, [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria|Maximilian Henry]], and the question of his succession in the state of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]].&lt;ref name="Lynn, p. 192"&gt;Lynn, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of the archbishopric lay along the left bank of the Rhine and included three fortresses of the river-line: [[Bonn]], [[Rheinberg]], and [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserswerth]], besides [[Cologne]] itself. Moreover, the archbishop was also prince-bishop of [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Liège]], the small state astride the strategic highway of the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. When the Elector died on 3 June 1688 Louis XIV pressed for the pro-French Bishop of Strasbourg, [[William Egon of Fürstenberg]], to succeed him. The Emperor, however, favoured [[Joseph Clemens of Bavaria|Joseph Clement]], the brother of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=mckayscott42&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 42. The Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbachs]] traditionally provided the electoral bishop.&lt;/ref&gt; With neither candidate able to secure the necessary two-thirds of the vote of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the [[cathedral chapter]], the matter was referred to [[Vatican City|Rome]]. There was no prospect of the Pope, already in deep conflict with Louis, favouring the French candidate, and on 26 August 1688 he awarded the election to Clement.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 15. The ''New Cambridge Modern History VI'' states Clement was awarded the election on 18 September.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1688, Leopold I's forces under the Elector of Bavaria secured [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|Belgrade]] for the Empire.&lt;ref name="Lynn, p. 192"/&gt; With the Ottomans appearing close to collapse Louis XIV's ministers, Louvois and Colbert de Croissy, felt it essential to have a quick resolution along the German frontier before the Emperor turned from the Balkans to lead a comparatively united German Empire against France on the Rhine and reverse the Ratisbon settlement.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September Louis published his manifesto, his ''Mémoire de raisons'', listing his grievances: he demanded that the Truce of Ratisbon be turned into a permanent resolution, and that Fürstenburg be appointed Archbishop-Elector of Cologne. He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis's control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands 'buffer-zone' would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies could have known its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to [[Siege of Philippsburg (1688)|investing Philippsburg]], the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, pp. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV and his ministers had hoped for a quick resolution similar to that secured from the War of the Reunions, but by 1688 the situation was drastically different. In the east an Imperial army, now manned with veteran officers and men, had dispelled the Turkish threat and crushed [[Imre Thököly]]'s revolt in Hungary; while in the west and north, William of Orange was fast becoming the leader of a coalition of Protestant states, anxious to join with the Emperor and Spain, and end the hegemony of France.&lt;ref name=wolf35/&gt; Louis wanted a short defensive war, yet by crossing the Rhine that summer he began a long war of attrition; a war framed by interests of the state, its defensible frontiers, and the balance of power in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), pp. 542–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine years of war: 1689–97==

===Rhineland and the Empire===
[[File:Holy Roman Empire c. 1700.png|thumb|400px|Rhine campaign 1688–89. French forces cross the Rhine at Strasbourg and proceed to invest Philippsburg – the key to the middle Rhine – on 27 September 1688.]]

[[Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras|Marshal Duras]], Vauban, and 30,000 men – all under the nominal command of the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661–1711)|Dauphin]] – besieged the Elector of Trier's fortress of Philippsburg on 27 September 1688; after a vigorous defence it fell on 30 October.&lt;ref name=lynn194&gt;Lynn, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV's army proceeded to take [[Mannheim]], which capitulated on 11 November, shortly followed by [[Frankenthal]]. Other towns fell without resistance, including [[Oppenheim]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Speyer]] and, above all, the key [[Fortress Mainz|fortress of Mainz]]. After [[Koblenz|Coblenz]] failed to surrender [[Louis François, duc de Boufflers|Boufflers]] put it under heavy bombardment, but it did not fall to the French.&lt;ref name=lynn194/&gt;

Louis XIV now mastered the Rhine south of Mainz to the Swiss border, but although the attacks kept the Turks fighting in the east, the impact on Leopold I and the German states had the opposite effect of what had been intended.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Augsburg was not strong enough to meet the threat, but on 22 October the powerful German princes, including the [[Frederick I of Prussia|Elector of Brandenburg]], [[John George III, Elector of Saxony]], [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus of Hanover]], and [[Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], reached an agreement in [[Magdeburg]] that mobilised the forces of north Germany. Meanwhile, the Emperor recalled the Bavarian, [[Swabia]]n, and [[Franconia]]n troops under the Elector of Bavaria from the Ottoman front to defend south Germany. The French had not prepared for such an eventuality. Realising that the war in Germany was not going to end quickly and that the Rhineland ''blitz'' would not be a brief and decisive parade of French glory, Louis XIV and Louvois resolved upon a scorched-earth policy in the Palatinate, [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]], intent on denying enemy troops local resources and prevent them from invading French territory.&lt;ref name="childs17"&gt;Childs (1991), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 December 1688 Louvois had selected all the cities, towns, villages and châteaux intended for destruction. On 2 March 1689 [[René de Froulay de Tessé|Count of Tessé]] torched Heidelberg; on 8 March [[Joseph de Montclar|Montclar]] levelled Mannheim. Oppenheim and Worms were finally destroyed on 31 May, followed by Speyer on 1 June, and Bingen on 4 June. In all, French troops burnt over 20 substantial towns as well as numerous villages.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] declared war on France on 11 February 1689, beginning a [[Reichskrieg|unified imperial war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2016), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans prepared to take back what they had lost, and in 1689 formed three armies along the Rhine. The smallest of these, initially under the Elector of Bavaria, protected the upper Rhine between the lines north of Strasbourg to the [[Black Forest]]. On the middle Rhine stood the largest army under the best Imperial general, and commander-in-chief, [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]]. Charles V cleared away the French threat on [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] and opened trenches around Mainz on 22/23 July. After a bloody two months siege the [[Nicolas Chalon du Blé|Marquis of Huxelles]] finally yielded the town on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, on the lower Rhine stood the Elector of Brandenburg who, aided by the celebrated Dutch engineer [[Menno van Coehoorn]], besieged Kaiserswerth. Kaiserswerth fell on 26 June before the Elector led his army on Bonn, which, [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|having endured a heavy bombardment]], finally capitulated on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the Rhineland had united the German princes in their opposition to Louis XIV who had lost more than he had gained that year along the Rhine. The campaign had also created a diversion of French forces and sufficient time for William of Orange to invade England.&lt;ref name="childs17"/&gt;

===Britain===
{{Main article|Glorious Revolution}}
James II's ill-advised attempts to Catholicise the army, government and other institutions had proved increasingly unpopular with his mainly Protestant subjects. His open Catholicism and his dealings with Catholic France had also strained relations between England and the Dutch Republic, but because his daughter Mary was the Protestant heir to the English throne, her husband William of Orange had been reluctant to act against James II for fear it would ruin her succession prospects.&lt;ref&gt;Mckay; Scott, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet if England was left to itself the situation could become desperate for the Dutch Republic: Louis XIV might intervene and so make James II his vassal;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} or James, wishing to distract his subjects, might even join with Louis in a repetition of the attack made on the Dutch Republic in 1672. By the end of 1687, therefore, William had envisaged intervention, and by early 1688 he had secretly begun to make active preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of a son to James's second wife in June 1688 displaced William's wife Mary as James's heir apparent. With the French busy creating their ''cordon sanitaire'' in the Palatinate (too busy to consider serious intervention in the Spanish Netherlands or to move against the south-eastern Dutch provinces along the Rhine) the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] unanimously gave William their full support in the knowledge that the overthrow of James II was in the security interests of their own state.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV had considered William's invasion as a declaration of war between France and the Dutch Republic (officially declared on 26 November); but he did little to stop the invasion – his main concern was the Rhineland. Moreover, French diplomats had calculated that William's action would plunge England into a protracted civil war that would either absorb Dutch resources or draw England closer to France. However, after landing his forces unhindered at [[Torbay]] on 5 November ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S]]) 1688, many welcomed William with open arms, and the subsequent [[Glorious Revolution]] brought a rapid end to James II's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 1689 (O.S.) William of Orange became King William III of England – reigning jointly with his wife [[Mary II of England|Mary]] – and bound together the fortunes of England and the Dutch Republic. Yet few people in England suspected that William had sought the crown for himself or that his aim was to bring England into the war against France on the Dutch side. The [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] did not see that the offer of joint monarchy carried with it the corollary of a declaration of war, but the subsequent actions of the deposed king finally swung [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] behind William's war policy.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 21–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian J.R. Jones states that King William was given:
:supreme command within the alliance throughout the Nine Years war.  His experience and knowledge of European affairs made him the indispensable director of Allied diplomatic and military strategy, and he derived additional authority from his enhanced status as king of England – even the Emperor Leopold...recognized his leadership.  William's English subjects played subordinate or even minor roles in diplomatic and military affairs, having a major share only in the direction of the war at sea.  Parliament and the nation had to provide money, men and ships, and William had found it expedient to explain his intentions...but this did not mean that Parliament or even ministers assisted in the formulation of policy.&lt;ref&gt; J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World, 1649-1815'' (1980) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

James II had fled to France to the welcoming arms of Louis XIV. In March 1689 (supported by French gold, troops, and generals) he sailed from his exile at [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|St Germain]] to rally Catholic support in Ireland as a first step to regaining his thrones. The French King supported James for two reasons: first, Louis XIV fervently believed in his God-ordained right to the throne; and second, he wished to divert William III's forces away from the Low Countries.&lt;ref name="Lynn, p. 203"&gt;Lynn, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; James II's initial aim, and that of his deputy the [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Duke of Tyrconnell]], was to pacify the northern Protestant strongholds. However, his ill-equipped army of around 40,000 could do little more than [[Siege of Derry|besiege Derry]]. Derry mounted a determined defence that lasted 105 days, and the city was finally relieved by the [[Royal Navy]] at the end of July. In the meantime the first major naval engagement of the war was fought off [[Battle of Bantry Bay|Bantry Bay]] on 11 May (O.S.) – before England's declaration of war – resulting in a minor French success for [[François Louis de Rousselet, Marquis de Châteaurenault|Châteaurenault]], who managed to land supplies for James II's campaign.&lt;ref name="Lynn, p. 203"/&gt; For their part, Williamite forces were supplied from the north, and in August the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Duke of Schomberg]] arrived with 15,000 Danish, Dutch, Huguenot, and English reinforcements. However, after [[Siege of Carrickfergus (1689)|taking Carrickfergus]] his army stalled at [[Dundalk]], suffering through the winter months from sickness and desertion.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 1690 (O.S.) the French navy secured victory off [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Beachy Head]] in the [[English Channel]] where Admiral [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville|Tourville]] defeated Admiral [[Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington|Torrington]]'s inferior Anglo-Dutch fleet.&lt;ref name="Lynn215"&gt;Lynn, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Louis XIV's decision not to use his main fleet as a subsidiary to the Irish campaign had enabled William III to land in Ireland with a further 15,000 men earlier that month.&lt;ref name="Lynn215" /&gt; With these reinforcements William III secured decisive victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on 1 July (O.S.), and once again forced James II to flee back to France.&lt;ref name="Lynn216"&gt;Lynn, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]]'s capture of the southern ports of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Kinsale]] in October 1690,&lt;ref name="Lynn216" /&gt; – thereby confining French and Jacobite troops to the west of the country – William III now felt confident enough to return to the Continent at the beginning of 1691 to command the coalition army in the Low Countries, leaving [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Baron van Ginkell]] to lead his troops in Ireland. After Ginkell's victory over the [[Marquis de St Ruth|Marquis of Saint-Ruth]] at the [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July (O.S.), the remaining Jacobite strongholds fell in rapid succession. Without prospect of further French assistance the [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|capitulation at Limerick]] finally sealed victory for William III and his supporters in Ireland with the signing of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] on 3 October (O.S.). English troops could now return to the Low Countries in strength.&lt;ref&gt;Kinross: ''The Boyne and Aughrim: The War of the Two Kings,'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War aims and the Grand Alliance===
[[File:King James II.png|thumb|upright|James II (1633–1701) c. 1690, artist unknown]]

The success of William's invasion of England rapidly led to the coalition he had long desired. On 12 May 1689 the Dutch and the Holy Roman Emperor had signed an offensive compact in Vienna, the aims of which were no less than to force France back to her borders as they were at the end of the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1659), thus depriving Louis XIV of all his gains since his assumption of power.&lt;ref name="wolf43"&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant for the Emperor and the German princes the reconquest of Lorraine, Strasbourg, parts of Alsace, and some Rhineland fortresses. Leopold I had tried to disentangle himself from the Turkish war to concentrate on the coming struggle, but the French invasion of the Rhineland had encouraged the Turks to stiffen their terms for peace and make demands the Emperor could not conceivably accept.&lt;ref name=spielman147&gt;Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold I's decision to side with the coalition (against the opposition of many of his advisers) was, therefore, a decision to intervene in the west while continuing to fight the Ottomans in the Balkans. Although the Emperor's immediate concerns were for the Rhineland, the most important parts of the treaty were the secret articles pledging England and the States-General to assist him in securing the Spanish succession should Charles II die without an heir, and to use their influence to secure [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|his son's]] election to succeed him as Emperor.

[[File:Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban.png|thumb|left|upright|Marshal Vauban (1633–1707), Louis XIV's greatest military engineer and one of his most trusted advisers]]

William III regarded the war as an opportunity to reduce the power of France and protect the Dutch Republic, while providing conditions that would encourage trade and commerce.&lt;ref name=childs27&gt;Childs (1991), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Although there remained territorial anomalies, Dutch war aims did not involve substantial alterations to the frontier; but William did aim to secure his new position in Britain. By seeking refuge in France and subsequently invading Ireland, James II had given William III the ideal instrument to convince the English parliament that entry into a major European war was unavoidable. With the support of Parliament, William III and Mary II declared war on 17 May 1689 (O.S.); they then passed the [[Trade with France Act 1688]] (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 34), which prohibited all English trade and commerce with France, effective 24 August 1689.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol6/pp98-103 ''An Act for Prohibiting all Trade and Commerce with France.'']&lt;/ref&gt; This Anglo-Dutch alignment was the basis for the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], ratified on 20 December by William III representing England, [[Anthonie Heinsius]] and Treasurer [[Jacob Hop]] representing the Dutch Republic, and [[Leopold Wilhelm, Count von Königsegg|Königsegg]] and [[Theodor Heinrich Stratman|Stratman]] representing Emperor Leopold I. Like the Dutch the English were not preoccupied with territorial gains on the Continent, but were deeply concerned with limiting the power of France to defend against a Jacobite restoration (Louis XIV threatened to overthrow the Glorious Revolution and the precarious political settlement by supporting the old king over the new one).&lt;ref&gt;Childs (1991), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; William III had secured his goal of mobilising Britain's resources for the anti-French coalition, but the Jacobite threat in Scotland and Ireland meant only a small English expeditionary force could be committed to assist the [[Dutch States Army]] in the coalition in the Spanish Netherlands for the first three years of the war.

The Duke of Lorraine also joined the Alliance at the same time as England, while the King of Spain (who had been at war with France since April 1689) and the Duke of Savoy signed in June 1690. The Allies had offered Victor Amadeus handsome terms to join the Grand Alliance, including &lt;!---the recognition of Savoy as a sovereign state and---&gt; the return of Casale to Mantua (he hoped it would revert to him upon the death of the childless [[Ferdinand Charles, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat|Duke of Mantua]]) and of Pinerolo to himself. His adhesion to the Allied cause would facilitate the invasion of France through [[Dauphiné]] and [[Provence]], where the naval base of [[Toulon]] lay.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Louis XIV had embarked on a policy of overt military intimidation to retain Savoy in the French orbit, and had envisaged the military occupation of parts of Piedmont (including the citadel of Turin) to guarantee communications between Pinerolo and Casale.&lt;ref name="rowlands" /&gt; French demands on Victor Amadeus, and their determination to prevent the Duke from achieving his dynastic aims,&lt;ref&gt;The Duke of Savoys' dynastic pretensions included a serious claim on the Spanish succession that provided an alternative to the rival claims of the Grand Dauphin and the Austrian Habsburgs.&lt;/ref&gt; were nothing less than an attack on Savoyard independence, convincing the Duke that he had to stand up to French aggression.&lt;ref name="rowlands"&gt;Rowlands (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elector of Bavaria consented to add his name to the Grand Alliance on 4 May 1690, while the Elector of Brandenburg joined the anti-French coalition on 6 September.&lt;ref name=childs24&gt;Childs (1991), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, few of the minor powers were as devoted to the common cause, and all protected their own interests; some never hesitated to exact a high price for continuing their support.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles XI of Sweden]] supplied the contingents due from his German possessions to the Allied cause (6,000 men and 12 warships),&lt;ref name=wolf47&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; while in August 1689 [[Christian V of Denmark]] agreed to a treaty to supply William III with 7,000 troops in return for a subsidy.&lt;ref name=childs24/&gt; However, in March 1691 Sweden and Denmark put aside their mutual distrust and made a treaty of armed neutrality for the protection of their commerce and to prevent the war spreading north. To the annoyance of the Maritime Powers the Swedes now saw their rôle outside the great power-struggle of the Nine Years' War, exploiting opportunities to increase their own maritime trade.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, pp. 650–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Louis XIV at last faced a powerful coalition aimed at forcing France to recognise Europe's rights and interests.&lt;ref name=wolf43/&gt;

===Expanding war: 1690–91===
[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|350px|The Low Countries c. 1700: the principal theatre during the Nine Years' War]]

The main fighting of the Nine Years' War took place around France's borders: in the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]]; the [[Rhineland]]; [[Catalonia]]; and [[Duchy of Savoy|Piedmont-Savoy]]. The importance of the Spanish Netherlands was the result of its geographic position, sandwiched between France and the Dutch Republic. Initially [[Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières|Marshal Humières]] commanded French forces in this theatre but in 1689, while the French concentrated on the Rhine, it produced little more than a stand-off – the most significant engagement occurred when William's second-in-command, the [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck|Prince of Waldeck]], defeated Humières in a skirmish at the [[Battle of Walcourt]] on 25 August. However, by 1690 the Spanish Netherlands had become the main seat of the war where the French formed two armies: Boufflers' army on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], and a larger force to the west under Humières' successor – and Louis XIV's greatest general of the period – [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Marshal Luxembourg]]. On 1 July Luxembourg secured a clear tactical victory over Waldeck at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]]; but his success produced little benefit – Louis XIV's concerns for the dauphin on the Rhine (where [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges|Marshal de Lorge]] now held actual command) overrode strategic necessity in the other theatres and forestalled a plan to besiege Namur or Charleroi.&lt;ref name="rowlands" /&gt; For the Emperor and the German princes, though, the most serious fact of 1690 was that the Turks had been victorious on the Danube, requiring them to send reinforcements to the east. The Elector of Bavaria – now Imperial commander-in-chief following Lorraine's death in April – could offer nothing on the lower or upper Rhine, and the campaign failed to produce a single major battle or siege.&lt;ref&gt;Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batalla de Fleurus (1690).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]], 1690]]

The smallest front of the war was in Catalonia. In 1689 the [[Anne Jules de Noailles|Duke of Noailles]] had led French forces there aimed at bringing further pressure to bear on the Spanish by re-igniting a [[Revolt of the Barretinas|peasant rising]] against Charles II, which initially broke out in 1687. Exploiting the situation, Noailles captured [[Camprodon]] on 22 May, but a larger Spanish army under the [[Carlos de Gurrea, 9th Duke of Villahermosa|Duke of Villahermosa]] forced him to withdraw back to [[Roussillon]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan campaign settled down in 1690, but a new front in Piedmont-Savoy proved more eventful. A ferment of religious animosities and Savoyard hatred of the French produced a theatre characterised by massacres and atrocities: constant guerrilla attacks by the armed populace were met by draconian reprisals.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1690 [[Marquis de St Ruth|Saint-Ruth]] took most of the Victor Amadeus II's exposed Duchy of Savoy, routing the Savoyard army in the process until only the great fortress of [[Montmélian]] remained in ducal hands; while to the south in Piedmont, [[Nicolas Catinat]] led 12,000 men and soundly defeated Victor Amadeus at the [[Battle of Staffarda]] on 18 August. Catinat immediately took [[Saluzzo]], followed by [[Savigliano]], [[Fossano]], and [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]], but lacking sufficient troops, and with sickness rife within his army, Catinat was obliged to withdraw back across the [[Alps]] for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siege of Mons 1691.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Siege of Mons 1691. While he never commanded a battle in the open field, Louis XIV attended many sieges (at a safe distance) until advancing age limited his activities.]]

French successes in 1690 had checked the Allies on most of the mainland fronts, yet their victories had not broken the Grand Alliance. With the hope of unhinging the coalition French commanders in 1691 prepared for an early double-blow: the [[Siege of Mons (1691)|capture of Mons]] in the Spanish Netherlands, and [[Nice]] in northern Italy. Boufflers invested Mons on 15 March with some 46,000 men, while Luxembourg commanded a similar force of observation. After some of the most intense fighting of all of Louis XIV's wars the town inevitably capitulated on 8 April.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourg proceeded to take [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] at the end of May, while Boufflers bombarded [[Liège]]; but these acts proved to have no political nor strategic consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; The final action of note in the Low Countries came on 19 September when Luxembourg's cavalry surprised and defeated the rear of the Allied forces in a minor action near [[Battle of Leuze|Leuze]]. Now that the defence of the Spanish Netherlands depended almost wholly on the Allies William III insisted on replacing its Spanish governor, the [[Francisco Antonio de Agurto, Marquis of Gastañaga|Marquis of Gastañaga]], with the Elector of Bavaria, thus overcoming delays in getting decisions from Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lands of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy.PNG|thumb|250px|North Italian campaign 1690–96. The territories of Victor Amadeus II, the Duke of Savoy, comprised the County of Nice, Duchy of Savoy and the Principality of Piedmont, which contained the capital city, Turin.]]

In 1691 there was little significant fighting in the Catalan and Rhineland fronts. In contrast, the northern Italian theatre was very active. [[Villefranche-sur-Mer|Villefranche]] fell to French forces on 20 March, followed by Nice on 1 April, forestalling any chance of an Allied invasion of France along the coast. Meanwhile, to the north, in the Duchy of Savoy, the Marquis of La Hoguette took Montmélian (the region's last remaining stronghold) on 22 December – a major loss for the Grand Alliance. However, by comparison the French campaign on the Piedmontese plain was far from successful. Although [[Carmagnola]] fell in June, the [[Antoine de Pas de Feuquières|Marquis of Feuquières]], on learning of the approach of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]'s relief force, precipitously abandoned the [[Siege of Cuneo (1691)|Siege of Cuneo]] with the loss of some 800 men and all his heavy guns. With Louis XIV concentrating his resources in Alsace and the Low Countries, Catinat was forced onto the defensive. The initiative in northern Italy now passed to the Allies who, as early as August, had 45,000 men (on paper) in the region, enabling them to regain Carmagnola in October. Louis XIV offered peace terms in December, but anticipating military superiority for the following campaign Amadeus was not prepared to negotiate seriously.&lt;ref name=rowlands/&gt;

===Heavy fighting: 1692–93===
After the sudden death of the influential Louvois in July 1691 Louis XIV had assumed a more active role in the direction of military policy, relying on advice from experts such as the [[Jules Louis Bolé, marquis de Chamlay|Marquis of Chamlay]] and Vauban.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; Louvois' death also brought changes to state policy with the less adventurous [[Paul de Beauvilliers, 2nd duc de Saint-Aignan|Duke of Beauvilliers]] and the [[Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne|Marquis of Pomponne]] entering Louis XIV's government as ministers of state. From 1691 onwards Louis XIV and Pomponne pursued efforts to unglue the Grand Alliance, including secret talks with Emperor Leopold I and, from August, attempts of religious solidarity with Catholic Spain. The approaches made to Spain came to naught (the Nine Years' War was not a [[religious war]]), but the Maritime Powers were also keen for peace. Talks were hampered, however, by Louis XIV's reluctance to cede his earlier gains (at least those made in the Reunions) and, in his deference to the principle of the divine right of kings, his unwillingness to recognise William III's claim to the English throne. For his part William III was intensely suspicious of Louis XIV and his supposed designs for universal monarchy.&lt;ref name="mckay50"&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the winter of 1691–92 the French devised a grand plan to gain the ascendancy over their enemies – a design for the invasion of England in one more effort to support James II in his attempts to regain his kingdoms; and a simultaneous assault on [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the Spanish Netherlands. The French hoped that Namur's seizure might inspire the Dutch to make peace, but if not, its capture would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations.&lt;ref name=wolf573&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt; With 60,000 men (protected by a similar force of observation under Luxembourg), Marshal Vauban [[Siege of Namur (1692)|invested the stronghold]] on 29 May. The town soon fell but the citadel – defended by van Coehoorn – held out until 30 June. Endeavouring to restore the situation in the Spanish Netherlands William III surprised Luxembourg's army near the village of [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkirk]] on 3 August. The Allies enjoyed some initial success, but as French reinforcements came up William III's advance stalled. The Allies retired from the field in good order, and both sides claimed victory: the French because they repulsed the assault; the Allies because they had saved Liège from the same fate as Namur. However, due to the nature of late 17th-century warfare the battle, like Fleurus before it, produced little of consequence.&lt;ref name=lynn227&gt;Lynn, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nine Years' War#Weapons, technology, and the art of war|See below]]).

[[File:The Battle of La Hogue, 23 May 1692.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of La Hogue]], (1692) by [[Adriaen van Diest]]. The last act of the battle – French ships set on fire at La Hogue.]]

While French arms had proved successful at Namur the proposed descent on England was a failure. James II believed that there would be considerable support for his cause once he had established himself on English soil, but a series of delays and conflicting orders ensured a very uneven naval contest in the English Channel.&lt;ref name=wolf573/&gt; The [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|engagement]] was fought at the tip of the [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg peninsula]], and lasted six days. At the action off Cape Barfleur on 29 May, the French fleet of 44 rated vessels under Admiral Tourville put up stern resistance against Admirals [[George Rooke|Rooke]]'s and [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Russell]]'s 82 rated English and Dutch vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey: ''The Defeat of James Stuart's Armada 1692,'' 175–79. Fleet strengths taken from Aubrey. Sources vary.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the French were forced to disengage: some escaped, but the 15 ships that had sought safety in Cherbourg and La Hogue were destroyed by English seamen and [[Fire ship|fireships]] on 2–3 June.&lt;ref&gt;Aubrey: ''The Defeat of James Stuart's Armada 1692,'' 118–21&lt;/ref&gt; With the Allies now dominant in the English Channel James II's invasion was abandoned. Yet the battle itself was not the death-blow for the French navy: the subsequent mismanagement and underfunding of the fleet under [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Pontchartrain]], coupled with Louis XIV's own personal lack of interest, were central to the French losing naval superiority over the English and Dutch during the Nine Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), pp. 574–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in southern Europe the Duke of Savoy with 29,000 men (substantially exceeding Catinat's number who had sent some troops to the Netherlands) invaded Dauphiné via the mountain trails shown to them by the Vaudois. The Allies invested [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], which capitulated on 15 August, before sacking the deserted town of [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]].&lt;ref name="Clark245"&gt;Clark, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with their commander falling ill with smallpox, and concluding that holding Embrun was untenable, the Allies abandoned Dauphiné in mid-September, leaving behind seventy villages and châteaux burned and pillaged.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Dauphiné had required Noailles give up troops to bolster Catinat, condemning him to a passive campaign in Catalonia; but on the Rhine the French gained the upper hand. De Lorge devoted much of his effort imposing contributions on German lands, spreading terror far and wide in Swabia and Franconia.&lt;ref name="Clark245"/&gt; In October the French commander relieved the siege of [[Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg|Ebernburg]] on the left bank of the Rhine before returning to winter quarters.&lt;ref name="lynn227"/&gt;

By 1693 the French army had reached an official size of over 400,000 men (on paper), but Louis XIV was facing an economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; France and northern Italy witnessed severe harvest failures resulting in widespread famine which, by the end of 1694, had accounted for the deaths of an estimated two million people.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France – Old Regime France,'' p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as a prelude to offering generous peace terms before the Grand Alliance Louis XIV planned to go over to the offensive: Luxembourg would campaign in Flanders, Catinat in northern Italy, and in Germany, where Louis XIV had hoped for a war-winning advantage, Marshal de Lorge would attack [[Heidelberg]]. In the event, Heidelberg fell on 22 May before Luxembourg's army took to the field in the Netherlands, but the new Imperial commander on the Rhine, [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince Louis of Baden]], provided a strong defence and prevented further French gains. Luxembourg had better luck in the Low Countries, however. After taking [[Huy]] on 23 July, the French commander outmanoeuvred William III, catching him off-guard between the villages of Neerwinden and Landen. The [[Battle of Landen|ensuing engagement]] on 29 July was a close and costly encounter but French forces, whose cavalry once again showed their superiority, prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourg and Vauban proceeded to take Charleroi on 10 October which, together with the earlier prizes of Mons, Namur and Huy, provided the French with a new and impressive forward line of defence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catalonian campaign, 1689-97.png|thumb|250px|Catalan campaign 1689–97. The Catalan front was the smallest of the Nine Years' War.]]

In northern Italy, meanwhile, Catinat marched on [[Rivoli (TO)|Rivoli]] (with reinforcements from the Rhine and Catalan fronts), forcing the Duke of Savoy to abandon the siege and bombardment of Pinerolo (25 September – 1 October) before withdrawing to protect his rear. The resultant [[Battle of Marsaglia]] on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French could get out of their victory was renewed breathing-space to restock what was left of Pinerolo.&lt;ref name=rowlands/&gt; Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable seaport of [[Roses, Girona|Rosas]] in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege [[Bellver de Cerdanya|Bellver]], both sides entered winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville's combined [[Brest, France|Brest]] and Toulon squadrons ambushed the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)|Smyrna convoy]] (a fleet of between 200–400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded [[Cape St. Vincent]]. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchant ships with a value of some 30 million livres.&lt;ref&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 153. 30 million livres was equivalent to the entire French naval budget for 1692.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and diplomacy: 1694–95===
French arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had achieved considerable battlefield success, but with the severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend the same level of energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In the background, Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not come apart as long as there was money available and a belief that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombardement de Dieppe en 1694 par l'escadre anglo-hollandaise.jpg|thumb|Bombardment of [[Dieppe]], 1694]]

In the Spanish Netherlands Luxembourg still had 100,000 men; but he was outnumbered.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking sufficient supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and, on 27 September 1694, recapturing Huy, an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October; while in Italy, the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat's push into Piedmont.&lt;ref name=rowlands/&gt; However, in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful. On 27 May Marshal Noailles, supported by French warships, soundly defeated the [[Juan Manuel Fernández Pacheco, 8th Marquis of Villena|Marquis of Escalona]]'s Spanish forces at the [[Battle of Torroella]] on the banks of the river [[Ter (river)|Ter]]; the French proceeded to take [[Palamós]] on 10 June, [[Girona|Gerona]] on 29 June, and [[Hostalric]], opening the route to Barcelona. With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance, William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for action. Part of the fleet under Admiral [[John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Berkeley]] would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous [[attack on Brest|amphibious assault on Brest]] on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Le Havre]], and [[Calais]]. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off [[Cadiz]]. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxería's ''[[Miquelet (militia)|miquelets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Die Belagerung von Namur 1695.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Siege of Namur (1695) by [[Huchtenburg|Jan van Huchtenburg]]. In the foreground William III, dressed in grey, confers with the Elector of Bavaria.]]

In 1695 French arms suffered two major setbacks: first was the death on 5 January of Louis XIV's greatest general of the period, Marshal Luxembourg (to be succeeded by the [[François de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Duke of Villeroi]]); the second was the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|loss of Namur]]. In a role reversal of 1692 Coehoorn conducted the siege of the stronghold under William III, and the Electors of Bavaria and Brandenburg. The French had attempted diversions with the [[bombardment of Brussels]], but despite Boufflers' stout defence Namur finally fell on 5 September.&lt;ref&gt;John Childs calls the recapture of Namur the most important event of the Nine Years' War.&lt;/ref&gt; The siege had cost the Allies a great deal in men and resources, and had pinned down William III's army through the whole summer campaign; but the recapture of Namur, together with the earlier prize of Huy, had restored the Allied position on the Meuse, and had secured communications between their armies in the Spanish Netherlands and those on the Moselle and Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the recent fiscal crisis had brought about a transformation in French naval strategy – the Maritime Powers now outstripped France in shipbuilding and arming, and increasingly enjoyed a numerical advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Symcox: ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism: 1618–1763,'' 236: For Vauban's ''Memorandum on Privateering, 1695,'' and ''Memorandum on the French Frontier, 1678,'' see Symcox&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting the abandonment of fleet warfare, ''guerre d'escadre'', in favour of commerce-raiding, ''[[Commerce raiding|guerre de course]],'' Vauban advocated the use of the fleet backed by individual shipowners fitting out their own vessels as [[privateer]]s, aimed at destroying the trade of the Maritime Powers. Vauban argued that this strategic change would deprive the enemy of its economic base without costing Louis XIV money that was far more urgently needed to maintain France's armies on land. Privateers cruising either as individuals or in complete squadrons from [[Dunkirk]], St Malo and the smaller ports, achieved significant success. For example, in 1695, the [[André, marquis de Nesmond|Marquis of Nesmond]], with seven ships of the line, captured vessels from the English East India Company that were said to have yielded 10 million livres. In May 1696, [[Jean Bart]] slipped the blockade of Dunkirk and struck a Dutch convoy in the [[North Sea]], burning 45 of its ships; on 18 June 1696 he won the battle at [[Dogger Bank]]; and in May 1697, the [[Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis|Baron of Pointis]] with another privateer squadron attacked and [[Raid on Cartagena (1697)|seized Cartagena]], earning him, and the king, a share of 10 million livres.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anne-Jules, duc de Noailles (1650-1708).jpg|thumb|170px|Duke of Noailles (1650–1708). Due to illness Vendôme replaced Noailles as French commander in Catalonia in 1695.]]

For their part, the Allied navy expended more shells on St Malo, Granville, Calais, and Dunkirk; likewise on Palamos in Catalonia where Charles II had appointed the Marquis of Gastañaga as the governor-general. The Allies sent Austrian and German reinforcements under [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]], a cousin of the Queen of Spain, while the French replaced the ailing Noailles with the [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme|Duke of Vendôme]] who would become one of Louis XIV's best generals. But the balance of military power was turning dangerously against the French. In Spain, in the Rhineland, and in the Low Countries, Louis XIV's forces only barely held their own: the bombardment of the French channel ports, the threats of invasion, and the loss of Namur were causes of great anxiety for the King at Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime the diplomatic breakthrough was made in Italy. For two years the Duke of Savoy's Minister of Finance, [[Giambattista Gropello, Count of Borgone|Gropello]], and the [[René de Froulay de Tessé|Count of Tessé]] (Catinat's second-in-command), had secretly been negotiating a bi-lateral agreement to end the war in Italy. Central to the discussions were the two French fortresses that flanked the Duke's territory – Pinerolo and Casale, the latter now completely cut off from French assistance.&lt;ref name=rowlands/&gt; By now Victor Amadeus had come to fear the growth of Imperial military power and political influence in the region (now more than he feared the French) and the threat it posed to Savoyard independence. Knowing, therefore, that the Imperials were planning to besiege Casale the Duke proposed that the French garrison surrender to him following a token show of force, after which the fortifications would be dismantled and handed back to the Duke of Mantua.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 198. Victor Amadeus thought it would be to his advantage to have Casale dismantled and neutralized. Because of its position it would then be at the mercy of Savoy.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV was compelled to accept, and after a sham siege and nominal resistance Casale surrendered to Amadeus on 9 July 1695; by mid-September the place had been razed.

===Road to Ryswick: 1696–97===
Most fronts were relatively quiet throughout 1696: the armies in Flanders, along the Rhine, and in Catalonia, marched and counter-marched but little was achieved. Louis XIV's hesitancy to engage with the Allies (despite the confidence of his generals) may have reflected his knowledge of the secret talks that had begun more than a year earlier—with [[François de Callières]] acting for Louis XIV, and [[Jacob Boreel]] and [[Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt]] representing the Dutch.&lt;ref name="wolf591"&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1696 the talks covered the whole panorama of problems that were proving an obstacle to peace. The most difficult of these were the recognition of the Prince of Orange as the King of England and the subsequent status of James II in France; the Dutch demand for a barrier against future French aggression; French tariffs on Dutch commerce; and the territorial settlements in the Rhine–Moselle areas regarding the Reunions and the recent conquests, particularly the strategically important city of Strasbourg.&lt;ref name="wolf591"/&gt; Louis XIV had succeeded in establishing the principle that a new treaty would be fixed within the framework of the Treaties of Westphalia and Nijmegen, and the Truce of Ratisbon, but with the Emperor's demands for Strasbourg, and William III's insistence that he be recognized as King of England ''before'' the conclusion of hostilities, it hardly seemed worthwhile in calling for a peace conference.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), pp. 591–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy the secret negotiations were proving more productive, with the French possession of Pinerolo now central to the talks. When Amadeus threatened to besiege Pinerolo the French, concluding that its defence was not now possible, agreed to hand back the stronghold on condition that its fortifications were demolished. The terms were formalised as the [[Treaty of Turin (1696)|Treaty of Turin]] on 29 August 1696, by which provision Louis XIV also returned, intact, Montmélian, Nice, Villefranche, [[Susa (TO)|Susa]], and other small towns.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands describes this as little short of a humiliation for Louis XIV when set alongside French demands in the summer of 1690.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other concessions Louis XIV also promised not to interfere in Savoy's religious policy regarding the Vaudois, provided the Duke prevents any communication between them and French Huguenots. In return, Amadeus agreed to abandon the Grand Alliance and join with Louis XIV – if necessary – to secure the neutralisation of northern Italy. The Emperor, diplomatically outmanoeuvred, was compelled to accept peace in the region by signing the [[Treaty of Vigevano]] of 7 October, to which the French immediately acceded. Italy was neutralised and the Nine Years' War in the peninsula came to an end. Savoy had emerged as an independent sovereign House and a key second-rank power: the Alps, rather than the River Po, would be the boundary of France in the south-east.&lt;ref name="rowlands" /&gt;

The Treaty of Turin started a scramble for peace. With the continual disruption of trade and commerce politicians from England and the Dutch Republic were desirous for an end to the war. France was also facing economic exhaustion, but above all Louis XIV was becoming convinced that Charles II of Spain was near death and he knew that the break-up of the coalition would be essential if France was to benefit from the dynastic battle ahead.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The contending parties agreed to meet at [[Rijswijk|Ryswick]] (Rijswijk) and come to a negotiated settlement. But as talks continued through 1697, so did the fighting. The main French goal that year in the Spanish Netherlands was [[Ath]]. Vauban and Catinat (now with troops freed from the Italian font) [[Siege of Ath (1697)|invested]] the town on 15 May while Marshals Boufflers and Villeroi covered the siege; after an assault on 5 June the Count of Roeux surrendered and the garrison marched out two days later. The Rhineland theatre in 1697 was again quiet: the French commander, [[Claude de Choiseul, Marquis of Francières|Marshal Choiseul]] (who had replaced the sick de Lorge the previous year), was content to remain behind his fortified lines. Although Baden took Ebernberg on 27 September, news of the peace brought an end to the desultory campaign, and both armies drew back from one another. In Catalonia, however, French forces (now also reinforced with troops from Italy) achieved considerable success when Vendôme, commanding some 32,000 troops, besieged and captured Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Childs states 25,000 French troops.&lt;/ref&gt; The garrison, under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, capitulated on 10 August. Yet it had been a hard-fought contest: French casualties amounted to about 9,000, and the Spanish had suffered some 12,000 killed, wounded or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American theatre (King William's War)==
[[File:Quebec 1690.jpg|thumb|250px|19th-century print showing Quebec batteries firing on William Phips' squadron during October 1690.]]

The European war was reflected in North America, where it was known as [[King William's War]], though the North American contest was very different in meaning and scale. The European war declaration arrived amid [[Beaver Wars|long-running tensions]] over control of the [[fur trade]], economically vital to both French and English colonies, and influence over the [[Iroquois]], who controlled much of that trade.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', 215–18&lt;/ref&gt; The French were determined to hold the St. Lawrence country and to extend their power over the vast basin of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Elson: ''History of the United States of America,'' I, 226–27&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Hudson Bay]] was a focal point of dispute between the Protestant English and Catholic French colonists, both of whom claimed a share of its occupation and trade. Although important to the colonists, the North American theatre of the Nine Years' War was of secondary importance to European statesmen. Despite numerical superiority, the English colonists suffered repeated defeats as [[New France]] effectively organised its French troops, local militia and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies (notably the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]] and [[Abenaki]]s), to attack frontier settlements.&lt;ref name=taylor290&gt;Taylor: ''The Thirteen Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all resources sent to the colonies by England were to defend the English [[Caribbean|West Indies]], the crown jewels of the empire.

Friction over Indian relations worsened in 1688 with French incursions against the Iroquois in upstate New York, and with Indian raids against smaller settlements in [[Province of Maine|Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor General of New France, [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]], capitalising on disorganisation in New York and New England following the collapse of the [[Dominion of New England]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the war with a series of raids on the northern borders of the English settlements: first was the destruction of [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in July 1689; followed by [[Bristol, Maine|Pemaquid]], Maine, in August.&lt;ref&gt;Elson: ''History of the United States of America,'' I, p. 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1690 [[Schenectady massacre|Schenectady]] in [[Province of New York|New York]] was attacked; massacres at [[Raid on Salmon Falls|Salmon Falls]] and [[Battle of Falmouth (1690)|Casco Bay]] followed. In response, on 1 May 1690 at the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] Conference, colonial representatives elected to invade [[Canada, New France|Canada]]. In August a land force commanded by Colonel Winthrop set off for [[Montreal]], while a naval force, commanded by the future governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], [[William Phips|Sir William Phips]] (who earlier on 11 May had [[Battle of Port Royal (1690)|seized the capital]] of French [[Acadia]], [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]), set sail for [[Quebec City|Quebec]] via the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. They were repulsed in [[Battle of Quebec (1690)|Battle of Quebec]] and the expedition on the St Lawrence failed, while the French retook Port Royal.&lt;ref name="taylor290"/&gt;

The war dragged on for several years longer in a series of desultory sallies and frontier massacres: neither the leaders in England nor France thought of weakening their position in Europe for the sake of a knock-out blow in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt; By the terms of the Treaty of Ryswick, the boundaries and outposts of New France, New England, and New York remained substantially unchanged. In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and Hudson's Bay French influence now predominated but William III, who had made the interests of the Bay Company a cause of war in North America, was not prepared to hazard his European policy for the sake of their pursuit. The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Five Nations]], abandoned by their English allies, were obliged to open separate negotiations, and by [[Great Peace of Montreal|the treaty of 1701]] they agreed to remain neutral in any future Anglo-French war.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, pp. 489–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia and the Caribbean==
[[File:Lagos 1693.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The Battle of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] June 1693; French victory and the capture of the Smyrna convoy was the most significant English mercantile loss of the war.]]
When news of the European war reached Asia, English, French and Dutch colonial governors and merchants quickly took up the struggle. In October 1690 the French Admiral [[Abraham Duquesne-Guitton]] sailed into [[Chennai|Madras]] to bombard the Anglo-Dutch fleet; this attack proved foolhardy but extended the war into the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=John|title=The Emergence of the Great Powers; 1685-1715|date=1962|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=0061397504|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1693 the Dutch launched an expedition against their French commercial rivals at [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] on the south-eastern coast of [[India]]; the small garrison under [[François Martin (Pondicherry)|François Martin]] was overwhelmed and surrendered on 6 September.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Caribbean]] and the Americas were historically an area of conflict between England and Spain but the two were now Allies while outside North America French interests were far less significant. [[Saint Kitts]] twice changed hands and there was sporadic conflict in [[Jamaica]], [[Martinique]] and [[Hispaniola]] but mutual suspicion between the English and Spanish limited joint operations. The Allies had the naval advantage in these isolated areas, though it proved impossible to keep the French from supplying their colonial forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=John|title=The Emergence of the Great Powers; 1685-1715|date=1962|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=0061397504|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1693, it was clear the campaigns in Flanders had not dealt a decisive blow to either the Dutch Republic or England and so the French switched to attacking their trade. The [[Battle_of_Lagos_(1693)|Battle of Lagos]] in 1693 and the loss of the Smyrna convoy caused intense anger among English merchants who demanded increased global protection from the navy. In 1696, a combination of regular French naval forces and [[Privateer|privateers]] went to the Caribbean hoping to intercept the Spanish silver fleet; this was a double threat since capture of the silver would give France a major financial boost while the Spanish ships also carried English cargoes. This failed but combined with de Pointis' expedition of 1697 demonstrated the vulnerability of English interests in the Caribbean and North America; their protection in future conflicts became a matter of urgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Satsuma|first1=Shinsuke|title=Britain and Colonial Maritime War in the Early Eighteenth Century: Silver, Seapower and the Atlantic|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1843838621|pages=30-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Ryswick==
{{Main article|Treaty of Ryswick}}
[[File:Europe c. 1700.png|thumb|300px|Map of European borders as they stood after the Treaty of Ryswick and just prior to Louis XIV's last great war, the War of the Spanish Succession.]]

The peace conference opened in May 1697 in William III's [[Huis ter Nieuwburg|palace]] at Ryswick near [[The Hague]]. The Swedes were the official mediators, but it was through the private efforts of Boufflers and [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland]] that the major issues were resolved. William III had no intention of continuing the war or pressing for Leopold I's claims in the Rhineland or for the Spanish succession: it seemed more important for Dutch and British security to obtain Louis XIV's recognition of the 1688 revolution.&lt;ref name=mckay52&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the terms of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Louis XIV kept the whole of Alsace, including Strasbourg. Lorraine returned to its duke (although France retained rights to march troops through the territory), and the French abandoned all gains on the right bank of the Rhine – Philppsburg, Breisach, [[Freiburg]] and [[Kehl]]. Additionally, the new French fortresses of La Pile, Mont Royal and Fort Louis were to be demolished. To win favour with Madrid over the Spanish succession question, Louis XIV evacuated Catalonia in Spain and Luxembourg, [[Chimay]], Mons, Courtrai, Charleroi and Ath in the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maritime Powers asked for no territory, but the Dutch were given a favourable commercial treaty, of which the most important provision was to relax regulations to favour Dutch trade and return to the French [[tariff]] of 1664. Although Louis XIV continued to shelter James II, he now recognised William III as King of England, and undertook not to actively support the candidature of James II's son.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 252–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave way over the Palatinate and Cologne issues. Beyond this, the French gained recognition of their ownership of the western half of the island of Hispaniola.

The representatives of the Dutch Republic, England, and Spain signed the treaty on 20 September 1697. Emperor Leopold I, desperate for a continuation of the war so as to strengthen his own claims to the Spanish succession, initially resisted the treaty, but because he was still at war with the Turks, and could not face fighting France alone, he also sought terms and signed on 30 October.&lt;ref name=mckay52/&gt; The Emperor's finances were in a bad state, and the dissatisfaction aroused by the raising of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] to electoral rank had impaired Leopold I's influence in Germany. The Protestant princes had also blamed him for the religious clause in the treaty, which stipulated that the lands of the Reunions that France was to surrender would remain Catholic, even those that had been forcibly converted—a clear defiance of the Westphalia settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 473–74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Emperor had netted an enormous accretion of power: Leopold I's son, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]], had been named [[King of the Romans]] (1690), and the Emperor's candidate for the Polish throne, [[Augustus II the Strong|August of Saxony]], had carried the day over Louis XIV's candidate, the [[François Louis, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]]. Additionally, Prince Eugene of Savoy's decisive victory over the Ottoman Turks at the [[Battle of Zenta]] – leading to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 – consolidated the Austrian Habsburgs and tipped the European balance of power in favour of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1970), p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war had allowed William III to destroy militant Jacobitism and helped bring Scotland and Ireland under more direct control. England emerged as a great economic and naval power and became an important player in European affairs, allowing her to use her wealth and energy in world politics to the fullest advantage.&lt;ref name="mckay52"/&gt; William III also continued to prioritise the security of the Dutch Republic, and in 1698 the Dutch garrisoned a series of fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands as a barrier to French attack – future foreign policy would centre on the maintenance and extension of these barrier fortresses.&lt;ref&gt;McKay; Scott, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the question of the Spanish inheritance was not discussed at Ryswick, and it remained the most important unsolved question of European politics. Within three years Charles II of Spain would be dead, and Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance would again plunge Europe into conflict – the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

==Weapons, technology, and the art of war==

===Military developments===
[[File:Mayence 1689.jpg|thumb|250px|Siege of Mainz 1689. Many of the larger fortified complexes had [[citadel]]s. Once the town had been captured the garrison would withdraw into the citadel, which then had to be separately reduced.]]

The campaign season typically lasted through May to October; due to lack of fodder campaigns in winter were rare, but the French practice of storing food and provisions in magazines brought them considerable advantage, often enabling them to take to the field weeks before their foes.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, military operations during the Nine Years' War did not produce decisive results. The war was dominated by what may be called 'positional warfare' – the construction, defence, and attack of [[Star fort|fortresses]] and entrenched lines. Positional warfare played a wide variety of roles: fortresses controlled bridgeheads and passes, guarded supply routes, and served as storehouses and magazines. However, fortresses hampered the ability to follow success on the battlefield – defeated armies could flee to friendly fortifications, enabling them to recover and rebuild their numbers from less threatened fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Many lesser commanders welcomed these relatively predictable, static operations to mask their lack of military ability.&lt;ref name="chandler235"&gt;Chandler, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Daniel Defoe]] observed in 1697, "Now it is frequent to have armies of 50,000 men of a side [who] spend the whole campaign in dodging – or, as it is genteelly called – observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters."&lt;ref name="chandler235" /&gt; In fact, during the Nine Years' War field armies had waxed to nearly 100,000 men in 1695, the strain of which had reduced the Maritime Powers to a fiscal crisis while the French struggled under the weight of a shattered economy.&lt;ref name="childs1"&gt;Childs (1991), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet there were aggressive commanders: William III, Boufflers, and Luxembourg had the will to win but their methods were hampered by numbers, supply, and communications.&lt;ref name="childs1" /&gt; The French commanders were also restricted by Louis XIV and Louvois who distrusted field campaigns, preferring Vauban, the taker of fortifications, rather than campaigns of movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (1962), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bombardement Bruxelles 1695 01.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Bombardment of Brussels]] 1695. Fortifications consisted of low-level, geometric earthworks; the ground plan was polygonal with a pentangle bastion at each salient angle, covered by ravelins, hornworks, crownworks, demi-lunes.]]

Another contributing factor for the lack of decisive action was the necessity to fight for secure resources. Armies were expected to support themselves in the field by imposing contributions (taxing local populations) upon a hostile, or even neutral, territory. Subjecting a particular area to contributions was deemed more important than pursuing a defeated army from the battlefield to destroy it. It was primarily financial concerns and availability of resources that shaped campaigns, as armies struggled to outlast the enemy in a long war of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, pp. 372–373.&lt;/ref&gt; The only decisive action during the whole war came in Ireland where William III crushed the forces of James II in a campaign for legitimacy and control of Britain and Ireland. But unlike Ireland, Louis XIV's Continental wars were never fought without compromise: the fighting provided a foundation for diplomatic negotiations and did not dictate a solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, pp. 264–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major advancement in weapon technology in the 1690s was the introduction of the [[flintlock]] [[musket]]. The new firing mechanism provided superior rates of fire and accuracy over the cumbersome [[matchlock]]s. But the adoption of the flintlock was uneven, and until 1697 for every three Allied soldiers that were equipped with the new muskets, two soldiers were still handicapped by matchlocks:&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; French second-line troops were issued matchlocks as late as 1703.&lt;ref name="bromley747"&gt;Bromley, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; These weapons were further enhanced with the development of the socket-[[bayonet]]. Its predecessor, the [[plug bayonet]] – jammed down the firearm's barrel – not only prevented the musket from firing but was also a clumsy weapon that took time to fix properly, and even more time to unfix. In contrast, the socket-bayonet could be drawn over the musket's muzzle and locked into place by a lug, converting the musket into a short [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] yet leaving it capable of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Childs (2003), p. 155. Different authorities credit both Hugh Mackay and Vauban for the socket bayonet.&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage of the pike came to be widely recognised: at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1690, German battalions armed only with the musket repulsed French cavalry attacks more effectively than units conventionally armed with the pike, while Catinat had abandoned his pikes altogether before undertaking his Alpine campaign against Savoy.&lt;ref name="bromley747" /&gt;

===Naval developments===
In 1688 the most powerful navies were the French, English, and Dutch; the Spanish and Portuguese navies had suffered serious declines in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, p. 790.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest French ships of the period were the [[French ship Soleil-Royal (1670)|''Soleil Royal'']] and the [[French ship Royal Louis (1668)|''Royal Louis'']], but while each was rated for 120 guns, they never carried this full complement and were too large for practical purposes: the former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years' War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the [[Royal Navy]], whose designs stagnated in the 1690s.&lt;ref&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 219–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovation in the Royal Navy, however, did not cease. At some stage in the 1690s, for example, English ships began to employ the [[Steering wheel (ship)|ship's wheel]], greatly improving their performance, particularly in heavy weather. (The French navy did not adopt the wheel for another thirty years).&lt;ref&gt;Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soleil Royal-Gaston Braun.jpg|thumb|250px|French warship ''Soleil Royal'']]

Combat between naval fleets was decided by cannon duels delivered by ships in [[line of battle]]; [[fireships]] were also used but were mainly successful against anchored and stationary targets, while the new [[bomb vessel]]s operated best in bombarding targets on shore. Sea battles rarely proved decisive. Fleets faced the almost impossible task of inflicting enough damage on ships and men to win a clear victory: ultimate success depended not on tactical brilliance but on sheer weight of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Louis XIV was at a disadvantage: without as large a maritime commerce as benefited the Allies, the French were unable to supply as many experienced sailors for their navy. Most importantly, though, Louis XIV had to concentrate his resources on the army at the expense of the fleet, enabling the Dutch, and the English in particular, to outdo the French in ship construction. However, naval actions were comparatively uncommon and, just like battles on land, the goal was generally to outlast rather than to destroy one's opponent. Louis XIV regarded his navy as an extension of his army – the French fleet's most important role was to protect the French coast from enemy invasion. Louis used his fleet to support land and amphibious operations or the bombardment of coastal targets, designed to draw enemy resources from elsewhere and thus aid his land campaigns on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Allies had secured a clear superiority in numbers the French found it prudent not to contest them in fleet action. At the start of the Nine Years' War the French fleet had 118 rated vessels and a total of 295 ships of all types. By the end of the war the French had 137 rated ships. In contrast, the English fleet started the war with 173 vessels of all types, and ended it with 323. Between 1694 and 1697 the French built 19 first- to fifth-rated ships; the English built 58 such vessels, and the Dutch constructed 22. Thus the maritime powers outbuilt the French at a rate of four vessels to one.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival''' ('''PSF''') is a professional theater company in residence at [[DeSales University]] and the Official Shakespeare Festival of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PA State Senate Resolution |url = http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/BillInfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=1995&amp;sind=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=R&amp;bn=0159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival is organized as a non-profit 501(c)(3) in Pennsylvania. Each summer, PSF produces six or more plays (often including a musical) and special one-night-only performances. In the fall, PSF tours a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play to schools as part of its Linny Fowler WillPower tour. The Festival celebrated its 25th anniversary season in the summer of 2016. Since its inception, the Festival has been attended by 888,000 people. The acting company consists primarily of professional actors from New York and Philadelphia and who are members of [[Actors' Equity Association]].  The plays are performed in two theaters in The Labuda Center for the Performing Arts: the 473-seat proscenium Mainstage or the 189-seat thrust Schubert Theater on the DeSales University campus in [[Center Valley, Pennsylvania|Center Valley]].

Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World'' by Marcus D. Gregio ([[editing|Editor]]), 2004.

==WillPower Tour==
The Festival's signature education program is the annual Linny Fowler WillPower Tour, which brings a professionally produced Shakespeare play to middle schools and high schools throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. Initiated in 2000, the WillPower Tour is a professionally directed 80-minute production with sets and costumes featuring a company of professionally trained and experienced actor/teachers. Half-day or full-day programming meets academic standards, with curriculum guides provided in advance. Post-performance discussion gives the students the opportunity to share their reactions and insights. Now in its 18th year, the fall 2017 WillPower Tour features ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', which is touring schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware from October 4 - November 17, 2017.

'''People's Vote''' is a British [[campaign group]] calling for a public vote on the final [[Brexit]] deal between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Launch"/&gt; The group was launched in April 2018 at an event at which four [[Member of the British House of Commons|Members of Parliament]] spoke, along with the actor [[Patrick Stewart]] and other public figures.&lt;ref name="BBC_Launch"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Brexit: 'People's Vote' campaign group launched | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43774200 | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 15 April 2018 | access-date = 16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Parliamentary group ===
In July 2017, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] established an [[all-party parliamentary group]] (APPG) on the UK's relations with the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="APPG"&gt;{{cite news | title = About | url = https://www.eurelations.uk/about | website = eurelations.uk | publisher = EU relations | access-date = 13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Register Of All-Party Parliamentary Groups: EU relations | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/180606/eu-relations.htm | website = publications.parliament.uk | publisher = UK Parliament | date = 6 June 2018 | access-date = 13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-chairs are [[Chuka Umunna]] MP ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]) and [[Anna Soubry]] MP ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]); the remaining members of the group are [[Caroline Lucas]] MP ([[The Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]), [[Jo Swinson]] MP ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]), [[Jonathan Edwards (Welsh politician)|Jonathan Edwards]] ([[Plaid Cymru]]), [[Stephen Gethins]] MP ([[Scottish National Party]]), [[Ros Altmann]] (Conservative), [[Andrew Adonis]] (Labour), [[John Kerr, Baron Kerr of Kinlochard|John Kerr]] ([[Crossbencher|Crossbench]]), [[Sharon Bowles]] (Liberal Democrats), and [[Dafydd Wigley]] (Plaid Cymru).&lt;ref name="APPG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lynskey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lynskey | first = Dorian | title = 'It's not a done deal': inside the battle to stop Brexit | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/28/brexit-not-a-done-deal-battle-to-stay-in-eu-second-referendum | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 April 2018 | access-date = 13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2018 ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a grassroots coordinating group (GCG) representing more than 500,000 members opposed to a hard Brexit had formed, with Umunna as its leader.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news| last = Mason | first = Rowena | title = Groups opposed to hard Brexit join forces under Chuka Umunna | url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/01/groups-opposed-to-hard-brexit-join-forces-under-chuka-umunna |work=[[The Guardian]] | quote = The main groups opposed to a hard Brexit are joining forces under the leadership of Chuka Umunna to push for the public’s voice to be heard on Theresa May’s final deal to leave the EU |date=1 February 2018 | access-date = 8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month it was reported that [[George Soros]]'s [[Open Society Foundations]] had donated £182,000 to [[European Movement UK]] and £35,000 to [[Scientists for EU]], two of the grassroot groups.&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{cite news | title = George Soros donates £400,000 to anti-Brexit campaign | url = https://www.ft.com/content/df9ed626-0c61-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2 | work = [[Financial Times]] | subscription = yes | date = 8 February 2018 | access-date = 7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Elgot | first = Jessica | title = George Soros raises donation to anti-Brexit Best for Britain group | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/11/george-soros-best-for-britain-pro-eu-100000 | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 11 February 2018 | access-date = 7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, ''[[HuffPost]]'' reported that several [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-EU]] groups had moved into an office together in London's [[Millbank Tower]] in order to co-ordinate their campaign to retain strong links between Britain and the European Union. This was also reported to be in order to work alongside the APPG on EU Relations. Umunna commented, "In our democracy, it is vital that the people get their say on Brexit, rather than their elected representatives in Parliament being reduced to some rubber stamp for whatever plan [[Boris Johnson]], [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]], and [[Michael Gove]] have been putting together behind closed doors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Forrester | first = Kate|title=Six pro-EU groups move to new shared office For Brexit fightback|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/six-pro-eu-groups-move-to-new-shared-office-for-brexit-fightback_uk_5aa6a266e4b009b705d4d05a|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=12 March 2018 | access-date = 17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Vote formation===

People's Vote was launched at an event in London on 15 April 2018, at [[Electric Ballroom|The Electric Ballroom]] in Camden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Quinn | first = Ben |title=Brexit: MPs from four parties jointly launch push for people's vote campaign|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/brexit-mps-from-four-parties-jointly-launch-push-for-peoples-vote|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 April 2018 | access-date = 3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event comprised [[Andy Parsons]] with MPs Umunna, Soubry, [[Layla Moran]] (Liberal Democrats), and Lucas speaking, as well as actor [[Patrick Stewart]].

'''Phenmetrazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Preludin''', and [[Phenmetrazine#Brand names|many others]]) is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] that was previously used as an [[appetite suppressant]], but has since been withdrawn from the market. It was initially replaced by its [[Structural analog|analogue]] [[phendimetrazine]] which functions as a [[prodrug]] to phenmetrazine, but now it is rarely prescribed, due to concerns of [[drug abuse|abuse]] and [[drug addiction|addiction]]. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a [[substituted amphetamine]] with a [[morpholine]] ring.

== History ==
Phenmetrazine was first patented in [[Germany]] in 1952 by [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1= Albert| last1= Boehringer| first2= Ernst | last2= Boehringer| title= Improvements in or relating to the preparation of substituted morpholines| number= GB773780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent| url= http://www.google.com/patents/US2835669 |country= US| status= Patent |title= Process for the Production of Substituted Morpholines | number= 2835669 | via= google.com| gdate= May 20, 1958| fdate= June 29, 1953| invent1= Otto Thoma| assign1= C. H. Boehringer Sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some pharmacological data published in 1954.&lt;ref name= thomae&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Thomä| first1= O |last2= Wick| first2= H |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Über einige Tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine mit sympathicomimetischen Eigenschaften| journal=Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmakol.| volume=222| year=1954| pages=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the result of a search by Thomä and Wick for an [[anorectic]] drug without the side-effects of [[amphetamine]].&lt;ref name=martel&gt;{{cite journal| last= Martel| first= Antonio| title=Preludin (Phenmetrazine) in the Treatment of Obesity| journal=Can. Med. Assoc. J.| volume=76| year=1957| pages=117–20| pmid=13383418| issue=2| pmc=1823494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenmetrazine was introduced into [[Clinical trial|clinical]] use in 1954 in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=kalant&gt;{{cite book| last= Kalant| first= Oriana Josseau| title=The Amphetamines: Toxicity and Addiction| year=1966| isbn=0-398-02511-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical use ==
In clinical use, phenmetrazine produces less [[Anxiety|nervousness]], hyperexcitability, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] and [[insomnia]] than drugs of the amphetamine family.&lt;ref name=jama&gt;{{cite journal| title=Phenmetrazine Hydrochloride| journal=J. Am. Med. Assoc.| volume=163| issue=5| pages=357| year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tends not to increase [[heart rate]] as much as other stimulants. Due to the relative lack of [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s, one study found it well tolerated in children.&lt;ref name=martel /&gt; In a study of the effectiveness on [[weight loss]] between phenmetrazine and [[dextroamphetamine]], phenmetrazine was found to be slightly more effective.&lt;ref name=hampson&gt;{{cite journal| title=Phenmetrazine and Dexamphetamine in the Management of Obesity| author=Hampson, J| journal=The Lancet| volume=275| issue=7137| pages=1265–7| year=1960| doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(60)92250-9| pmid=14399386| last2=Loraine| first2=J.A.| last3=Strong| first3=J.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pharmacology ==
Phenmetrazine acts as a [[releasing agent]] of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] with [[EC50|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] values of 50.4 ± 5.4 nM and 131 ± 11 nM, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid17017961"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH | title = Therapeutic potential of monoamine transporter substrates | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 17 | pages = 1845–59 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17017961 | doi = 10.2174/156802606778249766| url = http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2006/00000006/00000017/0004R.SGM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has negligible efficacy as a releaser of [[serotonin]], with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of only 7,765 ± 610 nM.&lt;ref name="pmid17017961"/&gt;

After an oral dose, about 70% of the drug is [[Excretion|excreted]] from the body within 24 hours. About 19% of that is excreted as the unmetabolised drug and the rest as various [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref name=clarkes&gt;{{cite book| title=Clarke's Analysis of Drugs and Poisons| author=Anthony C Moffat, M David Osselton and Brian Widdop| isbn=0-85369-473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In trials performed on rats, it has been found that after [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] administration of phenmetrazine, both [[optical isomer]]s are equally effective in reducing food intake, but in [[mouth|oral]] administration the [[Levorotation|levo]] isomer is more effective. In terms of central stimulation however, the dextro isomer is about 4 times as effective in both methods of administration.&lt;ref name=engelhardt&gt;{{cite journal| title=Studies of the Mechanism of the Anti-Appetite Action of Phenmetrazine| author=Engelhardt, A| journal=Biochem. Pharmacol.| volume=8| issue=1| pages=100| year=1961| doi=10.1016/0006-2952(61)90520-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{Expand section|1=details of the synthesis from US patent [https://www.google.com/patents/US3018222 US3018222]|date=January 2015}}
Its structure incorporates the backbone of [[amphetamine]], the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like phenmetrazine, is a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles [[ethcathinone]], the active metabolite of popular anorectic [[amfepramone]] (diethylpropion). Unlike phenmetrazine, ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline releasing agents.

== Recreational use ==
Phenmetrazine has been used recreationally in many countries such as [[Sweden]]. When stimulant use first became prevalent in Sweden in the 1950s, phenmetrazine was preferred to [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]] by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/cu/CU39.html| title=The Swedish Experience| author=Brecher, Edward M| accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autobiographical novel ''Rush'' by [[Kim Wozencraft]], intravenous phenmetrazine is described as the most euphoric and pro-sexual of the stimulants the author used.

Phenmetrazine was classified as a [[narcotic]] in Sweden in 1959, and was taken completely off the market in 1965. At first the illegal demand was satisfied by smuggling from [[Germany]], and later [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. At first, Preludin tablets were smuggled, but soon the smugglers started bringing in raw phenmetrazine powder. Eventually amphetamine became the dominant stimulant of abuse because of its greater availability.

Phenmetrazine was taken by [[the Beatles]] early in their career. [[Paul McCartney]] was one known user. McCartney's introduction to drugs started in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The Beatles had to play for hours, and they were often given the drug (referred to as ''Prellies'') by the maid who cleaned their housing arrangements, German customers, or by [[Astrid Kirchherr]] (whose mother bought them). McCartney would usually take one, but [[John Lennon]] would often take four or five.&lt;ref name="Milesp66-67"&gt;{{cite book| last= Miles| first= Barry| title=Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now| year=1998 |pages=66–67| isbn=0-8050-5248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunter Davies]] asserted, in his 1968 biography of the band,&lt;ref name="Davies78"&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Hunter Davies| last= Davies| first= Hunter| title=The Beatles: The Authorized Biography| year=1968 |page=78| isbn=0-07-015457-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that their use of such stimulants then was in response to their need to stay awake and keep working, rather than a simple desire for kicks.

[[Jack Ruby]] said he was on phenmetrazine at the time he killed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Jack| last= Ruby |title= Testimony of Jack Ruby| volume= 5| place= Washington| publisher= US Government Printing Office| year= 1964| pages= 198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preludin was also used recreationally in the US throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It could be crushed up in water, heated and injected. The street name for the drug in Washington, DC was "Bam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Leon| last= Dash | title = Rosa Lee | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1996 | page = 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phenmetrazine continues to be used and abused around the world, in countries including [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi H, Baeck S, Jang M, Lee S, Choi H, Chung H | title = Simultaneous analysis of psychotropic phenylalkylamines in oral fluid by GC-MS with automated SPE and its application to legal cases | journal = [[Forensic Science International]] | volume = 215 | issue = 1–3 | date = 10 February 2012 | pages = 81–87 | pmid= 21377815 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2011.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Wayne Aschenbrener''' (November 22, 1920 – July 2, 2009) was an American fighter pilot and [[flying ace]] of [[World War II]].

==Early life==
He was raised on the Indian reservation at [[Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin]]. He attended [[Loras College]] in [[Dubuque, Iowa]] for two years before enlisting in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] in September 1941.

==World War II==
Aschenbrener received flight training at Kelly, Ballinger, San Angelo, and Moore Fields in Texas, and graduated with the class of 42H. Lieutenant Aschenbrener was assigned to the [[8th Fighter Squadron]] (Black Sheep Squadron), [[49th Fighter-Bomber Group|49th Fighter Group]], then based in [[New Guinea]]. Flying the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]], he scored his first two victories on November 15, 1943, followed by another on February 15, 1944. Promoted to captain, he became operations officer and flew 272 combat missions before returning to the United States in the summer of 1944 to instruct other pilots in fighter tactics.

Wishing to return to combat, "Asch" (as he was nicknamed) wrangled a trip back to his old unit, now in the [[Philippines]] flying the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].&lt;ref name="Aces Against Japan, Eric Hammel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammel |first=Eric |date= |title= Aces Against Japan|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= }}{{Full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving again as operations officer, he became an ace on November 24, 1944, when he downed three [[Kawasaki Ki-61]]s ("Tony"s) and one [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] ("Zeke") in one day. On December 11 and 14, 1944, he was credited with his ninth and tenth victories.

[[File:Major Robert W. Aschenbrener 024.jpg|thumb|150px|Major Aschenbrener's P-38]]
On Christmas Day 1944, during a strafing run on enemy occupied [[Clark Field]], Aschenbrener's [[P-38]] was hit by 20mm ground fire, and he crashed into a rice paddy barely {{convert|5|mi|km}} from the end of the runway. Picked up by [[Hukbalahap]] guerrillas, he hid in the jungle for nearly a month evading enemy troops on the lookout for him. He was joined by the crew of a Navy torpedo plane, as well as downed [[F-6F Hellcat]] ace [[Alexander Vraciu]]. Making it back to safety after 27 days, he returned to his unit, where he was promoted to major and assumed command of the [[7th Fighter Squadron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pascalis |first1=William K. |last2=Ferguson |first2=Steve W. |date=February 1, 1996 |title=Protect &amp; Avenge: The 49th Fighter Group in World War II |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd. |page= |isbn=978-0887407505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 49th Fighter Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward |first1=Colonel J.|last2=Grinnell |first2=Roy |last3=Boyce |first3=Sonny Schug |date= 1996 |title=American Fighter Aces Album|publisher=American Fighter Aces Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, he met his soon to be wife, Laura Ann Middleton. They were married on recaptured [[Clark Air Base]] on August 20, 1945 in the shadow of [[Mount Pinatubo]] (a volcano which eventually destroyed the base) just a few miles from where his plane went down.

Before leaving the Army Air Force, Major Aschenbrener flew 345 combat missions and over 850 combat hours&lt;ref name="Aces Against Japan, Eric Hammel"/&gt; flying the P-40, [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]], and P-38 fighter aircraft.

==Post-war==
Major Aschenbrener returned to the United States in September 1945 and left the service to pursue a degree in journalism at the University of Missouri. After retiring from the ''Los Angeles Valley News'', he and Ann moved to [[Cameron Park, California|Cameron Park]] in northern California.

Aschenbrener died July 2, 2009 at the age of 88 in Sacramento, California, leaving behind eight children and over 30 grandchildren and great grandchildren.

'''Sixth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance''' was held in June 1911 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. It was led by the organization's president, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]].

The proceedings were inaugurated on Sunday, 11 June in the [[Gustaf Vasa Church]]. The welcome address was delivered at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music|Academy of Music]] by the president of the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]]. There were 24 organized countries in attendance. One of the outcomes of the conference was the formation of an International Men's League which was joined by New York, England, Holland, Hungary, Germany and France. [[Ann-Margret Holmgren]]n gave the Monday evening address. [[Ethel Snowden]] also spoke. On Tuesday evening, [[Selma Lagerlöf]] spoke, saying, "Woman with man by her side, has created the Ideal Home; it is now time that woman should co-operate with man, and together they can create the "Ideal State"."&lt;ref name=Simmern1911&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simmern|first1=E.|title=Sixth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1790&amp;dat=19110622&amp;id=K5Y9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tisMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2673,10879443&amp;hl=en|accessdate=11 October 2015|publisher=The Common Cause|date=22 June 1911|location=Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparations ==
The committee which had been appointed to prepare for the congress and had been working for many months beforehand consisted of the Executive Committee of the central board of the National Suffrage Association and the presidents of sub-committees formed for different purposes. [[Signe Bergman]] acted as president, [[:sv:Axianne Thorstenson| Axianne Thorstenson]] as vice-president, [[Anna Frisell]] as treasurer, [[Nini Kohnberger]] and [[Elise Carlson]] as secretaries. Axeline Virgin was at the head of the Finance Committee. The work of the Press Committee was directed by [[Else Kleen]]. [[Lily Laurent]] was at the head of the Committee on Localities. [[Lizinski Dyrssen]] headed the Committee for Festivities. [[:sv:Ezaline Boheman|Ezaline Boheman]] was the head of the Information Bureau. Alfhild Lamm and [[Eva Andén]] directed the work of the thirty university students who served as pages. At the head of the Travelling Committee was Dr. Martin Wester-Hallberg, who arranged the journey to [[Sápmi|Lapland]].{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

== Proceedings ==
The Sixth Conference and Congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance took place in the banquet hall of the [[Grand Hôtel (Stockholm)|Grand Hotel]], Stockholm, 12–17 June 1911. The coming of Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the Alliance, had been widely heralded. She had been received in [[Copenhagen]] with national honors by cabinet ministers and foreign legations. In Christiania, she was met with a greeting from a former Prime Minister and an official address of welcome from the Government and was received by King Haakon. In the midst of it all the woman suffrage bill came up for discussion in both Houses of the Parliament. The international president was escorted to the Lower House by a body of women that crowded the galleries. After a stormy debate the bill to enfranchise the women of Sweden received a majority vote. In the midst of the applause Catt was hurried to the Upper Chamber, the stronghold of caste and conservatism. Her presence did not save the bill from the usual defeat.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

The congress opened with representatives from 24 affiliated National Associations and two Committees, those of Austria and Bohemia. The government of Norway sent as its official delegate Dr. [[Kristine Bonnevie]]. The list of delegates filled seven printed pages, the United States, the Netherlands and Sweden having the full quota of twelve delegates and twelve alternates, Germany lacking only three of the latter, while Great Britain, France, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Hungary had twelve or more. Six were present from Russia; Bulgaria, Serbia, Switzerland, South Africa, Iceland and Canada had representatives. Of fraternal delegates from other organizations there was no end—about 70 men and women—among them members of five Men's Leagues for Woman Suffrage—in the United States, Great Britain, Netherlands, Hungary and Sweden. In addition to the spoken words letters and telegrams of greeting were read from societies and individuals in twelve different countries. The distinguished guests of the occasion were Dr. [[Selma Lagerlöf]] of Sweden, who had recently received the Nobel Literature Prize, and [[Helena Westermarck]] of Finland. Among prominent speakers were Mayor [[Carl Lindhagen]] and [[:sv:Ernst Beckman|Ernest Beckman]], M. P., the Rev. [[:sv:Knut Henning Gezelius von Schéele|Knut Henning Gezelius von Schéele]], Bishop of Visby, and the Rev. Dr. [[:sv:Samuel Fries|Samuel Fries]]. The ushers and pages were women students of the universities.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

On the Sunday afternoon preceding the convention the precedent of all past ages was broken when Dr. [[Anna Howard Shaw]] preached in the ancient State Church of Gusta Vasa. Sunday evening a reception was given at the Restaurant Rosenbad to the officers, presidents of national auxiliaries and Swedish Committee of Arrangements by its chairman, [[:sv:Bertha Nordenson|Bertha Nordenson]].{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

The official report of the first executive session Monday morning said: "Miss Janet Richards, delegate from the U. S. A., with an admirable speech, presented to the Alliance from the State which had recently given full suffrage to women a gavel bearing the inscription: "To the International W. S. A. from the Washington Equal Suffrage Association." It was announced that National Suffrage Associations had been formed in Iceland and Servia and they were gladly accepted as auxiliaries, bringing the number up to twenty-six. The municipality had contributed 3,000 crowns to the congress, which proved to be the largest ever held in Stockholm. Season tickets had been sold to 1,200 persons and other hundreds bought tickets to the various meetings. During the entire week the flags of the nations represented at the congress floated from the flagstaffs that lined the quay in front of the Grand Hotel facing the royal palace, as far as the eye could reach. All the time Mrs. Catt was in the city the American flag was run up for her as a public guest wherever she went and the Swedish colors dipped a salute.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

The Congress was formally opened in the afternoon of 12 June with addresses of welcome from [[Anna Whitlock]], acting president of the National Suffrage Association of Sweden, and the Hon. [[Ernest Beckman]], M. P., president of the National Swedish Liberal Association, and response from the Alliance was made by [[Chrystal Macmillan]] of Great Britain, proxy for [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]], its first vice-president. [[Anna Kleman]], president of the Stockholm suffrage society, then presented the beautiful white satin, gold embroidered Alliance banner, which was carried by six university students in white dresses with sashes of the Swedish colors. Catt announced that the Alliance flag was now flying over the Grand Hotel where they were assembled. The banner was the gift of [[Lotten von Kroemer]], a pioneer suffragist of Sweden, and the flag of the resident Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Tea Co., US. A suffrage song written by [[K.G. Ossiannilsson]] and the music composed by [[Hugo Alfvén]] for the occasion was sung by the Women's Choir of [[Gothenburg]], after which an official delegate of the Government extended its greeting while the audience rose and the flags of the nations waved from the galleries. Catt received an ovation as she came to the front of the platform to make her address. It filled twenty-three pages of the printed minutes and was a complete resume of the early position of women, the vast changes that had been wrought and the great work which the Alliance was doing.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

At the official reception given by the National Suffrage Association of Sweden in the evening the guests were welcomed by [[Ann Margret Holmgren]] and their appreciative responses were made by [[Margaret Hodge]], Australia; [[Gabriella Danzerova]], Bohemia; Mrs. Daisy Minor, Austria; Miss Helen Clay-Petersen, Denmark; Miss Annnie Furuhjelm, Finland; Madam DeWitt Schlumberger, France; Dr. [[Anita Augspurg]], Germany; [[Olga Ungar]], Hungary; Mrs. Philip Snowden, Great Britain. These were followed by a cantata beautifully rendered by the Gothenburg choir, words and music by women.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

During the convention Lieutenant Colonel [[W. A. E. Mansfeldt]] of Holland made the report for its Men's League for Woman Suffrage; Dr. [[C. V. Drysdale]] for Great Britain; [[Jean du Breuil]] for France; Dr. [[Alexander Patai]] for Hungary; [[Frederick Nathan]] for the United States, and the founding of an International Men's League was announced with Mansfeldt as secretary.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

The reports of the work of the different branches and their discussion, bringing before the Alliance the experience and opinions of women from all parts of the world, were perhaps the most valuable feature of the conference. The most animated and vital of these discussions was the one of a political nature, divided into three parts: 1. What political work have the women of the enfranchised countries done, what is their relation to the different parties and how do these treat them? Have they any advice to offer? led by Miss Hodge, Mrs. [[Louise Keilhau]], Norway; Dr. Tekla Hultin, M. P., Finland. 2. How can woman's political influence be brought to bear most effectively on Parliaments and governments? Led by Mrs. Snowden; Mrs. [[Anna B. Wicksell]], Sweden; Dr. [[Kiithe Schirmacher]], Germany; Miss Richards. 3. What should be the relation of the suffrage movement to political parties in the unenfranchised countries? Led by Miss [[Eline Hansen]], Denmark; Miss [[Rosika Schwimmer]], Hungary; Madame Pichon, France; Mrs. [[Zeneide Mirovitch]], Russia. There was a wide divergence of opinion but at last a resolution was unanimously adopted that "woman suffrage societies do their best work when organized in a non-partisan manner." In order to remove persistent misunderstanding a statement presented by Mrs. Catt was adopted explaining the wording of the resolution demanding "the franchise for women on the same terms as it is or may be exercised by men." It declared that the Alliance had on no occasion taken a position for or against any special form of suffrage but that the affiliated societies were left entirely free to determine for themselves which form they would demand. The Alliance did not express an opinion as to what should be the qualifications for enfranchisement, its sole object being to establish the principle that sex should not be a disqualification.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

[[File:Poliksena Shiskina Yavein - Women Wanted.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Dr. Shiskin-Yavein]]Eminent women speakers spoke in the [[Royal Swedish Opera|Royal Opera House]] of Stockholm on the second evening of the convention. Catt presided and addresses were made by Miss Westermarck, Dr. Augspurg, Mrs. Snowden, Miss Schwimmer, Dr. Shaw and Sweden's Selma Lagerlöf. Another which differed from all that had gone before was the great gathering in Skansen, the magnificest park, where at 7 o'clock, from two platforms, noted speakers from ten countries addressed an audience of thousands. A dinner followed in the park house, Hogenloft, with fine music, and then in the open air the visitors saw the famous national dances and processions by the young people in the picturesque costumes of the country.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

Although the official languages of the Alliance were French, German and English, a crowded meeting was held one evening in the People's House with the speeches in Scandinavian languages. It was opened by Mayor Lindhagen, an ardent advocate of woman suffrage. At another session the Woman Question in the Russian Parliament was considered by Dr. Shiskin-Yavein; the Suffrage Outlook in Bohemia by Miss [[Maria Tumova]], recent candidate for Parliament; the Future of South African Women by Miss [[Nina Boyle]]. A special meeting was held one afternoon in the hall of the Young Women's Christian Association. Mrs. Marie Stritt, Germany; Mme. [[Maria Verone]], France, and Miss Macmillan were appointed to compile a pamphlet of information about woman suffrage in all lands to be used for propaganda work.{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

The closing speech of the congress was made by the international president at [[Saltsjöbaden]].{{sfn|Stanton|Anthony|Gage|Harper|1922|pp=838-847}}

On the evening of September 2, 1984 ([[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]]) several [[tornado]]es hit [[southwestern Ontario]] from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] to [[London, Ontario|London]]. This was the biggest [[severe weather]] event of the year for the province.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During the morning hours, the [[surface map]] revealed a rather potent [[low pressure system]] (for late summer) over [[northern Michigan]], moving to the northeast.

A [[warm front]] was moving into [[southern Ontario]] and bringing with it a moist, unstable [[airmass]]. [[Thunderstorm]]s were also reported across much of district during the early morning hours as well. The [[cold front]] however, was still back over [[Lake Michigan]] and tracking steadily towards the east. During the afternoon, the weather generally cleared up in the outbreak area and temperatures reached the upper 20s Celsius (low 80s F) with [[dewpoint]]s in the low 20s Celsius (low 70s F).

==The tornadoes==
Towards 4:00 pm the cold front was starting to cross the border and thunderstorms began to form over the southern portion of [[Lake Huron]]. A tornado was reported near [[Lakeport, Michigan]] (where [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F3]] damage occurred) at around 4:30 pm but continued over the lake as a [[waterspout]], before weakening. In Ontario, the first tornado touchdowns were near [[Melrose, Middlesex County, Ontario|Melrose]] (just northwest of London) and at [[Forest, Ontario|Forest]] ([[Lambton County, Ontario|Lambton County]]) at 6:00 and 6:20 pm, respectively. Both of these tornadoes were relatively brief.

The next tornadoes occurred near the towns of Staffa and [[Sebringville, Ontario|Sebringville]] (in northern [[Perth County, Ontario|Perth County]]) at around 6:30 and 7:15 pm, respectively. These tornadoes were likely associated with the same thunderstorm (possibly a [[supercell]], cyclic in nature) as they occurred only within a few kilometres of each other.

At 7:20 pm, the most damaging tornado touched down just southwest of London, where it proceeded to rip through the White Oaks [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] at the southern end of the city (not too far from [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]). Approximately 600 homes were damaged and 30 people were injured as a result. Over the northern portion of the city, torrential [[Rain|downpours]] dropped 40–60&amp;nbsp;mm of rain in about an hour and were accompanied by gusty winds. There was one last brief touchdown near [[Bothwell, Ontario|Bothwell]] (northeast of [[Thamesville, Ontario|Thamesville]], [[Kent County, Ontario|Kent County]]) shortly after the London Tornado lifted.

None of the six tornadoes were assigned official [[Fujita scale|F-scale]] ratings by [[Environment Canada]] but the London Tornado was almost certainly significant ([[Fujita scale#Parameters|F2]] or higher intensity).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[File:Spaghetti harvest.jpg|thumb|300px|Photograph of a woman harvesting spaghetti in the BBC programme]]

The '''spaghetti-tree hoax''' was a three-minute [[hoax]] report broadcast on [[April Fools' Day]] 1957 by the [[BBC]] current-affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', purportedly showing a family in southern [[Switzerland]] harvesting [[spaghetti]] from the family "spaghetti tree". At the time spaghetti was relatively little known in the UK, so that many Britons were unaware that it is made from [[wheat flour]] and water; a number of viewers afterwards contacted the BBC for advice on growing their own spaghetti trees. Decades later [[CNN]] called this broadcast "the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Saeed |last= Ahmed | title= A nod and a link: April Fools' Day pranks abound in the news |publisher=CNN.com |date= 1 April 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/01/april.fools.pranks/index.html |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The report was produced as an April Fools' Day joke in 1957, showing a family in the canton of [[Ticino]] in southern Switzerland as they gathered a bumper spaghetti harvest after a mild winter and "virtual disappearance of the spaghetti [[weevil]]". Footage of a traditional "Harvest Festival" was aired along with a discussion of the breeding necessary to develop a strain to produce the perfect length. Some scenes were filmed at the (now closed) Pasta Foods factory on London Road, [[St Albans]], in [[Hertfordshire]], and at a hotel in [[Castagnola]], [[Switzerland]].

''Panorama'' cameraman [[Charles de Jaeger]] dreamed up the story after remembering how teachers at his school in Austria teased his classmates for being so stupid that if they were told that spaghetti grew on trees, they would believe it. The editor of ''Panorama'' [[Michael Peacock (television executive)|Michael Peacock]] told the BBC in 2014 how he gave de Jaeger a budget of £100 and sent him off. The report was made more believable through its [[voice-over]] by respected [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] [[Richard Dimbleby]].

A January 2017 assessment by the US Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] claimed that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] over [[Hillary Clinton]], adding that Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton's electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf |title=Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line. |date=January 6, 2017 |publisher=[[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] |accessdate=June 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626172540/https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged that the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] [[foreign electoral intervention|interfered]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]] by bolstering the candidacies of Trump, [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Jill Stein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russia-mueller-election.html|title=Inside a 3-Year Russian Campaign to Influence U.S. Voters|last1=Shane|first1=Scott|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|date=February 16, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 17, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217032428/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/politics/russia-mueller-election.html|archive-date=February 17, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DNI Report: High Confidence Russia Interfered With U.S. Election |magazine=nymag.com |first=Brian |last=Feldman |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=October 6, 2017 |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/01/report-high-confidence-russia-interfered-with-u-s-election.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021043941/http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/01/report-high-confidence-russia-interfered-with-u-s-election.html |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to increase political instability in the United States as well as to damage the Clinton presidential campaign.

=== Special counsel appointment ===
Once recused, oversight of any Russia investigation into the 2016 election fell to the Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]], a Trump appointee.  

As part of his oversight, Rosenstein called for a special counsel and appointed [[Robert Mueller]] in charge of that special counsel in May 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=May 17, 2017 |title=Appointment of Special Counsel |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel |website=Department of Justice |publisher=US Department of Justice |accessdate=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805213959/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel |archive-date=August 5, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the charter of determining if there was any Russian Interference in the 2016 election process, or related matters.

=== Reasons for appointing a special counsel ===
The special counsel appointment on May 17, 2017, followed a series of events that included Trump's [[Dismissal of James Comey|firing]] of FBI director [[James Comey]] and Comey's [[Comey memos|allegation]] that Trump asked him to drop the FBI investigation into former National Security Advisor [[Michael T. Flynn]].&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;{{cite news |first=Rebecca R. |last=Ruiz |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html |title=Robert Mueller, Former F.B.I.

[[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[Rod Rosenstein]], in his role as Acting [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] for matters related to the campaign due to the recusal of Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], appointed Mueller, a former [[Director of the FBI]], to serve as Special Counsel for the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) with authority to investigate [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], including exploring any links or coordination between Trump's [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]] and the Russian government, "any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html |title=Rod Rosenstein's Letter Appointing Mueller Special Counsel |authorlink=Rod Rosenstein |last1=Rosenstein |first1=Rod |date=May 17, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |dead-url=no |accessdate=May 18, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518015032/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html |archivedate=May 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and any other matters within the scope of [[Special prosecutor#Legal authority|28 CFR 600.4 – Jurisdiction]].

In March 2018, Mueller's office reportedly informed Trump's attorneys that the president is not a "criminal target" but remains a "subject" of the continuing investigation. Trump's advisers were reported to be split in their interpretation of this, with some believing it was an indication that his legal exposure was low, while others expressed concern that Mueller was inducing him to agree to a personal interview, which his attorneys have discouraged him from doing for fear he might perjure himself and thus change his status from subject to target. ''The Post'' reported that Mueller also advised the attorneys that he is "preparing a report about the president's actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice."&lt;ref name=subject&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html|title=Mueller told Trump's attorneys the president remains under investigation but is not currently a criminal target|first1=Carol D.|last1=Leonnig|first2=Robert|last2=Costa|date=April 3, 2018|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816172144/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html|archive-date=August 16, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Post'' referenced Justice Department guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.151|title=9-11.000 – Grand Jury|work=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|access-date=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902161255/https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.151#9-11.151|archive-date=September 2, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explain:

Through November 2018, the Special Counsel has publicly initiated criminal proceedings against 33 people—six U.S. nationals, 26 Russian nationals, and one Dutch national—and three Russian organizations. Two additional individuals have been charged as a result of referrals to other FBI offices.

Charges have been filed against Trump campaign members [[George Papadopoulos]], [[Paul Manafort]], [[Rick Gates (political consultant)|Rick Gates]], [[Michael Flynn]], and [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]]. Charges were filed against American Richard Pinedo who assisted the Russians and lawyer [[Alex van der Zwaan]] as well as Paul Manafort associate [[Konstantin Kilimnik]]. Also indicted were Russian based [[Internet Research Agency]] and related organizations and individuals directed by [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]], and a group of Russian hackers referred to as Viktor Netyksho, et al.

Trump did not note that Mueller himself is a Republican, as is the man who appointed him, Rod Rosenstein—who was appointed by Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A frustrated Trump lashes out at special counsel Mueller|url=https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/19/08/30/frustrated-trump-lashes-out-at-special-counsel-mueller|publisher=[[Nine News]]|accessdate=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319010916/https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/19/08/30/frustrated-trump-lashes-out-at-special-counsel-mueller|archive-date=March 19, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time he had criticized Mueller by name, alarming many prominent Republicans, who cautioned Trump not to criticize Mueller or give any appearance that he was contemplating having Mueller dismissed; they warned of dire repercussions if he did. Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb later stated that the president "is not considering or discussing" firing Mueller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html|title=Trump Assails Mueller, Drawing Rebukes From Republicans|first=Peter|last=Baker|date=March 18, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905033418/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html|archive-date=September 5, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tempo''''' is an [[Indonesia]]n weekly magazine that covers news and politics. It was founded by [[Goenawan Mohamad]] and [[Yusril Djalinus]] and the first edition was published in March 6, 1971.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Indonesia: 'Tempo' cofounder dies of stroke |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=104219 |work=[[Jakarta Post]] |publisher=[[Asia Media]] |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2009-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418023356/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=104219 |archivedate=2009-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===New Order era===
Under the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] of President [[Suharto]], Information Minister [[Harmoko]] banned the publishing of ''Tempo'' magazine, along with two others, citing them as a threat to national stability. Publication of ''Tempo'' resumed following Suharto's departure from office. In response to the ban, a number of journalists established the [[Alliance of Independent Journalists]] (Aliansi Jurnalis Independen).

===Post New Order era===
The magazine has continued its independent position, and on 27 June 2010 published a story about police corruption, based on leaked documents showing that six senior police officers had bank accounts containing millions of dollars, in one case more than US$10 million, on monthly salaries of around US$1600. A few days later (6 July) the magazine's editorial offices in central [[Jakarta]] were firebombed by two black-clad men on a motorcycle. Little damage ensued but the attack was widely presumed to be linked to the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2580&amp;Itemid=202 The Test of Indonesia's Press Freedom], Asia Sentinel, 7 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours on the day the story broke, officials presumed to be connected with the police vainly tried to buy up all the copies of the offending story. Although they purchased 30,000 copies in central Jakarta, no other areas were affected, and vendors doubled the price of the much-in-demand remainder. ''Tempo'' simply printed and supplied its distributors with 30,000 replacement copies. The action only added to the publicity surrounding the story.

''Tempo'' 's previous editor-in-chief is Wahyu Muryadi. Since November 2012, the position replaced by Arif Zulkifli, the youngest editor in ''Tempo'' 's history.

''Tempo'' has evolved its internet presence with Tempo.co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempo.co/|title=Berita Terkini, Berita Hari Ini Indonesia dan Dunia - Tempo.co|author=|date=|website=www.tempo.co|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the weekly magazine, ''Tempo'' also publishes a daily newspaper, ''[[Koran Tempo]]''. It provides semi-investigative news about political and economic issues. The newspaper is only published in Indonesian but foreign readers can read other versions, including English, at Tempo.co. Its style of journalism is different from other Indonesian daily newspapers. ''Tempo'' provides news in the style of what they call 'the story behind the story'. So, what is served to the readers is not only current events, but also the story following and behind the news.

==Magazine==
''Tempo'' magazine is published in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. Starting from 12 September 2000, ''Tempo'' has also been published in English. Since its inception, the deputy editor-in-chief of the English edition of ''Tempo'' has been Yuli Ismartono, who during ''Tempo'''s ban was the vice-president of corporate communications for [[Freeport indonesia#Indonesian operations|Freeport Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcoworldwide.com/404|title=404|author=|date=|website=APCO Worldwide|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bouvier Affair''' is the name that art commentators have given to a number of international lawsuits that started in 2015, and subsequent events. The lawsuits allege that Swiss art shipper and dealer [[Yves Bouvier]] defrauded his clients by misrepresenting the original cost of art works and subsequently overcharging them. The affair has played out in courts in [[Monaco]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], the [[United States|US]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  
[[File:Yves Bouvier.jpg|thumb|Yves Bouvier]]

The alleged victims are "high net worth individuals" in the UK, the US, Asia and Europe, most notably Monaco-based Russian oligarch [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/monaco/11436640/Swiss-businessman-Yves-Bouvier-arrested-for-art-fraud.html|title=Monaco FC owner Rybolovlev among alleged victims of huge art scam|last=Mulholland|first=Rory|date=2015-02-26|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2018, Bouvier was facing criminal charges in France, Monaco and also in Switzerland after the Geneva Prosecutor opened a new case there. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bouvier-questioned-by-geneva-prosecutor-over-russian-art-deals&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background to the Bouvier Affair ==

=== Prior fraud allegations ===
Before 2015, Bouvier was primarily known in the market as an art transporter and [[curator]] through his company, Natural Le Coultre, and as a major shareholder and promoter of the [[free port|freeport]] concept.

==== Lorette Shefner ====
In 2008, he became embroiled in a legal case involving Lorette Shefner, a Canadian collector. Shefner's family claims that she was the victim of a complex fraud, whereby she was persuaded to sell a [[Chaim Soutine|Soutine]] painting at a price far below market value, only to see the work later sold to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC for a much higher price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/realcleararts/2015/03/bouvier-shenanigans-chapter-two-steve-cohen.html|title=Bouvier Shenanigans, Chapter Two: Steve Cohen|website=Real Clear Arts|language=en-US|accessdate=8 January 2016}}

A suit filed by the Shefner family in New York in 2013 named Bouvier as a co-defendant alongside Paris-based Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière. Bouvier strenuously denies the claims against him, arguing that it is purely circumstantial and not based on any solid evidence. His lawyers have argued that there is no case to answer. The case remains pending.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cases.justia.com/new-york/other-courts/2013-ny-slip-op-32934-u.pdf?ts=1385072189|title=Shefner v Jacques de la Beraudiere|website=Cases.justia.com|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bouvier is not the primary defendant, court documents from 2013 accuse him of having acted "in concert" with several experts "to disguise the true ownership" of pieces of art in order to defraud the Shefner estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.justia.com/new-york/other-courts/2013-ny-slip-op-32934-u.pdf?ts=1385072189|title=Shefner v Jacques de la Beraudiere|last=|first=|date=|website=Justicia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wolfgang Beltracchi forgery scandal ====
In 2013, it was revealed that Bouvier was implicated in the notorious case of [[Wolfgang Beltracchi]], a German [[Art forgery|forger]] who was convicted in 2011 of having defrauded a number of collectors, including [[Daniel Filipacchi]], of millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The $7 Million Fake: Forgery Scandal Embarrasses International Art World|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-7-million-fake-forgery-scandal-embarrasses-international-art-world-a-768195-2.html|newspaper =[[Der Spiegel]] |publisher=Spiegel Online|date = 13 June 2011|access-date = 8 January 2016|first = Sven|last = Röbel|first2 = Michael|last2 = Sontheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German daily Die Zeit, Bouvier founded in 2008 Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière together with art dealer Jacques de la Béraudière, who played a key role in the Beltracchi scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zeit.de/2013/18/kunstmarkt-steueroase-yves-bouvier/seite-2|title=Steueroase: Freihäfen seien keine Schmuggler-Höhlen, beteuert Bouvier|work=ZEIT ONLINE|access-date=2018-08-30|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and his ownership of an off-shore entity called Diva Fine Arts led to Bouvier also being connected to the Beltracchi case. He has, however, always denied any connection to Beltracchi and dismissed media coverage as uninformed speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Steueroase: Freihäfen seien keine Schmuggler-Höhlen, beteuert Bouvier|url = http://www.zeit.de/2013/18/kunstmarkt-steueroase-yves-bouvier|newspaper=[[ZEIT]] ONLINE|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catherine Hutin-Blay ====
In March 2015, Catherine Hutin-Blay, the step daughter of [[Pablo Picasso]] from his second wife Jacqueline, filed a complaint alleging that 58 separate works had been stolen from her. Hutin-Blay alleged that the works were stolen from a store in a suburb of Paris that is run by Art Transit, a Bouvier family company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/arts/article/2015/09/15/l-homme-d-affaires-yves-bouvier-mis-en-examen-pour-recel-de-deux-picasso-voles_4757968_1655012.html|title=L’homme d’affaires Yves Bouvier mis en examen pour recel de deux Picasso volés|last=Bellet|first=Harry|newspaper=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=8 January 2016|publisher=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/arts/design/the-billionaire-the-picassos-and-a-30-million-gift-to-shame-a-middleman.html|title=The Billionaire, the Picassos and a $30 Million Gift to Shame a Middleman|last=Carvajal|first=Doreen|date=23 September 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=8 January 2016|last2=Bowley|first2=Graham|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that Bouvier had sold two of the allegedly stolen Picasso paintings to Rybolovlev in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/the-bouvier-affair|title=The Art-World Insider Who Went Too Far|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rybolovlev handed over the paintings to French authorities in 2015.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Ryobolev-returns-paintings"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/25/russian-billionaire-picassos-art-dealer-feud|title=so Russian billionaire in art dealer feud hands over Picassos|last1=AFP|accessdate=3 February 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouvier denied any involvement in the thefts, but in September 2015 he was indicted by French authorities on charges of theft in relation to the discovery of two of the works by Picasso that Hutin-Blay alleged were stolen from her.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Bouvier-Charged"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11865015/Yves-Bouvier-charged-over-concealed-theft-of-Picasso-paintings.html|title=Yves Bouvier charged over 'concealed theft' of Picasso paintings|last1=Samuel|first1=Henry|accessdate=3 February 2016|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In court, Bouvier produced a document meant to certify that he paid Hutin-Blay for the two paintings, to the tune of $8 million, to a fund in [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Affaire-Rybolovlev-enquete-sur-Catherine-Hutin-et-revelations-exclusives-1362968|title=Affaire Rybolovlev : une héritière de Picasso liée au scandale.

Following several rounds of interviews with lawyers in Geneva, the case was dismissed in 2015,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tdg.ch/economie/Vaduz-classe-une-plainte-pour-blanchiment-visant-Yves-Bouvier/story/29735335|title=Vaduz classe une plainte pour blanchiment visant Yves Bouvier|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reopened in 2016 as Bouvier's associate Olivier Thomas came under renewed scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dealer-investigated-evidence-stolen-picassos-yves-bouvier-552458|title=New Evidence in Stolen Picassos Case - artnet News|date=2016-07-12|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allegations of money laundering ===
In late 2015, it emerged that Bouvier has been investigated by the authorities in Liechtenstein on suspicion of money laundering, in one instance related to a forged [[Max Ernst]] work, that is alleged to have been created by Wolfgang Beltracchi. However, Liechtenstein suspended its investigation in December 2015.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In September 2017, Bouvier was under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities amid allegations that he may have evaded more than 100 million Euros in taxes related to his cross-border art dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/yves-bouvier-swiss-tax-charges-1072205|title=Swiss Authorities Investigate 'Freeport King' Yves Bouvier for More Than $100 Million in Back Taxes|date=2017-09-06|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case ==
The Hutin-Blay case coincided with a separate case involving allegations made by Rybolovlev that forms the main part of the Yves Bouvier Affair. With the help of Yves Bouvier, Dmitry Rybolovlev accumulated one of the most spectacular art collections of modern times since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-31/art-world-s-1-billion-question-was-russian-a-victim-or-savant|title=Art’s $1 Billion Question: Was Russian a Victim or Savant?|last=Miller|first=Hugo|date=31 May 2016|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rybolovlev's art collection includes paintings by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] ''(Nude on a Blue Cushion)'', Pablo Picasso, [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Mark Rothko]] ''(No. 6)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.fr/actualites/articles/dmitry-rybolovlev-contre-yves-bouvier-le-piege-de-loligarque/27575#|title=Oligarque contre marchand d'art : révélations sur l'affaire qui faut trembler Monaco et la Suisse|last=Gattegno|first=Hervé|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-08-30|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monaco ===

==== Arrest ====
On 25 February 2015, Bouvier was indicted in Monaco on charges of fraud and complicity in money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/freeport-king-fails-in-appeal-against-monaco-criminal-charges-0|title=Freeport king fails in appeal against Monaco criminal charges|last=Ui-Hoon|first=Cheah|work=The Business Times|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges followed a criminal complaint made by Rybolovlev's [[family trust]] alleging that Bouvier had systematically overcharged it over a period of 10 years to acquire paintings.&lt;ref name="New-Yorker-Bouvier-affair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/08/the-bouvier-affair|title=A Reporter At Lage: The Bouvier Affair|last1=Knight|first1=Sam|accessdate=3 February 2016|journal=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Billionaire, the Dealer, and the $186 Million Rothko|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-27/a-186-million-rothko-pits-russian-tycoon-against-art-merchant |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher= Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 8 January 2016|first = Stephanie Baker StephaniBaker Hugo Miller|last = hugodmiller}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Steve Cohen's Modigliani In The Middle Of An Art Market War: Billionaire Rybolovlev vs Yves Bouvier|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2015/03/12/steve-cohens-modigliani-in-the-middle-of-an-art-market-war-billionaire-rybolovlev-vs-yves-bouvier/|work =[[Forbes]]|accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Russian billionaire's lawyers accused Bouvier of having misrepresented his role in obtaining 38 art pieces for $2 billion and having thus defrauded Rybolovlev to the tune of a little more than $1 billion,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using offshore companies to disguise his gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2015/03/12/steve-cohens-modigliani-in-the-middle-of-an-art-market-war-billionaire-rybolovlev-vs-yves-bouvier/#44420da65bd2|title=Steve Cohen's Modigliani In The Middle Of An Art Market War: Billionaire Rybolovlev vs Yves Bouvier|last=Fontevecchia|first=Agustino|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subsequent developments ====
After [[HSBC]] Monaco provided a letter during the police investigation that erroneously stated that Bouvier and a co-defendant, Tania Rappo, with whom he is accused to have conspired to launder money from his art deal proceeds, held joint accounts at the bank, Bouvier called for an investigation into that matter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-billionaires-battle-with-art-dealer-draws-in-hsbc-1447971694|title=Russian Billionaire’s Battle With Art Dealer Draws In HSBC|last=Letzing|first=John|date=2015-11-20|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-08-31|last2=Colchester|first2=Max|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; HSBC stated the error was "unintentional and clerical."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Allegations occurred in the French and Swiss press that Rybolovlev received help in arresting Bouvier from Monaco's justice minister, [[Philippe Narmino]], and Jean-Pierre Dreno, the state prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/82863/Monaco-gives-go-ahead-to-million-dollar-art-fraud-trial-between-Dmitry-Rybolovlev-and-Yves-Bouvier--#.W4luC5P7RTZ|title=Monaco gives go-ahead to million-dollar art fraud trial between Dmitry Rybolovlev and Yves Bouvier|last=Villarreal|first=Ignacio|website=artdaily.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tdg.ch/economie/vaduz-classe-plainte-blanchiment-visant-yves-bouvier/story/29735335|title=Vaduz classe une plainte pour blanchiment visant Yves Bouvier|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that basis, Bouvier and Rappo attempted to have the charges against them thrown out in November 2015, arguing that there were a number of irregularities in the legal procedure against them and that Rybolovlev may have exercised undue influence.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = Freeport king fails in appeal against Monaco criminal charges|url = http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/freeport-king-fails-in-appeal-against-monaco-criminal-charges-0|newspaper=[[Business Times (Singapore)|The Business Times]] |accessdate = 8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the judge rejected their argument.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Criminal proceedings are ongoing as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bouvier-questioned-by-geneva-prosecutor-over-russian-art-deals|title=Art Dealer Quizzed After Billionaire’s Fraud Complaint|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Singapore ===
On 12 March 2015, Rybolovlev sued Bouvier in [[Singapore]], asking for a global freeze on Bouvier's and Rappo's assets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 13 March, Senior Judge Lai Siu Chiu of the High Court of Singapore ordered the global freezing of Bouvier's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-court-idUSKBN0M90RH20150313|title=Singapore court orders asset freeze on 'Freeport King'|date=13 March 2017|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore Court of Appeal repealed the decision and ordered that Bouvier's assets be unfrozen, citing a low risk that Bouvier would dissipate his assets and that Rybolovlev failed to follow procedure in the injunction by not giving Bouvier notice of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/singapore-unfreezes-yves-bouviers-assets-327141|title=Singapore Court Unfreezes Bouvier's Assets - artnet News|date=2015-08-25|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the High Court of Singapore dismissed Bouvier's attempt to suspend the civil suit filed in the territory against him by two companies linked to the Rybolovlev family trust. Bouvier had argued the dispute should be fought in the Swiss courts.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/spore-court-to-hear-14b-art-suit|title=Singapore court to hear $1.4b art suit|last=hermes|access-date=26 March 2016|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a judgment published on 22 March 2016, Senior Judge Lai Siu Chiu ruled that the Singapore suit, which was filed in the High Court in 2015, should proceed. She said the case should be transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court, which deals specifically with cross-border commercial disputes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

On 18 April 2017, the Court of Appeal of Singapore again contradicted the High Court, ruling that Switzerland was a more appropriate forum for the civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="theartnespaper.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/yves-bouvier-clears-legal-hurdle-in-singapore|title=Yves Bouvier clears legal hurdle in Singapore|date=19 April 2017|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|access-date=25 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/russian-billionaire-loses-a-path-in-fight-with-free-port-king|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
Next to Singapore, Bouvier also had the assets of his [[Hong Kong]]-based company Mei Invest Limited frozen through an injunction in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/bouvier-emails-art-transactions-285751|title=Swiss Newspaper Gets Bouvier's Revealing Emails - artnet News|date=2015-04-08|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September that year, it was announced that a consent summons had been agreed upon between Bouvier and Accent Delight International Limited as well as Xitrans Finance Limited, two of Rybolovlev's companies. Subsequently, Bouvier's assets were unfrozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1855225/swiss-art-dealer-accused-raking-us1b-secret-profits-sales|title=Swiss art dealer's Hong Kong assets unfrozen amid court battle with Russian tycoon who accused him of swindling|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In New York, auction house Sotheby's got embroiled in the legal dispute in 2016 when the art dealers that had originally sold Da Vinci's [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|Salvator Mundi]] painting to Bouvier, learned that he had sold it to Rybolovlev at a much higher price. According to court papers, Sotheby's was asked to clarify whether it had been aware that the painting was worth more than what the art dealers had sold it to Bouvier for, and whether the auction house had misled the dealers in favor of the Swiss trader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/arts/design/sothebys-tries-to-block-suit-over-a-leonardo-sold-and-resold-at-a-big-markup.html|title=Sotheby’s Tries to Block Suit Over a Leonardo Sold and Resold at a Big Markup|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November that year, [[Sotheby's]] issued a pre-emptive suit in relation to the Salvator Mundi painting, denying that it had ever been part of a scheme allegedly perpetrated by Bouvier to defraud both the sellers of the painting, and Rybolovlev.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/sothebys-bouvier-rybolovlev-758348&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2018, the US District Court in [[New York City|New York]] granted Rybolovlev permission to access Sotheby's paperwork regarding its interactions with Bouvier for his ongoing lawsuits against the Swiss in Monaco and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/rybolovlev-bouvier-lawsuit-sothebys-1306292|title=Russian Billionaire Rybolovlev Wins Access to a Trove of Confidential Documents in His Ongoing Crusade Against Yves Bouvier {{!}} artnet News|date=2018-06-21|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another ongoing US investigation into Bouvier and his alleged involvement in fraudulent activities was dropped in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2018-05-29/russian-s-da-vinci-windfall-undercut-u-s-probe-of-art-dealer?__twitter_impression=true|title=Russian’s Da Vinci Windfall Undercut U.S. Probe of Art Dealer|last=Berthelsen|first=Christian|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2018, Rybolovlev sued Sotheby's for $380 million, alleging the auction house had "materially assisted the largest art fraud in history" and that Sotheby's "knowingly and intentionally made the fraud possible" because it was aware of how much Bouvier had paid the original sellers of the paintings later purchased by Rybolovlev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-02/billionaire-rybolovlev-slaps-sotheby-s-with-380-million-lawsuit|title=Billionaire Slaps Sotheby's With $380 Million Lawsuit|last=Kazakina|first=Katya|date=3 October 2018|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotheby's called these allegations "baseless" and told ''[[Reuters]]'' it would seek to have the lawsuit dismissed in a New York court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-art-sotheby-s-rybolovlev/russian-tycoon-sues-sothebys-for-380-million-over-art-deals-idUSKCN1MD1Y1|title=Russian tycoon sues Sotheby's for $380 million over art deals|last=Devitt|first=Polina|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the Bouvier Affair ==
The Bouvier Affair has been widely reported and followed across the art world and beyond as one of the biggest scandals in the sector to date as it laid bare "the exploitation of art for financial gain"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/147192/modern-art-serves-rich|title=How Modern Art Serves the Rich|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put a spotlight on the often ethically blurry business behaviors of middlemen in the notoriously opaque art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-07/geneva-free-ports-king-mulls-art-fight-s-nearly-1-billion-toll|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/13/art-scandal-threatens-to-expose-mass-fraud-in-global-art-market.html|title=Art scandal may expose mass fraud in art market|last=Frank|first=Robert|date=2015-03-13|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have opined that the unfolding events could be the catalyst for a renewed push to reform the art sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Does the art market need more regulation? - Apollo Magazine|url = http://www.apollo-magazine.com/does-the-art-market-need-more-regulation/|website=Apollo-magazine.com|accessdate = 8 January 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, through the introduction of guarantees for vendors of highly valued works of art. Furthermore, the private art sales market is expected to take a hit following the public exposure of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/analysis/what-will-2018-hold-for-the-art-market|title=What will 2018 hold for the art market?|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Francis Bacon Opera''''' is a comic [[chamber opera]] in one act composed by [[Stephen Crowe (composer)|Stephen Crowe]]. The [[libretto]] is based on Crowe's transcript of [[Melvyn Bragg]]'s interview with the British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], filmed for ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' in 1985. The opera was first performed in its final version on 8 August 2012 in London, and went on to win the Hilton Edwards Award in May 2013.

==Background and performance history==
The opera is scored for two solo singers ([[tenor]]s) and a piano, and has a running time of 55 minutes. The libretto is derived from three portions of a documentary devoted to Francis Bacon which was filmed in 1985 for ''[[The South Bank Show]]''. In the episode, Melvin Bragg interviewed Bacon over a lengthy wine-fuelled lunch in a London restaurant. Bragg later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Francis Bacon and myself appeared on the ''Southbank Show'' and for a few minutes were caught in a state of naked inebriation, it provided I think, an insight into Francis as a man and as a painter. So I left it in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, Melvyn (2010). ''The South Bank Show: Final Cut'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNdaRKqOU18C&amp;pg=PT266&amp;lpg=PT266&amp;dq=francis+bacon+south+bank+show+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nEAlOnOOAa&amp;sig=XS6K1Tdsba8-Pnlxq66cCnOjTu8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-KcwUZywI-Wa0QXy2oDoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y Chapter 8: "Francis Bacon (1985)"].

''The Francis Bacon Opera'' was performed as "a work in progress" at the [[Grimeborn|Grimeborn Opera Festival]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, Keith (15 August 2011), [http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/opera/E8831313395243/Grimeborn+returns+to+the+Arcola+Theatre+.html "Grimeborn returns to the Arcola Theatre"].[[whatsonstage.com]].  Retrieved 1 March 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the opera, directed by the composer, was first performed on 8 August 2012 at the [[Camden Arts Centre]], London, with subsequent performances at the [[Courtauld Gallery]], [[Tête à Tête (opera company)|Tête à Tête Opera Festival]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], [[The James Joyce Centre]], [[National Portrait Gallery, London|The National Portrait Gallery]] and The [[Hugh Lane Gallery]], which houses Bacon's studio, having been relocated from London to Dublin in 2001.&lt;ref name = "Picard" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Scotsman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Michael (25 August 2012).

'''The Susso''' is an Australian slang term referring to "sustenance" ([[welfare]]) payments, especially during the [[Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression]]. "Susso" could also be used as a noun, for someone depending on such payments,&lt;ref&gt;Ramson, W. S. ''The Australian National Dictionary'' p.652 Oxford University Press 1988 {{ISBN|0-19-554736-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; often unsympathetically.

==Background==

By late 1929, the economic depression had hit all western countries.

== Causes ==

The prices of wool and wheat - two of the nation’s biggest exports had been in rapid decline. Overseas investments and loans started to disappear. As money became tight, there was a large decrease on spending on public work, which led to an increase in unemployment. 
The unemployment was further exacerbated by the falling income from primary producers. At the end of 1929, Australia's unemployment 
rate sat at around 13%. By 1932, it had peaked at a staggering 29%.

== Effects ==

Though the downturn in the economy had a much greater effect on the lives of the poor, not even the very rich could ignore the situation, as evidence of the Depression could be found everywhere. It was seen in the [[Unemployment benefits#Australia|dole]] queues, [[Soup kitchen#History|soup kitchens]] doling out [[Staple food|staple]], filling foods, such as bread and potatoes, and [[shanty town]]s that sprang up across the nation. The Depression was illustrated by the estimated 40,000 homeless who had to create makeshift accommodation in public parks and fields and by the men that went wandering - "on the track" - in search of work during this time, or even food, known as [[swagmen]]. These men - estimated to be somewhere around 30,000 in numbers, had to report to a police station every week, where they could claim very basic rations of food.

== The susso ==

By 1932, more than 60,000 people depended on sustenance payments - known as "the susso", merely to survive. This was only for the truly destitute, who had been unemployed for a sustained period of time, and had no assets or savings. Relief was State-based - in [[South Australia]] it was in the form of rations and vouchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55933644 A Wife Intervenes] ''The Mail (Adelaide)'' 7 August 1937 p.7 accessed 25 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when the basic wage was £2/11/8d,&lt;!-- 1/4d per hour for 40hrs --&gt; "the susso" in [[Queensland]] was 3s. to 4/6d per child. "Many spend more than that on a dog", one speaker was quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41786529 Actual Poverty in Land of Plenty] ''Cairns Post'' Saturday 7 November 1936 p.6 accessed 25 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;£2/11/8d and 3s. translate to around $800 and $45 in today's money.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was immortalised in a contemporary children’s rhyme (probably based on "[[You're in the Army Now (song)|You're in the Army Now]]", a [[World War I]] song featured in [[intertitles]] of the 1925 [[King Vidor]] silent film ''[[The Big Parade]]''):
:"We’re on the susso now,
:We can’t afford a cow,
:We live in a tent,
:We pay no rent,
:We’re on the susso now."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, J. ''All Things Wild'' p.7 cited in ''The Australian National Dictionary'' Ed. W. S. Ramson, Oxford University Press 1988 {{ISBN|0-19-554736-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triplemanía XXII''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) produced by the [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]]. It took place on August 17, 2014, at [[Mexico City Arena|Arena Ciudad de México]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. The event was the twenty-second annual [[Triplemanía]], which is AAA's biggest show of the year, airing in Mexico as a regular PPV and internationally as an internet pay-per-view (iPPV). This was the first AAA PPV event to be broadcast simultaneously in English through SAP, having [[Hugo Savinovich]] and [[Vampiro]] as announcers.

[[Alberto Del Rio]], who was fired from [[WWE]] more than a week prior, made an appearance at the event. WWE wrestler [[Rey Mysterio]] also appeared in a video package to end the show. [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Ricochet (wrestler)|Ricochet]] were advertised for the event, but both missed the event due to travel issues.

==Production==

===Background===
In early 1992 [[Antonio Peña]] was working as a booker and storyline writer for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to ''[[lucha libre]]''. He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA, or Triple A; Spanish for "Assistance, Consulting, and Administration" later renamed [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]]). After making a deal with the ''Televisa'' television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992.&lt;ref name=SLOrbit&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2006/10/07/el-fin-de-una-era/| title= El fin de una era| date= October 7, 2006 | accessdate= October 14, 2009 | author= Ocampo, Ernesto | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Peña and AAA held their first [[Triplemanía]] event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's [[Super Bowl]] event, similar to the [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] being the biggest show of the year.&lt;ref name=background&gt;{{cite web|title=Triplemanía XXII será de nuevo en la Ciudad de México|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2014/02/18/triplemania-xxii-sera-de-nuevo-en-la-ciudad-de-mexico|accessdate=July 16, 2014|language=Spanish|website=mediotiempo.com|publisher=Grupo Expansión}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizarre and honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=A family affair|pages=128–132|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Triplemanía was the 22nd year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 26th overall show under the Triplemanía banner. In February 2014, it was announced that Triplemanía XXII would be held in the [[Mexico City Arena|Arena Ciudad de México]] in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], for the third consecutive year; this would be the eighth time that Mexico City would host Triplemanía.&lt;ref name=background/&gt;

There were multiple options to watch Triplemanía XXII: via traditional [[pay-per-view]] on the [[SKY México|SKY]] television service at $229 ([[Mexican peso]]) for [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] and $298 for [[High-definition television|high-definition]], or via Internet pay-per-view (iPPV) at $194.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angelita|first1=Dark|title=AAA – Triplemania XXII: Los pormenores de la conferencia de prensa TMXXII|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/08/06/aaa-triplemania-xxii-los-pormenores-de-la-conferencia-de-prensa-tmxxii|language=Spanish|publisher=SuperLuchas|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the seventh year Triplemanía would be available through SKY.

===Storylines===
The Triplemanía XXII show featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

AAA frequently has eight person tag team matches open their major events, usually featuring on each team a high-flying wrestler, a female ''luchadora'', an [[exótico]] (in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]]) and a ''[[Mini-Estrella]]''. The opening match for Triplemanía XXII featured two feuds, one between former team-mates of the [[Real Fuerza Aérea]] faction, [[Aero Star]] and [[Súper Fly]], and another feud between [[Pimpinela Escarlata]] and [[Mamba (wrestler)|Mamba]].&lt;ref name=WVpre&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature: Josh Boutwell previews Triplemania XXII TONIGHT|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/featured-articles/50216|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAApreview&gt;{{cite web|title=Triplemania XXII: Cartel Completo|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticiasaaa/item/1629-tripleman%C3%ADa-xxii-cartel-completo.html|accessdate=July 13, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second match on the card had a complicated buildup. Bengala won an elimination match to become the number one contender to Daga's AAA Cruiserweight Championship. However, after AAA Fusión Champion Fenix pinned Daga in a six-man tag team match, Fenix also wanted to challenge for Daga's title, and he was willing to put his own title on the line at the same time. Daga agreed to the title challenges, after-which a multi-man elimination match to unify the AAA Cruiserweight and AAA Fusión Championship was set up for Triplemanía XXII, with several other wrestlers added to the match as well; those being [[Angélico]], Australian Suicide, [[El Hijo del Fantasma]], [[Jack Evans (wrestler)|Jack Evans]], [[Joe Líder]], [[Pentagón Jr]] and [[Ricochet (wrestler)|Ricochet]].&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt;

The third match, for the [[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship]], was set up when [[Taya Valkyrie|Taya]] won a number one contender elimination match in June 2014 over [[Cynthia Moreno]], La Jarochita, La Magnifica, [[Mari Apache]], Sexy Lady and [[Sexy Star]]. Taya was described to have been feuding with champion [[Faby Apache]] "for quite some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wrestleview.com/featured-articles/48892-feature-viva-la-raza-lucha-weekly-for-6-7-14|title=Feature: Viva La Raza! Lucha Weekly for 6/7/14|last=Boutwell|first=Josh|date=June 7, 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2015|work=wrestleview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth match, where the last wrestler to escape the cage would lose his mask or hair, had little buildup. The storyline leading into the match was [[Jeff Jarrett]]'s rivalry against Mexican wrestlers. [[Blue Demon Jr]], [[Electroshock (wrestler)|Electro Shock]] and La Parka represented the ''técnicos'' of ''Ejercito AAA'', while [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Chessman (wrestler)|Chessman]] and Jarrett being the ''rudos''.&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAApreview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valdés|first1=Apolo|title=El cartel de Triplemanía XXII|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/editoriales/apolo-valdes/2014/08/el-cartel-de-triplemania-xxii|website=mediotiempo.com|publisher=Grupo Expansión|accessdate=July 16, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; To set up the match, Jarrett attacked Electro Shock with a guitar and drew blood in [[Querétaro]] in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angelita|first1=Dark|title=AAA – Triplemanía XXII: Lo que se espera de la Lucha en jaula|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/07/31/aaa-triplemania-xxii-lo-que-se-espera-de-la-lucha-en-jaula|publisher=SuperLuchas|accessdate=July 16, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-way match originally promoted as second to the main event was for the Copa Triplemanía XXII, and also featured little buildup. This would be [[Myzteziz]]'s first major event for AAA since his in-ring debut, and he would once again face one of his hottest rivals, [[Perro Aguayo Jr.]] AAA announced a surprise entrant for the match, which was revealed as [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] in his return to the promotion. Wagner Jr. started a rivalry with the final entrant, [[Cibernético]], heading into the match.&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAApreview/&gt;

For the match originally promoted as the main event, the feud between [[Psycho Clown]] and [[Texano Jr.]] began due to the rivalry between their respective factions, ''Los Psycho Circus'' and ''El Consejo''.&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt; Psycho Clown had twice challenged for Texano Jr's [[AAA Mega Championship]], but lost twice due to the referees cheating on behalf of Texano Jr.&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAApreview/&gt; Despite the AAA Mega Championship not being on the line at Triplemanía XXII, the meeting of the duo was described as "the ultimate match of respect between luchadors" due to the ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'' conditions, where the loser must forfeit his hair (for Texano Jr) or his mask (for Psycho Clown).&lt;ref name=WVpre/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAApreview/&gt; The feud was seen as a continuation of the historical feud between ''[[Alvarado wrestling family|Los Brazos]]'' and ''[[Los Misioneros de la Muerte]]'', as Psycho Clown is a descendant of [[Brazo de Plata]] of the Alvarado Nieves generation, while Texano Jr. is the son of [[El Texano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=El Memo Pacheco|title=Texano Jr. vs Psycho Clown: Misioneros vs Brazos versión moderna|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/07/21/texano-jr-vs-psycho-clown-misioneros-vs-brazos-version-moderna/|publisher=SuperLuchas|accessdate=July 16, 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alberto Del Rio]] was fired by [[WWE]] on August 7, 2014, with the promotion citing his "unprofessional conduct and an altercation with an employee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oster|first1=Aaron|title=WWE fires Alberto Del Rio|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-08-08/sports/bal-wwe-fires-alberto-del-rio-aaa-20140807_1_sheamus-alberto-del-rio-cm-punk|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Meltzer]] of ''The Wrestling Observer'' reported that "the story going around" was that Del Rio had slapped a manager of [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meltzer|first1=Dave|title=WWE News: More details on Alberto Del Rio firing|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/38362|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713180318/http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe/38362|website=f4wonline.com|archivedate=July 13, 2015|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Rio later said that he reacted to what he felt was a racist comment by a fellow employee by demanding an apology. When the employee responded by smiling, Del Rio slapped him. Del Rio was later ashamed of his reaction but vowed to uphold his own dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fui víctima de racismo: Alberto del Río|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2014/08/16/fui-victima-de-racismo-alberto-del-rio|accessdate=July 22, 2015|website=mediotiempo.com|publisher=Grupo Expansión}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, WWE's [[Twitter]] account released a message stating that Del Rio "is responsible for his own actions. If you're angry at anyone, be angry at Alberto. There's no excuse for a pro athlete not to conduct themselves in a professional manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caldwell|first1=James|title=WWE calls out Alberto Del Rio post-release|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_80053.shtml|website=pwtorch.com|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the firing, Del Rio was announced to appear at Triplemanía XXII,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rey Mysterio update|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87557|website=pwinsider.com|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not wrestle, due to a 90-day non-compete clause imposed by WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Emmanuel|title=Cláusula impediría a Alberto del Río luchar en Triplemanía XXII|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2014/08/14/clausula-impediria-a-alberto-del-rio-luchar-en-triplemania-xxii|website=mediotiempo.com|publisher=Grupo Expansión|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Rio previously took part in [[Triplemanía X]] in 2002, as Dos Caras Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luchalibreaaa.com/noticiasaaa/item/1653-alberto-del-r%C3%ADo-en-tripleman%C3%ADa-xxii.html|title=Alberto del Río en Triplemanía XXII|date=August 11, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2014|work=[[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
Triplemanía began with the returning Alberto Del Rio, billed as El Patron Alberto talking about his departure from WWE and the racism within it, before he was interrupted by [[Konnan]] and [[El Hijo del Perro Aguayo]] A physical altercation occurred starting with El Patron's father, [[Dos Caras]], being assaulted, but El Patron fended off the attackers. In another non-match event, the AAA Hall of Fame welcomed new inductees [[El Brazo]] and [[Rayo de Jalisco Sr.]]; with the ceremony being interrupted by El Hjo del Perro Aguayo. Meanwhile, Jeff Jarett and Ricochet both missed the event despite being slated to wrestle, with both apologizing for having problems with their airline providers.&lt;ref name=InsiderResults&gt;{{cite web|title=Complete AAA Triplemania results and more: the Lucha Report|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=87676|website=pwinsider.com|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|last1=López|first1=Adrián|title="Perra" noche en Triplemania XXII|url=http://www.espn.com.co/news/story/_/id/2158139/perra-noche-en-triplemania-xxii|publisher=[[ESPN Latin America]]|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aero Star's team won the opening match when Mascarita Sagrada submitted Mini Abismo Negro.&lt;ref name=ViewResults/&gt;

The order of elimination for the second match was firstly [[Drago (wrestler)|Drago]] (substituting for Ricochet), Jack Evans, Joe Lider, Australian Suicide, Bengala, Pentagon Jr, (AAA Fusión Champion) Fenix and then (AAA Cruiserweight Champion) Daga. Finally, Hijo del Fantasma used a variant of a piledriver on Angelico to win the match and the new AAA World Cruiserweight Championship.&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAresults&gt;{{cite web|title=Triplemania XXII: Noche De Leyenda|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/eventos-magnos/triplemania/item/1659-noche-de-leyenda-en-tripleman%C3%ADa-xxii.html|accessdate=July 13, 2015|work=[[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SuperResults&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vela|first1=Eduardo Cano|title=AAA Triplemania 22 (Cobertura y resultados 17/8/14)|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/08/17/aaa-triplemania-22-cobertura-y-resultados-17814-alberto-el-patron-llega-aaa/|publisher=SuperLuchas|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third match saw Taya defeating Fabi Apache to capture Apache's AAA Reina de Reinas Championship after a [[Northern Lights suplex]], a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stomp|stomp variant]], and help from ''rudo'' referee Hijo del Tirantes. The match was described as "full of screwiness" due to Tirantes, Sexy Star and Hijo del Fantasma. Valkyrie, the first foreigner to win this title, suffered a broken nose in this match.&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=ViewResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAresults/&gt;&lt;ref name=SuperResults/&gt;

The fourth match saw Electroshock losing his hair as he lost a steel cage match when El Mesias (substituting for Jeff Jarrett, in his return after a near-eight month absence) escaped the cage after using a double knee backbreaker from the top rope on Electroshock. Prior to that, the order of escape was first La Parka Jr, then Averno, Blue Demon Jr, and Chessman. The match was described as "a total bloodbath full of wild spots".&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angelita|first1=Dark|title=AAA – "Me siento muy feliz de regresar de nuevo a mi casa": El Mesías|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/08/25/aaa-siento-muy-feliz-de-regresar-de-nuevo-mi-casa-el-mesias/|publisher=SuperLuchas|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electroshock rapado, no libró 'La Jaula' ante El Mesías|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2014/08/18/electroshock-rapado-no-libro-la-jaula-ante-el-mesias|accessdate=July 22, 2015|first1=Emmanuel|last1=Gutiérrez|website=mediotiempo.com|publisher=Grupo Expansión|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth match resulted in Texano Jr.being shaved of his hair in the ring after losing to Psycho Clown, who pinned him after a ''[[Flip piledriver|Canadian Destroyer]]'' of the top rope through a table. Texano Jr.enjoyed help from Rafael "El Maya" and Hijo del Fantasma, forcing AAA's commissioner Fantasma to expel them from the ringside area. The match was described as "another bloodbath full of table spots and unprotected chair shots to the head". AAA described the result being that Psycho Clown "rompió la maldición de [[Alvarado wrestling family|los Alvarado]]" (broke the curse of Alvarado).&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=ViewResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAresults/&gt; The feud ended with a handshake between the duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vela|first1=Eduardo Cano|title=Psycho Clown rapa a Texano Jr.en AAA Triplemania 22|url=https://superluchas.com/2014/08/17/texano-jr-rapado-en-aaa-triplemania-22/|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event four-way elimination match saw blood from Dr Wagner Jr.and Mysteziz. Cibernetico eliminated Dr Wagner Jr.first after a chokeslam. Then, Mysteziz submitted Cibernetico by applying La Mistica. Finally, Perro Aguayo Jr.[[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blow]]ed Mysteziz to win the Copa Triplemanía XXII. After the match, El Patron stormed the ring to brawl with Perro Aguayo Jr; with El Patron emerging from the brawl dominant.&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref name=ViewResults/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triplemania Notes: Alberto Del Rio appears, Rey Mysterio video|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/101-mexico/38525|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713090120/http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/101-mexico/38525|archivedate=July 13, 2015|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show ended with a video of Rey Mysterio (still contracted to WWE at the time) stating that he would return to AAA "soon".&lt;ref name=InsiderResults/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_80274.shtml|title=Triplemania news: Current WWE star Mysterio teases jump to AAA, Del Rio talks racism in first post-WWE promo|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2014|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
21,000 people attended the event in the [[Mexico City Arena|Arena Ciudad de México]].&lt;ref name=TMXXII/&gt;&lt;ref name=TMXXIIPWI/&gt;&lt;ref name=WONResults/&gt;

Josh Boutwell of wrestleview.com praised the opener as "very good", the Cruiserweight title match as "a great, high flying match with tons of action", and the Mask vs. Hair match as "awesome". However, Boutwell was critical of the cage match as "a disaster from the start" and the commentators including Vampiro, which Boutwell described as "one of the worst commentators in the history of wrestling". Lastly, Boutwell blasted the iPPV's "horrible stream" where he "was never able to see more than 1 minute uninterrupted of the stream before [he] gave up on the live show. It is beyond pathetic that after an entire year from the horrible disaster of last year's TripleMania stream this happens."&lt;ref name=ViewResults/&gt;

Adrián López of ESPN.com gave his views on some of the matches, stating that the main event showed the hatred between the competitors, while the penultimate match was an epic struggle and the women's match was dramatic, vibrant and exciting.&lt;ref name=ESPN/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Triplemanía XXII was Perro Aguayo Jr's final Triplemanía event, as he died in late March 2015 at the age of 35. Aguayo Jr. died after wrestling a match in Tijuana, Mexico for a promotion called The Crash; he was teaming with [[T.J. Perkins|Manik]] against [[Tigre Uno|Extreme Tiger]] and Rey Mysterio Jr. Initial reports stated that the cause of death was cervical spine trauma at the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullen|first1=Jethro|title=Mexican wrestling star Hijo del Perro Aguayo dies after kick in ring|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/22/americas/mexico-wrestling-hijo-del-perro-aguayo-death/|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/101-mexico/41727 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113343/http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/101-mexico/41727 | title=Perro Aguayo Jr. passes away in Tijuana hospital after match last night (Updated) | archivedate=April 2, 2015 | date=March 21, 2015 | accessdate=July 13, 2015 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Patrón Alberto had his first return match for AAA on September 14, 2014 in a six-man tag match, teaming with La Parka and Myzteziz to defeat [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], Perro Aguayo Jr.and Texano Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luchalibreaaa.com/resultados/item/1721-hard-rock-hotel-riviera-maya.html | title = Resultados de Ring &amp; Rock StAAArs 3, Quintana Roo | accessdate=July 13, 2015 | work=[[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, 2014 at [[Guerra de Titanes (2014)|Guerra de Titanes]], Alberto defeated Texano Jr.to win the [[AAA Mega Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2014/12/07/el-patron-es-el-nuevo-megacampeon-de-aaa/|title=El Patrón es el nuevo Megacampeón de AAA|last=Hernandez|first=Kennedy|date=December 7, 2014|accessdate=July 13, 2015|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vassa''' ({{lang-pi|vassa-|script=Latn}}, {{lang-sa|varṣa-|script=Latn}}, both "rain") is the three-month annual [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] observed by [[Theravada]] practitioners. Taking place during the [[wet season]], Vassa lasts for three [[lunar month]]s, usually from July (the [[Burmese calendar|Burmese month]] of Waso, {{my|ဝါဆို}}) to October (the Burmese month of Thadingyut {{my|သီတင်းကျွတ်}}).&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhismglossaryv/g/Vassadef.htm Vassa] at [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, Vassa is often glossed as '''Rains Retreat'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Vassa/id/578909 |title=Vassa |access-date=2010-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323201202/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Vassa/id/578909 |archive-date=2010-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Buddhist Lent''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/n003.htm|title=Shwedagon Pagoda marks the start of Buddhist Lent this week|last=Thein|first=Cherry|date=July 14–20, 2008|work=The Myanmar Times|accessdate=15 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921104822/http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/n003.htm|archive-date=21 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter by analogy to the [[Lent|Christian Lent]] (which Vassa predates by at least five centuries).

For the duration of Vassa, monastics remain in one place, typically a [[monastery|monasteries]] or temple grounds.&lt;ref name="access"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html#rains  Lay Buddhist Practice - The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/was-vassa-tf/ Was (Thai) Vassa]&lt;/ref&gt; In some monasteries, monks dedicate the Vassa to intensive [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="access"/&gt; Some Buddhist lay people choose to observe Vassa by adopting more ascetic practices, such as giving up meat, alcohol, or smoking.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;  While Vassa is sometimes casually called "Buddhist [[Lent]]", others object to this terminology.&lt;ref name="access"/&gt; Commonly, the number of years a monk has spent in monastic life is expressed by counting the number of vassas (or ''rains'') since [[upasampada|ordination]].

Most [[Mahayana]] Buddhists do not observe Vassa, though [[Vietnamese Thiền]] and [[Korean Seon]] monastics observe an equivalent retreat of three months of intensive practice in one location, a practice also observed in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Vassa begins on the first day of the waning moon of the eighth lunar month, which is the day after [[Asalha Puja]] or Asalha [[Uposatha]] ("Dhamma day"). It ends on [[Pavarana]], when all monastics come before the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] and atone for any offense that might have been committed during Vassa.

Vassa is followed by [[Kathina]], a festival in which the [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|laity]] expresses gratitude to monks.&lt;ref name="kathina"&gt;[http://www.viet.net/~anson/ebud/ebdha086.htm Vassa (Rains Retreat) and Kathina (Robe Offering) Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=6,9375,0,0,1,0 Vassa, The Rains Retreat]&lt;/ref&gt; Lay Buddhists bring donations to temples, especially new robes for the monks.&lt;ref name="kathina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/holydays/kathina.shtml Kathina] at [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassa tradition predates the time of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; It was a long-standing custom for [[sramana|mendicant ascetics]] in India not to travel during the rainy season as they may unintentionally harm crops, insects or even themselves during their travels.&lt;ref name="access"/&gt; Many Buddhist ascetics live in regions which lack a rainy season.&lt;ref name="tv"/&gt; Consequently, there are places where Vassa may not be typically observed.&lt;ref name="tv"/&gt;

'''Years of potential life lost''' ('''YPLL''') or '''potential years of life lost''' ('''PYLL'''), is an estimate of the [[average]] years a person would have lived if he or she had not died prematurely.&lt;ref name=homes&gt;{{cite web|author=Gardner JW|author2=Sanborn JS |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=2083312&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;indexed=google|title=Years of potential life lost (YPLL)—what does it measure?|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, a measure of premature [[death|mortality]]. As an alternative to [[mortality rate|death rates]], it is a method that gives more weight to deaths that occur among younger people. An alternative is to consider the effects of both disability and premature death using [[disability adjusted life years]].

== Calculation ==

To calculate the years of potential life lost, the analyst has to set an upper reference age. The reference age should correspond roughly to the life expectancy of the population under study. In the developed world, this is commonly set at age 75, but it is essentially arbitrary. Thus, PYLL should be written with respect to the reference age used in the calculation: e.g., PYLL[75].

PYLL can be calculated using individual level data or using age grouped data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario |title=Calculating Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) |url=http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=190 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164746/http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=190 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, for the individual method, each person's PYLL is calculated by subtracting the person's age at death from the reference age. If a person is older than the reference age when he or she dies, that person's PYLL is set to zero (i.e., there are no "negative" PYLLs). In effect, only those who die before the reference age are included in the calculation. Some examples:

# Reference age = 75; Age at death = 60; PYLL[75] = 75 − 60 = 15
# Reference age = 75; Age at death = 6 months; PYLL[75] = 75 − 0.5 = 74.5
# Reference age = 75; Age at death = 80; PYLL[75] = 0 (age at death greater than reference age)

To calculate the PYLL for a particular population in a particular year, the analyst sums the individual PYLLs for all individuals in that population who died in that year. This can be done for all-cause mortality or for cause-specific mortality.

== Significance ==

In the developed world, mortality counts and rates tend to emphasise the most common causes of death in older people because the risk of death increases with age. Because PYLL gives more weight to deaths among younger people, it is the favoured metric among those who wish to draw attention to those causes of death that are more common in younger people. Some researchers say that this measurement should be considered by governments when they decide how best to divide up scarce resources for research.&lt;ref name="pmid15655548"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burnet NG, Jefferies SJ, Benson RJ, Hunt DP, Treasure FP |title=Years of life lost (YLL) from cancer is an important measure of population burden—and should be considered when allocating research funds |journal=Br. J. Cancer |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=241–5 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15655548 |pmc=2361853 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602321 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in most of the developed world, heart disease and cancer are the leading causes of death, as measured by the number (or rate) of deaths. For this reason, heart disease and cancer tend to get a lot of attention (and research funding). However, one might argue that everyone has to die of something eventually, and so public health efforts should be more explicitly directed at preventing ''premature'' death. When PYLL is used as an explicit measure of premature death, then injuries and infectious diseases, become more important. While the most common cause of death of young people aged 5 to 40 is injury and poisoning in the developed world, because relatively few young people die, the principal causes of lost years remain [[Cardiovascular disease| cardiovascular disease]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2008/pdf/chorep_summary_08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121024116/http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2008/pdf/chorep_summary_08.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}Page 54 Retrieved 17 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report of the NSW Chief Medical Officer in 2002 indicates that cardiovascular disease (32.7% (of total Males Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality) and 36.6% of females YLL) and [[malignant neoplasm]]s (27.5% of Males YLL and 31.2% of Females YLL) are the main causes of lost years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/public-health/chorep02/bod/bod_YLLcateg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070613213424/http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/public-health/chorep02/bod/bod_YLLcateg.htm |archivedate=13 June 2007 |df= }} Retrieved=17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[disability adjusted life years]] are considered, [[cancer]] (25.1/1,000), [[cardiovascular disease]] (23.8/1,000), [[mental health]] issues (17.6/1,000), [[neurological disorders]] (15.7/1,000), chronic [[respiratory disease]] (9.4/1,000) and [[diabetes]] (7.2/1,000) are the main causes of good years of expected life lost to disease or premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2008/pdf/chorep_summary_08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121024116/http://mhcs.health.nsw.gov.au/pubs/2008/pdf/chorep_summary_08.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}Retrieved=17 January 2009 Page 53&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic difference is in the greater number of years of disability caused [[mental illness]] and neurological issues and by [[diabetes]].
