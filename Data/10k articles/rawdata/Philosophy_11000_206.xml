      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3906">'''Abba Mari ben Eligdor''' (also called '''Sen '''(or '''Senior''')''' Astruc de Noves''') was a distinguished [[Talmudist]], an eminent philosopher, and an able physicist and astronomer who flourished in the fourteenth century in [[Salon-de-Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La communauté juive de Salon-de-Provence d'après les actes notariés 1391–1435 |first=Monique |last=Wernham |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |year=1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0t4VFU1nTIC&amp;pg=PA3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1335, he was already very old (Samuel of Marseilles, in "Écrivains Juifs," p.&amp;nbsp;562, according to which the note in "Rev. Ét. Juives," ix. 59, must be corrected). Of the many writings of Abba Mari, who, according to his contemporary, [[Isaac de Lattes]], wrote commentaries on the [[Pentateuch]], Job, parts of the [[Talmud]], and [[Pirḳe de-Rabbi Eliezer]], as well as works on physics, logic, and metaphysics, merely fragments are extant, and these in manuscript only. His commentary on Job is found in several European libraries; it is not a commentary in an exegetical or historical sense, but is full of philosophical disquisitions upon the Biblical theodicy.

The existence of Job is doubted by Abba Mari, as by some of the Talmudic rabbis. He says that, at any rate, the book bearing his name was not written by Job, as some authorities in the Talmud admit, but by Moses. Job's four friends represent in their personalities four different views of evil in the world. Eliphaz, representative of tradition, denies altogether the reality of evil, in agreement with Deut. xxxii. 4. Bildad, on the other hand, does not deny its reality, but holds, as-if he had been the loyal disciple of the old rabbis and [[Motazilites]], that God allows the just to suffer here in order to reward them the more in the future life. Zophar, too, considers evil a reality; with the Ascharites, with whom many rabbis agree, he insists on man's ignorance of the divine will, which finite man ought not to investigate. Elihu is of the same opinion as Eliphaz, but with the difference that what Eliphaz accepts as a matter of faith, Elihu demonstrates philosophically. It can thus be seen that Abba Mari was a loyal student of [[Maimonides]], and that, like him, he considered revelation and true philosophy as identical. Whether a philosophical and allegorical commentary on the Song of Songs, in manuscript in the Cambridge and Oxford libraries and ascribed to him, is really his, or should be credited to [[Moses of Narbonne]], with whom Abba Mari is elsewhere confounded, is uncertain. The same doubt holds concerning the Hebrew translation of Gazzali's "Tendencies of Philosophers," which is ascribed to Abba Mari, but possibly also belongs to the aforesaid Moses. But there is no reason for Steinschneider's doubt concerning a Munich manuscript, containing the introduction to the first book of Euclid, with the superscription, "Written by Abba Mari, philosopher and teacher of truth."; it certainly belongs to our Abba Mari, and the words Abba Mari are not to be translated "My Lord and Father," for these two words would otherwise have their proper place at the beginning and not at the end of the sentence. Abba Mari also wrote "Refutations," in which he assailed [[Joseph Caspi]]'s "Book of Secrets." This book, with the exception of a few quotations from it in other writers, has disappeared.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2009}}
The '''Berlin Circle''' ({{lang-de|die Berliner Gruppe}}) was a group that maintained [[Logical positivism|logical empiricist]] views about [[philosophy]].

==History==
Berlin Circle was created in the late 1920s by [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Grelling]] and [[Walter Dubislav]] and composed of philosophers and scientists such as [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard von Mises]]. Its original name was ''Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'', which in English may be translated as "the society for empirical philosophy". Together with the [[Vienna Circle]], they published the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' ("Knowledge") edited by [[Rudolf Carnap]] and Reichenbach, and organized several congresses and colloquia concerning the [[philosophy of science]], the first of which was held in [[Prague]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berlincr/ "Berlin Circle" entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Circle had much in common with the Vienna Circle, but the philosophies of the circles differed on a few subjects, such as [[probability]] and [[conventionalism]]. Reichenbach insisted on calling his philosophy logical empiricism, to distinguish it from the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Few people today make the distinction, and the words are often used interchangeably.

Members of the Berlin Circle were particularly active in analyzing the philosophical and [[logical consequence]]s of the advances in contemporary [[physics]], especially the [[theory of relativity]]. Apart from that, they denied the [[soundness]] of [[metaphysics]] and traditional philosophy and asserted that many philosophical problems are indeed meaningless.

After the rise of [[Nazism]], several of the group's members emigrated to other countries, including Reichenbach, who moved to [[Turkey]] in 1933  and later to the United States in 1938; Dubislav emigrated in 1936; Hempel moved to Belgium in 1934 and later to the United States in 1939; and Grelling was killed in a [[concentration camp]]. A younger member of the Berlin Circle or Berlin School to leave Germany was [[Olaf Helmer]] who joined the [[RAND Corporation]] and played an important role in the development of the [[Delphi method]] used for predicting future trends, and other early forms of [[social technology]].&lt;ref&gt;''Berlin School of Logical Empiricism'' by [[Nicholas Rescher]] (Springer, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

After emigrating to various countries the group effectively came to an end, but not without influencing a wide range of philosophers of the 20th century, its method having been especially influential on [[analytic philosophy]] and [[futurology]].

The '''Bruce Codex''' (also called the ''Codex Brucianus'') is a [[gnosticism|gnostic]] manuscript acquired by the [[British Museum]]. In 1769, [[James Bruce]] purchased the codex  in [[Upper Egypt]]. It was transferred to the museum with a number of other Oriental texts in 1842. It currently resides in the [[Bodleian Library]] (Bruce 96), where it has been since 1848.

== Contents ==
The Bruce Codex was bound when it was in the possession of the British Museum - in a random order, with some pages upside-down, since no one involved spoke Coptic. It was edited in 1893 by [[Carl Schmidt (Coptologist)|Carl Schmidt]], who also translated it into German; it has since been rebound in Schmidt's ordering. Violet Macdermot  translated it into English as ''The Books of Jeu and the Untitled Text in the Bruce Codex'' in 1978.

Schmidt identified two texts in the Codex, both Gnostic mystery texts; he concluded that the first (in two books) was identical with the [[Books of Jeu]] mentioned in the [[Pistis Sophia]]; the other had no title. He associated two small fragments (a hymn and a prose passage on the progress of a soul through the "Archons of the Midst") with the second Book of Jeu, which is incomplete.

Gore was raised in a [[low-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] family{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1p=205 |2a1=Parker-McGee |2y=2016 |2p=12 |3a1=Wilkinson |3y=2008}} and was [[confirmation|confirmed]] by the church at the age of eight years.{{sfn|Tudesco|1976|p=274}} He was attracted to the [[high-church]] sacramental tradition and [[ritualism in the Church of England|ritualism]] of [[Anglo-Catholicism]] at a young age,{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1pp=205–206 |2a1=Parker-McGee |2y=2016 |2p=12 |3a1=Tudesco |3y=1976 |3p=274}} later writing "I have since my childhood been what I may call a Catholic by mental constitution".{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}} Around the age of nine years, he read [[Grace Kennedy (writer)|Grace Kennedy]]'s [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] novel ''Father Clement''.{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1pp=205–206 |2a1=Crosse |2y=1932 |2loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1 |3a1=Wilkinson |3y=2008}} The book served as his introduction to the high-church tradition and, instead of having his [[Protestantism]] reinforced as the author had intended, he found himself entranced by the Catholic tradition.{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1pp=205–206 |2a1=Wilkinson |2y=2008}} He would later write of it:
{{quote|I had been brought up in ordinary old-fashioned English Church ways. I had only attended very Low Church services. I had never heard of the Oxford Movement. I knew nothing about Catholicism, except as a strange superstition called Popery. But the book described confession and absolution, fasting, the Real Presence, the devotion of the Three Hours, the use of incense, etc., and I felt instinctively, and at once, that this sort of sacramental religion was the religion for me.{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}}}}

In his evidence given before the Ecclesiastical Discipline Commission in 1905 he said:
{{quote|I was what people call a ritualist from the time I was a boy, and I have been more interested I suppose in this subject through all the time of my growing up into manhood than in almost any other ...

I love, as I hardly love anything in the world physically, except the beauties of nature, that type and kind of ceremonial worship, which is called ritualistic by many people and Catholic by its maintainers. It appears to me personally to be the one kind of ceremonial worship which really expresses my feelings, and in which I feel really at home.{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1p=206 |2a1=Crosse |2y=1932 |2loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;1}}}}

In his adolescence, he began attending churches "that offered a richer sacramental ceremonial."{{sfn|Parker-McGee|2016|p=12}}

Gore's parents sent him to [[Harrow School]], London, in 1866, where he excelled academically.{{sfnm |1a1=Cadwell |1y=2013 |1p=206 |2a1=Tudesco |2y=1976 |2p=274}} He then went to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], in 1871, where he supported the trade-union movement.{{sfnm |1a1=Rice |1y=1961 |2a1=Wilkinson |2y=2008}} He graduated from Oxford in 1875 with a [[first-class degree]] in ''[[literae humaniores]]''.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2008}}

In 1875, Gore was elected a fellow of [[Trinity College, Oxford]],{{sfn|Rice|1961}} and he lectured there from 1876 to 1880.&lt;ref name=TT08111901&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=New Bishop of Worcester |day_of_week=Friday |date=8 November 1901 |page_number=9 |issue=36607| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore was ordained to the Anglican diaconate in December 1876 and to the priesthood in December 1878.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2008}} From 1880 to 1883, he served as vice-principal of [[Ripon College (Cuddesdon)|Cuddesdon Theological College]].{{sfnm |1a1=Chisholm |1y=1911 |1p=254 |2a1=Waddell |2y=2014 |2p=xiii}} He received [[Honorary Doctor of Divinity]] from various universities, including [[University of Athens]], [[University of Birmingham]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Durham University]], and [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Theologian at Pusey House==
When, in 1884, [[Pusey House]] was founded at Oxford as a home for Pusey's library and a centre for the propagation of his principles,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gore was appointed as principal, a position he held until 1893.{{sfn|Lagassé|2004}} As Principal of Pusey House, he exercised wide influence over undergraduates and the younger clergy and it was largely under this influence that the [[Oxford Movement]] underwent a change which to surviving [[Tractarian]]s seemed to involve a break with its basic principles. Puseyism had been in the highest degree conservative, basing itself on authority and tradition and repudiating compromise with the modern critical and liberalising spirit.  Gore, starting from the same basis of faith and authority, found from experience in dealing with the doubts and difficulties of the younger generation that this uncompromising attitude was untenable and set himself the task of reconciling the principle of authority in religion with that of scientific authority, by attempting to define the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence. To him the divine authority of the Catholic Church was an axiom.

In 1889, he published two works, the larger of which, ''The Church and the Ministry'', is a learned vindication of the principle of [[apostolic succession]] in the episcopate against the [[Presbyterians]] and other Reformed church bodies, while the second, ''Roman Catholic Claims'', is a defence, in more popular form, of [[Anglicanism]] and Anglican ordinations and sacraments against the criticisms of Roman Catholic authorities.{{sfn|Rice|1961}}

So far Gore's published views had been in consonance with those of the older Tractarians, but in 1890 a stir was created by the publication, under his editorship, of ''[[Lux Mundi (book)|Lux Mundi]]'', a series of essays by different writers attempting to bring the Christian creed into a harmonious relation to the modern growth of knowledge, scientific, historic, critical, and to modern problems of politics and ethics.  Gore himself contributed an essay on "The Holy Spirit and Inspiration" and, from the tenth edition, one of Gore's sermons, "On the Christian Doctrine of Sin", was included as an appendix. The book, which ran through twelve editions in little over a year, met with a mixed reception. Traditional clerics, both Evangelicals and Tractarians, were alarmed by views on the incarnate nature of Christ which seemed to them to impugn his divinity and, by concessions to the higher criticism in the matter of the inspiration of scripture, appeared to them to convert the "impregnable rock" (as Gladstone had called it) into a foundation of sand. Sceptics, however, were not impressed by a system of defence which seemed to draw an artificial line beyond which criticism was not to advance. The book nonetheless produced a profound effect far beyond the borders of the Anglican churches and it is largely due to its influence, and to that of the school it represents, that the Anglican high church movement developed on Modernist rather than Tractarian lines from then on.

==Bampton Lectures, Radley parish, and Westminster Abbey==
In 1891 Gore was chosen to deliver the [[Bampton Lectures]], and he took for his subject the "Incarnation of Christ". In these published lectures, Gore developed the theology of ''Lux Mundi'', attempting to explain how Christ, though incarnate God, could err (for example, in his citations from the [[Old Testament]]). The orthodox explanation had been based on the [[Accommodation (religion)|religious principle of accommodation]]. This, however, had not solved the difficulty that if Christ on earth was not subject to human limitations, especially of knowledge, he was not as other men, not subject to their trials and temptations. Gore addressed this through revisiting the Kenotic Theory of the Incarnation. Theologians had attempted to explain what [[Paul the Apostle]] meant when he wrote of Christ ([[Philippians 2]]:7) that he emptied himself (''[[kenosis]]'') and took upon him the form of a servant. According to Gore this means that Christ on his incarnation, although sinless, became subject to all human limitations and stripped himself of all attributes of [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]], including [[omniscience]], the divine nature being hidden under the human.&lt;ref&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/84.html Kiefer, James. E., "Charles Gore, Bishop and Theologian", Biographical sketches of memorable Christians of the past]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bampton Lectures led to a tense situation, which Gore relieved in 1893 by resigning his principalship of Pusey House and accepting the position of vicar of [[Radley]] parish near [[Oxford]].

In 1894 Gore became a canon of [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Lagassé|2004}} Here he gained commanding influence as a preacher{{sfn|Evans|2014|p=314}} and in 1898 was appointed one of the court chaplains.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In July 1901 he was appointed a [[Chaplain-in-Ordinary]] to [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27336 |pages=4838–4839|date=23 July 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he resigned as such on elevation as bishop in January 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27393|date=3 January 1902|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community of the Resurrection==
{{See also|Community of the Resurrection}}
In 1892, while Principal of Pusey House, Gore founded a clerical fraternity, known as the Society of the Resurrection. The society became a religious community and he became its first superior,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} only resigning when appointed as Bishop of Worcester in 1902. Its members were Anglican priests bound by the obligation of celibacy, living under a common [[Benedictine]] rule and with a common purse. Their work was pastoral, evangelistic, literary and educational. The community followed Gore to Radley in 1893, most of them remaining there when he moved to London in 1894. In 1898 the [[House of the Resurrection]] in [[Mirfield]], near [[Huddersfield]], became the centre of the community.

Although the community followed a liturgical day familiar to Roman Catholic monks, Gore and the other founders wanted it to engage in social action. Five of the six founding members belonged to the [[Christian Social Union (UK)|Christian Social Union]], hence the decision to settle in the industrial north, between Wakefield and Huddersfield.&lt;ref name=howse&gt;{{cite news |last=Howse |first=Christopher |date=13 November 2009 |title=The Levelling of Mirfield Church |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherhowse/6562705/The-levelling-of-Mirfield-church.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 a college for training candidates for the Anglican priesthood, the [[College of the Resurrection]], was established in Mirfield and, in the same year, a branch house for missionary work was set up in [[Johannesburg]] in South Africa.

==Bishop in Worcester, Birmingham, and Oxford==
In November 1901 Gore was nominated to succeed [[John Perowne|J. J. S. Perowne]] as [[Bishop of Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27389|date=20 December 1901|page=8979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment caused some controversy, due to his teachings and relationship to the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (he was a cousin of Lord Salisbury's daughter-in-law).&lt;ref name=TT08111901 /&gt; The [[Church Association]] and the Liverpool Laymen's League were among societies lodging formal protests before his confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ecclesiastical intelligence |day_of_week=Thursday |date=2 January 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36654| }}&lt;/ref&gt; After subsequent legal hearings, Gore was consecrated as Bishop at [[Lambeth Palace]] on 23 February 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ecclesiastical intelligence – Consecration of the Bishop of Worcester|day_of_week=Monday |date=24 February 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36699| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and enthroned at [[Worcester Cathedral]] two days later on 25 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Enthronement of the Bishop of Worcester |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=26 February 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36701| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Charles Gore NPG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gore in 1902]]
He received the degree [[Doctor of Divinity]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in December 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=6 December 1901 |page_number=7 |issue=36631| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected an [[Honorary Fellow]] of Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=28 May 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36779| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 Gore was installed as the first [[Bishop of Birmingham]], a new see, which he had helped to create by dividing his see of Worcester.{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;7}} The second parish church of Birmingham,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham|St Philip]], became the cathedral.{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;8}} While adhering to his views on the divine institution of episcopacy as essential to the Christian Church, Gore from the first cultivated friendly relations with the ministers of other Christian denominations and advocated co-operation with them in all matters when agreement was possible.

In social questions Gore became a leader of the group of high Anglicans known loosely as [[Christian socialists]]. In 1889 at Pusey House{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Gore had helped found the [[Christian Social Union (UK)|Christian Social Union]].{{sfn|Lagassé|2004}} He worked actively against the [[sweating system]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} pleaded for European intervention in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and {{citation needed span |date=December 2017 |text=in 1908}} was a keen supporter of the Licensing Bill.{{sfn|Prestige|1935|pp=268, 310}}{{verification needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1911 he succeeded [[Francis Paget]] as [[Bishop of Oxford]] and [[Chancellor of the Order of the Garter]].

On 28 September 1917 Gore licensed 21 women as [[lay reader]]s called the "Diocesan Band of Women Messengers".  These were possibly the first female lay readers in the Church of England. The last one, [[Bessie Bangay]], died in 1987 aged 98.

==Retirement in London==
Gore resigned in {{citation needed span |date=December 2017 |text=June}} 1919 and retired to London,{{sfn|Waddell|2014|pp=xiii, xxv}} where he lived at 6 Margaret Street{{sfn|Temple|Thom|n.d.|p=26}} as a tenant of the parochial authorities of [[All Saints, Margaret Street]]. There he remained for several years, celebrating regularly in the church and in the sisters' chapel close by, and taking his usual keen interest in the affairs of the church and parish. At the same time Gore attached himself to [[Grosvenor Chapel]], South Audley Street, and was licensed to the Rector of [[St George's, Hanover Square]], in whose parish that chapel stands, thus becoming for the first time in his life a licensed curate.{{sfn|Crosse|1932}}

Gore was a bundle of contradictions, an Anglo-Catholic in the Church of England whose questioning of the Old Testament produced in the 1890s a crisis for many believers. In the judgment of his biographer, Gore was a loner who thought he had a vocation to community life. He chose to be buried at Mirfield, in the church of the [[Community of the Resurrection]], though he had never managed to be more than a visitor there.&lt;ref name=howse/&gt;

In 1929-1930, he delivered the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]] on the topic "The Philosophy of the Good Life" at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.giffordlectures.org/lectures/philosophy-good-life|title=The Philosophy of the Good Life|date=2014-08-18|work=The Gifford Lectures|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Gore died on 17 January 1932 in [[Kensington]], London.{{sfnm |1a1=Crosse |1y=1932 |1loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;11 |2a1=Ekström |2y=1944 |2p=9}} He left instructions for his body to be cremated,{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;11}} a practice seen by some at the time as unacceptable for a Christian.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nearly three decades earlier, in a letter read at the 1903 opening ceremony of the [[Birmingham Crematorium]], Gore had written:&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal|date=17 October 1903|title=Birmingham Crematorium|journal=The Lancet|volume=162|issue=4181|page=1109|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)46268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|What I should desire when I myself die is that my body should be reduced rapidly to ashes, so that it may do no harm to the living, and then in accordance with Christian feeling be laid in the earth.}}

Gore's wishes provoked the Anglo-Catholic leader and politician [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] to exclaim, belatedly, "I could shake the life out of him with my own hands."&lt;ref name=howse/&gt; The ashes were taken to [[Mirfield]] in Yorkshire for burial.{{sfn|Crosse|1932|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;11}} His cope and mitre remain at the [[Grosvenor Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feast of Dedication |url=http://www.grosvenorchapel.org.uk/services/feast-of-dedication/ |location=London |publisher=Grosvenor Chapel |access-date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consumer culture theory''' is the study of [[consumption choice]]s and behaviors from a social and cultural point of view, as opposed to an [[Economics|economic]] or [[psychological]] one. It does not offer a grand unifying theory but "refers to a family of theoretical perspectives that address the dynamic relationships between consumer actions, the marketplace, and cultural meanings".&lt;ref name="CCT1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnould|first1=E. J.|last2=Thompson|first2=C. J.|year=2005|title=Consumer culture theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=4|pages=868–882|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjconrs/v_3a31_3ay_3a2005_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a868-882.htm|doi=10.1086/426626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective of a [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] society, it views cultural meanings as being numerous and fragmented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Firat|first1=A.

Consumer culture is viewed as "social arrangement in which the relations between lived culture and social resources, between meaningful ways of life and the symbolic and material resources on which they depend, are mediated through markets"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnould|first=E. J.|year=2006|title=Consumer culture theory: retrospect and prospect|journal=European Advances in Consumer Research|volume=7|issue=1|pages=605–607|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/eacr/vol7/EuropeanVolume7_105.pdf|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumers as part of an interconnected system of commercially produced products and images which they use to construct their identity and orient their relationships with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kozinets|first1=R. V.|year=2001|title=Utopian Enterprise: Articulating the Meanings of Star Trek’s Culture of Consumption|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=28|issue=3|pages=67–88|jstor=254324|doi=10.1086/321948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
There is a widely held misperception by people outside CCT researchers that this field is oriented toward the study of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] contexts.&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; Memorable study contexts, such as the [[Harley-Davidson]] subculture&lt;ref name="bikes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schouten|first1=J.|last2=McAlexander|first2=J. H.|year=1995|title=Subcultures of Consumption: An Ethnography of the New Bikers|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=22|issue=3|pages=43–.,./61|url=http://classes.bus.oregonstate.edu/winter-07/ba492/Subcultures%20of%20Consumption.pdf|doi=10.1086/209434}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Burning Man]] festival&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozinets|first=Robert V|year=2002|title=Can Consumers Escape the Market? Emancipatory Illuminations from Burning Man|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=29|issue=1|pages=20–38|url=http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjconrs/v_3a29_3ay_3a2002_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a20-38.htm|accessdate=7 August 2010|doi=10.1086/339919}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably fueled this perspective, which is far from the theory development aim of this school of thought.

While CCT is often associated with [[qualitative methodology|qualitative methodologies]], such as interviews, case studies, [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], as well as 'netnographic' methods&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Field Behind the Screen: Using Netnography for Marketing Research in Online Communities|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|date = February 1, 2002|issn = 0022-2437|pages = 61–72|volume = 39|issue = 1|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.39.1.61.18935|first = Robert V.|last = Kozinets}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are well adapted to study the experiential, sociological and cultural aspects of consumption, these are not a prerequisite to CCT contribution (Arnould &amp; Thompson 2005).

== Fields of study ==
Arnould &amp; Thompson&lt;ref name="CCT1" /&gt; identifies four research programs in CCT: 
*Consumer identity projects, such as Schau &amp; Gilly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schau|first1=H. J.|last2=Gilly|first2=M. C.|year=2003|title=We Are What We Post? Self-Presentation in Personal Web Space|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=30|issue=4|pages=384–404|jstor=3132017|doi=10.1086/378616}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on personal web space, which studied how consumers create a coherent self through marketer-produced materials
*Marketplace culture, such as Schouten &amp; McAlexander&lt;ref name="bikes" /&gt; study on the Harley-Davidson subculture, which looked at consumers as culture producers. This research program builds particularly on Maffesoli's concept of neo-tribes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=36elPGofHRUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=maffesoli+tribes&amp;ots=hV24JGRbE9&amp;sig=oBtoxgJANeqzP2WzuijhDr6y-zY|publisher = SAGE|date = 1995-12-05|isbn = 9781848609532|first = Michel|last = Maffesoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of consumer tribes have focused, for example, on clubbing culture and surf culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to be tribal: facilitating the formation of consumer tribes|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03090561311306886|journal = European Journal of Marketing|date = May 24, 2013|issn = 0309-0566|pages = 813–832|volume = 47|issue = 5/6|doi = 10.1108/03090561311306886}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mass-mediated marketplace ideologies and consumers' interpretive strategies, such as Kozinets&lt;ref name="burning" /&gt; study of the Burning Man Festival, which looked at consumer ideologies and identities are influenced by economic and cultural globalisation and how cultural product systems orient consumers toward certain ideologies or identity projects.
*Sociohistoric patterning of consumption, such as Holt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=D. B.|year=1998|title=Does Cultural Capital Structure American Consumption|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1086/209523}}&lt;/ref&gt; study which looked at the influence of social capital on consumption choices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">'''Danilo Pejović''' (6 March 1928, [[Ludbreg]], [[Croatia]] – 4 October 2007) was a Croatian [[philosopher]].

During the [[World War II]], in 1943, Pejović joined the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|National Liberation Army]] in its fight against the occupying forces of [[Yugoslavia]]. He continued his education after the war, graduating with a degree in philosophy at the [[University in Zagreb]] in 1953. He earned his PhD degree at the same university in 1958 with a dissertation about the [[ontology]] of [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Until 1966 Pejović was president of the Croatian Philosophy Society.

Pejović was part of the wing of Yugoslav philosophical thought that was defending critical, unorthodox views. When the journal ''Praxis'' was established in 1964, Pejović joined its editorial board, becoming a co-editor of the journal, together with [[Gajo Petrović]].

However, Pejović's cooperation with the [[Praxis School]] didn't last too long. After the attacks of the regime politicians against ''Praxis'' in summer 1966, Pejović resigned from his post as a co-editor of the ''Praxis'' and he broke his cooperation with the Praxis School, attacking his former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Gajo Petrović, ''Čemu Praxis'' (Zagreb, 1972), pp. 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, unlike his former colleagues in ''Praxis'', he condemned the Yugoslav student demonstrations in 1968.

It was first discovered amongst 52 other [[Gnostic]] [[Christian]] texts spread over 13 [[Codex|codices]] by an Arab peasant, Mohammad Ali al-Samman, in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] late in December 1945.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Another copy has more recently been found in the [[Codex Tchacos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=A.P. | title=A Dictionary of Gnosticism | publisher=Quest Books | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-8356-0869-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kigg-3Aehp8C&amp;pg=PA60 | page=60f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kasser | first=R. | last2=Meyer | first2=M. | last3=Wurst | first3=G. | last4=Ehrman | first4=D. | last5=Gaudard | first5=F. | title=The Gospel of Judas | publisher=National Geographic | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4262-0048-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xVK_hJouWwC&amp;pg=PA64 | access-date=22 June 2018 | page=64f}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is merely titled 'James'. Those texts were in the [[Coptic language]]. In 2017, the first [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] copy was found (the work was originally written in Greek)&lt;ref name=Medrano&gt;{{cite news|last= Medrano |first= Kastalia |title= First Copy of Jesus's Secret Writings to His Brother Recovered From Antiquity in Original Greek |date= 2017-11-30 |accessdate= 2017-12-04 |website= [[Newsweek]] |url= http://www.newsweek.com/copy-jesus-writings-his-brother-recovered-antiquity-original-greek-727815 |quote= Greek, the language in which it was originally written}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst unpublished [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] housed at Oxford University.&lt;ref name="GR120417"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Greg Ritchie|title=Heretical text of Jesus’ brother found in Oxford|url=http://cherwell.org/2017/12/04/heretical-text-of-jesus-brother-found-in-oxford/|accessdate=9 December 2017|date=4 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nag Hammadi Coptic manuscript is remarkably well preserved for its age; it was reported that the cache of texts called the "[[Nag Hammadi library]]", when originally found, were sealed within a large terra  cotta vessel. They were secreted during the fourth century, in an effort to hide the texts from destruction by others.&lt;ref&gt;Markschies, Christoph (trans. John Bowden), (2000). ''Gnosis: An Introduction.'' T &amp; T Clark. See details at [[Nag Hammadi library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the text is primarily that of a Revelation Dialogue/Discourse between [[James, brother of Jesus|James the brother of Jesus]] (James the Just) and [[Jesus]], with a rather fragmentary account of the departure (possibly meaning martyrdom) of James appended to the bottom of the manuscript, connected to the remainder by an oblique reference to crucifixion. The first portion of the text describes James' understandable concern about being crucified, whereas the latter portion describes secret "passwords" given to James so that he can ascend to the highest heaven (out of 72) after dying, without being blocked by evil "powers" of the [[demiurge]]. In the text, Jesus tells James, "you are not my brother materially."&lt;ref&gt;The text begins "It is the Lord who spoke with me: "See now the completion of my redemption. I have given you a sign of these things, James, my brother. For not without reason have I called you my brother, although you are not my brother materially."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the framing background details about James given in the text are thought by academics to reflect early traditions; according to the text:
* James was the head of the [[Early Christianity|early church]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}
* James was the most senior [[Twelve apostles|apostle]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}
* James fled to [[Pella]]{{cn|date=August 2016}} when the Romans invaded Jerusalem in 70 AD. This contradicts the testimony of [[Josephus]] and [[Eusebius]], who both state that James was executed in Jerusalem in 62 AD.

The first-known Greek copy of the text was discovered in 2017 at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] by Geoffrey Smith and Brent Landau, religious studies scholars at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The fragments date from the fifth or sixth century and were probably a teacher’s model used to help students learn to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.utexas.edu/2017/11/29/ut-austin-professors-discover-copy-of-jesus-secret-teaching | title=UT Austin Professors Discover Copy of Jesus’ Secret Revelations to His Brother |type= press release | publisher= [[University of Texas at Austin]] | date=2017-11-29 |accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Ritchie&gt;{{cite news|last= Ritchie |first= Greg |title= Heretical text of Jesus' brother found in Oxford |date= 2017-12-04 |accessdate= 2017-12-05 |newspaper= [[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]] |url= http://cherwell.org/2017/12/04/heretical-text-of-jesus-brother-found-in-oxford/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments will be published in the Oxyrhynchus compilation ''The Greco-Roman Memoirs''.

One of the most curious features of the First Apocalypse of James is that the range of dating of its original text, assigned to it by scholars, requires that it was written after the ''[[Second Apocalypse of James]]''.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Georg Friedrich Meier''' (26 March 1718 – 21 June 1777) was a German philosopher and aesthetician. A follower of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], he reformed the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] by introducing elements of [[John Locke]]'s empiricist theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name=CHECP&gt;{{Citation | last=Thiel | first=Udo | year=2006 | contribution=Meier, Georg Friedrich | editor-last=Haakonssen | editor-first=Knud | title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=2 | pages=1202–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier studied philosophy and theology at the [[University of Halle]], where he was a pupil of Baumgarten. Meier succeeded Baumgarten as extraordinary professor, and became a full professor at Halle in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/meier-georg-friedrich-17181777-eoph/ "Meier, Georg Friedrich"], ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Reference, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global resources dividend''' (GRD) is a method of tackling [[global poverty]] advanced by the philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]].&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt; He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas W.|title=Eradicating Systemic Poverty: Brief for a global resources dividend|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1080/14649880120050246|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/global-resources-dividend/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issn=1464-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on  any resources that they use or sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 October 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–327|url=http://www.icrea.cat/Web/GetFile.asmx/Download?idFile=bIujBBG01Ac%3D|accessdate=6 April 2015|doi=10.1163/174552411X591339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Widdows, N. Smith (2011) ''Global Social Justice'', Routlege:  New York, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a sort of "tax on consumption"&lt;ref name = PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate [[economic inequality]]. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.

Implementing some version of the GRD [[logical consequence|entails]] not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it "Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the [[original position]] the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts."&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Rights of the disadvantaged==
{{quotebox|quoted=1|source=Thomas Pogge's hypothetical speech to the global poor; he says we should give that speech if we decide that international cooperation is unrealistic, and not worth attempting.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;|align=right|width=40%|quote= We care deeply about equality, and we would very much like it to be the case that you are not so much worse off than we are. But, unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect that we would actually comply with more egalitarian global institutions. Since no one would benefit from a futile attempt to maintain impracticable institutions, we should all just rest content with the global inequalities of the status quo.}}
Pogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Pogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Rawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject [[totalitarianism]], for instance.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.

Under the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below).&lt;ref&gt;Haubrich. Dirk (2004) Global Distributive Justice and the Taxation of Natural Resources – Who Should Pick Up the Tab?,''Contemporary Political Theory'', 3: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in [[Sierra Leone]]. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Implementing a GRD==
Each nation or "peoples" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a "tax on consumption".&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

The funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a [[world government]] is not ''necessary''. The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide [[basic rights]] to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding [[NGO]]s may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report 2009-1.png|thumb|right|350px|There are different inequalities between, but also (pictured above) within countries. As the system around the GRD becomes more sophisticated, it could accommodate such issues.]]
The lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; (e.g. the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=What We Owe to the Global Poor: Political Philosophy Meets Development Economics|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Harvard University|pages=52|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=1599|accessdate=6 April 2015|ref=risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.

Primary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.

== Criticism ==
Richard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.&lt;ref name=Reichel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichel|first1=Richard|title=Internationaler Handel, Tauschgerechtigkeit und die globale Rohstoffdividende|journal=Analyse und Kritik|date=1997|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses [[Joseph Heath]]'s argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=Thomas Pogge’s Global Resources Dividend: A Critique and an Alternative|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 November 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1740468105058157|url=https://www.academia.edu/7038440/Thomas_Pogges_Global_Resources_Dividend_a_critique_and_an_alternative|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Supek''' (8 April 1915 – 5 March 2007) was a [[Croatia]]n [[physicist]], [[philosopher]], [[writer]], [[playwright]], [[peace activist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]].

==Early years and education==
Supek was born in [[Zagreb]], Croatia (still nominally under [[Austria-Hungary]]). During his high school days, he organized a local section of the [[Young Communist League of Yugoslavia]] at his school, and was a member of the League until the [[Hitler-Stalin Pact]]. On one occasion, he secretly smuggled a briefcase to a man in Vienna he later found to be [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After finishing grammar school in [[Zagreb]] in 1934, he continued pursuing his education in [[Vienna]] for a brief period, then moved to [[Zuerich]] studying [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[biology]] and [[philosophy]]. Increasingly interested in quantum physics and its philosophical consequences, he moved to [[Leipzig]] where in 1940 he obtained his [[PhD]] in physics under [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He worked on problems of [[superconductivity]], but ultimately his doctoral dissertation was on electrical conductivity in metals in low temperatures. In March 1941 he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] for being involved in antifascist activity and held in prison for many months. His professors, [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Friedrich Hund|Hund]] and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|von Weizsäcker]] intervened to release him from prison. Immediately after being released, instead of returning to Leipzig, he went back to [[Independent State of Croatia]] and joined the [[communist]] [[antifascist]] movement. He would not return to physics research again, focusing on his philosophical and literary work.

==Public activity==
Supek was a proponent of total and unconditional nuclear disarmament, having already in 1944, fourteen months before the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] warned on the danger of misuse of [[Nuclear physics|atomic energy]].

In 1946 he became a professor of [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Zagreb]]. His main contribution to physics was the discovery of the [[differential equation]] for [[electrical conductivity]] at low temperatures. In 1950 he advocated the construction of the [[Ruđer Bošković institute]] in Zagreb and became one of its founders. He was excluded from it in 1958 due to his disagreement with the Yugoslav Federal Commission for Nuclear Energy and his unwillingness to participate in a project for building the atomic bomb (an idea [[Josip Broz Tito]] himself did not like much, and which was subsequently abandoned). After that, he stopped active research in theoretical physics and continued researching philosophy and literature.

In 1960 he was accepted into the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (since 1991 the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]) of which he was president from 1991 to 1997, and in 1968 he became the rector of the University of Zagreb, serving two terms until 1972, during the turbulent times of the [[Croatian Spring]]. In 1960 he founded the Institute for the Philosophy of Science and Peace, as a section of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. The Institute was also a center of the nuclear disarmament movement, the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash Conference]] for Yugoslavia, of which he was one of the founders and a member of its Permanent Committee. In 1970 he initiated the establishing of the Interuniversity Centre in Dubrovnik (IUC). He was also one of the founders of the international organization [[World without the Bomb]]. After numerous disputes and arguments with the government he was interrupted in his public activity in 1971.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Among other incidents, he was put on a "black list" because of his involvement in the Croatian Spring movement.

In 1976 he signed the [[Dubrovnik-Philadelphia Statement]], with [[Philip Noel-Baker]], [[Ava Helen Pauling]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Aurelio Peccei]] and [[Sophia Wadai]]. He participated at the Philadelphia Congress of World Unity in 1976. He formulated his famous ten humanistic principles, which were more or less repeated at every later peace summit and event. He also established the [[International League of Humanists]].

==Later years to present==
Supek visited and lectured at numerous foreign universities. He retired in 1985, but ever since continued his humanist work. He founded a citizen association, ''Alijansa za treću Hrvatsku'' (Alliance for the third Croatia). He was a critic of [[globalisation]] and a proponent of the [[global justice movement]]. In 2002 he was elected an honorary member of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anubih.ba/index.php?option=content&amp;lang=eng&amp;Theme=honorary&amp;Level=2&amp;ItemID=6{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supek died on 5 March 2007, in his home in Zagreb, after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2007,3,7,umro_supek,65439.jl |first=Tanja |last=Rudež |title=Umro akademik Ivan Supek |work=Jutarnji list |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2009-01-29 |language=Croatian |quote=Akademik Ivan Supek [...] preminuo je u ponedjeljak u 92. godini u obiteljskom domu u Zagrebu. Prema Supekovoj želji, vijest o njegovoj smrti objavljena je nakon pokopa koji je održan danas u uskom obiteljskom krugu.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, shortly after his death, the "X. gimnazija" (10th Gymnasium) [[grammar school]] in Croatia's capital [[Zagreb]] was renamed in his honor to ''[[X. Gimnazija "Ivan Supek"]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseta.hr/deseta/Skola_info/Ime%20skole.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  He is among 24 famous Croats to be inducted in the [[Croatian Walk Of Fame]].

==Controversy over Heisenberg – Bohr 1941 meeting==
In one of his last interviews in March 2006 &lt;ref&gt;http://jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2006,3,19,supek_intervju,17440.jl?artpg=1&lt;/ref&gt; Supek spoke about the famous and controversial meeting between [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Niels Bohr]] in [[Copenhagen]] in September 1941. According to Supek, he was informed in confidence by Bohr's wife Margrethe about the meeting. In his interview, Supek claimed that the main figure of the meeting was neither Heisenberg nor Bohr but [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]. "Heisenberg and von Weizsäcker came to Bohr in German army uniforms. Von Weizsäcker's idea, probably originating from his father who was [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]]'s deputy, was to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany."

Although Margrethe allegedly thought Supek will never bring these details into public, Supek felt it was "his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Heisenberg – Bohr meeting".

==Disputes with president Tuđman==
Supek had many disputes with the first president of independent Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]]. In a 1997 "open letter" which he also read on the national television and published in all the major dailies, president Tuđman accused Supek, then President of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, of supporting forces that allegedly plotted his assassination after Supek made public statements critical of presidential policies: he called for Tuđman to submit to public scrutiny his financial assets before and after the war. Supek had been a critic of Tuđman's political ''faux pas'' since Tuđman took office in 1990. Following the publication of the letter, Supek and his family suffered numerous death threats.

==Literary works==
Beside his scientific and humanist work, Supek wrote numerous novels and plays, with themes spanning from philosophy, science fiction to politics. His novel ''{{lang|hr|Proces stoljeća}}'' (translated to ''[[The Process of the Century]]'') is about the process against the physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. A list of his works can be found on the Academy homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.hazu.hr/ivan_supek_bibliografija_popis_radova_ivana_supeka_nepotpun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318171055/http://info.hazu.hr/ivan_supek_bibliografija_popis_radova_ivana_supeka_nepotpun |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he started a journal, ''Encyclopedia moderna''.

In his numerous works, Supek developed a worldview in which the values of the freedom, responsibility, and democracy are integrated with his philosophical-scientific reflections.

==Quotes==
* About science and humanism in 1995:
:"The diversity of the world cannot be overcome in a political system; whoever tried to do that only produced tyranny and misery. The richness of plurality and diversity will only be increased in the future. All the European and world organizations are not enough, and cannot be effective if not inspired by the universal spirit and consciousness nourished by science and art."

'''Jan Deckers''' teaches and researches [[bioethics]] at [[Newcastle University]]. His work revolves mainly around three topics: [[animal ethics]], reproductive ethics and embryo research, and genetics.

== Animal ethics ==

Deckers has published numerous articles in animal ethics, mainly on the ethical issues associated with the human consumption of animal products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sme/staff/profile/jan.deckers|title=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic has been approached from various angles, including its connections with the causation of harm to animals, environmental degradation, [[climate change]], and the emergence and spread of [[zoonoses]]. Early work also considered the relevance of the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] for animal ethics, where Deckers's work has been reviewed critically by other Whiteheadian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel J. A response to Deckers. Journal of Animal Ethics 2011, 1(1) 93–95; Dombrowski D. A response to Deckers. Journal of Animal Ethics 2011, 1(2), 210–14.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work has also considered the ethics of [[cultured meat|in-vitro flesh]] and the idea of creating animals with decreased pain sensitivity, where Deckers chaired a conference on these themes, funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;The audio-visual recordings and powerpoint slides of this conference can be found here: [http://interactive.ncl.ac.uk/case/195/1/7/view/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[speciesist]], Deckers argues that human health is paramount to address whether and when animal products ought to be consumed. The book [[Animal (De)liberation|Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?]] defends 'qualified moral [[veganism]]', which is associated with a political goal: the vegan project.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?, London: Ubiquity Press, 2016; [doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is critical of positions adopted by other scholars, including [[Alasdair Cochrane]], [[Gary Francione]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], and [[Peter Singer]], and has more in common with the positions of scholars such as [[Alice Crary]], [[Melanie Joy]], and [[Marti Kheel]]. 

Many charges have been pressed against vegan diets, for example that they alienate human beings from nature ([[Michael Pollan]]) or that they increase human food security and other sustainability concerns relative to other diets (Simon Fairlie).&lt;ref&gt;Fairlie S. Meat: A Benign Extravagance, East Meon: Permanent Publications, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Deckers addresses these challenges. The book’s appendix also considers whether vegan diets might be nutritionally adequate or even superior compared to other diets.

The book has been described as ‘an innovative defense of veganism’ because of its concern with maximising positive global health impacts, and its primary focus on safeguarding the health of moral agents.&lt;ref&gt;Mancilla, A. Moral Veganism. In: P. Thompson and D. Kaplan (eds.). Encyclopedia of Food and Agricultural Ethics, second edition. Springer International (in press).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproductive ethics and embryo research ==

Deckers has analysed debate in [[Westminster Parliament]] around the use of embryos for [[stem cell research]] and [[cloning]] as well as the law on abortion in Great Britain, and argued for legal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. An analysis of the arguments underpinning UK embryonic stem cell legislation on the embryo's status. Journal of Stem Cells 2007, 2(1), 47–62. URL: [https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=5525](author's version at [http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/pub_details2.aspx?pub_id=31766].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the debate on abortion, Deckers has engaged with [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]]'s thought experiment of the [[violinist (thought experiment)|violinist]]. In an article with the title 'The right to life and abortion legislation in England and Wales: A proposal for change’, Deckers argues for a radical overhaul of the law on abortion in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. The right to life and abortion legislation in England and Wales: A proposal for change. Diametros 2010, 26, 1–22. URL:[http://www.diametros.iphils.uj.edu.pl/pdf/diam26deckersen.PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this area has been the subject of significant academic critique.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Eberl, J. T. (2007). A Thomistic perspective on the beginning of personhood: redux. Bioethics, 21(5), 283–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==

In his article ‘Are scientists right and non-scientists wrong? Reflections on discussions of GM’ Deckers analyses the views of scientists and non-scientists on [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. Are scientists right and non-scientists wrong? Reflections on discussions of GM. Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 2005, 18(5), 451–478. [[doi: 10.1007/s10806-005-0902-1]]author's version at [http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/pub_details2.aspx?pub_id=70417].&lt;/ref&gt; In a comprehensive overview of the literature between 1975 and 2008, the article was identified as a key paper in the debate on the ethics of GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorowius, D., Lindemann-Matthies, P., &amp; Huppenbauer, M. (2012). Ethical discourse on the use of genetically modified crops: a review of academic publications in the fields of ecology and environmental ethics. Journal of agricultural and environmental ethics, 25(3), 265–293.&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent work reflects on the meaning and the moral significance or otherwise of the (un)natural, where Deckers argues, inspired by Alfred North Whitehead’s [[teleological]] understanding of natural entities, that the concept of the unnatural carries both meaning and moral significance in discussions of genetic engineering. At the same time, his (ontological) understanding of the world is critical of Whitehead's thought by rejecting the view that the universe as a whole is a teleological entity.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?, London: Ubiquity Press, 2016, section 2.11.[doi: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay].&lt;/ref&gt;
Deckers also developed a contextualised case in human genetics as a teaching resource for the [[Higher Education Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resource/genetics-contextualised-scenario|title=Genetics Contextualised Scenario – Higher Education Academy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other work ==

In a book chapter on 'Fairness in Newcastle: Theory and Practice’, Deckers engages with a report of the Newcastle Fairness Commission, published in 2012, which set out to define some principles of fairness to improve decision-making and guide the work of [[Newcastle City Council]] and other organisations in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. Fairness in Newcastle: Theory and Practice. In: Davoudi,S;Bell,D, ed. Justice and fairness in the city. A multi-disciplinary approach to ‘ordinary’ cities. Bristol: Policy Press, 2016, pp.249–264. URL: https://policypress.co.uk/justice-and-fairness-in-the-city#book-detail-tabs-stison-block-content-1-0-tab0&lt;/ref&gt; Deckers has also written on the ethics of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Deckers J. Minimizing Marriage: Marriage, Morality, and the Law; by Elizabeth Brake. Journal of Applied Philosophy 2014, 31(4), 442–444. [[doi: 10.1111/japp.12086]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brake, E. Minimizing Marriage: Marriage, Morality, and the Law. Oxford University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Hyppolite''' (January 8, 1907 &amp;ndash; October 26, 1968) was a French [[philosopher]] known for championing the work of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and other German philosophers, and educating some of France's most prominent post-war thinkers. His major works include ''Genesis and Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'' and ''[[Studies on Marx and Hegel]]''.

==Life and career==
Hyppolite was born in [[Jonzac]]. He was a graduate of the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS) at roughly the same time as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. After graduation he embarked on a serious study of [[Hegel]], teaching himself German in order to read ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' in the original. In 1939 he came out with his own translation and his commentary would later form the basis of the book ''Genesis and Structure of the Phenomenology of Spirit'' (published in 1947). After the Second World War, Hyppolite became a professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]], before moving to the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Heckman74"&gt;Heckman, John. 2000 (1974). Introduction. In: Hyppolite, Jean. ''Genesis and Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit.'' Northwestern University Press: Evanston. pp. xv–xli.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Hyppolite published ''Logique et existence'', a work that may have had a seminal effect on what was to become known as [[post-structuralism]]. This book tries to correlate Hegel's ''Phenomenology'' to his ''Logics'' (longer and shorter). In doing so, it raises the questions of language, being, and difference that were to become the hallmarks of new French philosophy at the end of the 20th century. The book was reviewed by the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]. The translators of the English language edition of the text (SUNY Press, 1997) included Deleuze's review at the end of the volume.

In 1954, he became the director of the ENS and in 1955 produced a study of [[Karl Marx]]'s earlier, more Hegelian period, at a time when the French interest in Hegel was at its apogee.&lt;ref name="Heckman74" /&gt; In 1963 he was elected to the [[Collège de France]] and given a chair in ''The History of Philosophical Thought''.

While philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] were known for producing new works influenced by German philosophy, Hyppolite is remembered as an expositor, teacher, and translator. He influenced a number of thinkers, including Deleuze, who studied Hegel under him at the [[Lycée Henri-IV]], and [[Michel Foucault]], as well as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gérard Granel]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] (at the ENS).&lt;ref name="Heckman74" /&gt;

Hyppolite died in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8960">'''John of Dumbleton''' ([[Latin]] ''Ioannes De Dumbleton''; c. 1310&amp;nbsp;– c. 1349) was a member of the Dumbleton village community in [[Gloucestershire]], a southwestern county in England. Although obscure, he is considered a significant English fourteenth-century philosopher for his contributions to [[logic]], [[natural philosophy]], and [[physics]]. Dumbleton’s masterwork is his ''Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis'' (Summary of Logic and Natural Philosophy), likely to have been composed just before the time of his death.

==Life==
John of Dumbleton is recorded to have become a [[fellow]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]] (''ca.'' 1338–9) and to have studied with the likes of [[William Heytesbury]], [[Thomas Bradwardine]], and [[Richard Swineshead]]. These four medieval scholastics held a common bond in that their study interests were in a similar field, but the method of study which brought these fellows into the same sphere of learning was of a more esoteric bent than modern university methods. They were interested in mathematics and logical analysis for the purposes of natural philosophy, [[theology]], and an [[a priori (epistemology)|''a priori'']] type of [[mathematical physics]] (not to be confused with modern, [[empirical]], [[experimental physics]]). Thus, the physics postulations and conjectures made by Dumbleton and his Oxford contemporaries were primarily done without any application of physical experimentation. Dumbleton, along with the other three Merton philosophers, received the moniker [[Oxford Calculators|'Calculators']] for their adherence to mathematics and logical disputation when solving philosophical and theological problems.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pasnau (ed.) and Christina Van Dyke (2nd ed.). ''The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy'' (Vol. II). (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010) p.904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer68&gt;Maurer, Armand A. (C.S.B.). ''A History of Philosophy: Medieval Philosophy'' (5th ed.). (USA: Random House, February, 1968) pp.256-60&lt;/ref&gt; After being named a fellow at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] (1340) and making a return to Merton College (1344–45) Dumbleton is recorded to have studied theology in Paris (ca. 1345–47) for a brief period before returning to finish his studies at Merton College (1347–1348).&lt;ref name=Hackett92&gt;Hackett, Jeremiah (Ed.). ''Medieval Philosophers (Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Vol. 115). (USA/United Kingdom: Gale Research International Limited, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|253}} The fact that no [[Extant literature|extant]] copy of Dumbleton's ''Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis'' is complete (nor edited) leads one to wonder if his death (''ca.'' 1349) abruptly terminated the possibility of its completion.

==Philosophical contributions==
Though there was a considerable reverence for [[Platonism]] in Oxford during the fourteenth century, the rebirth of [[Aristotelianism]] held sway in the higher Parisian learning circuits. Dumbleton, who studied in Paris for a brief time, was not immune to this spell. In fact, his [[compendium]] ''Summa Logica et Philosophiae Naturalis'', has an overview of many principles found in Aristotle's ''Physics''. The ''Summa'' is broken into ten different sections. The ninth section is uncompleted in all extant manuscripts. The tenth section, which, according to Dumbleton, was supposed to examine "[[universals]] and signification," shows no evidence of ever being worked on.&lt;ref name=Hackett92 /&gt;{{rp|254}} Although this is the case, the other sections of Dumbleton's ''Summa'' are filled with medieval philosophical gems. A couple emphasized topics to be found in the first section are "certitude and the psychology of logic."&lt;ref name=Hackett92 /&gt;{{rp|253}} It includes a medieval examination of [[epistemological]] issues; such as the [[certainty]] of knowledge. A strong Aristotelian appreciation is felt in the remaining sections, since the majority of the work is dedicated to commenting on the first eight chapters of Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', and his treatises ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' &amp; ''[[On the Soul]]''. In those sections of the ''Summa'' will be found discussions and commentary on such topics as: alteration, change (i.e., the measure of motion), properties of natural bodies and their forms (parts II and III); questions dealing with classification (e.g., "whether light belongs to some element";&lt;ref name=Hackett92 /&gt;{{rp|253}} motions and changes of bodies/forms (parts IV&amp;nbsp;– VI); and in the final sections an examination of the [[intellect]] and matters of the soul (parts VII&amp;nbsp;– IX).&lt;ref name=Hackett92 /&gt;{{rp|253–4}} It is difficult to assess why Dumbleton's ''Summa'' did not have a significant following, but it may have been because it was never completed or that it was not circulated well enough.

==Scientific contributions==
The four [[Oxford Calculators|Merton ‘Calculators’]] were not only well versed in the current issues of philosophy during the fourteenth century; they actually initiated new groundbreaking scientific postulations. John of Dumbleton was no exception. Because he concurred with many of the positions held by [[William Ockham]] (1288–1348)—especially the idea that is commonly referred to as [[Ockham’s razor]], which states that the most simplistic explanations are ideal—he may have learned how to succinctly formulate his scientific conjectures.

Of Dumbleton’s many scientific theories there is one in particular that is worth mentioning here. By making the assumption that bodies are finite, Dumbleton was able to conjecture that contraction or expansion, as in cases of [[condensation]] or [[rarefaction]], does not eliminate any parts of a body; rather, a “[[denumerable]] number of parts” always exists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (eds.). Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia. (Great Britain: Routledge, 2005) p. 518&lt;/ref&gt; Though the idea of [[molecules]] was not theorized at this time, Dumbleton’s speculation helped to tame the view that bodies have infinitely divisible parts.

Dumbleton was one of the first to express [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the [[mean speed theorem]] stating that "the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination, stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the [[Inverse-square law]], which was postponed nearly 250 years until its discovery by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1604.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
It is difficult to determine what methodology the Oxford 'Calculators' used when they were conjecturing and postulating theorems by way of [[abstraction]] (i.e., without empirical investigation). This criticism is not expressly made toward Dumbleton's conjectures but more broadly aimed at the methodology of the whole group of Mertonian physicists. One suggestion is that they may have been trying to create a mathematical picture of the Aristotelian world-view. If this were true, it would show why empirical investigation was not their ''[[modus operandi]]''. In other words, the Oxford Calculators' works show respect for quantitative reasoning; opposed to ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluations. Regardless of whether they opted against empirical investigation for theological reasons or simply because the debut of the [[scientific method]] was not ready to be revealed, one ought to regard John of Dumbleton and his contemporaries as exemplary pioneers in mathematics, physics, and logical discourse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6661">'''John Newbold Hazard''' (1909–1995) was a leading [[Americans|American]] scholar of [[Soviet law]] and public administration. Hazard was one of the pioneers in the field of Sovietology, particularly in Soviet law, administration and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=John Hazard, 86, Law Professor And a Top Sovietology Scholar|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/obituaries/john-hazard-86-law-professor-and-a-top-sovietology-scholar.html|work=The New York Times |date=April 11, 1995 |accessdate=July 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
John Newbold Hazard was born in [[Syracuse, N.Y.]], Jan. 5, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=HAZARD, JOHN NEWBOLD  |title= Who's Who in America 1995 |place= New Providence, NJ  |publisher=Marquis Who's Who |year=1994 |volume= 1 (A-K)|page=1623 |edition=49th |url= https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinamerica10marq |via= Internet Archive |accessdate= November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the A.B. from [[Yale]] in 1930, the LL.B. from [[Harvard]] in 1934 and the J.S.D. (Doctor of Juristic Science) from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1939.

His career as an American Sovietologist began shortly after the United States recognized the government of the [[USSR]] in 1933.

==Career==
Upon his graduation from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1934, he was sent by the Institute of Current World Affairs as the first American to study Soviet law at the Moscow Juridical Institute, later the [[Institute of State and Law]]. Only a handful of scholars were concerned with Russian diplomacy and business then, and scholarship on Russia was limited principally to historical studies. He approached the field of Soviet law as a pioneer and received the certificate of the Juridical Institute in 1937.

===Soviet desk===
When World War II broke out, Hazard joined the U.S. government and was assigned to the Soviet desk in the Division of Defense Aid Reports.

He helped negotiate the conditions under which the Soviet Union joined the [[Lend-Lease]] program as its major recipient. He became deputy director of the Soviet branch of the Lend-Lease Administration, through which the United States furnished food, machinery and services to its allies.

As an expert on the USSR, Hazard accompanied [[Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] on his secret mission to [[China]] in May, 1944.

The following year he was chosen as an expert on Soviet law to assist [[Justice Robert Jackson]] in preparing the prosecution of Nazi leaders to be brought before an international tribunal for war crimes.

===Columbia University===
With his return to civilian life in 1946, he joined the Columbia faculty.  Along with four other scholars, Hazard was a founder of the Russian Institute at [[Columbia University]], now the [[Harriman Institute]], the first academic center in America dedicated to Russian-Soviet studies.  He also was a founder of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, the first American professional organization in the field.

He was appointed professor of public law at the same time, beginning a teaching career that spanned two generations. He became the Nash Professor of Law in the [[Columbia Law School]], received emeritus status in 1977 and continued to teach each semester until 1994.

He was associated with the [[Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law]] at Columbia and helped shape its programs in Russian and East European law. He was the editor in chief of the Parker School Journal of East European Law, the leading journal in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pechota |first=Vratislav |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link=Ronald  |journal=The Parker School Journal of East European Law |title= John N.

The John N. Hazard Memorial Fellowship at Columbia's Harriman Institute exists to fund scholars researching Soviet and Russian law.

John N. Hazard was the mentor of famous [[Sovietologist]] [[Harold J. Berman]].

==Scholarship==
Hazard's books cover both political science and law. His textbook, ''The Soviet System of Government'', first published by University of Chicago Press in 1957, has been republished in five editions and several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John N. |last= Hazard |chapter= |title=The Soviet System of Government|place= Chicago and London|url=https://archive.org/details/sovietsystemofgo00john |year= 1980| publisher=The University of Chicago Press |edition= 5th. |via= Internet Archive|accessdate= July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books include ''Soviet Housing Law'' (1939), ''Law and Social Change in the USSR'' (1953), ''Settling Disputes in Soviet Society'' (1960), ''The Soviet System of Government'' (1957), ''Communists and Their Law'' (1969), ''Managing Change in the USSR'' (1983), and ''Recollections of a Pioneer Sovietologist'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;One of his last published works was: {{cite book|first=John N. |last= Hazard |chapter=Commonwealth of Independent States Law Digest |title=Martindale Hubbell International Law Digest, Argentina-Venezuela Law Digests, Selected International Conventions|place=New Providence, NJ and London, England |url=https://archive.org/details/martindalehubbel00newp |ISBN= 1-56160-113-6 |year= 1995| publisher=Martindale Hubbell, Reed Elsevier |via= Internet Archive|accessdate= July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his volumes are still in wide use in comparative law courses.

'''''Julius of Tarent''''' ({{lang-de|Julius von Tarent}}) is a dramatic [[tragedy]] by [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]]. Published in 1774, it is a notable work of the [[Sturm und Drang]] era. The play was a favourite of [[Friedrich Schiller]] and much acted in Germany. Its central theme is the struggle between the two princes Julius and Guido of Tarent for the affections of commoner Blanca.

Like in [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Klinger]]'s ''Die Zwillinge'', "a dynamic but frustrated man of action," Guido, "is opposed to a more pacific, melancholy figure," Julius.&lt;ref&gt;David Hill, Literature of the Sturm Und Drang, Volum 6, Camden House, 2003, p. 127, {{ISBN|1571131744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes the play as the forerunner of Friedrich Schiller's famous Sturm und Drang masterpiece ''[[The Robbers]]'' (1781).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335498/Johann-Anton-Leisewitz?anchor=ref141414 Johann Anton Leisewitz], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a teahouse in the temple's grounds]]

{{nihongo|'''Kōdai-ji'''|高台寺|''Kōdai-ji''}}, formally identified as {{nihongo|Jubuzan Kōdai-ji|鷲峰山高台寺|''Jubuzan Kōdai-ji''}}, is a temple of the [[Rinzai school]] of [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] in [[Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto|Higashiyama-ku]], [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]—the largest subtemple of the [[Kennin-ji]] branch.

==History==
[[File:Toyotomi Hideyoshi 1601.jpg|thumb|upright|This portrait of Toyotomi Hideyoshi is an Important Cultural Asset of Japan.]]
It was established in 1606 by the nun [[Kōdai-in]] (often known by the title Kita no [[Mandokoro]]), who was the widow of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], to pray for her late husband. The principal image is a statue of [[Gautama Buddha|Shaka]].

The gardens of Kōdai-ji are a [[Cultural Properties of Japan|nationally designated]] [[Monuments of Japan|Historic Site]] and [[Monuments of Japan|Place of Scenic Beauty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bsys/maindetails.asp?register_id=401&amp;item_id=1661 |title=高台寺庭園 |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple possesses a number of objects designated as Important Cultural Assets. Among these are the Main Gate and the Spirit Hall, noted for its use of ''[[maki-e]].'' The temple is nicknamed the ''maki-e'' temple." It also holds paintings, including one of Hideyoshi, as well as textiles, and a bronze [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] with an inscription dating it to 1606.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6210">'''''Latria''''' is a theological term ([[Latin]] ''Latrīa'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:λατρεία|λατρεία]], ''latreia'') used in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theology to mean [[adoration]], a reverence directed only to the [[Holy Trinity]]. Latria carries an emphasis on the internal form of worship, rather than external ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic beliefs and traditions'' by John F. O'Grady 2002 {{ISBN|0-8091-4047-0}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eucharist==
Latria also applies to the [[Eucharist]] and [[Eucharistic adoration]]. In the 16th century, the [[Council of Trent]] made specific affirmations of the presence of [[Christ]] in the Eucharist and the theological basis for Eucharistic adoration and stated:&lt;ref name= Hardon4 &gt;''The History of Eucharistic Adoration'' by John A Hardon 2003 {{ISBN|0-9648448-9-3}} pages 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The only-begotten Son of God is to be adored in the Holy
Sacrament of the Eucharist with the worship of "latria", including
external worship.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pope [[Paul VI]]'s 1965 encyclical ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]'':&lt;ref name= Hardon4 /&gt; also affirmed this belief and in items 56 stated:"The Catholic Church has always displayed and still displays this latria that ought to be paid to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, both during Mass and outside of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mysterium Fidei, item 56|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_03091965_mysterium_en.html|publisher=Vatican website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latria vs. Dulia and Hyperdulia==
''Latria'' is sacrificial in character, and may be offered only to God. Catholic and Orthodox Christians offer other degrees of reverence to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and to the [[Saint]]s; these non-sacrificial types of reverence are called ''[[hyperdulia]]'' and ''[[dulia]]'', respectively. In English, dulia is also called ''veneration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Devotion to Mary?|author-first=Mark|author-last=Miravalle|authorlink= Mark Miravalle|publisher=Mother of all peoples
|accessdate=November 2, 2013|date=November 24, 2006|url=http://www.motherofallpeoples.com/2006/11/what-is-devotion-to-mary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperdulia is essentially a heightened degree of dulia provided only to the Blessed Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;[[s.v.]] ''dulia'', {{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Third Edition|editor1-first=F.L.|editor1-last=Cross|editor2-first= E.A.|editor2-last=Livingstone|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction, written about as early as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Saint Jerome|St Jerome]], was detailed more explicitly by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his [[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], A.D. 1270: "Reverence is due to God on account of His Excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we pay to God, and which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia, and we shall speak of it further on [https://web.archive.org/web/20040603130204/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/310303.htm (103)]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=II II, 84, 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/308401.htm|publisher=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this next article St. Thomas Aquinas writes: "Wherefore dulia, which pays due service to a human lord, is a distinct virtue from latria, which pays due service to the Lordship of God. It is, moreover, a species of observance, because by observance we honor all those who excel in dignity, while dulia properly speaking is the reverence of servants for their master, dulia being the Greek for servitude".

==Linguistic distinctions in English==

Generally, in English, the word ''adoration'' is reserved for God alone and therefore it aptly translates ''latria''.  The word ''worship'' is derived from the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon dialect]] noun ''weorðscipe'' 'condition of being worthy', which is from ''weorð'' 'worthy' + ''-scipe'' '-ship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|worship}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''worship'' is used in a strong sense in relation to God (''latria''), but also in a weak sense in relation to man:  for instance, "His Worship the Mayor", or "Your Worship" (when addressing a magistrate in Court), or the worship of the saints (''dulia'') as distinct to the adoration of God (''latria'').  ''Adoration'' provides a clear and unequivocal, and therefore better, translation of ''latria'' and expression of the absolute sacrificial reverence due to God alone.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name ''latreia'' (Latinized, ''latria''), for which the best translation that our language affords is the word ''Adoration''. Adoration is different from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adoration|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01151a.htm|publisher=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians especially adore with ''latria'' during their religious service, the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or Divine Liturgy. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christians do not have a [[Eucharist]]ic sacrifice ''per se''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}; while [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] consider themselves to literally participate in the sacrifice at the foot of Calvary, that what Christ offered once "participates in the divine eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CCC § 1085|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c1a1.htm#II|publisher=Vatican Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurence BonJour''' (born August 31, 1943) is an [[American philosopher]] and Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernecker|first=Sven |title=Reading Epistemology: Selected Texts with Interactive Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bg8uhTI2hkC&amp;pg=PA139 |accessdate=January 28, 2011|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2763-5|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
He received his bachelor's degrees in Philosophy and Political Science from [[Macalester College]] and his doctorate in 1969 from [[Princeton University]] with a dissertation directed by [[Richard Rorty]].  Before moving to UW he taught at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;https://phil.washington.edu/people/laurence-bonjour&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
His areas of specialty include [[epistemology]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and [[British empiricism]].

BonJour is best known for his contributions to epistemology.  Initially defending [[coherentism]] in his anti-foundationalist critique ''The Structure of Empirical Knowledge'', BonJour has since moved to defend [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] [[foundationalism]] in such works as ''Epistemology'' and ''In Defense of Pure Reason''.  The latter book is a sustained defense of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' justification, strongly criticizing empiricists and pragmatists who dismiss it (such as [[W. V. O. Quine]] and [[Richard Rorty]]).

'''Louis Billot''' (12 January 1846 in [[Sierck-les-Bains]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], France – 18 December 1931 in [[Ariccia]], [[Latium]], Italy) was a [[France|French]] [[Jesuit]] priest and [[Theology|theologian]]. He became a cardinal in 1911 and resigned from that status in 1927, the only person to do so in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=walsh&gt;{{cite book | accessdate = 17 September 2017 | first = Michael J. | last = Walsh | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UX4U8QCJUW4C&amp;pg=PA220&amp; | page=220 | title = The Cardinals: Thirteen Centuries of the Men Behind the Papal Throne | publisher = William B. Eerdmanns Publishing | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Louis Billot, sometimes identified as '''Ludovic Billot''',&lt;ref name=purple/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;  studied at the [[Seminary|seminaries]] in [[Metz]], [[Bordeaux]], and [[Blois]]. Ordained a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] on 22 May 1869, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on 25 November in [[Angers]]. Billot did pastoral work in [[Paris]] from 1875 to 1878 and in [[Laval Mayenne|Laval]] until 1879.

He taught at the [[Université Catholique de l'Ouest|Catholic University of Angers]] from 1879 to 1882 and made his [[Religious vows|final vows]] as a Jesuit on 2 February 1883, while teaching at the Jesuit Scholasticate on [[Jersey]]. In 1885, Billot became a [[professor]] of [[dogmatic theology]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]]. In addition his academic post, he was named a [[consultor]] to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] on 19 June 1909.

A keen proponent of [[Thomism|Thomistic]] [[scholasticism]], Billot became a leading figure in [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and speculative [[theology]]. He produced numerous published works and attracted many students.&lt;ref&gt;McCool, Gerald A. ''Nineteenth-century Scholasticism: The Search for a Unitary Method''. Fordham University Press: 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in drafting [[Pope Pius X]]'s 1907 [[encyclical]] ''[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]'' and was a close friend of [[Henri Le Floch|Fr. Henri Le Floch]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[French Seminary]] in Rome.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

[[Pius X]] created him [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal Deacon]] of [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of 27 November 1911. Billot was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1914|cardinal electors]] in the [[Papal conclave, 1914|conclave of 1914]], and participated in [[Papal conclave, 1922|conclave of 1922]] as well. He was also one of the three [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]-[[President]]s of the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical Academy "S. Tommaso"]] in Rome, together with [[Benedetto Lorenzelli]] and [[Michele Lega]]. He was appointed a member of the [[Pontifical Biblical Commission]] on 6 February 1923.

==Resignation as cardinal==
Billot's support for the deeply [[Conservatism|conservative]] movement [[Action Française]] eventually created tension between him and the [[Holy See]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] believed that the movement used Catholicism for its own political ends and placed the movement's newspaper on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] which meant that it was banned from all Catholic homes. Billot expressed strong disagreement with the decision, saying that the political activities of [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Catholics ought not to be censured by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731030,00.html Billot v. Pope] October 3, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 1927, in a meeting with Pope Pius XI, Billot submitted a letter asking to be allowed to resign as cardinal. The Pope had a document drafted for his signature and accepted the resignation eight days later on 21 September. The Pope announced Billot's change in status to the [[College of Cardinals]] at the consistory on 19 December, saying: "The autograph letter with which he tendered his resignation adduced such high spiritual motives, and in such grave circumstances, that after much thought and prayer we decided to accept them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope in Allocution Silent on Disputes|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1927/12/20/96686894.pdf |accessdate=27 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=20 December 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billot had asked to be allowed to resign several times before.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Billot Dead at 85; A Retired Cardinal|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/12/19/118430500.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=19 December 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action Française suggested that the papal action against the newspaper had provoked Billot's action.&lt;ref name=purple&gt;{{cite news|title=French Cardinal Resigns Purple to Enter Monastery|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1927/10/16/101509065.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=16 October 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican said his meeting with the Pope was amicable and attributed his resignation to his age, which was 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Say Cardinal Resigned over French Paper Ban|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1927/09/21/119073467.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2017|work=New York Times|date=21 September 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; It said he had only an academic interest in Action Française.&lt;ref name=purple/&gt;

He was the only cardinal to resign that rank during the twentieth century,&lt;ref name=walsh/&gt; though others relinquished the rights and privileges of the office while retaining the title.{{efn|[[Hans Hermann Groër]], an Austrian monk and Archbishop of Vienna, was asked by [[Pope John Paul II]] to relinquish the rights and privileges of his cardinal's rank in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 17 September 2017 | work = New York Times | date = 15 April 1998 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/15/world/austrian-cardinal-quits-in-sex-scandal.html | title= Austrian Cardinal Quits in Sex Scandal | agency = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith O'Brien]], Archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, agreed with [[Pope Francis]] to a similar arrangement in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 17 September 2017 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11486525/Pope-Francis-strips-disgraced-Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-of-privileges-but-not-title.html | title = Pope Francis strips disgraced Cardinal Keith O’Brien of privileges but not title | date=20 March 2015 | first= John | last = Bingham | work= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Billot died at the Jesuit [[Novitiate]] of [[Galloro]], near [[Ariccia]], outside Rome, at the age of 85.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He is buried in the Jesuit [[chapel]] of the [[Campo Verano]] cemetery.

'''Mariano Iberico Rodríguez''' (* [[Cajamarca]], 1892 - died [[Lima]], 1974) was a Peruvian philosopher.

==Life and education==

He was born in Cajamarca, [[Peru]] on April 11, 1892 and received his higher education at the [[National University of San Marcos]] in Lima.  In 1919 he was awarded doctorates in Literature, Political Science and Administration, and Jurisprudence. After completing his training, he became a professor in the School of Arts at the University of San Marcos, the same center of Lima where he had completed his studies.  Throughout his career he would teach History of Modern Philosophy, Subjective Philosophy, History of Ancient Philosophy, Aesthetics and Contemporary Philosophers. From 1952-1955 he served as rector of the University and for a short period of time (December 1955), was Minister of Education.

==Philosophy and impact==

There are two main areas in which Dr. Iberico focused: the relationship between [[aesthetics]] and [[metaphysics]] and [[dialectics]] of being and appearing. In his treatment of aesthetics he was very influenced by the ideas of [[Henri Bergson]].  His theory of symbolic knowledge summarized the relationship between aesthetic experience and metaphysics (the "feeling of cosmic life"), considering the latter a transcendental improvement on the former.

Considering his theory of the relationship between ''being'' and ''appearing'', his most original contribution to philosophy, Dr. Iberico said that ''being'' ceases to be, in and of itself, when ''being'' ''appears'' mirrored before the conscience, which synthesizes ''being'' and ''appearance''. Thus a dialectic of ''being'' is created that is reflected in ''appearance'' and ''appearance'' acquires the status of ''being''.

The library of [http://www.unc.edu.pe The National University of Cajamarca] bears his name.

==Writings==

Among his most important writings are: 
* ''An Aesthetic Philosophy'' ({{lang-es|Una filosofía estética}}) (1920)
* ''The New Absolute'' ({{lang-es|El nuevo absoluto}}) (1926)
* ''The Journey of the Spirit'' ({{lang-es|El viaje del espíritu}}) (1929)
* ''The Divided Unity'' ({{lang-es|La unidad dividida}}) (1932)
* ''Notes on the Landscapes of the Sierra'' ({{lang-es|Notas sobre el paisaje de la sierra}}) (1937)
* ''The Sense of Cosmic Life'' ({{lang-es|El sentimiento de la vida cósmica}}) (1939)
* ''The Apparition: an essay on being and appearing'' ({{lang-es|La aparición: Ensayo sobre el ser y el aparecer}}) (1950).
* ''Psychology'' ({{lang-es|Psicología}}) (1958, co-written with [[Honorio Delgado]]).

{{distinguish|Material inference}}

The '''material conditional''' (also known as '''[[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]]''', '''material consequence''', or simply '''implication''', '''implies''', or '''conditional''') is a [[logical connective]] (or a [[binary operator]]) that is often symbolized by a forward arrow "→". The material conditional is used to form [[statement (logic)|statements]] of the form ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''q'' (termed a ''conditional statement'') which is read as "if ''p'' then ''q''". Unlike the English construction "if...&amp;nbsp;then...", the material conditional statement ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''q'' does not specify a [[causal relationship]] between ''p'' and ''q''. It is merely to be understood to mean "if ''p'' is true, then ''q'' is also true" such that the statement ''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''q'' is false only when ''p'' is true and ''q'' is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=forallx: An Introduction to Formal Logic|url=http://www.fecundity.com/codex/forallx.pdf|author=Magnus, P.D|date=January 6, 2012|publisher=Creative Commons|page=25|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The material conditional only states that ''q'' is true when (but not necessarily only when) ''p'' is true, and makes no claim that ''p'' causes ''q''.

The material conditional is also symbolized using:
# 𝑝 ⊃ 𝑞 (Although this symbol may be used for the superset symbol in [[set theory]].);
# 𝑝 ⇒ 𝑞 (Although this symbol is often used for [[logical consequence]] (''i.e.,'' logical implication) rather than for material conditional.)
# C𝑝𝑞 (using [[Polish notation#Polish notation for logic|Łukasiewicz notation]] or [[Józef_Maria_Bocheński|Bocheński notation]])

With respect to the material conditionals above:
* ''p'' is termed the '''[[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]''' of the conditional, and
* ''q'' is termed the '''[[consequent]]''' of the conditional.

Conditional statements may be nested such that either or both of the antecedent or the consequent may themselves be conditional statements. In the example {{gaps|"(''p''|→|''q'')&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;(''r''|→|''s'')"}}, meaning "if the truth of ''p'' implies the truth of ''q'', then the truth of ''r'' implies the truth of ''s''), both the antecedent and the consequent are conditional statements.

In [[classical logic]] &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\neg(p \land \neg q)&lt;/math&gt; and by [[De Morgan's Law]] logically equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\neg p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modern Formal Logic Primer: Sentence Logic Volume 1|url=http://tellerprimer.ucdavis.edu/pdf/1ch4.pdf|author=Teller, Paul|date=January 10, 1989|publisher=Prentice Hall|page=54|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, in [[minimal logic]] (and therefore also intuitionistic logic) &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; only [[Logical consequence|logically entails]] &lt;math&gt;\neg(p \land \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;; and in [[intuitionistic logic]] (but not minimal logic) &lt;math&gt;\neg p \lor q&lt;/math&gt; entails &lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definitions==
Logicians have many different views on the nature of material implication and approaches to explain its sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/gries/symposium/clarke.htm | title=A Comparison of Techniques for Introducing Material Implication | publisher=Cornell University | date=March 1996 | accessdate=March 4, 2012 | author=Clarke, Matthew C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a truth function===
In [[classical logic]], the compound {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}} is logically equivalent to the negative compound: not both ''p'' and not ''q''. Thus the compound {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}} is ''false'' [[if and only if]] both ''p'' is true and ''q'' is false.  By the same stroke, {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}} is ''true'' if and only if either ''p'' is false or ''q'' is true (or both). Thus → is a function from pairs of [[truth value]]s of the components ''p'', ''q'' to truth values of the compound {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}}, whose truth value is entirely a function of the truth values of the components. Hence, this interpretation is called ''[[Truth function|truth-functional]]''. The compound {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}} is logically equivalent also to {{gaps|¬''p''|∨|''q''}} (either not ''p'', or ''q'' (or both)), and to {{gaps|¬''q''|→|¬''p''}} (if not ''q'' then not ''p''). But it is not equivalent to {{gaps|¬''p''|→|¬''q''}}, which is equivalent to {{gaps|''q''|→|''p''}}.

====Truth table====
The [[truth table]] associated with the material conditional {{gaps|''p''|→|''q''}} is identical to that of {{gaps|¬''p''|∨|''q''}}. It is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;|| &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; p \rightarrow q &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || T
|- 
| T || F || F
|-
| F || T || T
|-
| F || F || T
|}

It may also be useful to note that in [[Boolean algebra]], true and false can be denoted as 1 and 0 respectively with an equivalent table.

===As a formal connective===
The material conditional can be considered as a symbol of a [[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]], taken as a set of sentences, satisfying all the classical inferences involving&amp;nbsp;→, in particular the following characteristic rules:

# [[Modus ponens]];
# [[Conditional proof]];
# [[contraposition|Classical contraposition]];
# [[reductio ad absurdum|Classical reductio ad absurdum]].

Unlike the truth-functional one, this approach to logical connectives permits the examination of structurally identical propositional forms in various [[Formal system|logical system]]s, where somewhat different properties may be demonstrated. For example, in [[intuitionistic logic]] which rejects proofs by contraposition as valid rules of inference, {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''q'')&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;¬''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''}} is not a propositional theorem, but [[False (logic)#False, negation and contradiction|the material conditional is used to define negation]].

==Formal properties==

When studying logic formally, the material conditional is distinguished from the [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic consequence]] relation &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt;. We say &lt;math&gt;A \models B&lt;/math&gt; if every interpretation that makes ''A'' true also makes ''B'' true. However, there is a close relationship between the two in most logics, including [[classical logic]]. For example, the following principles hold:

* If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\models\psi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\varnothing\models(\varphi_1\land\dots\land\varphi_n\rightarrow\psi)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n\in\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. (This is a particular form of the [[deduction theorem]]. In words, it says that if Γ models ''ψ'' this means that ''ψ'' can be deduced just from some subset of the theorems in Γ.)
* The converse of the above
* Both &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; are [[Monotonic function|monotonic]]; i.e., if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\models\psi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Delta\cup\Gamma\models\psi&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;\varphi\rightarrow\psi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(\varphi\land\alpha)\rightarrow\psi&lt;/math&gt; for any ''α'', Δ. (In terms of structural rules, this is often referred to as [[weakening (logic)|weakening]] or ''thinning''.)

These principles do not hold in all logics, however. Obviously they do not hold in [[non-monotonic logic]]s, nor do they hold in [[relevance logic]]s.

Other properties of implication (the following expressions are always true, for any logical values of variables):

* [[distributivity]]: &lt;math&gt;(s \rightarrow (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow ((s \rightarrow p) \rightarrow (s \rightarrow q))&lt;/math&gt;
* [[transitive relation|transitivity]]: &lt;math&gt;(a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow ((b \rightarrow c) \rightarrow (a \rightarrow c))&lt;/math&gt;
* [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;
* [[connex relation|totality]]: &lt;math&gt;(a \rightarrow b) \vee (b \rightarrow a)&lt;/math&gt;
* truth preserving: The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of material implication.
* commutativity of antecedents: &lt;math&gt;(a \rightarrow (b \rightarrow c)) \equiv (b \rightarrow (a \rightarrow c))&lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow (b \rightarrow c)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;(a \land b) \rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;; this property is sometimes called [[currying|un/currying]].  Because of these properties, it is convenient to adopt a [[right-associative]] notation for → where &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b \rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow (b \rightarrow c)&lt;/math&gt;.

Comparison of Boolean truth tables shows that &lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\neg a \lor b&lt;/math&gt;, and one is an equivalent replacement for the other in classical logic. See [[material implication (rule of inference)]].

== Philosophical problems with material conditional ==

Outside of mathematics, it is a matter of some controversy as to whether the [[truth function]] for [[material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]] provides an adequate treatment of conditional statements in a [[natural language]] such as English, i.e., [[indicative conditional]]s and [[counterfactual conditional]]s. An indicative conditional is a [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] in the [[indicative mood]] with a [[Conditional sentence|conditional clause]] attached. A counterfactual conditional is a false-to-fact sentence in the [[subjunctive mood]].&lt;ref name="sep-conditionals"/&gt;  That is to say, critics argue that in some non-mathematical cases, the truth value of a compound statement, "if ''p'' then ''q''", is not adequately determined by the truth values of ''p'' and ''q''.&lt;ref name="sep-conditionals"/&gt;  Examples of non-truth-functional statements include: "''q'' because ''p''", "''p'' before ''q''" and "it is possible that ''p''".&lt;ref name="sep-conditionals"/&gt;

"[Of] the sixteen possible truth-functions of ''A'' and ''B'', material implication is the only serious candidate. First, it is uncontroversial that when ''A'' is true and ''B'' is false, "If ''A'', ''B''" is false. A basic rule of inference is [[modus ponens]]: from "If ''A'', ''B''" and ''A'', we can infer ''B''. If it were possible to have ''A'' true, ''B'' false and "If ''A'', ''B''" true, this inference would be invalid. Second, it is uncontroversial that "If ''A'', ''B''" is sometimes true when ''A'' and ''B'' are respectively (true, true), or (false, true), or (false, false)… Non-truth-functional accounts agree that "If ''A'', ''B''" is false when ''A'' is true and ''B'' is false; and they agree that the conditional is sometimes true for the other three combinations of truth-values for the components; but they deny that the conditional is always true in each of these three cases. Some agree with the truth-functionalist that when ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, "If ''A'', ''B''" must be true. Some do not, demanding a further relation between the facts that ''A'' and that ''B''."&lt;ref name="sep-conditionals"&gt;{{cite web |first=Dorothy |last=Edgington |editor=Edward N. Zalta |year=2008 |title=Conditionals |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Winter 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/conditionals/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The truth-functional theory of the conditional was integral to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s new logic (1879). It was taken up enthusiastically by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] (who called it "material implication"), [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'', and the [[logical positivist]]s, and it is now found in every logic text. It is the first theory of conditionals which students encounter. Typically, it does not strike students as ''obviously'' correct. It is logic's first surprise. Yet, as the textbooks testify, it does a creditable job in many circumstances. And it has many defenders. It is a strikingly simple theory: "If ''A'', ''B''" is false when ''A'' is true and ''B'' is false. In all other cases, "If ''A'', ''B''" is true. It is thus equivalent to "~(''A''&amp;~''B'')" and to "~''A'' or ''B''". "''A'' ⊃ ''B''" has, by stipulation, these truth conditions.|[[Dorothy Edgington]]|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|"Conditionals"&lt;ref name="sep-conditionals"/&gt;}}

The meaning of the material conditional can sometimes be used in the English "if ''condition'' then ''consequence''" construction (a kind of [[conditional sentence]]), where ''condition'' and ''consequence'' are to be filled with English sentences. However, this construction also implies a "reasonable" connection between the condition ([[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]]) and consequence ([[Consequent|apodosis]]) (see [[Connexive logic]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The material conditional can yield some unexpected truths when expressed in natural language. For example, any material conditional statement with a false antecedent is true (see [[vacuous truth]]). So the statement "if 2 is odd then 2 is even" is true. Similarly, any material conditional with a true consequent is true. So the statement "if I have a penny in my pocket then Paris is in France" is always true, regardless of whether or not there is a penny in my pocket. These problems are known as the [[paradoxes of material implication]], though they are not really paradoxes in the strict sense; that is, they do not elicit logical contradictions. These unexpected truths arise because speakers of English (and other natural languages) are tempted to [[equivocation|equivocate]] between the material conditional and the [[indicative conditional]], or other conditional statements, like the [[counterfactual conditional]] and the [[logical biconditional|material biconditional]].

It is not surprising that a rigorously defined truth-functional operator does not correspond exactly to all notions of implication or otherwise expressed by 'if ... then ...' sentences in natural languages. For an overview of some of the various analyses, formal and informal, of conditionals, see the "References" section below. [[Relevance logic]] attempts to capture these alternate concepts of implication that material implication glosses over.

'''Mohammed Bagayogo Es Sudane Al Wangari Al Timbukti ''' was an eminent scholar from [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]. He was the Sheik and professor of highly esteemed scholar, [[Ahmed Baba]] and teacher at the [[Sankore Madrasah]], one of three philosophical schools in Mali during West Africa's golden age (i.e. 12th-16th centuries); the other two were Sidi Yahya University and Jingaray Ber university. He was born in [[Djenné]] in 1523. A significant amount of his writings has been preserved in manuscript form in ''Institute Ahmed Baba of Tombouctou'', a repository for [[African literature]]. Some of the manuscripts found their way into French museums. A project is under way to digitalise these manuscripts which will lead to better understanding of the culture that flourished in Mali in the [[medieval period]].

Mohammed Bagayogo also has a place in Mali history for his refusal to comply with Moroccan occupiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/history.html |title=History of Timbuktu, Mali |accessdate=2007-07-17 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704094351/http://www.timbuktufoundation.org/history.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He died on July 7, 1593 in what is now old town of Timbuktu.

'''Moshe Idel''' ({{lang-he-n|משה אידל}}) is a Romanian born historian and philosopher of Jewish mysticism. He is Emeritus Max Cooper Professor in Jewish Thought at the [[Hebrew University]], Jerusalem, and a Senior Researcher at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]].

==Life and scholarship==
{{Kabbalah}}
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Born in [[Târgu Neamț]], [[Romania]], in 1947, Idel was a precocious child, with a passion for reading which made him read all the books in the town, cooperative, then High school Library, in addition to buying more books with the money earned by singing at weddings.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"&gt;http://www.idee.ro/jewish_heritage_2/targu_neamt.html#C05&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] did not directly affect the Jewish population of Târgu Neamț, they were affected by the so-called [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|“population displacements”]]. In 1963 he immigrated with his family to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Garb, Jonathan (2007). "Moshe Idel." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Macmillan Reference USA. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrolled at the [[Hebrew University]], he studied under [[Gershom Scholem]]. After earning his doctorate with a thesis on [[Abraham Abulafia]], he eventually succeeded [[Gershom Scholem|Scholem]] to the chair of Jewish Thought.  He has served as visiting Professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[UCLA]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/moshe_idel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Idel has undertaken a systematic revision of the history and analysis of [[Jewish mysticism]]. His explorations of the mythical, theurgical, mystical, and messianic dimensions of Judaism have been attentive to history, sociology, and anthropology, while rejecting a naïve historicist approach to Judaism.&lt;ref name="brill.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/moshe-idel|title=Moshe Idel: Representing God|author=|date=6 October 2014|website=brill.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His 1988 work, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives'' ([[Yale University Press]]), is said to have revolutionised [[Kabbalah]] studies.&lt;ref name="Mopsik"&gt;[[Charles Mopsik]], ''Moshé Idel, lauréat du prix Israël'', Association Charles Mopsik, en ligne&lt;/ref&gt; His historical and phenomenological studies of rabbinic, philosophic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic texts have transformed the understanding of Jewish intellectual history and highlighted the close relationship between magic, mysticism, and liturgy.&lt;ref name="brill.com"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1999, Idel was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for excellent achievement in the field of Jewish philosophy, and in 2002 the [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|EMET Prize]] for Jewish Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=39&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About|title=Faculty - Shalom Hartman Institute|first=Shalom Hartman|last=Institute|date=|website=hartman.org.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he received the [[Koret Jewish Book Award|Koret Award]] for Jewish philosophy for his book ''Absorbing Perfections''.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"/&gt; He has been conferred [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] by the universities of [[Yale University|Yale]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Budapest University|Budapest]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[University of Haifa|Haifa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.haifa.ac.il/~focus/2003-autumn/05hondocs.html|title=Focus Newspaper - Autumn 2003|author=|date=|website=research.haifa.ac.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iasi]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2010/12/17/professor-moshe-idel-phd-doctor-honoris-causa-of-alexandru-ioan-cuza-university-of-iasi-12-56-17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Bucharest|Bucharest]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The '''New Orleans Zen Temple''' is a dojo of the [[Soto Zen]] tradition in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  Robert Livingston Roshi was the abbot until his retirement in 2016, and Richard Collins is the current abbot.  Livingston, a close disciple of Taisen Deshimaru,  founded the temple in 1984.  Before his death in 1982, Deshimaru asked Livingston to go to the United States to open a Zen dojo and teach true Zen practice in the United States. The temple is also the home of the [http://www.nozt.org/aza.shtml American Zen Association], which gives support to zen dojos and publishes rare [[Buddhist]] texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6043">The philosopher [[Michel Henry]] defines [[God]] in a phenomenological point of view. He says: "God is Life, he is the essence of [[phenomenological life|Life]], or, if one prefers, the essence of Life is God. Saying this we already know what God is, we know it not through the effect of some knowledge or learning, we do not know it through thought, against the background of the truth of the world. Rather we know it, and can know it, only in and through Life itself. We can know the essence of God only in God."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Stanford University Press, 2003, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska, ''Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie'', Beauchesne, 2003, p. 246 : "Le salut, la foi, la connaissance de Dieu, la communion avec Lui, reviennent à expérimenter dans le souffrir-jouir de la Vie le Don infini et l'Amour qui se révèlent en creux dans cet engendrement."&lt;/ref&gt;

This Life is not biological [[Meaning of life|life]] defined by objective and exterior properties, nor an abstract and empty philosophical concept, but the absolute [[phenomenological life]], a radically immanent life which possesses in it the power of showing itself in itself without distance, a life which reveals permanently itself.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Capelle (éd.), ''Phénoménologie et Christianisme chez Michel Henry'', Editions du Cerf, 2004, p. 21 : "Puisqu'il est question de la vie, écartons ici une équivoque. La vie n'est-t-elle pas l'objet de cette science en plein essor qui s'appelle la biologie ? Il faut répondre négativement : il n'y a pas de vie en biologie."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Capelle (éd.), ''Phénoménologie et Christianisme chez Michel Henry'', Editions du Cerf, 2004, p. 21 : "Le concept d'immanence est celui qui a le plus manqué à la pensée occidentale, c'est cette absence qui a fait d'elle une pensée extérieure de la réalité, et, à ce titre, le plus souvent superficielle."&lt;/ref&gt; A manifestation of oneself and a self-revelation which doesn’t consist in the fact of seeing outside oneself or of perceiving the exterior world, but in the fact of feeling and of feeling oneself, of experiencing in oneself its own inner and affective reality.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Stanford University Press, 2003, p. 33-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Michel Henry says also in this same book, "God is that pure Revelation that reveals nothing other than itself. God reveals Himself. The Revelation of God is his self-revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Stanford University Press, 2003, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska, ''Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie'', Beauchesne, 2003, p. 159 : "L'objet de ''C'est moi la Vérité'' n'est ainsi rien d'autre que Dieu comme cette Archi-Essence de la phénoménalité laissée en suspens depuis la parution de ''L'Essence de la manifestation''. Le philosophe nous invite à rejoindre le Fond originaire qui soutient, comme un abîme d'infinité, l'être du sujet humain [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; God is in himself revelation, he is the primordial Revelation that tears everything from [[nothingness]], a revelation which is the pathetic self-revelation and the absolute self-enjoyment of Life. As John says, God is love, because Life loves itself in an infinite and eternal love.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Stanford University Press, 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Dufour-Kowalska, ''Michel Henry, passion et magnificence de la vie'', Beauchesne, 2003, p. 195 : "L'amour divin peut-il signifier davantage ? Davantage que le fait pour Dieu de nous donner sa propre vie en partage, sa propre auto-révélation dans cette "étreinte pathétique" qui le constitue ?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Michel Henry opposes to the notion of creation, which is the creation of the world, the notion of generation of Life. The creation of the world consists in the opening of this exteriority horizon where every thing becomes visible. Whereas Life never stops to generate itself and to generate all the livings in its radical immanence, in its absolute phenomenological interiority that is without gap nor distance.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''Paroles du Christ'', éd. du Seuil, 2002, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translation in English : Michel Henry, ''Words of Christ'', Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As we are living and by consequence generated continually by the infinite Life of God, as he never stops to give us life, and as we never cease of being born into the eternal present of life by the action in us of this absolute Life, God is for Christianity our Father and we are its beloved Sons, the Sons of the living God.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Vidalin, ''La parole de la vie'', Parole et silence, 2006, pp. 79-87&lt;/ref&gt; This doesn’t only mean that he has created us at the time of our conception or at the beginning of the world, but that he never stops to generate us permanently into Life, that he is always at work in us in the least of our subjective impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Henry, ''I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of Christianity'', Stanford University Press, 2003, p. 152-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland Hagenbüchle''' (13 October 1932 in [[Frauenfeld]], [[Switzerland]] &amp;ndash; 14 January 2008) was a scholar for American Studies and cultural philosopher.

==Life, teaching and research==
Hagenbüchle studied first architecture at the ETH Zurich and completed a two-year internship in Basel, then linguistics, English and German at the University of Zurich. After studying in Cambridge (UK) and Nancy he finished his PH.D. in Zurich 1964. From 1970 to 1972 Hagenbüchle was docotoral fellow at [[Yale University]]. In 1974 he finished the habilitation in Zürich. 

After visiting professorships in Bern, Göttingen and at the John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies, Free University of Berlin, he was appointed in 1975 to a professorship at the newly opened University of Wuppertal. In 1980, Hagenbüchle simultaneously got two calls to the University of Marburg and at the Catholic University of Eichstätt. Hagenbüchle was from 1980 to 1996 Chair of American Studies at the [[Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt]]. 

Roland Hagenbüchle is an internationally renowned interpreter of the works of American poet [[Emily Dickinson]]. After the retirement in 1996 Hagenbüchle moved his research interests to the broader field of [[cultural philosophy]], especially on interculturality, the problematic relationship between the different cultures and the critique of Western thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10902">'''Roscelin of Compiègne''' ({{circa|lk=no|1050|1125}}), better known by his [[Latinization of names|Latinized name]] '''Roscellinus Compendiensis''' or '''Rucelinus''', was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]], often regarded as the founder of [[Medieval nominalism|nominalism]].
{{TOClimit|2}}
==Biography==
Roscellinus was born in [[Compiègne]], [[France]]. Little is known of his life, and knowledge of his doctrines is mainly derived from [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] and [[Abelard]].

He studied at [[Soissons]] and [[Reims]], was afterwards attached to the [[cathedral of Chartres]] and became canon of [[Compiègne]]. As a monk of Compiègne, he was teaching as early as 1087. He had contact with [[Lanfranc]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]] and [[St. Ivo of Chartres]].

It seems most probable that Roscellinus was not strictly the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in his exposition they received more definite expression, and being applied to the [[dogma]] of the [[Trinity]], attracted universal attention.

Roscellinus maintained that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents our speaking of the three persons as three substances or three Gods. If it were otherwise, and the three persons were really one substance or thing (''una res''), we should be forced to admit that the Father and the [[Holy Spirit]] became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems to have put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith, and to have claimed for it at first the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm.

In 1092/1093, however, a [[Council of Soissons|council convoked at Soissons]] by the [[archbishop of Reims]] condemned his interpretation,{{refn|group=n|Roscelin's writings and the council's acts have not survived and we know about them principally through the correspondence and writings of [[St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]].{{sfnp|Cunningham|1836|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vEA_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA312 p.&amp;nbsp;312, n.&amp;nbsp;6]}}}} and Roscellinus, who was accused of tritheism, recanted the doctrines attributed to him, but only out of fear of [[excommunication]] and even [[stoning]] to death by the orthodox populace, for later he returned to his early theories. He fled to England, but having made himself unpopular by an attack on the doctrines of Anselm, he left the country and repaired to Rome, where he was well received and became reconciled to the Catholic Church. He then returned to France, taught at [[Tours]] and Loc-menach ([[Loches]]) in [[France]] (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and finally became canon of [[Besançon]]. He is heard of as late as 1121, when he came forward to oppose Abelard's views on the Trinity. He was also sent a letter by [[Theobald of Étampes]] for having denigrated wrongfully the sons of priests.

Of his writings there exists only a letter addressed to Abelard on the Trinity, in which Roscellinus "belittles Abélard and makes merry over his castration."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''The History of Western Philosophy''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barthélemy Hauréau|Hauréau]] brings forward his name in connection with a text: "Sententia de universalibus secundum magistrum R." ("Notices et extr. de quelques manuscr. lat.", V, Paris, 1892, 224), but this is a conjecture. We have as evidences of his doctrine texts of Anselm, Abelard, [[John of Salisbury]], and an anonymous epigram. His share in the history of ideas and especially his nominalism have been exaggerated, his celebrity being far more due to his theological tritheism.

==Roscelin's nominalism, or ''Sententia Vocum''==
According to [[Otto of Freisingen]] Roscelin ''primus nostris temporibus sententiam vocum instituit'' (''Gesta Friderici imp''. in ''[[Monum. German. Histor.: Script.]]'', XX, 376) (Literally: "was the first in our times to institute the opinion/theory of words"), but the chronicler of the "Historia Francia" (cf. [[Martin Bouquet|Bouquet]], "''Recueil des hist. des Gaules et de la France''", XII, Paris, 1781, 3, b, c) mentions before him a "magister Johannes", whose personality is much discussed and who has not yet been definitively identified. What constitutes the ''sententia vocum''? To judge of it we have besides the texts mentioned above which bear directly on Roscelin an exposition of the treatise ''De generibus et speciebus'' (thirteenth century), wrongly attributed to Abelard by [[Victor Cousin]]. The "sententia vocum" was one of the anti-Realist solutions of the [[problem of universals]] accepted by the early Middle Ages. Resuming [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s alternative (''mox de generibus et speciebus illud quidem sive subsistent sive in nudis intellectibus posita sint'') the first medieval philosophers regarded genera and species (substance, corporeity, animality, humanity) either as things or as having no existence, and applying to this alternative a terminology of [[Boethius]], they derived thence either res (things) or voces (words). To the nominalists [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] were ''voces'' 'voices', which means: (1) above all that universals are not ''res'', that is that only the individual exists: ''nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum ...'' (De gener. et spec., 524). Nominalism was essentially anti-Realist. (2) that universals are merely words, '''''flatus vocis''''', e.g., the word "homo", divisible into syllables, consonants and vowels. ''Fuit autem, nemini magistri nostri Roscellini tam insana sententia ut nullam rem partibus constare vellet, sed sicut solis vocibus species, ita et partes ascridebat'' (Abelard, ''Liber divisionum'', ed. Cousin, 471); "[...] ''Illi utique dialectici, qui non nisi flatum vocis putant universalis esse substantias, et qui colorem non aliud queunt intellegere quam corpus, nec sapientiam hominis aliud quam animam, prorsus a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi.''" (Anselm, ''De Incarnatione Verbi'', p. 285. Opera Omnia, vol. 1. Ed. F.S. Schmitt, 1938); "''Alius ergo consistit in vocibus, licet haec opinio cum Roscelino suo fere omnino evanuerit'' (John of Salisbury, ''Metalog.'', II, 17). The universal is reduced to an emission of sound (''flatus vocis''), in conformity with Boethius' definition: ''Nihil enim aliud est prolatio (vocis) quam aeris plectro linguae percussio''. Roscelin's universal corresponds to what is now called the "universale in voce" in opposition to ''universale in re'' and ''universale in intellectu''.

But this theory of Roscelin's had no connection with the abstract concept of genus and species. He did not touch on this question. It is certain that he did not deny the existence or possibility of these concepts, and he was therefore not a nominalist in the fashion of [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]] or in the sense in which nominalism is now understood. That is why, in reference to the modern sense of the word, some call it a pseudo-nominalism. John of Salisbury, speaking of "nominalis secta" (Metalog., II, 10), gives it quite another meaning. So Roscelin's rudimentary, even childish, solution does not compromise the value of universal concepts and may be called a stage in the development of [[moderate realism]]. However, because of his position as the first medieval philosopher to challenge medieval Realism, he has been invoked as a forefather of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Utz, "Medievalism as Modernism: Alfred Andersch's Nominalist ''Littérature engageé''," ''Studies in Medievalism'' 6 (1993), 76–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roscelin was also taken to task by Anselm and Abelard for the less clear idea which he gave of the whole and of composite substance. According to Anselm he maintained that colour does not exist independently of the horse which serves as its support and that the wisdom of the soul is not outside of the soul which is wise (De fide trinit., 2). He denies to the whole, such as house, man, real existence of its parts. The word alone had parts, ''ita divinam paginam pervertit, ut eo loco quo Dominus partem piscis assi comedisse partem hujus vocis, quae est piscis assi, non partem rei intelligere cogatur'' (Cousin, P. Abaelardi opera, II. 151).

Roscelin was not without his supporters; among them was his contemporary [[Raimbert of Lille]], and what the monk [[Hériman of Tournai|Hériman]] relates of his doctrine agrees with the statements of the master of Compiègne. Universal substances, says Hériman, are but a breath, which means ''eos de sapientium numero merito esse exsufflandos''. He merely comments on the saying of Anselm characterized by the same jesting tone: a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi" (''[[Patrologia Latina|P.L.]]'', 256a), and says that to understand the windy loquacity of Raimbert of Lille one has but to breathe into his hand (''manuque ori admota exsufflans'' "''Mon. Germ. Hist.''", XIV, 275).

==Tritheism of Roscelin==
Roscelin considered the three Divine Persons as three independent beings, like three angels; if usage permitted, he added, it might truly be said that there are three Gods. Otherwise, he continued, God the Father and God the Holy Ghost would have become incarnate with God the Son. To retain the appearance of dogma he admitted that the three Divine Persons had but one will and power [''Audio ... quod Roscelinus clericus dicit in tres personas esse tres res ab invicem separatas, sicut sunt tres angeli, ita tamen ut una sit voluntas et potestas aut Patrem et Spiritum sanctum esse incarnatum; et tres deos vere posse dici si usus admitteret'' (letter of Anselm to Foulques)].

This characteristic [[tritheism]], which Anselm and Abelard agreed in refuting even after its author's conversion, seems an indisputable application of Roscelin's anti-Realism. He even argues that if the three Divine Persons form but one God, all three have become incarnate. There are therefore three Divine substances, three Gods, as there are three angels, because each substance constitutes an individual, which is the fundamental assertion of anti-Realism. The ideas of the theologian are closely linked with those of the philosopher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">'''Le Saulchoir''' is a [[Dominican order|Dominican]] school of theology in the order's province of [[France]], established 1904.

After the [[Anti-clericalism#Third Republic|expulsion from France]] in 1880, French Dominican friars went into exile in Spain and Austria; they were allowed to return in 1895, establishing themselves in the convent of [[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliothequedusaulchoir.org/French/historique/hist.html Histoire de la bibliothèque du Saulchoir]&lt;/ref&gt;
After the renewed expulsion in 1903, the Dominicans were exiled to Belgium, residing at Kain (now a part of [[Tournai]]). 
Here, they established a   ''studium generale'' in 1904, in a former Cistercian abbey called ''Le Saulchoir''. 
From there, they published two journals, ''Revue des Sciences philosophiques et théologiques'' (from 1907)
and the ''Bulletin thomiste'' (from 1924, not to be confused with ''Revue thomiste'', a neo-Thomist journal established in 1893). 
In 1939, the Dominicans were allowed back into [[French Third Republic|France]] and they established themselves in [[Étiolles]] ([[Essonne]] département), retaining the name of ''Le Sauchoir'' for their school. They remained in Étiolles until 1971, in which year they moved to the [[couvent Saint-Jacques]] in [[Paris]] where the ''Centre d'études du Saulchoir'' was established in 1992.

The '''Scottish Ministerial Code''' applies to members of the [[Scottish Government]] (the First Minister, Cabinet Secretaries and Law Officers) and junior Scottish Ministers. The guidance is issued by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] and is a collection of standards around expected behaviours and responsibilities. Since 2008 there has been a mechanism for an independent review of any suspected breaches of the code.

==History==
Drafting of the new Scottish Ministerial Code was discussed at the first meeting of the Cabinet on 20 May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/donald-dewar-s-cabinet-minutes-unveiled-1-3648391 |title=Donald Dewar's cabinet minutes unveiled |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a [[Ministerial Code|code]] used in [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/jim-gallagher-time-to-crack-the-scottish-ministerial-code-1-2733388 |title=Time to crack the Scottish Ministerial Code |first=Jim |last= Gallagher |authorlink=Jim Gallagher (civil servant) |work=The Scotsman |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version was issued in August 1999.

The 2008 version introduced changes that specifically prohibited ministers from making misleading statements in the Parliament chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/outside-scrutiny-needed-to-keep-ministers-on-best-behaviour-1-1264050 |title=Outside scrutiny needed to keep ministers on best behaviour |first=Patrick |last=Harvie |authorlink=Patrick Harvie |work=The Scotsman |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 changes were made to allow Ministers to confirm whether they have received legal advice on a specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13412794.SNP_Government_changes_ethics_code_without_input_from_MSPs/ |title=SNP Government changes ethics code without input from MSPs |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |work=[[The Sunday Herald]] |date=14 June 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministerial parliamentary aides were originally not able to sit on committees that provided scrutiny of their Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/ian-swanson-scottish-politics-1-943845 |title=Scottish Politics |first=Ian |last=Swanson |work=The Scotsman |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positions became known as Parliamentary Liaison Officers (PLOs) and the restriction was removed in 2007. In August 2016&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14952675.Sturgeon_to_toughen_Ministerial_Code_on_Holyrood_aides/ |title=First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to toughen Ministerial Code on Holyrood aides |first=Tom |last=Gordon |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=8 December 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement was introduced for PLOs to declare this on the first occasion that they took part in parliamentary business within the remit of their Cabinet Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/scottish-government-removes-ministerial-aides-committees-after-conflict-interest |title=Scottish Government removes ministerial aides from committees after 'conflict of interest' pressure |first=Tom |last=Freeman |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December this had been tightened up to extend to every occasion.&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"/&gt;

The February 2018 version contained new sections to guard against harassment, bullying and other such inappropriate behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/12318/scottish-ministerial-code-updated-clamp-down-harassment |title=Scottish ministerial code updated to clamp down on harassment |first=Caitlin |last=Logan |work=[[CommonSpace]] |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrutiny==
In 2008 an independent Panel was created to review any concerns, with former Presiding Officers Lord [[David Steel]] and [[George Reid (Scottish politician)|George Reid]] appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14527259 |title=Lord Steel quits standards role over Supreme Court row |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Reid left their positions in mid-2011. Following this [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Peter Fraser]] and [[Dame Elish Angiolini]] were appointed. [[David Bell (university administrator)|David Bell]] was appointed in October 2012, then in 2013 [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], a former Director of Public Prosecutions on Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13090578.Ministerial_code_role_for_ex_prosecutor/ |title=Ministerial code role for ex-prosecutor |work=The Herald |date=2 February 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: श्री सिद्धरामेश्वर महाराज; {{lang-kn| ಶ್ರೀ ಸಿದ್ಧರಾಮೇಶ್ವರ್ ಮಹಾರಾಜ್ }}) (1888–1936) &lt;ref group=web name=NisargadattaMaharajBiography /&gt; was a guru in the [[Inchagiri Sampradaya]] founded by his guru [[Bhausaheb Maharaj|Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj]],{{sfn|Ranade|1982}} a branch of the [[Navnath Sampradaya]],&lt;ref group=web name=NisargadattaMaharajBiography /&gt; the 'Nine Masters' tradition in India.&lt;ref group=web name="nisargadatta-lineage" /&gt;{{sfn|Ranade|2003}} He was the [[Guru]] of [[Nath]] teachers [[Nisargadatta Maharaj|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]], [[Ranjit Maharaj|Sri Ranjit Maharaj]], and [[Kaadsiddheshwar|Sri Kadsiddheshwar Maharaj]].

==Biography==
Siddharameshwar was born in 1888 in the village [[Pathri]], [[Solapur]], [[India]]. Since his childhood he was very intelligent and had very sharp imbibe abilities. In 1906&lt;ref group=web name="RanjitHistory" /&gt; he was initiated by his guru 'Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj' in Inchagiri in [[Karnataka]] India, who taught mantra meditation as the way to reach Final Reality.&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt; He was one of the contemporaries of Sri [[Ramana Maharshi]].

In 1920 Siddharameshwar started to set out on [[Subitism#Neo-Vedanta|"the Bird's Path"]], the fast way to attain realization, six years after Bhauhaseb maharaj had died.&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt; His fellow-students opposed, but eventually he succeeded by himself.&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt;

Siddharameshwar died on November 9, 1936 ([[Ekadashi]], 11th day in the later half [[Ashwin]]), at the age of 48, giving his understanding to his disciples. It is said that dozens of his disciples became self-realized through his clear and lucid teaching. His samadhi shrine today is located at [[Banganga Tank|Banganga]], [[Walkeshwar]] in [[Mumbai]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Teachings==
{{Hindu philosophy}}

===Atma Vidya===
''Atma Vidya'' (Self-Knowledge") is the central theme in Siddharameshwar Maharaj's teachings. In ''Master Key to Self-Realization''{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009}} he describes how the teaching of Vedanta is transmitted to a student. It starts with the meeting with a guru, who tells about the teachings. Thereafter a [[mantra]] is being used by the student to meditate and make the mind more receptive. Then the guru explains the teaching further, which has to be realized experientially by the student.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|p=1-2}}

The student has to turn away his mind from external objects and the gross body, and "turn within".{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|p=5}} By realizing that objects have only a temporary appearance, it becomes possible to develop detachment{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|10}} and to clear one's mental attitude from pride.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|11}} This is a necessary step to develop Self-Knowledge, and the renunciation of the impermanent, and the acceptance of the permanent.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|12}}

===The koshas===
To realize this Self-Knowledge, an investigation of the four [[Kosha|bodies]] has to be made to discover whence the notion of "I" comes.{{refn|group=note|According to the [[Vedanta]] doctrine of ''[[Sarira (Vedanta)|Sarira]]'', or the "Three Bodies Doctrine", the human being is composed of three ''sariras'', or five ''[[kosha]]s'' ("bodies"):{{sfn|Jagadeesan|2008|page=13}}
* ''Sthula sarira'', the Gross body, also called the ''Annamaya Kosha''{{sfn|Jagadeesan|2008|page=13}}
*''Suksma sarira'', the [[Subtle body]], composed of:
** ''[[Prana]]maya Kosha'' (Vital breath or [[Energy]]), 
** ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manomaya]] Kosha'' ([[Mind]]) 
*''[[Vijñāna|Vijnanamaya]] Kosha'' ([[Intellect]]){{sfn|Jagadeesan|2008|page=13}} 
* ''Karana sarira'', the [[Causal body]], the ''[[Anandamaya kosha|Anandamaya Kosha]]'' ([[Happiness|Bliss]]){{sfn|Jagadeesan|2008|page=13}}}} Siddharameshwar Maharaj discerns four bodies:
# The Physical Gross Body
# The Subtle body: 
## the Five Senses of Action (hands, feet, mouth, genitals, and anus)
## the Five Senses of Knowledge (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin)
## the Five Pranas or vital breaths (vyana vayu, samana vayu, udana vayu, apana vaya, prana vayu)
## the Mind (manas)
## The Intellect ([[Buddhi]])
# The Causal Body, characterized by "emptiness", "ignorance" and "darkness"{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|Compare [[kenosis]] and Juan de la Cross' ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]''.}}
# The Great-Causal Body,{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|32}} the knowledge of "I am" that cannot be described,{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|33}} the state after Ignorance and Knowledge, or [[Turiya]] state{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|32}}

By subsequently identifying with the three lower bodies, investigating them, and discarding identification with them when it has become clear that they are not the "I", the sense of "I am" beyond knowledge and Ignorance becomes clearly established.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|34-58}}

===The Bird's way===
The teachings of Siddharameshwar have been called ''Vihangam Marg'',&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt; "the Bird's Way", the direct path to Self-discovery,&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also Ranjit Maharaj's "Illusion vs. Reality Dialogues with Shri Ranjit Maharaj on the Stateless State", dialogue of May 3, 1998. Available at [https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/advaitin/conversations/topics/20381 Siddharameshwar Maharaj's discovery of "the Bird's way"]}} in contrast to Bhausaheb Maharaj's teachings, which have been called ''Pipilika Marg '',&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt; "the Ant's way",&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt; the way of meditation:&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway" /&gt;
{{quote|Ranjit Maharaj: There are two ways to realize: the bird's way or ant's way. By meditation (or ant's way) one can realize. The word or name has so much power. The name you were given by your parents  has done so many things. Mantra is given by the master, but it is a  very long way for the understanding. By chanting or saying the  mantra you can go to the final reality.There are only two things:  one is reality, the other is illusion. One word only can wipe out  illusion.

So one thought [i.e. mantra] from the Master who has realized is sufficient to realize. It is a very lengthy way, that's the only  thing. So my Master found the shortest way, by thinking. By  unthinking you have become the smallest creature, and by thinking you  can become the greatest of the great, why not? If you don't have the  capacity to understand by thinking, the bird's way, then you can go by way of meditation. It is the long way and you have to meditate for many hours a day. People say they meditate, but most don't know how to meditate. They say that God is one and myself is another one,  that is the duality. It will never end that way.

So one word is sufficient from the Master. Words can cut words,  thoughts can cut thoughts in a fraction of a second. It can take you  beyond the words, that is yourself. In meditation you have to  eventually submerge your ego, the meditator, and the action of the  meditation, and finally yourself. It is a long way, and in this world now people have no time to do that. The world is going so fast now. So my Master found the shortest way.{{sfn|Ranjit Maharaj|1999}}{{refn|group=note|From sadguru.us: "The way of meditation is a long arduous path while the Bird's Way is a clear direct path of Self investigation, Self exploration, and using thought or concepts as an aid to understanding and Self-Realization. Sometimes this approach is also called the Reverse Path. What Reverse Path indicates is the turning around of one's attention away from objectivity to the more subjective sense of one's Beingness.{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Jinul]]'s "tracing back the radiance".{{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press | isbn =978-0-8248-1427-4}}}} With the Bird's Way, first one's mind must be made subtle. This is generally done with some initial meditation on a mantra or phrase which helps the aspirant to step beyond the mental/conceptual body, using a concept to go beyond conceptualization."&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway" /&gt;}}}}

===Usage of classical texts===
Siddharameshwar Maharaje used four books to give sermons on:&lt;ref group=web name="meeting" /&gt;
* [[Dasbodh]] of Saint Shri [[Samarth Ramdas]]
* the [[Yoga Vasistha]]
* the "Eknathi Bhagwat" of Sant [[Eknath]]
* "Sadachara" of Shri Madhvacharya

===Adhyatma Jnanachi Gurukilli - Master Key to Self-Realization===
The most well known book in India containing Siddharameshwar Maharaj's teachings is ''Adhyatma Jnanachi Gurukilli''. It was transcribed by Shri Dattatray Dharmayya Poredi, a distinguished disciple of Shri Siddharameshwar Maharajs, from Siddharameshwar's teachings as spoken in the Marathi language. It was originally published by Shri [[Ganapatrao Maharaj]] of Kannur.

Shri Ranjit Maharaj received verbal permission from Shri Ganapatrao Maharaj to have the text translated into English. Ranjit Maharaj entrusted the translation responsibilities to Dr. Mrs. Damyanti Dungaji. The completed English translation was then proofread and subsequently published by Shri Siddharameshwar Adhyatma Kendra, Mumbai under the name "Master Key to Self-Realization". When all of the copies of that original English text were sold, the text was incorporated into another book of Siddharameshwar Maharaj's talks entitled "Amrut Laya", also published by Shri Siddharameshwar Adhyatma Kendra, Mumbai). It was republished by Sadguru Publications in 2008, and also included within "Master of Self-Realization" and "Amrut Laya: The Stateless State".

===Adhyatmadnyanacha Yogeshwar - Master of Self-Realization: An Ultimate Understanding===
''Adhyatmadnyanacha Yogeshwar'' Vol I &amp; II consists of 130 talks of Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj. They were transcribed, edited and published by [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]] in 1961-1962 in Marathi language, who also wrote the preface to the book. It was translated in English and published as "Master of Self-Realization: An Ultimate Understanding".

===Amrut Laya: The Stateless State===
Volume 1 of Amrut Laya is composed of transcribed notes from 50 talks given by Siddharameshwar Maharaj on various themes from Dasbodh. Volume 2 of Amrut Laya consists of notes taken from 88 talks of Siddharameshwar Maharaj where he elaborates on various spiritual principles from three main classic texts, namely [[Dasbodh]], [[Yogavasishtha]] and [[Eknath|Eknathi Bhagawat]].

[[Image:Soulcatchertlingit.jpg|thumb|400px| A [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] soulcatcher, made by Heendei, of the Raven moiety and the Deisheetaan clan.]]

A '''Soulcatcher''' (''Haboolm  Ksinaalgat'', 'keeper of breath') is an [[amulet]] ''(Aatxasxw)'' used by the [[shaman]] (Halayt) of the Pacific Northwest Coast of [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska]]. It is believed that all soulcatchers were constructed by the [[Tsimshian]] tribe, and traded to the other tribes.

==Construction==
Soulcatchers were constructed of a tube of bear [[femur]], incised on one or both sides, and often ornamented with [[abalone]] shell.  Bears had powerful [[shaman]]ic connotations among the people of the Northwest Coast.
  
Soulcatchers were decorated with a [[sisiutl]]-like animal: a land-otter or bear head at both ends of the tube, and an [[anthropomorph]]ic face in the middle.  This form may have represented the ability to shift shapes, or the mythological land-otter [[canoe]], implying the ability to travel between the three realms: air/god realm ''(kijek)'', earth/human/animal realm ''(takijek)'', and water/spirit realm ''(tekijek)''. The land-otter was the source of all shamanic power.

A [[shaman]]'s helper spirit may have resided in the central head.

The soulcatcher was plugged at both ends with shredded [[Cedar wood|cedar]] bark, to contain the lost soul, or to hold a malevolent spirit "sucked out" of a patient.  The amulet was usually worn as a [[necklace]]. Soulcatchers ranged in length from 16&amp;nbsp;cm to 21.6&amp;nbsp;cm (6{{frac|5|8}}" to 8{{frac|1|2}}").  

There are a few examples of wood soulcatchers, and a Haida example covered with [[copper]] sheeting.

==Use==
Sickness incurable by secular (herbal) means was believed to be caused by "soul loss" through:
*Dreaming, which was thought to be the soul leaving the body and traveling to the spirit world. If the soul was unable to return to the body by morning (due to disorientation or supernatural interference), chronic illness would follow.
*Being frightened out of the body
*Being enticed out by [[witchcraft]]

To cure the patient, the [[shaman]] would wear the soulcatcher as a necklace.  He would then travel to the spirit world by calling helper spirits using [[trance]] music, employing helper-spirit masks, and magical implements such as staffs.  Shaman might also work in groups, constructing a representation of a shaman's Land-Otter canoe and "[[dantsikw]]" spirit boards (see [[sisiutl]]) as a vehicle to travel to the spirit world.  Once the errant soul was located, the shaman would "suck" the soul into the soulcatcher, and return to the patient.  The soul would then be "blown" back into the patient.  

Another use of the soulcatcher was to suck malevolent spirits out of a patient.

'''Terence Parsons''' (born 1939) is an American contemporary philosopher of the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Parsons is also a Professor at [[UCLA]] in its [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|Department of Philosophy]].

He works on the [[semantics]] of [[natural language]] to develop theories of truth and meaning for natural language similar to those devised for [[artificial language]]s by philosophical logicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurels to Linguists Archive|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/laurels-linguists-archive|website=Linguistic Society of America|accessdate=4 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by [[Alexius Meinong]], he wrote ''Nonexistent Objects'' (1980), which dealt with [[possible world]] theory in order to defend the reality of nonexistent objects.

==Biography==
Parsons was born in [[Endicott, New York]] and graduated from the [[University of Rochester]] with a BA in physics. He received his PhD from [[Stanford University]] in 1966. He was a full time faculty member at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] from 1965 to 1972, at the [[University of Massachusetts at Amherst]] from 1972 to 1979, at the [[University of California at Irvine]] from 1979 to 2000, and at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] from 2000 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articulating Medieval Logic: Author Information|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/articulating-medieval-logic-9780199688845?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolpert|first1=Stuart|title=Six UCLA faculty elected to academy|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/070508_fellows|website=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=4 March 2018|language=en|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond''''' is [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s final collection of [[detective story|detective stories]], published after his death in 1936. Of the eight mysteries, seven were first printed in the ''Storyteller'' magazine. ''The Unmentionable Man'' was unique to the book.

The stories revolve around a civil servant named Mr. Pond (we are not told his first name). He is described as a very ordinary and fish-like man who has a habit of startling those who meet him with outrageous [[paradox]]ical statements. He seems unaware of the oddness of his remarks, and his friend Sir Hubert Wotton explains: "he looks a very sedentary, scientific little cuss... but he's really had very extraordinary experiences. He doesn't talk about them; he doesn't want to talk about them... but when, in the course of talking in the abstract he comes on some concrete thing that he has actually ''done'' – well, I can only say he crumples it up. He tries to crush it into a small space and it simply sounds contradictory. Almost every one of those crazy sentences simply stands for one of the adventures in what would be called by most people a very unadventurous life."&lt;ref&gt;From "Pond the Pantaloon"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesterton himself was well known for using paradox in his writings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html ''The Eccentric Prince of Paradox'']&lt;/ref&gt; but in one story he explains that his kind of paradox is different from Mr. Pond's:
:''Paradox has been defined as "Truth standing on her head to get attention." Paradox has been defended; on the ground that so many fashionable fallacies still stand firmly on their feet, because they have no heads to stand on. But it must be admitted that writers, like other mendicants and mountebanks, frequently do try to attract attention. They set out conspicuously, in a single line in a play, or at the head or tail of a paragraph, remarks of this challenging kind; as when Mr. Bernard Shaw wrote: "The Golden Rule is that there is no Golden Rule"; or Oscar Wilde observed: "I can resist everything except temptation"; or a duller scribe (not to be named with these and now doing penance for his earlier vices in the nobler toil of celebrating the virtues of Mr. Pond) said in defence of hobbies and amateurs and general duffers like himself: "If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly." To these things do writers sink; and then the critics tell them that they "talk for effect"; and then the writers answer: "What the devil else should we talk for? Ineffectualness?"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://chesterton.org/qmeister2/doingbadly.htm From "When Doctors Agree", cited on the American Chesterton society website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In four of the stories Pond is induced to tell the dramatic tale which lies behind a baffling paradox; in another, "Pond the Pantaloon", Wotton tells the story. In two more, "The Crime of Captain Gahagan" and "The Terrible Troubadour", Pond's keen mind arrives at the truth when his friend Gahagan is accused of murder. In "Ring of Lovers" Gahagan tells a true story and trusts to Pond to guess the secret behind it.

These stories written at the end of Chesterton's career contain narrative stretches and improbabilities, but they do not lack his familiar flashes of insight. In the story ''The Crime of Captain Gahagan'' Chesterton observes, through the character of Mr. Pond, that "Love never needs time. But friendship always needs time. More and more time, until up past midnight."

==Characters==
The main characters in the book are Mr. Pond, his friend Captain Peter Gahagan, a romantic and impulsive Irishman, and a well-known government official, Sir Hubert Wotton. Also mentioned in more than one chapter are Violet Varney, an actress, and her sister Joan, to whom Gahagan proposes after being suspected of having an affair with Lord Crome's wife in "Ring of Lovers". Joan, now married to Gahagan, appears in the framing sequence of "A Tall Story".

==Stories==

===The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse===
The paradox is introduced when a casual discussion turns to matters of European politics, and Pond recalls an episode during a war between the Prussians and the Polish. The fact, insists Pond, to Wotton's dismay, is that the Prussian soldiers were ''too'' obedient. Marshal Von Grock failed in his attempt to execute the influential Polish poet and singer Paul Petrowski because two of his soldiers did precisely what he asked.
:''The whole thing went wrong because the discipline was too good. Grock's soldiers obeyed him too well; so he simply couldn't do a thing he wanted....It is a military fact that Grock failed, because two of his soldiers obeyed him. It is a military fact that he might have succeeded, if one of them had disobeyed him.''

===The Crime of Captain Gahagan===
The chapter begins with Pond being interviewed by a garrulous American journalist who cannot finish a sentence without interrupting herself. This supplies a clue to Pond when a lawyer accuses Pond's acquaintance Captain Gahagan of murdering his client, the husband of a woman Gahagan had been spending much time with. After hearing the lawyer's story of what Gahagan said when leaving the Varney house, Pond introduces the paradox: Gahagan said exactly the same thing to all three witnesses, despite their conflicting reports.

===When Doctors Agree===
The paradox, simply put, is that two doctors once agreed so thoroughly that one naturally murdered the other. In the framing sequence mention is made of an agreement between the Poles and the Lithuanians about [[Vilnius#In Poland|Wilno]], and Pond mentions [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] (who ''agreed'' to have a battle) and tells the story of a protracted argument over morality which came to an abrupt conclusion.

===Pond the Pantaloon===
Pond introduces the paradox—that the pencil was relatively red, which was why it made such black marks—but Gahagan must go to Wotton for the explanation. Wotton tells the story of how Pond saved England and was shot at five times in a railway station waiting room, all because of the "pencil" which made the "black marks".

===The Unmentionable Man===
During a discussion of deportation, Pond mentions a man who was so well-regarded that officials longed to deport him – but could not. In the capital of a European republic with an oppressive government and an active revolutionary movement, Mr Louis sits in the central square and entertains all and sundry. His identity is a well-kept secret, but Pond guesses it.

===Ring of Lovers===
This story centres on Captain Gahagan, described by Mr. Pond as "a very truthful man... [who] tells wanton and unnecessary lies". The captain tells a (true) story of a dreadful dinner party which ended in death, and explains how it induced him to propose to the woman he loves.

===The Terrible Troubadour===
The paradox, "In Nature you must go very low to find things that go so high", in this case is not Mr. Pond's, but his friend Dr. Paul Green's. Green introduces the Vicar of Hanging Burgess, who accuses Captain Gahagan of having, many years ago, shot a rival in love, dumped the body and then run away to the war. From the Vicar's eyewitness description of the incident, Pond divines the truth.

===A Tall Story===
Mr Pond, Sir Henry Wotton, Captain Gahagan and his new wife Joan are discussing the [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|treatment of Jews in Germany]], and Pond recalls an incident in the last war when a Jew who had adopted a German name was suspected of being a spy. He describes the persecution of officials by "spy-maniacs" who reported all sorts of "suspicious behaviour", while the real spies passed unnoticed—including the spy who was "too tall to be seen".

==Radio==
5 of the 8 stories (1,2,4,6,7 of the list above) were produced as 15 minute radio stories for BBC Radio 4 Extra, read by [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]]. Broadcast 13-17 May 2014.

'''''The Task: A Poem, in Six Books''''' is a poem in blank verse by [[William Cowper]] published in [[1785 in poetry|1785]], usually seen as his supreme achievement. Its six books are called "The Sofa", "The Timepiece", "The Garden", "The Winter Evening", "The Winter Morning Walk" and "The Winter Walk at Noon". Beginning with a mock-[[John Milton|Miltonic]] passage on the origins of the sofa, it develops into a discursive meditation on the blessings of nature, the retired life and religious faith, with attacks on slavery, blood sports, fashionable frivolity, lukewarm clergy and French despotism among other things. Cowper's subjects are those that occur to him naturally in the course of his reflections rather than being suggested by poetic convention, and the diction throughout is, for an 18th-century poem, unusually conversational and unartificial. As the poet himself writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
...my raptures are not conjured up
To serve occasions of poetic pomp,
But genuine...&lt;ref&gt;Book 1, lines 151-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Writing and publication==
[[File:William Cowper by Lemuel Francis Abbott.jpg|thumb|William Cowper in 1792, by [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]]]]

Cowper prefaced ''The Task'' with an account of its genesis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded a poem of that kind from the Author, and gave him the S&lt;small&gt;OFA&lt;/small&gt; for a subject. He obeyed; and, having much leisure, connected another subject with it; and, pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him, brought forth at length, instead of the trifle which he at first intended, a serious affair – a Volume.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement to ''The Task''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lady Austen, a friend of Cowper's in the early 1780s, made this suggestion in the early summer of 1783, and he took the idea up, continuing in spite of sporadic returns of the depressive illness from which he suffered so much. On its completion the following year the poem was sent to Cowper's publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], who had previously issued Cowper's ''Poems'' (1782). It was decided to add three shorter poems, ''An Epistle to Joseph Hill'', ''Tirocinium'' and ''[[The Diverting History of John Gilpin]]'', but, because of delays on Johnson’s part, the book did not appear until 1785. The venture was successful, and was soon followed by a second edition of the ''Poems'' in two volumes, ''The Task'' and its three attendants forming the second volume.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Southey]] ''The Life of William Cowper, Esq.'' (Boston: Otis, Broaders, 1839) vol. 1, pp. 268-307.&lt;/ref&gt; Further editions were called for at short intervals for the next 40 years, for ''The Task'' had so caught the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] spirit of the age that, according to one critic, "As ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' is to militant [[Puritan]]ism, so is ''The Task'' to the religious movement of its author's time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Goldwin Smith]] ''Cowper'' (London: Macmillan, 1880) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In a letter [[Robert Burns]] wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is not ''The Task'' a glorious poem? The religion of ''The Task'', bating a few scraps of Calvinistic divinity, is the religion of God and Nature: the religion that exalts, that ennobles man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He is said to have loved the poem enough to have habitually walked about with a copy in his pocket. &lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Robert Burns'' (London: James Cochrane, 1834) vol. 3, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is extensively quoted in the novels of [[Jane Austen]], and has been seen as deeply influential on her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]] ''Jane Austen: Illusion and Reality'' (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer, 1999) pp. 127-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The conversational diction of the [[Lake Poets]]' works can be seen as stemming directly from ''The Task''. Certainly the young [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] wrote of Cowper's "divine Chit chat", and in later years praised ''The Task'''s "chastity of diction" and "harmony of blank verse".&lt;ref&gt;Emerson R. Marks ''Taming the Chaos: English Poetic Diction Theory Since the Renaissance'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998) p. 367; Earl Leslie Griggs (ed.) ''The Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1956-1971) vol. 1, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1796 [[Letters of Charles Lamb|letter]] [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] testified to Coleridge's thorough relish for Cowper, and on his own account wrote of Cowper as an old favourite and of "reading the ''Task'' with fresh delight".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin W. Marrs, Jr. (ed.) ''The Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1975-78) vol. 1, p. 78; Mary Jacobus ''Tradition and Experiment in Wordsworth's "Lyrical Ballads" (1798)'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] borrowed a copy while still a schoolboy, and the poem's influence on his ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]'' and ''[[The Prelude]]'' is widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;T W Thompson (ed. Robert Woof) ''Wordsworth's Hawkshead'' (1970) p. 344; Kenneth R. Johnston ''The Hidden Wordsworth'' (London: Pimlico, 2000) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical editions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6896">A '''theoretical definition''' defines a term in an academic discipline, functioning as a proposal to see a phenomenon in a certain way. A theoretical definition is a proposed way of thinking about potentially related events.&lt;ref name="AboutTD"&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/logicalarguments/a/def_theoretical.htm About.com, Logical Arguments, "Theoretical Definitions"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConciseIntro" /&gt; Theoretical definitions contain ''built-in'' theories; they cannot be simply reduced to describing a set of observations.

[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-observation Theory and Observation in Science]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 5 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical definition of a term can change, over time, based on the methods in the field that created it.

Without a [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[operational definition]], conceptual definitions assume both knowledge and acceptance of the theories that it depends on.&lt;ref name="AboutTD" /&gt; A [[hypothetical construct]] may serve as a theoretical definition, as can a [[stipulative definitions|stipulative definition]].

==In different fields==

===Sciences===

The term [[scientific theory]] is reserved for concepts that are widely accepted. A [[scientific law]] often refers to regularities that can be expressed by a mathematical statement. However, there is no consensus about the distinction between these terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.kennesaw.edu/~rmatson/3380theory.html Scientific Laws And Theories].

In the natural sciences, a concept is an abstract conclusion drawn from observations.&lt;ref name="research methods" /&gt;

====Social and health sciences====
Social and health sciences interact with non-empirical fields and use both observation based and pre-existing concepts such as intelligence, race, and gender.

===In natural science===
The definitions of substances as various configurations of atoms are theoretical definitions, as are definitions of [[color]]s as specific [[wavelength]]s of reflected light.

====Physics====

The first [[postulate]] of [[special relativity]] theory that the [[speed of light]] in vacuum is the same to all inertial observers (i.e. it is a constant, and therefore a good measure of length). Of interest, this theoretical concept is the basis of an [[operational definition]] for the length of a [[metre]] is ''"the distance traveled by [[light]] in a [[vacuum]] during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a [[second]]"''.  Thus we have defined 'metre' according to other ideas contained in modern scientific theory. Rejection of the theory underlying a theoretical definition leaves the definition invalid for use in argument with those who reject it — neither side will advance its position by using terms the others do not accept {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Philosophy===

Differing theoretical definitions of "thinking" have caused conflict amongst [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence philosophers]], illustrated for example by the different responses to the [[Chinese room]] experiment.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Some philosophers might call "thought" merely ''"having the ability to convince another person that you can think"''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} An [[operational definition]] corresponding to this theoretical definition could be a simple conversation test (e.g. [[Turing test]]). Others believe that better theoretical and operational definitions are required.

The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

'''Unilateral gratuitous obligations''' are undertaken voluntarily and are also known as unilateral voluntary obligations or gratuitous promises. If one person promises in definite terms to do something to benefit or favour another, he may be under a legal obligation to keep his promise.

Example: promise to donate a sum of money to a [[charitable organization|charity]].
:This is unilateral.  It imposes a legal obligation on only one person (the donor) and is gratuitous because the other party (the charity) does not do anything in order to be entitled to the money.

Not a major feature of [[commerce|commercial dealings]], but they do sometimes arise in a business context. Examples: 
*Promise to keep an offer open for a certain period of time
*Promise to renegotiate the terms of a [[contract]]

In [[England]], gratuitous obligations are not generally regarded as being enforceable if verbal or executed under hand. This is because, in [[English law]], there is a [[doctrine of consideration]] which requires that both parties must be under an obligation to give something of value, before either will be legally bound to an obligation. Gratuitous obligations will only be enforced by the courts if they are constituted by [[deed]].

== Awards ==
Honorary Diploma of the committee organization of the conference "Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis in the context of Austrian and Russian cultures" (2000), Honorary Doctor Diploma of the [http://veip.oedipus.ru Eastern European Institute of Psychoanalysis] (2002), Diploma of the publishing house [[:ru:Питер (издательство)|"Piter"]] in the nomination "For variety of genres of published works and contribution to the study of psychoanalytic theory and practice in Russia” at the Moscow International Book Fair (2002).

== Criticism of Valery Leibin’s activities ==
O.E. Akimov at [http://www.humans.ru/humans/1718 www.humans.ru] had published a critical article entitled "Leibin, Freud and Russia. "Non-Russianness" of psychoanalysis". In this article the author accuses Valery Leibin of having caused enormous damage to Russia by "taking up the promotion of contentious teachings of Freud", by “doing everything for the ideology of Freudianism to become the official ideology of Russia" and by "being a brilliant propagandist; [[Hitler, Adolf|Hitler]] would have remained satisfied with his work". Akimov believes psychoanalysis harmful and dangerous, calls [[Freud, Sigmund|Sigmund Freud]] "the father of shamanism of the 20th century", a clever adventurer". One of the author's claims against Valery Leibin is that he introduced the concept of "Russianness", widely used by Russian nationalists now. Also O.E. Akimov, while calling Valery Leibin "a prominent figure in the psychoanalytic world”, "the greatest expert in the field of theory, practice and history of psychoanalysis”, "the leading psychotherapist”, accuses the latter in causing psychological trauma to his students.&lt;ref&gt;
In a comment to this article the editor of [http://www.humans.ru/humans/y1 Polozov Y.S.] 12/24/2005 reports that the article O.E. Akimov, along with some other of his materials, was transferred from the rubric "Psychology" to "Trial subject" because "public denunciation might be interesting, but it differs from the constructive and discussible style, which the portal [http://www.humans.ru www.humans.ru] adheres to.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13373">'''Visual space''' is the [[perception|perceptual]] space housing the [[visual perception|visual]] world being experienced by an aware [[observation|observer]]; it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes.

==Spaces of objects and of visual percepts==

===Space of physical objects===

In ''' object space''' the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry. For practical purposes it is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. It is three-dimensional and various co-ordinate systems like the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] x,y,z (with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes), or [[Bipolar coordinates|bipolar]] with angles of elevation, azimuth and binocular parallax (based on the separation of the two eyes) are interchangeable. No elaborate mathematics are needed.

===Space of visual percepts===

'''Percepts''', the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space, constitute an ordered ensemble or, as [[Ernst Cassirer]] explained,&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, E. (1944). The concept of group and the theory of perception. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 5 (1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations. This visual space can be accessed by introspection, by interrogation, or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed, even quantitatively.

An example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space:
Two straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel. When this has been done, the lines ''are'' parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines' setting in object space. Good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals. The reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read-out as readily: show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception.

Considering how it arises (see below), visual space seems, as an immediate, unmediated experience, to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects.

===Visual space and visual field===

The distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call ''visual field'', the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina, and the virtual, perceptual ''visual space'' in which visual percepts are located, the subject of this entry.
Confusion is caused by the use of ''[[:de:Geschichte der Theorie des Sehens|Sehraum]]'' in the German literature for both. There is no doubt that [[Ewald Hering]] and his followers &lt;ref&gt;Tschermak, A. (1947). ''Einführung in die Physiologische Optik''. Wien: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; meant visual space in their disquisitions.

===Spaces: formal, physical, perceptual&lt;!--Linked from 'Rudolf Carnap'--&gt;===
{{See also|Conceptual space}}
The fundamental distinction was made by [[Rudolf Carnap]] between three kinds of space which he called ''formal'', ''physical'' and ''perceptual.''&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1922). Der Raum. In: ''Kantstudien Ergänzungsheft'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, for example, deal with ordered structures, ensembles of elements for which rules of logico-deductive relationships hold, limited solely by being not self-contradictory. These are the ''formal'' spaces. According to Carnap, studying ''physical'' space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects. Finally, there is the realm of what students of Kant know as ''[[:de:Anschauung|Anschauungen]],'' immediate sensory experiences, often awkwardly translated as "[[apperception]]s," which belong to ''perceptual spaces.''

==Visual space and geometry==
Geometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other. For example, in Euclidean space there is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for distances. In a two-dimensional space of constant curvature, like the surface of a sphere, the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere. On the two-dimensional surface of a football, the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location. In well-behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called ''[[Metric (mathematics)|Metrics]],'' are classically handled by the mathematics invented by [[Riemann]]. Object space belongs to that class.

To the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes, visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations. The first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1906) ''Space and Geometry''. Open Court Publishing: Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901. Under the heading ''On Physiological as Distinguished from Geometrical Space'' Mach states that "Both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses" but the former is "...neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike, nor infinite in extent, nor unbounded." A notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in 1947 by the highly talented mathematician [[Rudolf Luneburg]], who preceded his essay &lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947). ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by a profound analysis of the underlying principles. When features are sufficiently singular and distinct, there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item ''A'' in object space and its correlate ''A' '' in visual space. Questions can be asked and answered such as "If visual percepts ''A',B',C' '' are correlates of physical objects ''A,B,C,'' and if ''C'' lies between ''A'' and ''B'', does ''C' '' lie between ''A' '' and ''B' ''?" In this manner, the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached. If the exercise is successful, a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space.

On the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations, Luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature, meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape. One of Luneburg's major arguments is that, in accord with a common observation, the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome (the sky). The Luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments, which on the whole did not favor it.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 ''Geometry and Spatial Vision''. (2006) In M.R.M. Jenkin and L.R. Harris (Eds) ''Seeing Spatial Form''. Oxford U. Press. pp 35-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic to the problem, and underestimated by Luneburg the mathematician, is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space. Any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it, and the precision, repeatability and generality of measurements. Insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space &lt;ref&gt;Foley, J.M. (1964). Desarguesian property in visual space. ''Journal of the Optical Society of America'', 54 (5), 684-692.&lt;/ref&gt; but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity. If the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of, say, apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer, or from day to day, or from context to context, so does the geometrical nature of, and hence mathematical formulation for, visual space.

All these arguments notwithstanding, there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. [[visual space agnosia]] is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called [[geometrical-optical illusions]], are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.

==Neural representation of space==

===Fechner's ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics ===

Its founder, [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] defined the mission of the discipline of [[psychophysics]] as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds—in this particular case, the visual and object spaces—but he acknowledged an intermediate step, which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience. In distinguishing between ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics, Fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems. Hence, without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept, the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space.

===Retinotopy and beyond===

Two major concepts dating back to the middle of the 19th century set the parameters of the discussion here. [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]] emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes, and Hermann [[Lotze]], from psychological considerations, enunciated the principle of local sign. Put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there. The orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain, and provides what is aptly called a "[[Retinotopy|retinotopic"]] mapping in the primary visual cortex. Thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space. Unfortunately, as is so common in brain studies, simplicity and transparency ends here. Right at the outset, visual signals are analyzed not only for their position, but also, separately in parallel channels, for many other attributes such as brightness, color, orientation, depth. No single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location. The unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience, demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research.

===Place cells===

Though the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque, a startling finding gives hope for future insights. Neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called [[hippocampus]] that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Space and its content==
Only on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent, This major proposition of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] is of no concern in vision. For us, distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects.

But this is not so simple in visual space. At a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field, a simplistic extension from object space that enabled Luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space. In a more richly textured visual world, the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition. Identical separations in physical space can look quite different (''are quite different'' in visual space) depending on the features that demarcate them. This is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects.

Even in monocular vision, which physiologically has only two dimensions, cues of size, perspective, relative motion etc. are used to [[Monocular depth cues|assign depth differences to percepts]]. Looked at as a mathematical/geometrical problem, expanding a 2-dimensional object manifold into a 3-dimensional visual world is "ill-posed," i.e., not capable of a rational solution, but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer.

The problem becomes less ill-posed when [[binocular vision]] allows actual determination of relative depth by [[stereoscopy]], but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain (see: [[stereoscopic depth rendition]]). Hence, the uncomplicated three-dimensional visual space of every-day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects.

Believers maintain that it is possible for the original soul of a human to leave a person's body and for another soul to "walk in".  Souls are said to "walk-in" during a period of intense personal problems on the part of the departing soul, or during or because of an accident or trauma. The individual retains the memories of the original personality, but their personality and abilities change and become oriented towards helping humanity. Incarnating into a fully grown body allows the more advanced soul to carry out its mission without having to go through the two decades of maturation that humans need to reach adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Partridge|Partridge, Christopher]].

==In popular culture==
The film ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' and the 1978 remake ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' portrays one soul replacing a recently deceased man's soul and reviving and inhabiting his body. 

The ''[[Hawkgirl]]'' comics, the ''[[K-PAX]]'' series of books and film, and the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank]]" have all featured situations similar or identical to walk-in experiences, although the term "walk-in" is not used.

In the ''[[Death of Superman]]'' story cycle, a handful of new superheroes appeared, among them [[John Henry Irons]], who called himself the "Man of Steel". He never claimed to be the real Superman, but [[Lois Lane]] speculated that if Superman were really dead, perhaps his soul had moved into Irons' body as a walk-in, and she used that word.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2miDHzlltK4C&amp;q=%22have+you+ever+heard+of+a+walk-in+spirit?%22&amp;dq=%22have+you+ever+heard+of+a+walk-in+spirit?%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL1JmC5bvPAhUNx2MKHUEuCQIQ6AEIHjAA ''The Death and Life of Superman''] (novelization of the ''[[Death of Superman]]'' storyline). Random House Publishing Group, 1994. p. 365. "I knew all along that Superman would return, and now he has. Not necessarily in the form people might have expected, but it was him. Listen, have you ever heard of a walk-in spirit? When a body has been  abandoned by one spirit but is not yet uninhabitable, then another spirit can move in. Anyway, whatever he is, the cards tell me for sure that the man who saved me today is definitely the Man of Steel. For sure."&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Red Museum]]" discusses walk-ins, described by Mulder as enlightened spirits who have taken possession of the bodies of people who have lost hope and who want to leave their life. The concept is returned to in the episode "[[Closure (The X-Files)|Closure]]". 

In the TV series ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', the season 4 episode "[[Ghost_Whisperer_(season_4)#Episodes|Threshold]]" used the term "step-in" when the soul of one of the series' main characters, who had died in the previous episode, enters the body of a man who dies in an unrelated accident.

[[Stephen King]] speaks of "walk-ins" several times in books 6 and 7 of ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' novels, but King's walk-ins are usually physical travellers, or - when they possess another's body - are more guests, sharing the body with the original mind as strangers. John Callum mentions them in ''[[The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah]]''. The term is also used in the CODA section of this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3436">{{for|the LDS (Mormon) doctrine|Word of Wisdom}}
In [[Christianity]], the '''word of wisdom''' is a [[spiritual gift]] listed in [[1 Corinthians]] 12:8. The function that this gift is given varies. Some Christians see in this gift a prophetic-like function. Others see in the word of wisdom a teaching function. This gift is closely related with the gift of the [[word of knowledge]].

==Description==
Commentators have often placed this gift within the larger context of the biblical wisdom tradition, especially references to God’s secret wisdom in 1 Corinthians 2:6-10 and elsewhere in the letter. The secret wisdom pertains to the [[Gospel]] that [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] preached. This wisdom relates to that which God had previously hidden and destined for the glory of believers. It is a wisdom that speaks of those things that God has prepared for those who love him. These emphases from the broader context of the Corinthian letter could imply that the word of wisdom involves insight into God's plan of salvation and the proclamation of Christ crucified.&lt;ref name=GeeGifts35&gt;Gee, Donald. ''Concerning Spiritual Gifts''. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House. {{ISBN|0-88243-486-1}}. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCWisdom/&gt;&lt;ref name=CathEncycharismata&gt;Wilhelm, Joseph. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03588e.htm "Charismata"]. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Accessed 23 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have noted both a prophetic and a teaching character to the word of wisdom. Among Pentecostals and charismatics, the gift is often defined as a revelation of the Holy Spirit that applies scriptural wisdom to a specific situation that a Christian community faces.&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCWisdom&gt;''The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements'', s.v. "Wisdom, Word of".&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pentecostal theologian [[Donald Gee]], "One is deeply conscious that the supremely right thing has been said and the true course of action indicated. No further appeal is desired because the heart rests in a calm satisfaction that the will of God has been revealed".&lt;ref name=GeeGifts37&gt;Gee, ''Concerning Spiritual Gifts'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some commentators translate the term as "teaching of wisdom" and prefer to focus on the gift's function in teaching the truths of scripture.&lt;ref name=NIDPCMCWisdom/&gt; ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' defines it as "the grace of propounding the Faith effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of Christianity".&lt;ref name=CathEncycharismata/&gt; Donald Gee writes:

{{quote|there ofttimes comes shining forth a revelation in words that make our hearts burn within us. Many of us have experienced the holy awe and the thrilling exaltation of spirit that accompanies a ministry of the spiritual gift of the word of wisdom on these lines. We have recognized once again 'not the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.' And with the recognition has come a deep thankfulness that these glorious ministrations of the Spirit are still active in the church.&lt;ref name=GeeGifts35-36&gt;Gee, ''Concerning Spiritual Gifts'', pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It may comprise a short meeting, without liturgical service, headed by a [[Buddhist monasticism|monastic]], or by a group of practitioners without the presence of a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zazenkai|url=http://diamondsangha.org/training/zazenkai/|publisher=[[Diamond Sangha]]|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reader|first=Ian|title=Religion in Contemporary Japan|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|year=1991|page=103|ISBN=9780824813543}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes used to refer to a meeting of lay practitioners &lt;ref&gt;Jørn Borup "Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism: Myōshinji, a living religion" (Brill NV: Leiden, The Netherlands), 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who practice together regularly without a resident teacher. It can also denote a period of zazen in a temple schedule.

The meeting itself is punctuated and guided through the use of bells – usually the kinhin bell and the wooden clapper known as a ''taku''. Zazenkai may include a short period of rest or [[kinhin]] (walking meditation). A tea ceremony may also follow. 

At some Zen centers or temples, zazenkai may be followed by social activities or a dharma talk.
