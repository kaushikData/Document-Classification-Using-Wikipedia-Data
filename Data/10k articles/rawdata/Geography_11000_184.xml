The '''A499 road''' is the major road of the [[Llŷn peninsula]] in [[North Wales]].

Its northern terminus is a roundabout with the [[A487 road|A487 trunk road]] between [[Llanwnda, Gwynedd|Llanwnda]] and [[Llandwrog]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.0948|-4.2824|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A499 road (northern end)}}).}} It then runs south-westerly along the northern coast of the peninsula, through [[Clynnog Fawr]] then turns inland crossing the peninsula to meet the southern coast at [[Pwllheli]], it then follows that southern coast to terminate at [[Abersoch]] {{nowrap|({{coord|52.8227|-4.5054|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A499 road (southern end)}}).}}

The total length is 23.4 miles. At no point is it a trunk road, although the Welsh Assembly has considered upgrading its status.&lt;ref name=trunk-gc&gt;[http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/ADNPwyllgorau/2007/Bwrdd%20y%20Cyngor/2007-03-13/english/07_01_Review%20of%20Trunk%20Roads.pdf Gwynedd Council response to the Welsh Assembly Government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623155411/http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/ADNPwyllgorau/2007/Bwrdd%20y%20Cyngor/2007-03-13/english/07_01_Review%20of%20Trunk%20Roads.pdf |date=23 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trunk-wa&gt;[http://new.wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/enterprisepress/einpress2003/713470/?lang=en Welsh Assembly Government: Long-term review of strategic road network]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvements ==

Work started in February 2008 to upgrade the road between [[Aberdesach]] and [[Llanaelhaearn]] and also bypass [[Clynnog Fawr]]. This work is expected to complete in Summer 2009.&lt;ref name=gc-pr&gt;[http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/gwy_doc.asp?cat=5653&amp;doc=19983 Gwynedd Council Press Release Nov 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126084208/http://www.gwynedd.gov.uk/gwy_doc.asp?cat=5653&amp;doc=19983 |date=26 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous work in 2006/2007 had cleared the new route of trees and erected boundary fencing.

'''Agricultural geography''' is a subdiscipline of [[human geography]] concerned with the spatial relationships found between agriculture and humans. 

== Focus ==
It is traditionally considered the branch of [[economic geography]] that investigates those parts of the [[Earth's surface]] that are transformed by humans through [[primary sector]] activities for consumption. It thus focuses on the different types of structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the cultural, political, and environmental processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,&lt;ref&gt;Laingen, C. &amp; L. Butler Harrington (2013): Agricultural Geography. ''Oxford Bibliographies''. [[Oxford University Press]]. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006 DOI 10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006]&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction can be made between [[nomothetic]] (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and [[idiographic]] research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within [[regional geography]].

'''Professor Sir Alan Geoffrey Wilson''' {{postnom|country=GBR|FRS|FBA}} [[FAcSS]] (born 8 January 1939) is a British mathematician and social scientist, former [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Leeds]] and a professor at [[University College London]].&lt;ref name=UCLCASA&gt;[http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/people/person.asp?ID=44 UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis] accessed 19 Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in [[Bradford]] on 8 January 1939,&lt;ref name=Debretts&gt;[http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/w/6482/Alan%20Geoffrey%20WILSON.aspx Debrett's] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815030633/http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/w/6482/Alan%20Geoffrey%20WILSON.aspx |date=15 August 2012 }} Prof Sir Alan Wilson, FBA, FRS&lt;/ref&gt; and educated at [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College|Queen Elizabeth Grammar School]], Darlington and the [[University of Cambridge]] where he was an undergraduate student of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] and studied the [[Mathematical Tripos]].{{fact|date=July 2016}}{{when|date=July 2016}} 
==Career and research==
Wilson converted in the 1960s from theoretical [[physics]] to the social sciences through research on the mathematical modelling of cities (working in Oxford and London). From 1961 to 1964, he was a Scientific Officer in the Theoretical Physics Group at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory|Rutherford Laboratory]]; from 1964 to 1966, a Research Officer at the Institute of Economics and Statistics in the [[University of Oxford]]; from 1966 to 1968, Head of the Mathematical Advisory Group, Ministry of Transport; and from 1968 to 1970, Assistant Director of the [[Centre for Environmental Studies]] in London. He was appointed Professor of Urban and Regional Geography at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1970, Pro-Vice-Chancellor in 1989 and was Vice Chancellor from 1991. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1994, and was [[British honours system#Knighthood|knighted]] in 2001.

Sir Alan retired in May 2004 after 13 years as Vice-Chancellor. During his time the University underwent unprecedented growth and transformation. Student numbers increased from 12,000 to 31,500, turnover increased from £100m to £320m and research income increased by more than 400% to £71m.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

His knowledge of the university sector led to his appointment as first Director General for Higher Education by the UK Government, a post which he took up part-time in February 2004 and full-time on 1 June 2004. In this role, he was a key adviser to secretaries of state [[Charles Clarke]], [[Ruth Kelly]] and  [[Alan Johnson]], and played a critical role in the government’s drive to [[widening participation|widen participation]] in [[higher education]] and maintaining a world-class education system. 

In May 2006 he was appointed Master of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/oldmembers/news.php?newid=100 |title=New Master announced for College |publisher=Corpus Christi College, Cambridge |accessdate=24 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019230753/http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/oldmembers/news.php?newid=100 |archivedate=19 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and took up the post in October. He resigned from the post of Master of Corpus Christi on 1 May 2007, after only seven months in post.{{fact|date=July 2016}}  

In September, 2007, he joined [[University College London]] to serve as Professor of Urban and Regional Systems at the [[Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''American Cordillera''' is a chain of [[mountain range]]s ([[cordillera]]s) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of [[mountain range]]s that form the western "backbone" of [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Geology Notes - The Breakup of Pangea and Deformation in the Western Cordillera|url=http://myweb.cwpost.liu.edu/vdivener/notes/west_cord.htm|website=Long Island University, C.W. Post Campus faculty website|accessdate=June 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001124708/http://myweb.cwpost.liu.edu/vdivener/notes/west_cord.htm|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the backbone of the [[volcanic arc]] that forms the eastern half of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

From north to south, this sequence of overlapping and parallel ranges begins with the [[Alaska Range]] and the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]] and runs through the [[Yukon]] into [[British Columbia]]. The main belt of the [[Rocky Mountains]] along with the parallel [[Columbia Mountains]] and [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and [[Vancouver Island]]. In the [[United States]], the Cordillera branches include the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], the [[Sierra Nevadas (US)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], and various small [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Pacific coastal ranges]]. In [[Mexico]], the Cordillera continues through the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], as well as the backbone mountains of the [[Baja California peninsula]].

The ranges of the Cordillera from Mexico northwards are collectively called the [[North American Cordillera]] or [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western Cordillera]] in the United States and Canada, and also named as the [[Canadian Cordillera]] or Pacific Cordillera in Canada.

The Cordillera continues on through the mountain ranges of [[Central America]] in [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Panama]], and becomes the [[Andes Mountains]] of [[South America]]. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of [[Chile]] continue through [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] to the very tip of South America at [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The Cordillera continues along the [[Scotia Arc]] before reaching the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of//1998/of98-140/|title=The North American Cordillera:  A Color Shaded-Relief Map in Oblique Mercator Projection About the Pacific-North America Pole of Rotation, Scale Circa 1:5,000,000|website=pubs.usgs.gov|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Assimitron''' was a Japanese device uses to measure fluctuating CO2 levels at crop canopies. Led by E. Inoue at the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences in [[Tsukuba]], [[Japan]], the device itself was an offshoot of an earlier Australian invention, the Evapotron that first found mention in a 1958 article in the journal ''Nature.'' The Evaporimeter, as it was first called, was used to measure the evaporations from natural surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Taylor &amp; A.J. Dyer, An Instrument for Measuring Evaporation from Natural Surfaces, Nature 181 (Feb 8, 1958): 408-409.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Assimitron, it “instantaneously” performed “the necessary calculations for determining water vapour flux by correlation of humidity fluctuations with vertical wind fluctuations.”.&lt;ref&gt;E. Inoue, Z. Uchijima, T. Saito, S. Isobe, and K. Uemura, ‘The “Assimitron”, a Newly Devised Instrument for Measuring CO2 flux in the Surface Air Layer,’ Journal of Agricultural Meteorology, Tokyo 25 (1969): 165-171, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Such calculations required the use of a complex centralized computer to process the enormous quantities of data. Part of this stemmed from the need to perform two different equations to deal with turbulent and low flows, depending on whether it was a windy or sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Uchijima, “Carbon dioxide environment and flux within a corn crop canopy,” in Prediction and Measurement of Photosynthetic Productivity (Wageningen: Centre for Agricultural Publishing and Documentation, 1970): 179-196, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bashi Channel''' is a [[waterway]] between [[Y'Ami Island]] of the [[Philippines]] and [[Orchid Island]] of [[Taiwan]]. It is a part of the [[Luzon Strait]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is characterized by windy storms during the rainy period, June to December.

The Bashi Channel is an important passage for military operations. Both Taiwan and the Philippines dispute the ownership of the waters because both sides say the region lies within 200-nautical-mile from their shores. The channel is also significant to communication networks. Many of the [[undersea cable]]s that carry data and telephone traffic between Asian countries pass through the Bashi Channel, making it a major potential point of failure for the [[Internet]]. In December 2006, a magnitude 6.7 [[submarine earthquake]] cut several undersea cables at the same time, causing a significant communications bottleneck that lasted several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthquakes Disrupt Internet Access in Asia; A Series of Powerful Earthquakes Damages Undersea Cables and Interrupts Internet Connections in Asia|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,128337-c,industrynews/article.html|website=PC World|date=December 27, 2006|last=Lemon|first=Sumner|accessdate=December 27, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103225353/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id%2C128337-c%2Cindustrynews/article.html|archivedate=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PINR report, [http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=602&amp;language_id=1 Taiwan Quake Exposes Internet Vulnerability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204093416/http://www.pinr.com/report.php?ac=view_report&amp;report_id=602&amp;language_id=1 |date=February 4, 2007 }}, published 15 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

About 13.0% of families and 19.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 28.2% of those under age 18 and 10.9% of those age 65 or over.

==History==
The European-American history of Bluefield began in the 18th century, when two families settled in a rugged and remote part of what is now southern West Virginia. Others joined them and they built a small village with a mill, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, and a fort for defending the settlement against invasions by the [[Shawnee]] Indian tribe, which had a village on the banks of the [[Bluestone River]].

In 1882, the descendants of the Davidson and Bailey family sold a portion of their land, when Captain John Fields of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] pioneered the area and began building a new railroad through the hills of Bluefield. The city is traditionally thought to be named after the [[chicory]] flowers in the area, which give the fields a purplish blue hue during the summer. Research has shown that this settlement, also known as Higginbotham's Summit in the 1880s, was probably named for the coal fields that were developed in the area of the Bluestone River.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Coal rush===
Beneath the land of the Davidsons and Baileys lay the largest and richest deposit of [[bituminous coal]] in the world. The first seam was discovered in nearby [[Pocahontas, Virginia]] in the backyard of Jordan Nelson. President [[Frederick J. Kimball|Frederick Kimball]] of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] described this as the "most spectacular find on the continent and indeed perhaps of the entire planet."{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The coal seam had been mentioned much earlier in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'', but it was not mined until 1890.

Around that time, coal mines were developed in the area around Harman, Bluefield, War, and Pocahontas, which together were known as the Pocahontas Coal Fields. They helped support the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United States. The development of the coal industry in this area created a boom in the local and national economy, and attracted immigrant European workers and migrant African Americans from the Deep South to the mountains in search of industrial work. During the Great War and World War II, coal from this area supplied the navies of the United States and United Kingdom.

In the late 19th century, the Norfolk and Western Company selected Bluefield as the site for its headquarters and repair center, which greatly stimulated the town's growth. In the one-year period from 1887 to 1888, passenger travel along the railroad increased 317%. As with the extremely accelerated growth of [[San Francisco]] during the [[gold rush]], Bluefield became a city that seemed to spring up "overnight." Growth far outpaced the existing infrastructure. [[Urban sprawl]] and [[Urban decay|blight]] were common complaints in the early days, as workers crowded into aging housing.

The growth and decay of the city depended almost entirely upon Norfolk and Western Railroad. When coal tonnage was good and the market for coal was booming, Bluefield was essentially a "Little New York," as it was called in the day. A bustling metropolis, it had a nightlife and a personality that was "a little bit Chicago, a little bit New York, and a whole lot of Pittsburgh"{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}—rugged and with steel and coal embedded in its soul.

The coal boom generated a flood of money in the area. Nearby [[Bramwell, West Virginia|Bramwell]], incorporated in 1888, boasted that it was the "Millionaires' Town" because more millionaires per capita lived there than anywhere in the nation. The city also had more automobiles per capita than any other city in the country.

In 1889, the city of Bluefield was officially incorporated. The city government was always known in those days as being corrupt, inefficient, with drunken brawls and fights breaking out on the floor of City Hall on an almost daily basis.

With a strong ethnic community, Bluefield was the site of the 1895 founding of the Bluefield Colored Institute, an [[historically black college]]. It developed as today's [[Bluefield State College]].&lt;!-- Delete inaccurate content about its being the first primarily black college; numerous colleges were founded after the Civil War in the South that were historically black, including Howard, Hampton, Fisk, etc. --&gt;

===20th century===
During the 1920s, the twelve-story West Virginian Hotel was built. It has been adapted and in the 21st century is operated as the West Virginia Manor and Retirement Home. In 1924, nearby Graham, Virginia decided to rename itself as [[Bluefield, Virginia|Bluefield]] to try to unite the two towns, which had been feuding since the civil war. Nobel Prize–winning economist and mathematician [[John Forbes Nash]] was born in Bluefield in 1928.

The [[Great Depression]] was particularly damaging to Bluefield. With the government nearly bankrupt, after a series of devastating structural fires swept through the downtown area, the city was nearly destroyed. It was not until the outbreak of World War II that coal production revived.

The strategic importance of the city was so great that [[Adolf Hitler]] put Bluefield on his reputed list of German air raid targets in the United States. Air raid practice drills were common in the city during this time.

[[Thomas Edd Mayfield]], one of the Mayfield Brothers [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] musicians of [[West Texas]], died of [[leukemia]] in a Bluefield hospital in 1958 at the age of thirty-two. He was on tour here with [[Bill Monroe]] and the Bluegrass Boys.

The [[Interstate Highway System]] was constructed through [[East River Mountain Tunnel|East River Mountain]] on December 20, 1974; for the first time automobile traffic could reach the city without crossing the top of the mountain. The dependence on the railroads waned and restructuring changed the industry. Bluefield lost jobs and population as a result. Its [[Amtrak]] station closed in the 1980s. [[Mercer Mall]], the area's major shopping mall, opened in 1980.

Bluefield is a mountain city with a [[humid subtropical climate]] ('''Cfa''') bordering on [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ('''Dfa/Dfb''') or highland climate, due to its elevation. It is characterized by moderately cold, snowy winters and pleasantly warm to hot summers. The hottest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|97|°F|°C|abbr=on}} with the coldest temperature at −21&amp;nbsp;°F.

==Culture==
Bluefield prides itself on its hospitable climate. Since 1938 the Chamber of Commerce has given free [[lemonade]] when the temperature has surpassed 90&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityofbluefield.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=178&amp;Itemid=272&lt;/ref&gt; The city's motto is "nature's air conditioned city, where the summer spends the winter."

Jazz musician [[Louis Jordan]]'s song "Salt Pork, W.Va." was inspired by his time in a Bluefield jail.

The song "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]" was co-written by [[Maceo Pinkard]], a native of Bluefield.

A controversy exists over whether or not [[Hank Williams]] was last seen alive in Bluefield on his way to a show in Ohio. He was discovered dead in [[Oak Hill, West Virginia]].

Bluefield is mentioned in [[the Stylistics]]' 1973 song ''[[Rockin' Roll Baby]]'' as the birthplace of Li'l Joe.

Bluefield was the hometown of fictional character [[Rita Stapleton|Rita Stapleton Bauer]] on the CBS soap ''[[Guiding Light]]''.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Rail====
The last passenger train was the [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]] to Washington and Boston ''[[Hilltopper (train)|Hilltopper]]'' train of [[Amtrak]], which was terminated in sweeping cuts in 1979. Until 1977 Amtrak's ''[[Mountaineer (train)|Mountaineer]]'' operated from Chicago and Cincinnatil, through Bluefield, and then through lower Virginia to [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Into the 1960s the [[Norfolk and Western Railroad]] operated trains from the Mid-West to the metropolitan Norfolk-Newport News, Virginia area, and Bluefield City was a stop.

====Road====
[[U.S. Route 19]], [[U.S. Route 21]] and [[U.S. Route 52]] run through the city. [[Interstate 77]] is a short distance to the east.

==Sports==
Bluefield was the home of the [[Appalachian League]] (rookie) [[Bluefield Blue Jays|Bluefield Orioles]] baseball team until 2010.  The Orioles have had a team in Bluefield since 1958, which was the longest relationship between a parent club and a town in affiliated baseball.&lt;ref name="bdt28Aug2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Orioles leaving Bluefield|url=http://bdtonline.com/local/x329608842/AFTERNOON-UPDATE-Orioles-leaving-Bluefield|accessdate=August 29, 2010|newspaper=Bluefield Daily Telegraph|date=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsunblog"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Orioles out of Bluefield|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/2010/08/orioles_out_of_bluefield.html|work=Orioles Insider: Baltimore Sun|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toronto Blue Jays replaced Baltimore for the 2011 season with the [[Bluefield Blue Jays]]. The team plays at [[Bowen Field]] (former Orioles stadium) and several renovations have been made to the ball park.

Bluefield High School has 522 state championships in all sports, which is more than any other AA school in the state. Also Bluefield ranks third in total football state championships with ten. They trail now closed Ceredo-Kenova High School (12) and national powerhouse [[Parkersburg High School]] (11).

Bluefield is largely a football town and the rivalry between the Bluefield Beavers and their sister city [[Bluefield, Virginia]]'s Graham G-Men always draws a large crowd at [[Mitchell Stadium]]. 2005 saw the introduction of the Bluefield Barons, an Alliance Football League team.

Bluefield is also home to the East River Soccer Complex which has five fields and hosts local high school and [[college soccer]] games. The [[Southern West Virginia King's Warriors]] of the [[USL Premier Development League|USL PDL]] play their home games at the [[East River Soccer Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=King's Warriors Make Move To Bluefield|url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/786408.html|work=United Soccer Leagues (USL)|date=February 8, 2014|accessdate=February 8, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223001610/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/786408.html|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluefield is also the home of the Rough and Rowdy Brawl, an amateur boxing tournament owned by [[barstool sports]] and broadcast on pay per view via its website. The tournament features many local and non-local fighters who compete in 3 one minute rounds.

== Notable people ==
* The famous mathematician [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.]] was born in Bluefield on June 13, 1928. His life became the basis for Sylvia Nasar's biography, ''[[A Beautiful Mind (book)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', as well as a film of the same name starring [[Russell Crowe]].
* Newspaper publisher [[John S. Knight]] was born in Bluefield.
* The horror punk band, [[Blitzkid]] began in Bluefield, WV in the winter of 1997.
* Intellectual, professor, and solidarity activist [[Steven Salaita]] is from Bluefield, WV.

:''"Brick clamp" also refers to a device (usually powered) to lift quantities of bricks.''

A '''brick clamp''' is a traditional method of [[Brick#Methods of manufacture|baking bricks]], done by stacking the unbaked bricks with [[fuel]] under or among them and then setting the fuel on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Sowden, A. M. ''The Maintenance of brick and stone masonry structures''. London: E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 1990. 18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The clamp is considered a type of [[kiln]].  If the clamp is [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] by packing [[soil|earth]] or [[mud]] around it, it becomes a '''scove kiln'''.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William Dwight.

'''CALIPSO''' is a joint [[NASA]] (USA) and [[CNES]] (France) environmental satellite, built in the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], which was launched atop a [[Delta II]] rocket on April 28, 2006.  Its name stands for '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations'''.

Passive and active remote sensing Instruments on board the CALIPSO satellite monitor aerosols and clouds 24 hours a day. CALIPSO is part of the "[[A-train (satellite)|A Train]]", flying in formation with several other satellites ([[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]], [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] and [[CloudSat]]).

==Mission==
Three instruments:
* '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)''' - a [[lidar]] that provides high-resolution vertical profiles of [[aerosol]]s and [[cloud]]s.
* '''Wide Field Camera (WFC)''' - a modified version of the commercial off-the-shelf [[Ball Aerospace]] [http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=104 CT-633] [[star tracker camera]]. It was selected to match band 1 of the [[MODIS]] instrument on the Aqua satellite.
* '''Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR)''' - used to detect [[cirrus cloud]] emissivity and particle size. The CALIOP laser beam is aligned with the center of the IIR image to optimize joint CALIOP/IIR observations.

In February 2009, CALIPSO switched over to the redundant laser as scheduled. The primary laser achieved its mission goal of three years of successful operation, and the redundant laser has been performing beyond expectations.

The CALIPSO mission was granted extended mission status in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |title=CALIPSO - INSTRUMENT UPDATE |publisher=NASA LARC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316180550/http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian canoe routes (early):''' This article covers the water routes used by [[History of Canada|early explorers of Canada]] with special emphasis on [[North American fur trade|the fur trade]].

==Introduction==

===Canada and Siberia===
Both Canada and Siberia were explored by Europeans mainly by river. Both regions have many navigable rivers with short portages between them. There are no serious barriers to water-borne travel east of the Rockies or from the Urals almost to the Pacific. The fur trade drove and financed both expansions (mostly beaver furs in Canada, sable and many others in Siberia). In both areas incomers obtained furs from the natives and exported them to Europe. In Siberia a band of armed Cossacks would enter a native village and demand [[yasak]] or tribute. In Canada furs were obtained by honest trade.

Russian expansion into Siberia began with the [[conquest of the Khanate of Sibir]] in 1582. In 1639 they reached the Pacific near [[Okhotsk]]. European settlement of Canada began in 1605 and 1608 ([[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port Royal, Nova Scotia]] and [[Quebec City]]). Canada-based Europeans reached the Arctic Ocean in 1789 and the Pacific in 1793, both expeditions led by [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]]).  For details of Siberian travel see [[Siberian River Routes]].

===Gateways to the continent===
[[Image:NorthAmerica-WaterDivides.png|thumb|right|Major river basins in North America]]
An explorer naturally wishes to travel as far as possible by water. Hudson Bay gets one more than a third of the way across the continent, but it leads to unproductive country and is blocked by ice for most of the year. The Mississippi River is a natural entry point, but it only began to be used in 1718 with the foundation of [[New Orleans]]. Early sea ships could follow the [[Hudson River]] as far as Albany, but this leads north to the Saint Laurence and westward travel was blocked by the [[Iroquois]] league. The Chesapeake and Delaware Bays lead a short way inland and the other east coast rivers are too short or shallow to be of much use. This leaves the [[St. Lawrence River]].

===Two Ages of Trade and Exploration===
''French Era:'' In the sixteenth century, cod fishermen began trading for furs, especially at [[Tadoussac]] on the St. Lawrence River. With the foundation of Quebec in 1608, [[Coureurs des bois]] spread out through the many rivers and lakes to trade with the Indians, while Indians would carry canoe-loads of fur down to Montreal. Nearby tribes became middlemen, drawing furs from further inland. Montreal was the main base where furs were stored before transshipment to Europe. By the end of the period, trade and exploration had spread to all the Great Lakes and was extending down the Mississippi. Meanwhile, the British maintained posts on Hudson Bay, ignored the interior and waited for Indians to bring furs to them.

''British Era:'' The second era began when trade reached the ''pays d'en haut'' west of Lake Superior. In these cold lands beaver had longer and thicker fur. After the British conquered Canada in 1759, management of the Montreal trade was taken over by English-speakers while the real work continued to be done by French-Canadians. The Montreal-based [[North West Company]] was formed in 1779 largely because distances had become so great as to require a highly organized transport system (The Athabasca country was 3000 miles from Montreal and a canoe might go 1000 miles in a month). The independent [[coureur des bois]] was replaced by hired [[voyageurs]]. Since the west country was too far for a round trip in one season, each spring, when the ice broke up, boats would set out from Montreal while winterers would start east. They exchanged their goods at Grand Portage on Lake Superior and returned before the rivers froze five months later. To save the cost of hauling food from Montreal [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]] around Winnipeg began the large-scale production of [[pemmican]]. The Hudson Bay trade was diverted southwest to the edge of the prairie where pemmican was picked up to feed the voyageurs on their journey northwest to the Athabasca country. Competition from the Nor'Westers forced the Hudson's Bay Company to build posts in the interior. The two companies competed for a while and, in 1821, merged. Management was taken over by the capital-rich HBC, but trading methods were those of the Montreal-based Nor'Westers.  Much trade shifted to York Factory and later some went [[Red River Trails|south to Minnesota]]. After 1810 the western posts were linked to the British bases on the Oregon coast. By mid-century the HBC ruled an inland empire that stretched from Hudson Bay to the Pacific. The [[Carlton Trail]] became a land route across the prairies. HBC land claims were transferred to Canada by the [[Rupert's Land Act 1868]].  From 1874 the [[North-West Mounted Police]] began to extend formal government into the area. The fur trade routes grew obsolete from the 1880s with the coming of railways and steamships.

==St. Lawrence River basin==
[[File:Grlakes lawrence map.png|thumb|St. Lawrence Basin and Great Lakes. Montreal is where the Quebec-Ontario border joins the St. Lawrence]]
[[File:Ottawarivermap.png|right|thumb|Ottawa River Basin. The area labeled Lake Huron is the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron]]
Seagoing ships can reach Quebec City and smaller ones can reach Montreal. One might think that the route would continue up the St. Lawrence, but this was not the case. Possible reasons are the [[Lachine Rapids]] and other rapids above Montreal, [[Niagara Falls]], [[Iroquois]] hostility, the poorer quality of southern furs and the lack of large birch trees to make canoes. The route west from Montreal has been called the 'first Trans-Canada Highway'. It ran from near Montreal, up the [[Ottawa River]], west up the [[Mattawa River]] to [[Trout Lake (Ontario)|Trout Lake]] and over the 7-mile La Vase portage at what is now [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] on [[Lake Nipissing]] and down the [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] to [[Georgian Bay]] of [[Lake Huron]]. This route was first used by Etienne Brule in 1610 and later by Champlain.&lt;ref&gt;Consul Willshire Butterfield, (1898), [https://archive.org/details/historyofbruls00buttuoft ''History of Brulé's discoveries and explorations, 1610-1626''].&lt;/ref&gt; When the Iroquois made the Ottawa dangerous it was possible for small canoes to continue up the Ottawa above the Mattawa and from its sources cross to the [[Saint-Maurice River]] and down to the St. Lawrence at [[Trois-Rivières]].

From the French River south to the Jesuit [[Wyandot people|Huron]] missions at the southern end of Georgian Bay (1626–1640). Or west through the [[Strait of Mackinac]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. Or west north of [[Manitoulin Island]] and up the [[St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)|St Marys River]] (26 feet difference in elevation) to [[Lake Superior]]. On Lake Superior voyageurs would normally hug the northern shore because of the danger of frequent squalls that could overturn their boats.

The route up the St. Lawrence to [[Lake Ontario]], [[Niagara Falls]], [[Lake Erie]], [[Detroit River]], [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], [[St. Clair River]] and lower [[Lake Huron]] developed later (Adrien Jolliet in 1669 was probably the first) and was never the main westward route. North of the St. Lawrence were many complex lakes and rivers that were sometimes used to go as far as [[James Bay]]. The [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]] was a major portage route in the St. Lawrence basin, linking Lake Ontario with [[Lake Simcoe]] and the northern Great Lakes.

==Nelson River basin==
[[File:Nelsonrivermap.png|thumb]]
[[File:Lake Winnipeg map.png|thumb|The Saskatchewan enters Lake Winnipeg through Cedar Lake]]
The [[Canada–United States border]] meets Lake Superior near [[Grand Portage, Minnesota]]. From here to Lake of the Woods the voyageurs' route went northwest across the 9 mile (14&amp;nbsp;km) long Grand Portage to avoid the falls and canyon of the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota-Ontario)|Pigeon River]], thence along the present international border west up the {{convert|50|mi}} long Pigeon River and Arrow River to South Lake, and then across the {{convert|400|m}} [[Height of Land Portage]] to North Lake whose waters drain into Hudson Bay. From North Lake the route goes through Gunflint Lake, thence down the Pine and Granite Rivers to Saganaga lake and through a chain of lakes, including Knife and Basswood Lakes, to Lac La Croix, where the route from Fort William comes in. It continues down the Loon River to Lake Namakan and north over either of two portages to [[Rainy Lake]] (a depot was established here to shorten the voyage of the Athabasca brigade) and down the [[Rainy River (Minnesota–Ontario)|Rainy River]] to [[Lake of the Woods]] {{convert|210|mi}} west-northwest of Grand Portage. Leaving the US border, northwest down the [[Winnipeg River]] with 26 portages to [[Lake Winnipeg]], a poor lake for small craft. This area was opened up by [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye|La Vérendrye]] in 1731-1737. Following the current downstream leads to the [[Nelson River]] and [[Hudson Bay]], which is not very useful. (The Nelson River is difficult and the parallel [[Hayes River]] was preferred. The Hayes route became more important after 1821 when much trade shifted from Montreal to York Factory)

In 1803 it was found that Grand Portage was on the US side of the border and the Lake Superior base was moved {{convert|45|mi}} northeast to [[Fort William, Ontario]], from which an old trail led inland to the north and west to Lac La Croix in the watershed of the Rainy River.&lt;ref&gt;Lass (1980), pp. 37–39, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the two routes from Lake Superior see [[Grand Portage National Monument]] and [[Kaministiquia River]].

A minor route ran from [[Duluth, Minnesota]] west and north up the [[St. Louis River]] and [[Embarrass River (Minnesota)|Embarrass River]] over another Height of Land Portage and north down the [[Pike River (Minnesota)]] and [[Vermilion River (Minnesota)]] to [[Rainy Lake]] on the Grand Portage route. During the negotiations for the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] Britain tried to make this as the Canada–US border.&lt;ref&gt;Lass (1980), pp. 37–39, 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel et al. (1992), pp. E-12, E-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saskatchewan River]] enters Lake Winnipeg at [[Grand Rapids, Manitoba]]. Around these rapids to [[Cedar Lake (Manitoba)|Cedar Lake]]. [Cedar Lake is one of the chain of lakes that look like a single lake west of Lake Winnipeg. Although it was not much used, a route ran from Cedar Lake south over the {{convert|4|mi}} Mossy portage to [[Lake Winnipegosis]] and then the mile-and-a-half Meadow Portage to [[Lake Manitoba]] and the at least {{convert|5|mi}} of [[Portage la Prairie]] to the [[Assiniboine River]]. Another route reached Lake Manitoba from Lake Winnipeg via the [[Dauphin River]]. Up the Saskatchewan, past [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan|Cumberland House]] and up the [[North Saskatchewan River]] almost to the Rocky Mountains at [[Fort Edmonton]] and [[Rocky Mountain House]], [[Alberta]]. The North Saskatchewan is approximately the southern limit of forested beaver country. There are no portages between Cumberland and Edmonton, but there are sand bars and {{convert|125|mi}} stretch of strong current east of [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]] where canoes were dragged upstream on ropes.  Above Prince Albert is the ''La Montée'' prairie country where voyageurs were fed by [[buffalo hunter]]s.  Both [[York boats]] and north canoes were used. Trade was helped by the fact that the [[Cree Language]] was spoken along the whole route. South of the river there was enough grass for horses and one could travel from Edmonton to Red River on horseback.  Horses were used for speed and canoes for freight.  There are, of course, no canoe routes over the Rockies.

The [[Assiniboine River]] which meets the Red River just south of Lake Winnipeg provided another route west. The [[Red River of the North]], which flows north into the southern tip of Lake Winnipeg gained some importance after 1812 with the establishment of the [[Red River Colony]] and when the [[Metis people (Canada)|Metis]] began supplying buffalo [[Pemmican]] to feed the [[voyageurs]]. These are prairie rivers and not good beaver country. Much transport was by horse and [[Red River cart]], and American traders were able to subvert the British monopoly over the fur trade by siphoning off much of the trade to entrepôts on the Mississippi River to the south by way of the [[Red River Trails]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilman (1979), pp. 7-8, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mackenzie River basin==
[[Image:Canada-satellite.jpg|thumb|Forest axis. Note the light-colored prairie in the southwest and the greyish Barren Grounds to the northeast.]]

[[File:Mackenzierivermap.jpg|thumb|right|Mackenzie Basin. Lac La Loche is south of the 'w' in 'Clearwater'. The best beaver country was to the south and along the Rockies.]]
The axis from Lake Superior to the Mackenzie River runs along the southwest side of the forested beaver country between the prairie to the southwest and the Barren Grounds to the northeast. Here beaver fur is longer and thicker than further southeast. The southern part of the axis was near the source of [[pemmican]].  From the depot at [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan]] on the lower Saskatchewan River, this route runs north up the [[Sturgeon-Weir River]], across [[Frog Portage]] to the east-flowing [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] which is mostly a chain of lakes, west up the Churchill past the depot on [[Lac Île-à-la-Crosse]], through [[Peter Pond Lake]] to [[Lac La Loche]] and over the 12-mile [[Methye Portage]] to the [[Clearwater River (Saskatchewan)|Clearwater River]] whose waters reach the Arctic. The Methye Portage, which was first reached by [[Peter Pond]] in 1778 ranks with Grand Portage as the most difficult of the major portages. 

The route continues west down the Clearwater River to the [[Athabasca River]] at [[Fort McMurray]] and north down the Athabasca to the [[Peace-Athabasca Delta]] and the depot at [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta]], at the west end of [[Lake Athabasca]]. This was about as far as canoes could reach and return in one season and was the gathering place for furs from the rich Athabasca region and further west. One could continue into poorer country north down the [[Slave River]] to the [[Great Slave Lake]] and thence northwest down the [[Mackenzie River]] to the Arctic Ocean.

==Pacific Coast==
[[Image:Oregoncountry2.png|thumb|Map of Oregon Country]]
[[Image:York-Factory-Express.png|thumb|Map of the route of the [[York Factory Express]], 1820s to 1840s. Modern political boundaries shown. The road from Assiniboine to Edmonton was a horse track built in 1825]]

After the voyages of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] European ships entered the Pacific in large numbers. A [[Maritime fur trade]] with China developed from the [[Columbia District]] (known as [[Oregon Country]] in the US). The inland canoe routes were linked to the Pacific coast in 1811 when [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] reached the mouth of the [[Columbia River]]. A fur trade developed in the interior.  Here, horses were used more often than canoes, furs were trapped by non-Indians and the pelts exported by ship. Here Canadians competed, rather successfully, with the [[American Fur Company]]. In 1846 the Columbia District was divided between the two nations at the 49th parallel.

The interior of British Columbia around the upper [[Fraser River]] was called [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caladonia]]. Goods were carried from [[Fort Chipewyan]] up the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] (1,500 foot elevation gain and only one significant portage at [[Hudson Hope, British Columbia]]) to [[McLeod Lake, British Columbia|Fort McLeod]] and carried over the mountains. It normally took two years for heavy goods to cross the continent, goods being stored at [[Fort Chipewyan]] over the winter. Later there was a horse trail from the Fraser River south to [[Fort Okanogan]] on the Columbia River.

The route to the Columbia River ran from Fort Chipewyan southwest up the [[Athabasca River]] to [[Fort Assiniboine]] and after 1825, west from [[Fort Edmonton]] on the North Saskatchewan over an 80-mile horse track to [[Fort Assiniboine]]. From there it went up the Athabasca to [[Jasper House]] and by horse over [[Simpson Pass]] to [[Boat Encampment]] on the Columbia. The route was used for messages and light freight but was not practical for heavy freight.

The far northwest was supplied by an unusual route which was found in 1851 by [[Robert Campbell (fur trader)|Robert Campbell]] who travelled in the opposite direction from the one described here. From the Mackenzie River delta it went south up the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] to the depot at [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories]], thence back down the Peel and west up the Rat River (by poling or dragging, not paddling) or by a parallel trail and over a half-mile portage to the Little Bell River.  The route from [[Bell River (Yukon)]] went past a post called Lapierre's House and down the [[Porcupine River]] to [[Fort Yukon, Alaska]] about 300 miles west of Fort McPherson. From there it went at least 400 miles south-southeast up the [[Yukon River]] and [[Pelly River]], then the Findlayson and Campbell Rivers and a portage to [[Frances Lake]], down the Frances River to the [[Liard River]] and east to [[Fort Simpson]] on the Mackenzie about 275 miles east of Frances Lake. There was some transport on the Laird, but the Laird river canyon made this difficult.

==Mississippi basin==
In 1682 [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] reached the mouth of the Mississippi from the Great Lakes. From about 1715 the French sought to link the St. Lawrence and Mississippi basins and bottle up the English on the east coast. From the southeast side of Lake Michigan, east up the [[St. Joseph River (Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] to near the present site of [[South Bend, Indiana]] and across a short portage to the [[Kankakee River]], west down to Kankakee, which joins the [[Des Plaines River]] to become the [[Illinois River]] which runs first west and then southwest to the Mississippi. Another route was the [[Chicago River]] and across the [[Chicago Portage]] to the Des Plaines River and south to the Illinois. Alternatively, from the northwest side of Lake Michigan, at the head of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]], up the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]], past serious rapids to [[Lake Winnebago]], up the Fox and over a [[Fox-Wisconsin Waterway|short portage]] to the [[Wisconsin River]] and southwest to the Mississippi. Another route ran from the western extremity of Lake Superior up the [[Saint Louis River]] and the [[East Savanna River]], across the [[Savanna Portage]], and down south and west flowing streams to the Mississippi River and the fur country of what is now the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Axelson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luukkonen, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the British conquest there were French trading posts from New Orleans up the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to the Great Lakes.

==Lake-Champlain-Hudson River==
[[Image:Champlainmap.svg|thumb|Map showing the Lake Champlain-River Richelieu watershed.]]
[[Image:French and Indian War map.png|thumb|right|Forts and routes during the French and Indian War]]

This was the main axis of British-French and British-US military conflict late in the period. From Quebec upriver about a third of the way to Montreal, up the [[Richelieu River]] to [[Lake Champlain]], portage west parallel to the [[La Chute River]] (230 feet drop in 3½-miles) to [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], overland to the [[Hudson River]] and downstream to New York.

==Upper Ohio River basin==
Although the French had long been in the Ohio country (La Salle in 1669, [[Fort des Miamis]] from 1715), this area only became important after about 1743 when the French tried to block Anglo-American expansion into the [[Ohio country]]. From Lake Erie, at [[Fort Presque Isle]] (1753), south up an army-built wagon road to [[Fort Le Boeuf]] at the head of the Rivière aux Boeufs ([[LeBoeuf Creek (Pennsylvania)|LeBoeuf Creek]]), down LeBoeuf Creek to [[French Creek (Allegheny River)|French Creek]] to [[Fort Machault]] at its junction with the [[Allegheny River]] and down the Allegany to [[Fort Duquesne]] (1754) at modern-day Pittsburgh. The British response to this move was the beginning of the [[French and Indian War]].

==Hudson Bay==
[[Image:GRAND Canal proposal (James Bay to Lake Huron).jpg|thumb|right|Rivers around James Bay. Marking shows a possible water diversion and is close to the route south from Moose Factory]]

The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] began establishing posts on the Bay in 1668. Unlike the French-Canadians, the English were usually content to sit on the coast and let the Indians bring furs to them. '[[Asleep by the frozen sea]]' is how Joseph Robson described it. Movement inland began about 1750 after the French entered the western country and tried to divert the Hudson Bay fur trade to Montreal. The most important route ran from [[York Factory]] up the [[Hayes River]] (not the Nelson River) to [[Norway House]] at the north end of Lake Winnipeg. Most posts were on the southwest side of the bay. Inland were many complex routes, most being too small for heavy freight canoes.
Main routes from east to west were:

*On [[James Bay]]
**North of the Eastmain were Barren Grounds with few beaver.
**[[Eastmain River]] from James Bay east.
**[[Rupert River]] with [[Rupert House]]: Rupert Bay at the southeast corner of James Bay, east up the Rupert to [[Lake Mistassini]], over to [[Lake Saint-Jean]] and down the [[Saguenay River]] to the St. Lawrence at [[Tadoussac]].
**[[Nottaway River]]: Rupert Bay southeast to [[Lake Matagami]].
**[[Moose River (Ontario)|Moose River]] with [[Moose Factory]] on the south end of James Bay: 1) south:Moose River, [[Abitibi River]], [[Lake Abitibi]], portage to the upper Ottawa River near [[Lake Timiskaming]]. This was the best route from James Bay to the Ottawa and was used by the [[Hudson Bay expedition (1686)]]; 2) southwest: Moose River, [[Missinaibi River]], portage to the [[Michipicoten River]] to Lake Superior at [[Wawa, Ontario]]. This route was used to supply Lake Superior from Hudson Bay.
**[[Albany River]] with [[Fort Albany, Ontario]] on the west side of James Bay with [[Henley House]](1743) 160 miles upstream: 1) southwest: up the Albany, up the [[Ogoki River]], cross to [[Lake Nipigon]] and south to Lake Superior; 2) West: Albany River to [[Lake St. Joseph]], portage to a river going south to [[Lac Seul]] and down the [[English River (Ontario)]] to the Winnipeg River.
*[[Severn River (northern Ontario)]] with Fort Severn on the 'shoulder' west of James Bay. The Severn flows northeast from the general area of [[Lake St. Joseph]]
*[[Hayes River]] with [[York Factory, Manitoba]]: York Factory was the Hudson's Bay Company base of operations. Up most of the Hayes, across the [[Echimamish River]] to the upper [[Nelson River]] and upstream to [[Norway House, Manitoba]] at the north end of Lake Winnipeg.
*[[Nelson River]] with [[Port Nelson, Manitoba|Port Nelson]] just north of the mouth of the Hayes. Although the Nelson drains Lake Winnipeg, this route was avoided in preference to the Hayes.
*[[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)]] with [[Prince of Wales Fort|Fort Churchill]]: This route was used mainly by [[Chipewyan people|Chipewyans]] to bring furs down from the rich Athabasca country. The route ran from the east end of [[Lake Athabasca]] up the [[Fond du Lac River (Saskatchewan)]] to [[Wollaston Lake]] and south through [[Reindeer Lake]] to the Churchill. This route was used by [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] in 1824 but was rarely used by Europeans because the large lakes retain their ice long into the season.
*Inland between the Churchill and Hayes Rivers: Smaller Indian canoes used the Upper and Middle Tracts between the Hayes and Nelson. These routes grew obsolete after 1774 when [[Cumberland House, Saskatchewan]] was founded, which allowed transport by heavy freight canoes and [[York boat]]s.
**Middle Tract: One branch left the Hayes about 100 miles from the Bay and went up the [[Fox River (Manitoba)]] and Bigstone River to Utik (Deer) Lake and somehow over to [[Cross Lake, Manitoba]] on the Nelson. The other left the Hayes at [[Oxford Lake]] and went up the Carrot River and crossed to Walker Lake which connects to Cross Lake about 50 miles west of Oxford Lake. From the west end of Cross Lake, up the [[Minago River]] and over a low divide to Moose Lake and along the Summerberry River to the Saskatchewan River.
**Upper Tract: began on the Nelson River at [[Split Lake, Manitoba]], somehow avoiding about 150 difficult miles of the lower Nelson, and went about 200 miles west-southwest up the Grass River, over the Cranberry Portage to the Goose River and down the Goose and [[Sturgeon-Weir River]] to [[Cumberland Lake]] on the Saskatchewan River about 50 miles west of the start of the Middle Tract.
**Another route connected the Nelson and Churchill. It ran from Split Lake west up the [[Burntwood River]] and a portage via the [[Kississing Lake|Kississing River]] to the Churchill and up to [[Frog Portage]].
*north of the Churchill is Barren Grounds

{{refimprove|date=December 2014}}
{{Royal and noble ranks}}
A '''castellan''' was the [[governor]] or captain of a castellany and its [[castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Friar, Stephen (2003). ''The Sutton Companion to Castles'', Sutton Publishing, Stroud, 2003, p. 47. {{ISBN|978-0-7509-3994-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word stems from the Latin ''Castellanus'',&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, Henri. "Medieval Cities". Princeton University Press, 1952. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from ''castellum'' "castle". Sometimes also known as a '''constable''', '''governor''' of the castle district or '''captain''', the [[Constable of the Tower]] of [[Tower of London|London]] is, in fact, a form of castellan. A castellan was almost always male, but could occasionally be female, as when, in 1194, Beatrice inherited her father's castellany of [[Bourbourg]] upon the death of her brother, Roger.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Erin L. "Female Founders: Exercising authority in Thirteenth-century Flanders and Hainaut." ''Church History and Religious Culture'', Vol. 88, No. 4, Secular Women in the Documents for Late Medieval Religious Women (2008), pp. 546. Jordan, 559, later says, though, that women holding castellanies may be more prevalent in Flanders and Hainalt than in other parts of Western Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial power==
After [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] [[Roman Empire]], many tribes [[Migration Age|migrated into western Europe]], causing strife and war. The answer to recurrent invasion was to create fortified areas which evolved into [[castles]]. Some leaders gained control of several areas, each with a castle. The problem lay in exerting proper control and authority in each area when a leader could only be in one place at a time. To answer this, lords gave their trusted [[vassal]]s direct control of a castle, reporting to the lord only.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bosl, “Ruler and Ruled in the German Empire from the Tenth to the Twelfth Century,” in Lordship and Community in Medieval Europe, ed. Fredric Cheyette, (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc., 1968): 359=362.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth century, as fortifications improved and kings had difficulty making their subordinates pay their taxes or send the military aid the kings demanded, the castellans grew in power, holding their [[fief]] without much concern for their overlord's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Markus. "Feudal Europe, 800-1300: Communal Discourse and Conflictual Practices." ''International Organization'', Vol. 46, No. 2 (Spring, 1992), pp. 438-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This changed as kings grew in power and as the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] emperors replaced recalcitrant [[vassals]] with [[ministerialis|ministerials]].

==Duties==
{{See also|Majordomo|Medieval warfare}}
Usually the duties of a castellan were combined with the duties of a [[majordomo (domestic staff)|majordomo]], making the castellan responsible for a castle's domestic staff and its [[garrison]], as well as a military administrator responsible for maintaining defenses and protecting the castle's lands. This was particularly the case if there was no lord resident at the castle, or if the resident lord was frequently absent.&lt;ref&gt;Pirenne, 73, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; A castellan may exercise the power of the "ban" - that is, to hear court cases and collect the fines, collect taxes from residents, and muster local men for the defense&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwein, Barbara. "A Short History of the Middle Ages: Volume II, from c.900 to c.1500" University of Toronto Press, 2009. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Castellans had both the power of low justice and high justice, which allowed them to implement up to and including the death penalty, as when, in 1111, the Salzburg castellan caught the [[ministerialis|ministerial]] who fomented armed rebellion, he had the offender blinded, as one would a serf.&lt;ref name="Arnold1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Arnold|title=German knighthood, 1050-1300|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UpQaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=arnold+German+Knighthood+1050-1300.&amp;q=blinded|year=1985|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=137}} (also available to subscribers at [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;idno=heb01508.0001.001;node=heb01508.0001.001%3A7;view=image;seq=149;size=100;page=root University of Michigan] {{subscription required|s}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821014318/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;idno=heb01508.0001.001;node=heb01508.0001.001%3A7;view=image;seq=149;size=100;page=root |date=2016-08-21 }})&lt;/ref&gt; At times, the castellan served as the representative of the people of his castellany, as did the castellan of [[Bruges]], when the burghers stood up for more privileges and liberties from the counts of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James Bruce. "Rise and Fall of a Twelfth-century Clan: The Erembalds and the Murder of Count Charles of Flanders, 1127-1128." ''Speculum'', Vol. 34, No. 3 (Jul., 1959), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castellans and Jews===
One unusual responsibility in western Europe concerned jurisdiction over the resident Jewish communities near the [[English Channel]]. The [[Constable of the Tower]] of London and those castellans subordinate to the dukes of [[Normandy]] were responsible for their administration. Vivian Lipman posits four reasons for this: the castles provided defense, they were centres of administration, they were potential prisons, and possibly, as the residence of a local magnate, they could be a valuable client.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, Vivian. "Jews and castles in medieval England: Transactions &amp; Miscellanies" Jewish Historical Society of England, Vol. 28 (1981-1982), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional differences==

===France===
{{Main|Châtelain}}
In France, castellans (known in [[French language|French]] as [[châtelain]]s) who governed castles without resident nobles acquired considerable powers, and the position actually became a hereditary [[fiefdom]]. By the tenth century, the fragmentation of power became so widespread in [[Mâcon]] that the castellany was considered the basic unit of governance, without effective levels above it - the counts of Mâcon were largely ignored by their castellans from about 980 to 1030. In the 12th century ''châtelains'' had become lords, they expanded their territories to include taking weaker castellanies under their control, as when then castellan of [[Beaujeu, Rhône|Beaujeu]] took over lands in [[Lyons]], or when [[Uxelles]] annexed [[Briançon]], then [[Sennecey-le-Grand]] and L'Épervieres.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, p. 440-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the castellans never managed to rise to the lordship and they remained a local officer of an overlord. During the Ancien Régime, castellans were heads of the local royal administration, but their power was delegated to their lieutenants.

All remaining lordships and royal local administration were suppressed during the [[French Revolution]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, ''châtelain'' is used to describe the owner of a castle or manor house, in many cases a figure of authority in his parish, akin the English [[squire]].

===Germany===
{{main|Burgmann}}
[[File:Festung Hohensalzburg (2).jpg|thumb|right|The fortress of [[Hohensalzburg]], Austria, had a ministerial castellan]] In Germany the castellan was known as a ''[[Burgmann]]'', or sometimes ''Hauptmann'' ("captain"), who reported to the lord of the castle, or ''Burgherr'', also often known as the [[burgrave]] (''Burggraf''). The ''burgmann'' may have been either a free noble or a ''[[ministerialis]]'', but either way administered the castle as a [[vassal]]. A ''ministerialis'', being wholly indebted to a lord, was more easily controlled. ''Ministeriales'' replaced free nobles as castellans of [[Hohensalzburg]] under Conrad I of Abensberg’s tenure as Archbishop of Salzburg from 1106 to 1147, starting with Henry of Seekirchen in the 1130s.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, John B. "Noble Bondsmen: Ministerial Marriages in the Archdiocese of Salzburg,
1100-1343." Cornell University Press, 1995. pp. 39-40&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In the Medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] usually was called "várnagy", and in the Latin charts it appeared as "castellanus". The lord of the castle had very similar functions than the German ones. In Hungary first the King, later the most powerful noblemen designed the castellans between their followers for the administration of their castles and the states that belonged to the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varturak.hu/magyar/oldalak/varnagyok/|title=Várnagyok|author=|date=|website=www.varturak.hu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513205848/http://www.varturak.hu/magyar/oldalak/varnagyok/|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem===
At times, there was a castellan among the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]], starting with Anselm (castellan, c. 1110).

===Malta===

===Poland===
{{main|Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
In the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] and later the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the castellans ({{Lang-pl|Kasztelan}}) were in most cases lower in precedence to the [[voivode]]s (with the exception of the [[Burgrave]] of [[Kraków]] [Polish ''Burgrabia krakowski''] who had precedence before the [[Voivode]] of [[Kraków]]). Castellans were in charge of a part of a [[voivodeship]] called the castellany (Polish ''Kasztelania'') until the 15th-century and from that time on their domain was divided into [[province]]s for greater castellans, and [[powiat]]s for minor castellans. Castellans in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were of [[senator]] rank.

===Portugal===
In Portugal, a castellan was known as ''alcaide''. Later, the role of ''alcaide'' became an honorary title awarded by the [[King of Portugal]] to certain nobles. As the honorary holder of the office of ''alcaide'' did not often live near its castle, a delegate of him started to be appointed to effectively govern it. An honorary holder of the office became known as ''alcaide-mor'' (major ''alcaide'') and its delegate became known as ''alcaide pequeno'' (little ''alcaide'') or ''alcaide-menor'' (minor ''alcaide).

==Castellany==
[[File:BrugseVrije1664.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[Brugse Vrije]], a castellany of the [[County of Flanders]]]]

A '''castellany''', or castellania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur|last=Enenkel|date=1908|origyear=1856 |url=https://archive.org/stream/newdictionaryofe00eneniala/newdictionaryofe00eneniala_djvu.txt|title=A new dictionary of the English and Italian languages, containing the whole vocabulary in general use with copious selections of scientific, technical and commercial terms and others lately brought into use with their pronunciation figured|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term denoting a [[district]] administered by a castellan. Castellanies appeared during the [[Middle Ages]] and in most current [[Sovereign state|states]] are now replaced by a more modern type of [[country subdivision]]. The word is derived from [[castle]] and literally means the extent of [[Real property|land]] and [[jurisdiction]] belonging to a given castle.

It also renders equivalent, often cognate, terms in other languages. Examples of French ''châtelainies'' include the castellanies of [[Ivry-la-Bataille]], [[Nonancourt]], [[Pacy]], [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and [[Gaillon]], all in Normandy, which under in the treaty of Issoudun (1195, after a war with king Richard of England) were acquired for the French crown by Philip Augustus. Examples from Poland include [[Leczyca]] and [[Sieradz]] (both once a duchy), [[Spycimierz]], [[Rozprza]], [[Wolbórz]] and [[Wojnicz]] (in Cracow diocese) and [[Otmuchow]] in Silesia.

The '''Districts of Ghana''' are second-level administrative subdivisions of [[Ghana]], below the level of [[Regions of Ghana|region]]. There are 216 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Districts and nominated DCEs|url=http://ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/newcreateddistricts.pdf|publisher=GhanaDistricts,com|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305161824/http://ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/newcreateddistricts.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The districts of Ghana were re-organized in 1988/1989 in an attempt to decentralize the government and to combat the rampant corruption amongst officials{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. The reform of the late 1980s subdivided the [[regions of Ghana]] into 110 districts, where local district assemblies should deal with the local administration. By 2006, an additional 28 districts were created by splitting some of the original 110, bringing their number up to 138. In February 2008, there were more districts created and some were upgraded to municipal status. This brought the final number to 170 districts in Ghana.&lt;ref name=2008list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/all_mmdas_in_ghana.pdf |title=BREAK DOWN OF METROPOLITAN, MUNICIPAL AND DISTRICT ASSEMBLIES IN GHANA |accessdate=2009-11-23 |publisher=GhanaDistricts.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216210935/http://www.ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/all_mmdas_in_ghana.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a further 46 districts have been added since 28 June 2012 bringing the total to 216 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Districts and nominated DCEs|url=http://ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/newcreateddistricts.pdf|publisher=GhanaDistricts,com|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305161824/http://ghanadistricts.com/pdfs/newcreateddistricts.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41152">'''Enhanced 911''', '''E-911''' or '''E911''' is a system used in North America to automatically provide the caller's location to [[9-1-1|911]] dispatchers. 911 is the universal [[emergency telephone number]] in the region.  Outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, this type of facility is often called '''caller location'''. In the European Union, a similar system exists known as [[E112]] (where [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]] is the emergency access number) and known as [[eCall]] when called by a vehicle.

An incoming 911 call is routed to a [[Public safety answering point|Public Safety Answering Point]] (PSAP), a call center operated by the local government. At the PSAP, the call is answered by a specially trained official known as a [[telecommunicator|9-1-1 dispatcher]].  The dispatcher's computer uses information provided by the telephone company to display the physical address or [[geographic coordinates]] of the caller.  This information is used to dispatch police, fire, medical, and other services as needed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/there-are-many-problems-mobile-privacy-presidential-alert-isnt-one-them|title=There are Many Problems With Mobile Privacy but the Presidential Alert Isn’t One of Them|last=Quintin|first=Cooper|date=2018-10-04|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Call routing ==

=== Landline routing ===
Calls to 911 over the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) are routed to a special router (known as Selective Router, or 9-1-1 Tandem)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-master-psap-registry|title=911 Master PSAP Registry|date=2011-02-14|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/communications-route-diversity-public-safety|title=Communications Route Diversity for Public Safety|date=2011-02-11|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The router looks for the address associated with the caller's telephone number in a database. The caller's phone number is known as an [[Automatic number identification|ANI]]. The database relating ANIs to addresses is known as ALI (Automatic Location Identification).  The router then uses the address to search in the MSAG for the Emergency Service Number (ESN) of the appropriate PSAP for that area, and connects the call to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ecn/programs/911/Pages/history.aspx|title=ECN 911 History|last=|first=|date=|website=Minnesota Department of Public Safety|publisher=|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite patent|country=US|number=20160337831A1|title=Real-time over the top 9-1-1 caller location data|status=|pubdate=2016-11-17|fdate=2015-05-16|gdate=|invent1=|inventor1-first=|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160337831A1/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MSAG ====
The Master Street Address Guide (MSAG) is a database of street addresses and corresponding Emergency Service Numbers (ESNs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ESNs represent one or more emergency service agencies (e.g. fire department, law enforcement) designated to serve a specific range of addresses in a geographic area, called an Emergency Service Zone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ecn/programs/911/Documents/NG911PSAP_Installation%20Guide_v3_8.pdf PSAP Installation Guide] (19 December 2011), ECN 911 Program, Minnesota Department of Public Safety&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wireless routing ===
Calls from cellular phones are received via [[Cell site|cell towers]] by [[Mobile switching centre server|mobile switching centers]] (MSC).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The switching center automatically assigns a unique identifier to each cellular 911 call, known as a "pseudo ANI".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The Selective Router connects the call to a PSAP based on the cell tower's location.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Location transmission ==
Location is an important concept in the manner of how the Enhanced 911 system works.

Automatic location of the emergency is intended to be faster and more reliable than verbal communication of the location, though this is usually requested anyway for confirmation.  It also makes it possible for emergency services to respond when callers cannot communicate their location, because they do not know where they are, are too panicked, are a child, are distracted by the ongoing emergency, or do not wish to attract the attention of the perpetrator of a crime in progress. 

Calls made to non-911 emergency numbers (such as the direct line to a police or fire department) might not have automatic location enabled.

Call to 911 calls from are answered by an operator at a PSAP. In addition to the voice transmission, the telephone network also transmits a number associated with the current call, the ANI. The 911 operator (or their computer) at the PSAP searches a database (ALI) for the ANI to find the caller's relevant location.

The ALI record associated with the query is then returned to the PSAP where the [[Customer-premises equipment]] (CPE) correlates that information with the call taker receiving the call and displays the information on their computer screen.

=== Landline transmission ===
For landline calls the ANI resembles the caller's phone number. The ALI stores a pre-determined address associated with the caller's telephone number. This address is typically the phone's billing address.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Wireless transmission ===
For wireless calls, the ANI (or "pseudo-ANI") is a unique number assigned to each individual 911 call, assigned at a mobile switching center.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In parallel to the actual voice call, the ALI database gets periodically updated with more granular and recent location information.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cellular networks can determine a more granular location of the caller's device by using triangulation from the cell towers ([[radiolocation]]). In addition to triangulation, a second source of location information may be the caller's phone itself (or other cellular device).

Many phones manufactured after 2005 have [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers built in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gps-phone2.htm|title=How GPS Phones Work|date=2005-10-24|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the cellular phone detects that the user is placing an emergency call, it begins to transmit its location to a secure server, from which the PSAP can retrieve it. Cellphone manufactures may program the phone to automatically enable GPS functionality (if disabled) when an emergency call is placed, so that it may transmit its location.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ALI database ===
[[File:9-1-1 System.svg|thumb|500px|The 911 system|alt=The 911 system]]The ALI database is secured and separate from the public phone network by design.  It is generally maintained by the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) under contract by the PSAP. Each ILEC has their own standards for the formatting of the database.

The ALI is maintained on behalf of local governments by contracted private third parties generally the [[Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier]] (ILEC).  Often, the contracted 3rd party further subcontracts the actual ALI database management to companies such as Intrado, [[Bandwidth (company)|Bandwidth]] and TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. The ALI database also feeds the Master Street Address Guide database which is used to route the call to the appropriate PSAP and when the call arrives, the ALI database is queried to determine the location of the caller.

Most ALI databases have a companion database known as the MSAG, Master Street Address Guide. The MSAG describes the exact spelling of streets, street number ranges, and other address elements. When a new account is created, the address is located in the Master Street Address Guide to track the proper Emergency Service Number (ESN) that 911 calls from that phone number should be routed to. [[Competitive local exchange carrier]]s (CLEC) and other competing wireline carriers negotiate for access to the ALI database in their respective Interconnect Agreement with the ILEC. They populate the database using the ILEC MSAG as a guide.

If the phone number is not in the ALI database, this is known as ''ALI Failure''; the call is then passed to default ESN for the call's [[trunk line]] group, which is a PSAP designated for this function. The 911 operator must then ask the incoming caller for their location and redirect them to the correct PSAP. The legal penalty in most states for ALI database lookup failure is limited to a requirement that the telephone company fix the database entry.

== Location determination ==
The way location is determined varies by the type of originating device or network. 

=== Landline location ===
Landline or wireline calls originate from a device connected to a known and fixed location connection to the PSTN. These locations are stored in the Automatic Location Information (ALI) database.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bandwidth.com/glossary/ali-database/|title=What is an ALI Database? - Bandwidth|work=Bandwidth|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is permitted by special privacy legislation&lt;!-- which legislation? --&gt;.

Location information is not passed along by the public phone network; only the calling party's phone number is known to the receiver.

=== Wireless location ===
The billing address associated with a [[cell phone]] is not necessarily considered the location to which emergency responders should be sent, since the device is portable.  This means that locating the caller is more difficult, which resulted in the second phase of the Enhanced 911 service (E911 Phase 2), which relates to locating wireless or [[mobile telephone]] devices.

To locate a mobile telephone geographically, there are two general approaches.  One is to use some form of [[radiolocation]] from the [[cellular network]]; the other is to use a [[Global Positioning System]] receiver built into the phone itself. Both approaches are described by the [[Radio resource location services protocol]] (LCS protocol).

Radiolocation in [[cellular telephony]] uses [[base station]]s. Most often, this is done through [[triangulation]] between [[radio masts and towers|radio tower]]s.  The location of the [[Caller (telecommunications)|caller]] or [[handset]] can be determined several ways:

*[[Angle of arrival]] (AOA) requires at least two towers, locating the caller at the point where the lines along the angles from each tower [[Line-line intersection|intersect]].
*[[Multilateration|Time difference of arrival]] (TDOA) works like [[GPS]] using [[multilateration]], except that it is the networks that determine the time difference and therefore distance from each tower (as with [[seismometer]]s).
*Location signature uses "[[fingerprint]]ing" to store and recall patterns (such as [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]) which mobile phone signals are known to exhibit at different locations in each cell.

The first two depend on a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], which can be difficult or impossible in mountainous terrain or around skyscrapers.  Location signatures actually work ''better'' in these conditions however.  TDMA and [[GSM]] networks such as [[T-Mobile]] 2G use TDOA.&lt;ref name="fcc_report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-257964A1.pdf|title=FCC Report to Congress on the Deployment of E-911 Phase II Services by Tier III Service Providers|date=April 1, 2005|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] initially advocated TDOA, but changed to embedded GPS in 2006 for every GSM or [[UMTS]] voice-capable device due to improved accuracy.

[[Code division multiple access]] (CDMA) networks tend to use handset-based radiolocation technologies, which are technically more similar to radionavigation.  GPS is one of those technologies. [[Alltel]], [[Verizon Wireless]], T-Mobile 3G, and [[Sprint PCS]] use [[Assisted GPS]].&lt;ref name="fcc_report" /&gt;

Hybrid solutions, needing both the handset and the network include:

*[[Assisted GPS]] ([[wireless]] or television) allows use of GPS even indoors
*Advanced Forward Link Trilateration (A-FLT)
*Timing Advance/Network Measurement Report (TA/NMR)
*Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD)

Mobile phone users may also have a selection to permit location information to be sent to non-emergency [[phone number]]s or [[data]] networks, so that it can help people who are simply lost or want other [[location-based service]]s.  By default, this selection is usually turned off, to protect privacy. In areas such as tunnels and buildings, or anywhere else that GPS is not available or reliable, wireless carriers can deploy enhanced location determination solutions such as Co-Pilot Beacon for CDMA networks and LMU's for GSM networks.

The [[3GPP]] specified protocol for handset geolocation in GSM networks is called [[RRLP|Radio Resource Location Protocol]].

===911 address===
The term '''911 address''' refers to a format for specifying where a 911 call originated from (e.g. the address of the landline, or estimated location of a cell phone).

The 911 address contains a uniform number, the street name, direction (if applicable), and the city. The uniform number is usually assigned by the grid of the existing community. Each county usually has their own policy on how the addressing is done, but for the most part NENA guidelines are followed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} These guidelines are expressed by the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG). The exact 911 addresses and associated phone numbers are put into the ALI database.

==History==
The first 911 system was installed in [[Haleyville, Alabama]], in February 1968, as a way to quickly connect a subscriber to the local police station. The system was rapidly adapted and improved by other telephone companies, evolving into the E911 system, which provides both caller location and identification.  A pioneering system was in place in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] by the mid-1970s, providing both police and fire departments access to the source location of emergency calls.  Enhanced 911 is currently deployed in most [[metropolitan areas]] in the [[United States]],  [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]] as well as all of the [[Cayman Islands]].

=== The 911 Act ===
In the US, the [[Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act]] of 1999, also known as the 911 Act, mandated the use of E911 and designated 911 as the universal emergency number, including both wireline and wireless phone devices.

===FCC Requirements===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has made several requirements applicable to wireless or [[mobile telephone]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/wireless911srvc.html|title=Wireless 911 Services|author=|date=|work=Consumer &amp; Governmental Affairs Bureau|publisher=FCC.gov|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Basic 911: All 911 calls must be relayed to a call center, regardless of whether or not the mobile phone user is already a customer of the network being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1998/01/e911-turns-cell-phones-into-tracking-devices/|title=E911 Turns Cell Phones into Tracking Devices|last=|first=|date=6 January 1998|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* E911 Phase 1: Wireless network operators must identify the phone number and cell phone tower used by callers, within six minutes of a request by a PSAP.
* E911 Phase 2:
** 95% of a network operator's in-service phones must be E911 compliant ("location capable") by December 31, 2005. (Numerous carriers missed this deadline and were fined by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/sprint-alltel-usc-fined-missed-e911-deadline/2007-08-31|title=Sprint, Alltel, USC fined for missed e911 deadline|author=|date=2007-08-31|publisher=FierceWireless|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
** Wireless network operators must provide the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of callers within 300 meters, within six minutes of a request by a PSAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_11_18/ai_n27458948/?tag=content;col1|title=How accurate E911?|date=November 2007|work=GPS World|publisher=Questex Media Group, Inc.|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708073052/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_11_18/ai_n27458948/?tag=content;col1|archive-date=2012-07-08|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2010-11-17}} Network-based technology:100 meters for 67% of calls and 300 meters for 95% of calls. Handset-based technologies: 50 meters for 67% of calls and 150 meters for 95% of calls.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accuracy rates must meet FCC standards on average within any given participating PSAP service area by September 11, 2012 (deferred from September 11, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20080314/SUB/431138710/carriers-push-e-911-lawsuit-in-court-despite-winning-deadline|title=Carriers push E-911 lawsuit in court despite winning deadline extension|date=2008-03-14|publisher=RCR Wireless News|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Location information is used by the wireless network operator to determine to which PSAP to route the call to, and is transmitted to the PSAP for the purpose of sending [[emergency services]] to the scene of the incident. 

&lt;!--The paragraphs below were moved from the main 911 article and need to be integrated with the rest of this section. --&gt;
In 1996, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) issued an order requiring wireless carriers to determine and transmit the location of callers who dial 911. The FCC set up a phased program: Phase I involved sending the location of the receiving antenna for 911 calls, while Phase II sends the location of the calling telephone. Carriers were allowed to choose to implement 'handset based' location by Global Positioning System ([[GPS]]) or similar technology in each phone, or 'network based' location by means of [[triangulation]] between cell [[tower]]s. The order set technical and accuracy requirements: carriers using 'handset based' technology must report handset location within 50 meters for 67% of calls, and within 150 meters for 90% of calls; carriers using 'network based' technology must report location within 100 meters for 67% of calls and 300 meters for 90% of calls.

The order also laid out milestones for implementing wireless location services. Many carriers requested [[waiver]]s of the milestones, and the FCC granted many of them. By mid-2005, implementation of Phase II was generally underway, limited by the complexity of coordination required from wireless and wireline carriers, PSAPs, and other affected [[government agencies]]; and by the limited funding available to local agencies which needed to convert PSAP equipment to display location data (usually on [[Digital mapping|computerized map]]s).

In July 2011, the FCC announced a proposed rule requiring that after an eight-year implementation period, at some yet-to-be-determined date in 2019, wireless carriers will be required to meet more stringent location accuracy requirements.  If enacted, this rule would require both "handset based" and "network based" location techniques to meet the same accuracy standard, regardless of the underlying technology used. The rule is likely to have no effect as all major carriers will have already achieved over 85% GPS chipset penetration, and are thus able to meet the standard regardless of their 'network based' location capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-107A1.pdf|title=FCC 11-107, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
In 2009, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] required implementation of Phase II Stage 1 for wireless carrier by 1 February 2010, in areas that provide landline E911.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-40.htm|title=Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2009-40|date=2009-02-02|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=2013-02-20|quote=All wireless service providers are to complete their respective implementation of wireless Phase II Stage 1 E9-1-1 service by 1 February 2010, wherever wireline E9-1-1 service is available across Canada.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Canadians now have access to Phase II service.&lt;ref&gt;See also the third and fourth paragraphs of [http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1791514-If-I-call-9-1-1-and-if-geolocation-succeeds-does-Mobi-send-latitude-longitude-info#post15064413]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)==
The final destination of an E911 call (where the 911 operator sits) is a [[Public-safety answering point|Public Safety Answering Point]] (PSAP). There may be multiple PSAPs within the same [[telephone exchange|exchange]] or one PSAP may cover multiple exchanges. The territories (Emergency Service Zone) covered by a single PSAP is based on the dispatch and response arrangements for the fire, police, and medical services for a particular area. All primary PSAPs have a regional Emergency Service Number (ESN), a number identifying the PSAP.

The Caller Location Information (CLI) provided is normally integrated into [[dispatch (logistics)|emergency dispatch]] center's [[computer-assisted dispatch]] (CAD) system.  Early CAD systems provided text display of the caller's address, call history and available emergency response resources.  In 1994, working in cooperation with the emergency response agencies of Covington, KY, 911 Mapping Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.911mapping.com/web/index.html|title=911 Mapping Systems, Inc|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=911mapping.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323213607/http://www.911mapping.com/web/index.html|archivedate=2006-03-23|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1992 by Robert Graham Thomas Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/12/25/loc_otherobit25.html |title=Obituary: Robert Thomas Jr., 911 Mapping CEO |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=2002-12-25 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented the first real-time on-screen E911 street map display to highlight the caller's position, nearest available emergency responders and other relevant information such as fire hydrants, hazardous materials and/or other data maintained by the city.  Shortly thereafter, integrated mapping became a standard and integral part of all CAD systems and continues to evolve alongside 911 response technology.  For Wireline E911, the location is an address. For Wireless E911, the location is a coordinate. Not all PSAPs have the Wireless and Wireline systems integrated.

===Interconnection details===
Each telephone company ([[local exchange carrier]], or LEC) has at least two redundant [[Digital Signal 0|DS0]]-level (that is, 64 kbit/s, or voice quality) trunks connecting each host office [[telephone switch]] to each call center.  These trunks are either directly connected to the call center or they are connected to a telephone company central switch that intelligently distributes calls to the PSAPs. These special switches are often known as 911 Selective Routers. Their use is becoming increasingly more common as it simplifies the interconnection between newer ISUP/SS7-based host office switches and the many older PSAP systems.

If the PSAP receives calls from the telephone company on older analog trunks, they are usually [[Pulse dialing|Pulse driven]] circuits. These circuits are similar to [[Plain old telephone service|traditional telephone lines]], but are formatted to pass the calling party's number ([[Automatic Number Identification]], ANI). For historical reasons, the PSAP will refer to these as CAMA circuits even though [[Centralized Automatic Message Accounting]] (CAMA) is actually a reference to the call log.

If the PSAP receives calls on older-style digital trunks, they are specially formatted [[Multi-Frequency]] (MF) trunks that pass the calling party's number (ANI) only. Some of the upgraded PSAPs can receive calls on [[ISDN User Part|ISUP]] trunks controlled by the [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] protocol. In that case, the calling party's number (ANI) is already present in the SS7 setup message.  The Charge Number Parameter contains the ANI.

==VoIP enhanced 911==
VoIP enhanced 911 pertains to communications originating from various commercial services provided by companies that send telephone calls across the commercial internet using specialized devices and software applications.

As [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) technology matured, service providers began to interconnect VoIP with the [[public telephone network]] and marketed the VoIP service as a cheap replacement phone service.  However, E911 regulations and legal penalties have severely hampered the more widespread adoption of VoIP: VoIP is much more flexible than land line phone service and there is no easy way to verify the physical location of a caller on a nomadic VoIP network at any given time (especially in the case of wireless networks), and so many providers offered services which specifically excluded 911 service so as to avoid the severe E-911 non-compliance penalties.  VoIP services tried to improvise, such as routing 911 calls to the administrative phone number of the Public Safety Answering Point, adding on software to track phone locations, etc. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The [[Location Information Server]] is a service that is provided by an [[access network]] provider to provide [[location information]] to users of the network.  To do this, it uses knowledge of [[network topology]] and a range of location determination techniques to locate devices that are attached to the network.  The precise methods that are used to determine location are dependent on the type of access network and the information that can be obtained from the device.

Initially, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) took a hands-off approach to VoIP in order to let the service mature, and also to facilitate competition in the telephony market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In time, this problem reached the headlines of newspapers as individuals were unable to place emergency calls with their [[VoIP phone]]s.  In March 2005, Texas Attorney General [[Greg Abbott]] filed a lawsuit against Vonage for deceptive marketing practices by not making it clear that VoIP users had to actually sign up for E911 service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=850 |title=Attorney General Abbott Takes Legal Action To Protect Internet Phone Customers|author=OAG |publisher=OAG.state.tx.us |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FCC Chair Kevin Martin replaced FCC Chair Michael Powell, he immediately changed FCC's hand's off policy and moved to impose 911 obligations on VoIP service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060725/1216203.shtml |title=Why Does the FCC Treat VoIP as the Ugly Duckling, Techdirt July 25, 2006 |publisher=Techdirt.com |date=2006-07-25 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Chair Martin moved FCC to require "interconnected VoIP services" to begin to provide 911 service and provide notice to their consumers concerning the 911 limitations. The FCC announced that customers must respond to the E911 VoIP warning and those who do not have their service cut off on August 30, 2005. The FCC extended the deadline to September 28, 2005.&lt;ref name=gross/&gt; The E911 hookup may be directly with the Wireline E911 Network, indirectly through a third party such as a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), or by any other technical means.  The FCC explained that they felt compelled to issue this mandate because of the public safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-116A1.pdf |title=IP-Enabled Services : E911 Requirements for IP-Enabled Service Providers  |format=PDF |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vonage co-founder [[Jeff Pulver]] opined that this was an attempt by FCC Chair Martin to hinder telephony competition to [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/005082.html |first=Jeff |last=Pulver |title=A Little Rant on the Ongoing Mis-application of CALEA and E911 and Universal Service on Voice Applications and Some Ironic, Illogical Results |publisher=Jeff Pulver Blog |date=July 24, 2006 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309014504/http://pulverblog.pulver.com/archives/005082.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 911 obligations were imposed only on "interconnected VoIP."  The FCC defined "interconnected VoIP" as VoIP over broadband that interconnects with the public switch telephone network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannon |first=Robert |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/voip/definition.htm#int |title=VoIP Definition :: FCC :: Interconnected VoIP :: CFR |publisher=Cybertelecom.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VoIP that is not interconnected, such as two individuals talking to each other over the Internet while playing computer games, does not fall under the obligation.

There are, however, complicated technological problems with implementing E911 with VoIP, which providers are attempting to solve. VoIP phones are on the Internet and nomadic; the [[geolocation]] of the individual placing the 911 call can be very difficult to determine. Service providers are attempting to phase in solutions through the I1, I2, and I3 phases.  During I1, the 911 call was routed to the 911 administrative telephone lines without location information.  During I2, VoIP services would participate in the public telephone networks location database for the location that is identified with that telephone number.  During the I3 solution, VoIP service providers would have a true IP interconnection with Public Safety Answering Points and would be able to provide even more valuable information than the legacy 911 system.  Where VoIP phones are mobile, geolocation has additional problems; VoIP service providers are seeking access to [[Home Location Register#Home location register (HLR)|mobile phone location databases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intrado.com/assets/documents/Annual_2004_NENA_Conf_VoIPforPSAP_final.pdf |title=Intrado Evolution of the PSAP Experience  - Slide 0 |first=Bob |last=Currier| format=PDF |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrado.com/assets/documents/PSAP%20Issues%20Whitepaper.pdf |title=Intrado Next Generation Needs |format=PDF |date = May 2004|last=Meer |first=Stephen |last2=Nelson |first2=Michael |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intrado.com/assets/documents/VoIP%20with%20background.pdf |title=Intrado Emergency Calling Services |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions are being developed through the cooperation of the Voice on the Network Coalition and the [[National Emergency Number Association]]. [[Vonage]] has encouraged its customers to register the locations from which their 911 calls could be dialed with the local public safety answering point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jonathan E. |last=Nuechterlein|first2= Philip J. |last2=Weiser |title= Digital Crossroads:  American Telecommunications Policy in the Internet Age |year=2005 |page=222 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZPgvnoVNMkC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC had continued to add more requirements and mandate a more sophisticated 911 function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nena9-1-1.org/VoIP_IP/VONCoalition9-1-1whitepaper0105.pdf |title=Answering the Call for 911 Emergency Services in an Internet World |author= |date = January 2005|publisher=Voice on the Net Coalition |page=4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123043804/http://www.nena9-1-1.org/VoIP_IP/VONCoalition9-1-1whitepaper0105.pdf |archivedate=2005-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VoIP services have noted an obstacle to full 911 interconnection; in order to interconnect with the Public Safety Answering Point, the VoIP service providers must interconnect with the 911 telephone trunk, which is owned and controlled by their competitors, the traditional fixed-line telephone carriers.&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0,aid,122322,pg,1,RSS,RSS,00.asp |first=Grant |last=Gross |title=FCC extends VoIP E911 deadline |publisher=PCWorld.com |date=August 26, 2005 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222003957/http://www.pcworld.com/resource/article/0%2Caid%2C122322%2Cpg%2C1%2CRSS%2CRSS%2C00.asp |archivedate=February 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 which granted interconnection rights to interconnected VoIP services.&lt;ref name=cybertelecom&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/voip/911reg.htm |title=VoIP :: 911 :: Regulation |publisher=Cybertelecom.org}} Information on NET Act and FCC proceeding implementing legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the E911 challenges inherent to IP phone systems, specialized technology has been developed to locate callers in the case of emergency. Some of these new technologies allow the caller to be located down to the specific office on a particular floor of a building. These solutions support a wide range of organizations with IP telephony networks. The solutions are available for service providers offering hosted [[IP-PBX]] and residential VoIP services. This increasingly important segment in IP phone technology includes E911 call routing services and automated phone tracking appliances. Many of these solutions have been established according to FCC, CRTC, and NENA i2 standards, in order to help enterprises and service providers reduce liability concerns and meet E911 regulations.&lt;ref name="Emergency Gateway Datasheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.911enable.com/documents/pdf/emergency_gateway_datasheet.pdf |title=Emergency Gateway Datasheet |publisher=911 Enable |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914042248/http://www1.911enable.com/documents/pdf/emergency_gateway_datasheet.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there have been numerous important developments in E911 solutions for IP phone technology. The more noteworthy of these developments include:
*On-site appliances that automate and simplify E911 management for enterprise IP-PBX systems, reducing administration, ensuring that IP phone locations are always up to date, thus helping enterprises meet their E911 obligations;
*IP phone tracking that automatically assigns locations to IP hard phones, soft phones and wireless phones as they move on the corporate network using layer 2, layer 3, or wireless LAN discovery.
*Support for remote employees, allowing off-campus users and teleworkers to update their locations in real time directly from their IP phones;
*Support for phone mobility, to ensure accurate E911 services for employees that move IP phones between locations, share line appearances between multiple devices, and log into IP phones on the fly;
*Security desk routing and notification functionalities that deliver 911 calls and custom email alerts to on-site security personnel, notifying them of the emergency and providing them with the caller’s precise location information;
*Advanced E911 call management and reporting features, such as misdial protection and call recording, to improve solution performance and administration.

VoIP &amp; 911 issues are also relevant to [[Telecom Relay Services]] utilized by individuals with disabilities.

==Multi-line Telephone System==
Multi-line Telephone System (MLTS) pertains to the location of callers dialing 911 from within the private telecommunications networks used by large organizations. A Multi-line Telephone System (MLTS), often referred to as a [[private branch exchange]], is a telecommunications switching system used by large organizations to process calls between employees within the organization and with parties external to the organization. An MLTS may serve a single building, segments of multi-tenant buildings, a group of buildings on a campus or even a number of buildings separated by geography. New communications technologies are making it possible for single MLTS systems to serve locations at far distant places that may span multiple governmental jurisdictions even distant countries.

The challenge of Enhanced 911 for the MLTS is that information about the location of callers is only available to the extent that the private organization discloses the information.  For the organization the challenges of collecting and reporting the information can be significant. Today’s highly mobile work forces and technologies that allow users to relocate without the intervention of an administrator place significant responsibilities on the MLTS owner or operator.

Recent legislation, rules, and regulations in numerous US government jurisdictions have established the burden upon the enterprise style organization to provide accurate location information so that the ALI database may be updated and the processes used by public safety agencies can function properly when an emergency call originates from within a MLTS system.

The member driven volunteer organization that represents the people who staff the PSAPs, the [[National Emergency Number Association]] (NENA.org), has done significant work advocating on the subject of MLTS E911. It is an important contemporary issue of growing concern as enterprise style organizations employ new technologies to create vast private networks that interconnect with the PSTN in ways that do not map to the logic used to locate callers in the Public Enhanced 911 system.  The risks to people who initiate a 911 call from and MLTS who are not physically located within the jurisdiction of the agency to which the 911 call is routed and the increasing burdens of misdirected 911 calls upon those agencies is escalating.

==Address signage standards==
In addition to upgrading communications systems, most counties and communities in the United States have established ordinances (e.g. IRC section [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053121/http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/irc/2012/icod_irc_2012_3_par250.htm R319.1]) requiring property owners to standardize the display of house numbers on buildings and along streets and roadways, to allow emergency personnel to more easily identify a given address day or night, even in poor weather. These are normally composed of reflective characters, at least 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches high, on a contrasting reflective background. It is necessary for the address number to be affixed to the building or to a separate structure such as a post, wall, fence, or mailbox, provided that such separate structure is located in front of the building and on the building's side of the street. Compliant signage systems are often advertised as being "E911 compliant".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

[[File:IOM ET GENI LOCI.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Votive inscription to [[:en:Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] and the ''Genius loci'' by the [[Signifer]] of [[Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix]] on behalf himself and his own legion during the consulate of Maternus and Atticus (185 AD)]]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|classical Roman religion]], a '''''[[genius (mythology)|genius]] loci''''' ([[plural]] ''genii loci'') was the protective spirit of a place. It was often depicted in religious iconography as a figure holding attributes such as a [[cornucopia]], [[patera]] ([[libation]] bowl) or [[Serpent (symbolism)|snake]]. Many Roman altars found throughout the [[Western Roman Empire]] were dedicated to a particular ''genius locus''. The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman imperial cults of the Emperor]] and the imperial house developed in part in connections with the sacrifices made by neighborhood associations ''([[vicus|vici]])'' to the local ''genius''. These 265 local districts&lt;ref&gt;Number is for the city of Rome, cf. Plin. ''Nat. Hist.'' III, 66&lt;/ref&gt; had their cult organised around the ''Lares Compitales'' (guardian spirits or ''[[lares]]'' of the crossroads), which the emperor [[Augustus]] transformed into ''Lares Augusti'' along with the ''Genius Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Greg. (2008). "Divinity and Power in Ancient Rome" in ''Religion and Power: Divine Kingship in the Ancient World and Beyond''. Nicole Brisch (ed.)(Oriental Institute Seminars No. 4), Chicago: The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor's ''genius'' is then regarded as the ''genius loci'' of the [[Roman Empire]] as a whole.

Roman examples of these Genii can be found, for example, at the [[Church (building)|church]] of St. Giles, [[Tockenham]], Wiltshire where the genius locus is depicted as a relief in the wall of a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] church built of [[Roman Britain|Roman]] material. This shows "a youthful and curly-haired Roman Genius worked in high relief, holding a cornucopia in his left hand and a ''patera'' in his right", which previously has been "erroneously identified as [[Asclepius]]".&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, J. M. C. (1978). "Two Romano-British Genii", in ''Britannia'', Vol. 9, p. 330. London: Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asian usage==
The [[numen|numinous spirits]] of places in Asia are still honored today in [[Lak Mueang|city pillar shrine]]s, outdoor [[spirit house]]s and indoor [[Shrine#Household shrines|household and business shrine]]s.

==Western usage==

In contemporary usage, ''genius loci'' usually refers to a location's distinctive atmosphere, or a "[[spirit of place]]", rather than necessarily a guardian spirit. An example of contemporary usage might be along the lines of "Light reveals the genius loci of a place."

==Art and architecture==
[[Alexander Pope]] made the Genius Loci an important principle in [[garden]] and landscape design with the following lines from ''Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Consult the genius of the place in all;
That tells the waters or to rise, or fall;
Or helps th' ambitious hill the heav'ns to scale,
Or scoops in circling theatres the vale;
Calls in the country, catches opening glades,
Joins willing woods, and varies shades from shades,
Now breaks, or now directs, th' intending lines;
Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pope's verse laid the foundation for one of the most widely agreed principles of [[landscape architecture]]. This is the principle that landscape designs should ''always'' be adapted to the context in which they are located.

[[A priori and a posteriori|A priori]], [[archetype]], and ''genius loci'' are the primary principals of Neo-Rationalism or New Rationalism. Pioneered by the Italian architect [[Aldo Rossi]], Neo-Rationalism developed in the light of a re-evaluation of the work of [[Giuseppe Terragni]], and gained momentum through the work of [[Giorgio Grassi]]. Characterized by elemental [[vernacular]] forms and an adaptation to the existing environment, the Neo-Rationalist style has adherents beyond architecture in the greater world of art.

In the context of modern architectural theory, ''genius loci'' has profound implications for place-making, falling within the philosophical branch of "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]". This field of architectural discourse is explored most notably by the theorist [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] in his book, ''Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture''.

==Modern fantasy==
In modern works of [[fantasy]], such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' or ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', a genius loci is an intelligent [[spirit]] or [[Magic (fantasy)|magical]] power that resides in a place. Very few genius loci of this form are able to move from their native area, either because they are "part of the land" or because they are bound to it. Genius loci are usually portrayed as being extremely powerful and usually also very intelligent, though there is a great deal of variability on these points. Some versions are nearly omnipotent and omniscient inside the area they inhabit, while others are simply vast, semi-sentient wellsprings of magical energy. This power almost never extends beyond the border of the genius loci.

Different settings give different explanations for the existence of genius loci. In most cases, however, the intelligent, magical entity simply develops from the similarly named "spirit of place" over a great deal of time. In other settings, genius loci are formed by powerful magical events, and in others they are the results of [[ley lines]], [[Mana#Mana in fantasy|mana pools]], or an equivalent.
&lt;!--
Note to any future editors: I don't have the expertise required to correctly comment this, so I'm going to leave it with the "citations needed" flag and simply list here a few probable good sources. These were my primary sources while writing this, but I've encountered genius loci in a number of other works (mostly short stories by various authors, although they're occasionally the monster of the week in epic fantasy novels).

Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 epic level handbook
''Turn Coat'': book 11 of ''The Dresden Files''

Most high fantasy settings that use a more literal hot-and-cold-running-mana system, as described in Niven's works, also sometimes feature intelligent mana pools. These share many similarities with genius loci even though they're not named as such. I haven't found any really good similar term/page for these (there isn't a mana pool page? Might have to create that), and I tend to conflate them anyway, so I've stuck a reference to intelligent mana pools in there.

[[Image:AmériqueMéridionaleaugmenté.JPG|thumb|Map of South America. (1750) Geograph: Robert de Vaugondy.]]
[[Image:Sunset over Western South America.jpg|thumb|The [[Terminator (solar)|terminator]] s visible in this panoramic view across central South America.]]
The '''geography of South America''' contains many diverse regions and climates. Geographically, [[South America]] is generally considered a [[continent]] forming the southern portion of the [[landmass]] of the [[Americas]], south and east of the [[Panama]]–[[Colombia]] border by most authorities, or south and east of the [[Panama Canal]] by some. South and North America are sometimes considered a single continent or [[supercontinent]], while constituent [[subregion|regions]] are infrequently considered [[subcontinent]]s.

South America became attached to North America only recently (geologically speaking) with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama some 3 million years ago, which resulted in the [[Great American Interchange]]. The [[Andes]], likewise a comparatively young and seismically restless mountain range, runs down the western edge of the continent; the land to the east of the northern Andes is largely tropical [[rain forest]], the vast [[Amazon River]] basin. The continent also contains drier regions such as eastern [[Patagonia]] and the extremely arid [[Atacama]] desert.

The South American continent also includes various [[island]]s, most of which belong to countries on the continent. The [[Caribbean]] territories are grouped with North America. The South American nations that border the Caribbean Sea—including [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]]—are also known as [[Caribbean South America]].

==Topography and geology==
The geographical structure of South  America is deceptively simple for a continent-sized landmass. The continent's topography is often likened to a huge bowl owing to its flat interior almost ringed by high [[mountain]]s. With the exception of narrow coastal plains on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s, there are three main topographic features: the [[Andes]], a central lowland, and the extensive [[Brazilian Highlands|Brazilian]] and [[Guiana Highlands]] in the east.

The Andes are a Cenozoic mountain range formed (and still forming)  [[Altiplano]] and a number of major valleys such as the [[Rio Magdalena]]. These contain three of the world's highest capitals: [[Bogotá]], [[Quito]] and highest of all, [[La Paz, Bolivia]]. The southern Andes have been eroded by the [[Patagonian Ice Sheet]] and are much lower and narrower. There are a number of large [[glacier]]s in the northern part, but from latitude [[19th parallel south|19°S]] to [[27th parallel south|28°S]] the climate is so arid that no permanent ice can form even on the highest peaks. [[Permafrost]], however, is widespread in this section of the Altiplano and continuous above {{convert|5600|m|ft|0}}.

The climate of the coastal belt west of the Andes shows violent contrasts, including two of the world's wettest regions in the Colombian [[Department of Chocó|Chocó]] and southern Chile, and the world's driest desert, the [[Atacama]]. This dry area is cooled by the [[Humboldt Current]] and [[upwelling]], giving rise to the largest fisheries in the world. There are two small transition zones between the perhumid and perarid regions: around [[Guayaquil]] with summer rain, and the [[Mediterranean climate]] region of central Chile. Both these regions have highly erratic rainfall strongly influenced by [[El Niño]] events, which bring major floods. In contrast, the high plateaux of the Andes are drier than normal during El Niño episodes.

The very fertile soils from the erosion of the Andes formed the basis for the continent's only pre-Columbian state [[civilization]]s: those of the [[Inca Empire]] and its predecessors ([[Chavín]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]], etc.). The area is still a major agricultural region. The Altiplano contains many rare minerals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[mercury (element)|mercury ore]]. The Atacama is mined for its [[nitrate]]s. Peru east of the Andes is regarded as the most important [[biodiversity]] hotspot in the world with its unique forests that form the western edge of the world's largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].

East of the Andes is a large lowland drained by a small number of rivers, including the two largest in the world by drainage area—the [[Amazon River]] and the more southerly [[Paraná River]]. The other major river of this central lowland is the [[Orinoco River]], which has a [[Casiquiare canal|natural channel]] linking it with the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southamerica.zoom-maps.com/ South America physical map]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this central lowland is sparsely populated because the soils are heavily leached, but in the south is the very fertile [[pampas]] of Argentina—one of the world's major food-producing regions where wheat and [[beef cattle]] are pre-eminent. The natural vegetation of the northern lowlands are either [[savanna]] in the northern ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]]'' and southern ''[[wikt:campo#Spanish|campos]]'', or tropical rainforest throughout most of the Amazon basin. Efforts to develop agriculture, outside of fertile floodplains of rivers descending from the Andes, have been largely failures because of the soils. Cattle have long been raised in the ''llanos'' of northern Colombia and Venezuela, but [[petroleum]] is now the dominant industry in the northern lowlands, making Venezuela the richest country in the continent.

The eastern highlands are much older than the Andes, being pre-Cambrian in origin, but are still rugged in places, especially in the wet [[tepui]]s of Venezuela, Guyana and [[Roraima]]. The Amazon River has cut a large valley through a former highland, and to the east is a relatively low plateau comprising the [[Nordeste]] and [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] regions of Brazil. In the north of this region is the arid ''[[sertão]]'', a poor region consistently affected by extremely erratic rainfall, and the humid ''[[zona da mata]]'', once home of the unique [[Atlantic Rainforest]] with many species not found in the Amazon, and now a centre for [[sugarcane]]. Further south, the main land use is [[coffee]], while [[São Paulo]] is the economic heart of the continent with its industry.

South of about [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], the highlands fade out to low plains in Uruguay.

East of the Andes in Argentina, there are a number of rugged, generally dry "islands", the highest of which is the Sierra de Cordoba near the city of that name. Argentine Patagonia is a [[Paleozoic]] plateau now heavily dissected by rivers flowing from the Andes.

As part of the [[Hadley circulation|Hadley]] model of atmospheric circulation, the equator is characterised by the ascending branches of separate [[meridional]] cells, driven by intense [[insolation]].&lt;ref name="Sylvestre2009"&gt;Sylvestre, F. (2009). Moisture Pattern During the Last Glacial Maximum in South America. Past Climate Variability in South America and Surrounding Regions: From the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene. F. Vimeux, F. Sylvestre and M. Khodri. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grodsky2003"&gt;Grodsky, S. A. and J. A. Carton (2003). "The intertropical convergence zone in the South Atlantic and the equatorial cold tongue". Journal of Climate 16(4): 723–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical [[convection]] draws in air from the surrounding atmosphere, known as the [[trade winds]]. As these inwards flows of air converge they reduce horizontal wind speed, and as they rise, they form [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The vertical convection also results in a net export of heat and freshwater from the lower atmosphere into the [[troposphere]]&lt;ref name="Sylvestre2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver2005"&gt;Oliver, J. E. (2005). Encyclopedia of World Climatology, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; This system is known as the [[ITCZ]]. The location of the ITCZ is centred on the areas of highest insolation, although it is more stationary over the oceans than landmasses.

In the Atlantic region, the ITCZ is clearly developed, and the spatial extent of the ITCZ reaches a minimum close to the [[equator]] during the boreal spring (March–May), while extending to a maximum of 10°–15°N in late [[boreal climate|boreal]] summer (August).&lt;ref name="Grodsky2003" /&gt; No comprehensive theory for ITCZ formation and spatial variation has been validated, although several hypotheses have been proposed. Some studies advance ideas that describe one or more atmospheric cells over the equator,&lt;ref name=Hastenrath1968&gt;Hastenrath, S. L. (1968). "On mean meridional circulations in the tropics". Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 25: 979–983.&lt;/ref&gt; while others state that the position of the ITCZ depends on [[Ekman transport|Ekman]] pumping efficiency and moisture availability.&lt;ref name=Charney71&gt;Charney, J. G. (1971). "Dynamical theory of formation of cloud bands in tropical oceans". Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 52(8): 778.&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever hypothesis best represents the natural system, it is clear that the dynamics of the ITCZ are influenced by several other external climate systems. These include continental convection and equatorially asymmetric sea surface temperature (SST) distribution. This asymmetry is evident in the northward bias of the ITCZ´s location, which is maintained by a positive [[feedback]] between wind speed, evaporation and SST.&lt;ref name=Xie1998&gt;Xie, S. P. and Y. Tanimoto (1998). "A pan-Atlantic decadal climate oscillation". Geophysical Research Letters 25(12): 2185–2188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the ITCZ has a global extent, South America is subject to its own unique climate patterns. which have been organised into the [[Monsoon|South American Monsoon System]] (SAMS). As an integrated component in the global climate system, the SAMS is influenced the Atlantic sector of the ITCZ, variability in the adjacent Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Andean and central-east Brazil topography, complex land surface processes and relations with land use change, and interactions involving [[topography]] and soil moisture.&lt;ref name=Marengo2010&gt;Marengo, J. A., B. Liebmann, et al. (2010). "Recent developments on the South American monsoon system". International Journal of Climatology: n/a–n/a.&lt;/ref&gt; The SAMS framework comprises several distinct subcomponents, which are discussed below:

*'''The Pacific and Atlantic subtropical high:''' These are semi-permanent high pressure systems caused by descending sectors of the equatorial Hadley cells. The air masses are relatively warm and dry, and move in an [[anticyclonic]] circulation pattern over the sub-tropical oceans. The Pacific High is generally stable, whereas the Atlantic High moves throughout the year. During the summer, it covers most of the midlatitude and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. During winter, it is smaller and moves to the east.
*'''The Gran Chaco thermal low:''' A semi-permanent thermal-[[orographic]] depression located over the slope extending from Chaco to the Los Andes mountain range in the Argentine Northwest. It can be considered, together with the Bolivian High, as the regional response of the tropospheric circulation to the strong convective heating over the Amazon–central Brazil. The Andes effect reinforces the strength of the Chaco Low as an orographic barrier.&lt;ref name=Vera2006&gt;Vera, C., J. Baez, et al. (2006). "The South American low-level jet experiment". Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 87(1): 63.&lt;/ref&gt; It is present throughout the year, but is more intense during the summer, with a strong thermal component caused by the combination of high insolation and dry surface conditions. The resulting pressure gradient between the south Atlantic subtropical high and the Chaco low forces the easterly winds over the Amazon basin to turn southward, being channelled between the eastern slope of the [[Andes]] and the Brazilian Plateau.&lt;ref name="Paegle2002"&gt;Paegle, J. N. and K. C. Mo (2002). "Linkages between summer rainfall variability over south America and sea surface temperature anomalies". Journal of Climate 15(12): 1389–1407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garreaud2009"&gt;Garreaud, R. D., M. Vuille, et al. (2009). "Present-day South American climate".  	Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 281(3-4): 180–195.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The [[South Atlantic Convergence Zone]] (SACZ):''' The SACZ controls rainfall in the southern subtropics and extends southeastward from the large continental convective zone of tropical South America. It is generated by moisture convergence between the South Atlantic high pressure zone and the continental thermal low pressure zone. The location of the SACZ is influenced by the topography in central-east Brazil Vera et al. (2006). The intensity of the SACZ is highest in austral summer, in phase with intensifying continental heating and convection. Weak SACZ is accompanied by enhanced rainfall over northern Argentina and southern Brazil. These positive rainfall anomalies are supported by a strong  southward moisture flux at about 35°S–60°W that shifts eastward to about 40°W for the opposite phase of the seesaw, in accordance with an eastward displacement of the Atlantic high. An intensified SACZ is associated with enhanced streamflows to the north and diminished flows to the south.&lt;ref name="Robertson2000"&gt;Robertson, A. W. and C. R. Mechoso (2000). "Interannual and interdecadal variability of the South Atlantic convergence zone". Monthly Weather Review 128(8): 2947–2957.&lt;/ref&gt; This north–south separation is probably related to the anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the tropical and subtropical South Atlantic that strengthens the low-level [[meridional]] temperature gradient, intensifying the South Atlantic High and consequently the trade-winds.
*'''Polar outbreaks:''' Polar outbreaks occur when cold dense polar air masses pass beneath warmer tropical air masses, significantly cooling subtropical South America. They occur as a result of [[anticyclogenesis]] in the Pacific subtropical high, which is constrained at a low level by the southern extent of the [[Andes]] mountain range. This leads to the formation of a slow-moving long wave that creates mountain-parallel, [[ageostrophic]] flow, causing incursions of high-latitude cold air. They generate an important drop in temperature and increase in pressure, resulting in regional precipitation for southern South America. These surges occur mainly during the winter but their impact on the precipitation is even greater during summer.&lt;ref name="Marengo2001"&gt;Marengo, J. and J. C. Rogers (2001). Polar Air Outbreaks in the Americas: Assessments and Impacts During Modern and Past Climates. Interhemispheric Climate Linkages. V. Markgraf, Academic Publishers: 31–51.
&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low Level Jet (LLJ):''' LLJs originate in a low pressure area over the northern Andes and provide moisture for subtropical latitudes. During summer, they operate as localised wind maximum within the lower 1–2&amp;nbsp;km of the atmosphere, channelled by the Andes, terminating in southeastern South America. They are controlled by Amazonian wind patterns, which are influenced and controlled by patterns of insolation. They transport large amounts of moisture from the Amazon basin to the monsoonal anitcyclone over Bolivia. A suppressed SACZ and increased convection in the sub-tropical plains is associated with a strengthening of the LLJ. These phases are linked to short-term extreme precipitation events in the plains of central Argentina. When the LLJ is weak, there is enhanced SACZ and suppressed convection to the south and extreme heat waves over the sub-tropical regions.&lt;ref name="Marengo2010" /&gt; It also generates turbulence through shear and participates actively as trigging mechanism for the formation of severe storm and Mesoscale Convective Systems over Paraguay, Northern Argentina and South of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Silva2009"&gt;Silva, G. A. M., T. Ambrizzi, et al. (2009). "Observational evidences on the modulation of the South American Low Level Jet east of the Andes according the ENSO variability". Annales Geophysicae 27(2): 645–657.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Westerlies:''' South America experiences [[Westerlies|westerly winds]] in the middle latitudes, caused by the [[Coriolis force]] and associated geostrophic circulation patterns. They are more intense than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts due to the lack of continental landmass in the Southern Hemisphere. They reach their maximum speed in the troposphere, where they form jetstreams. In particular, over the southern tip of South America and the adjacent south Pacific, the westerlies are strongest during austral summer, peaking between 45° and 55°S. During the austral winter, the [[jetstream]] moves into subtropical latitudes (its axis is at about 30°S) and the low-level westerlies expand equatorward but weaken, particularly at ~50°S.&lt;ref name="Garreaud2009" /&gt; The pressure gradients between the polar low-pressure belt and the Pacific high-pressure cell, combined with these westerlies, results in permanent anticyclogenesis. Northward penetration of atmospheric perturbations from the westerlies is possible when the southeast Pacific anticyclone is weakened or moves equatorward, allowing penetration of westerly storm tracks to latitudes as far north as 31◦S. In the Andes, winter rains reach further north. During summer, the Pacific anticyclone shifts southward, impeding the northward migration of the westerlies.&lt;ref name="Sylvestre2009" /&gt;
*'''The Bolivian High:''' large anticyclonic circulation centred near 15°S, 65°W. It has been explained as the response of diabatic local heating in the Amazon region.&lt;ref name="Marengo2010" /&gt; The SACZ has a strong influence on the position and intensity of the Bolivian High&lt;ref name="Vera2006" /&gt;
*The '''[[Madden–Julian oscillation]] (MJO):''' The MJO is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of both enhanced and suppressed tropical rainfall, observed mainly over the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. It is a source of intra-seasonal variability affecting South America that seems to be related to a combination of tropical circulation changes and midlatitude [[Rossby]] wave trains that propagate into South America.

The development of the SAMS during spring is characterised by a rapid southward shift of the convective region from northwestern South America to the highland region of the central Andes and to the southern Amazon basin. The South Atlantic High moves eastward, reflecting the pressure reduction over the continent and the intensity and direction of the zonal flow over the nearby tropics and sub-tropics. This change in flow direction is evident in changes to terrestrial windfields over extreme southwestern Amazonia, with winds changing from northerlies to northwesterlies, and over eastern Brazil, where the winds turn from easterlies to northeasterlies.&lt;ref name="Raia2008"&gt;Raia, A. and I. F. A. Cavalcanti (2008). "The Life Cycle of the South American Monsoon System". Journal of Climate 21(23): 6227–6246.&lt;/ref&gt; The southward moisture flux east of the Andes also increases, bringing humidity to central and southeast Brazil.

As the SAMS progresses a continental-scale [[gyre]] transports moisture westward from the tropical Atlantic Ocean to the Amazon basin and then southward toward the extratropics of South America.&lt;ref name="Vera2006" /&gt; The [[diabatic]] heating released in the SAMS region seems to promote that gyre, and the maintenance of the South Atlantic subtropical high during austral summer.&lt;ref name="Rodwell2001"&gt;Rodwell, M. J. and B. J. Hoskins (2001). "Subtropical anticyclones and summer monsoons", Journal of Climate 14(15): 3192–3211.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that is the subsidence over the cool SSTs of the eastern Pacific and extensive [[stratocumulus]] decks provide a radiative heat sink to the tropical atmosphere that can balance the [[adiabatic]] warming due to the monsoonal descent.

The decay phase of the monsoon begins between March and May, as convection shifts gradually northward toward the equator. During April and May, the low-level southward flow of moisture from the western Amazonia weakens, as more frequent incursions of drier and cooler air from the mid-latitudes begin to occur over the interior of subtropical South America.

'''Gerlovo''' or '''Gerilovo''' ({{lang-bg|Герлово, Герилово}}) is a small geographic and ethnographic region in [[Northern Bulgaria|Northern]] [[Bulgaria]], a hilly fertile [[valley]] in the northeastern [[Balkan Mountains]], south of the [[Ludogorie]] region. It lies between the Lisa, Preslav-Dragoevo and Kotel-Varbitsa mountains and covers much of [[Varbitsa (town)|Varbitsa]] municipality of [[Shumen Province]], with smaller parts in [[Omurtag (town)|Omurtag]] municipality ([[Targovishte Province]]) and [[Kotel, Bulgaria|Kotel]] municipality ([[Sliven Province]]). The main river is the [[Kamchiya]], which runs through the entire valley and forms the [[Ticha Reservoir]]; the only sizable town is Varbitsa. Four strategically important [[mountain pass]]es run through the region: the [[Preslav Pass]], [[Dervent Pass]], [[Kotel Pass]] and [[Varbitsa Pass]].

The population mostly consists of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Turks in Bulgaria|Turks]];[http://promacedonia.org/ki/ki_priturka.htm] there is an [[Alians|Alian]] community. 

[[Gerlovo Beach]] on [[Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula]] in [[Livingston Island]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Gerlovo region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136860 Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica:] Gerlovo Beach.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a history of notable [[hydroculture]] phenomena. Ancient hydroculture proposed sites, and modern revolutionary works are mentioned. Included in this history are all forms of aquatic and semi-aquatic based horticulture that focus on flora: [[Aquascaping|aquatic gardening]], semi-aquatic crop farming, [[hydroponics]], [[aquaponics]], [[passive hydroponics]], and modern [[aeroponics]].

==Hanging Gardens of Babylon==
[[File:BasoliAntonio StageSet1 Meyerbeer Semiramide.jpg|right|225px]]
{{Main|Hanging Gardens of Babylon}}
One of the wonders of the ancient world was irrigated by the Euphrates River. It is uncertain if [[Semiramis|Sammu-ramat]] or [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ordered them to be built between 8th and 7th century BC Babylonia. The gardens were built partially on top of ziggurats, and plants were irrigated on channels. No direct evidence of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] exists. However, there is archeological evidence, uncovered by [[Robert Koldewey]], that ancient structures exist to support the technology used for these gardens. Ancient Greeks [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]] have noted the Hanging Babylonian Gardens.&lt;ref name="Babylon"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Hanging Gardens of Babylon | encyclopedia=Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc | editor=University of Chicago | year=1993 | volume=5 | edition=15 | location=Chicago | pages=681–682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precolonial America==
{{Main|Chinampa}}
[[File:ChinampaScaleModel.JPG|thumb]]
A [[Chinampa]] is a floating garden armada in a lake from the Xochimilco region, once Chinampan, of Mexico. This floating garden, still in use, can have an area of up to 10 meters by 200 meters.&lt;ref name="Chinampa"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Chinampa | encyclopedia=Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc | editor=University of Chicago | year=1993 | volume=3 | edition=15 | location=Chicago | pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agricultural output of the chinampa allowed the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic period|postclassic]] Aztec civilization to flourish.

==Historical Orient==
Historically, fish have been raised within flooded rice fields in Indochina and China.&lt;ref name="mcmurtry1988"&gt;McMurtry, M. R., Nelson, P.V., &amp; Sanders, D.C. (1988).

==Living root bridges==

There are 500-year-old bridges made by living roots in India, sculpted by the [[Khasi people|War-Khasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/09/living-bridges-india-grown-500-years-pics.php |title=Living Bridges in India Have Grown for 500 Years (Pics) |publisher= [[TreeHugger]], New York |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trees span rivers, and may be limited in connectivity to hydroculture.

[[Orchids]] are well known for their aerial roots.

Ōhi'a Lehua, [[Metrosideros polymorpha]], is a Hawaiian plant with roots that can grow suspended in extinct lava tubes. The roots of this plant are able to penetrate deep into the volcanic rock, to reach these hollow tubes, where they can collect moisture.&lt;ref name="DscAtlas"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Hawaii | series=Atlas 4D | credits=Cambell Scott, David Allen, Mike Slee, Paul Spillenger | network=Discovery | location=USA | airdate=August 2010 | season=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:FK''' is the entry for the [[Falkland Islands]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently no ISO 3166-2 codes are defined in the entry for the Falkland Islands. The territory has no defined subdivisions.

The Falkland Islands are officially assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code {{mono|FK}}.

'''ISO 3166-2:GB''' is the entry for the [[United Kingdom]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]]. The codes and structures used are provided to the ISO by [[British Standards]] and the [[Office for National Statistics]].

Currently for the United Kingdom, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for the following subdivisions:
* [[Countries of the United Kingdom|3 countries and 1 province]]
* 3 nations (see below)
* [[non-metropolitan counties|27 two-tier counties]], [[metropolitan boroughs|36 metropolitan districts]], [[unitary authorities of England|56 unitary authorities]] (includes six single-tier counties), [[London boroughs|32 London boroughs]] and [[City of London|1 city corporation]] (England)
* [[Local government in Northern Ireland|11 districts]] (Northern Ireland)
* [[council areas of Scotland|32 council areas]] (Scotland)
* [[principal areas of Wales|22 unitary authorities]] (Wales)

The four [[countries of the United Kingdom|constituent parts of the United Kingdom]] are described as either "country" (England, Wales and Scotland) or "province" (Northern Ireland). Three other geopolitical terms are included in the standard and designated "nations" (formerly "included for completeness"):
* [[England and Wales]] (consisting of England and Wales)
* [[Great Britain]] (consisting of England, Scotland, and Wales)
* United Kingdom (consisting of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales)

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GB}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of the United Kingdom. The second part is three letters, which is the [[British Standards|British Standard]] BS 6879 three-letter code of the subdivision.

Though {{mono|GB}} is the United Kingdom's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, {{mono|UK}} is [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2#Exceptional reservations|exceptionally reserved]] for the United Kingdom on the request of the country. Its main usage is the [[.uk]] internet [[country code top-level domain|ccTLD]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

BS 6879 gives alternative name forms in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (cy) for some of the Welsh unitary authorities (together with alternative code elements). Since this part of ISO 3166 does not allow for duplicate coding of identical subdivisions, such alternative names in Welsh and code elements are shown for information purposes only in square brackets after the [[English language|English]] name of the subdivision.

'''McDonald's Corporation''' ({{nyse|MCD}}) is the world's largest chain of [[fast food]] restaurants, serving around 68 million customers daily in 119 countries.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/McDonald-Momentum-Delivers-prnews-2702110553.html?x=0 |title=McDonald's Momentum Delivers Another Year of Strong Results for 2011 |publisher=Yahoo Finance |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-01-25 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burgerbusiness.com/?p=9168 |title=McDonald’s Answers the Doubters |publisher=BurgerBusiness |date=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McDonald's]] traces its origins to a 1940 restaurant in [[San Bernardino, California]]. After expanding within the United States, McDonald's became an international corporation in 1967, when it opened a location in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond, Canada]]. By the end of the 1970s, McDonald's restaurants existed in five of the Earth's seven continents; an African location came in 1992 in Cape Town, South Africa.

In order to cater to local tastes and [[Cuisine|culinary traditions]], and often in respect of particular laws or religious beliefs, McDonald's offers regionalized versions of its [[McDonald's products|menu]] among and within different countries. As a result, [[List of McDonald's products|products]] found in one country or region may not be found in McDonald's restaurants in other countries.

==Africa==
===Egypt===
In 2001, McDonald's introduced the [[Falafel|McFalafel]] sandwich in its Egypt locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/news/mcdonald-s-mcfalafel-a-hit-egyptians/15353/|accessdate=2 August 2012|newspaper=Advertising Age|date=19 June 2001|title=McDonald's McFalafel a hit with Egyptians}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restaurants also offer a Chicken [[Big Mac]] and Fish Mac, variations on the standard Big Mac which substitute breaded chicken or fish, respectively, for the usual beef patties. In the summer of 2008, McDonald's introduced fish fingers with tartar dipping sauce as a side in Egyptian restaurants. Early 2010 saw the introduction of Egyptian cookies to the [[Cairo]] location. Egypt has almost 70 locations throughout the country.

===Morocco===
The [[McArabia]], a grilled chicken sandwich from [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/oman/en/product_nutrition_details.A%20la%20Carte.12.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|title=McArabia Chicken|publisher=McDonald's}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a product called the McSahara was briefly sold. In late 2006, the Chicken Mythic, ''Petit Plaisirs'' ("small pleasures," a sandwich usually made from chicken or beef), and a 280-gram Recette Moutarde ("mustard burger") were released. During the [[Islam]]ic holy month of [[Ramadan]], a special menu is offered for the breaking of the fast, including local specialties such as dates, milk, and [[harira]].

==Asia==
&lt;!---please do not again take out countries for a region called "Middle East". It is NOT a continent and erodes the spatial integrity of both Africa and Asia. Inserting it between the continents is POV and OR.---&gt;

===Bahrain===
As in all McDonald's locations in the Islamic Middle East, food in Bahraini locations is [[halal]].&lt;ref name=halal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/bahrain/en/the_truth/see_what_we_are_made_of/halal.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128082940/http://www.mcdonaldsarabia.com/bahrain/en/the_truth/see_what_we_are_made_of/halal.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2013|accessdate=3 August 2012|publisher=McDonaldsArabia|title=McDonald's commitment to halal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the McArabia, Bahraini locations offer, beginning in March 2009, the McCrispy, a meal consisting of up to three chicken fingers with a choice of barbecue, sweet and sour, or garlic sauce.

=== China ===
[[File:McDonald's Chinese New Year set meal.jpg|thumb|150px|McDonald's [[Chinese New Year]] meal, grilled chicken sandwich and twisted French fries. Tray liner has an image of the [[Chinese zodiac]].]]
In China, [[Chicken McNuggets]] can come with the traditional barbecue, sweet and sour, honey and hot mustard sauces; or even a special chili garlic sauce, which is popular in China. Chinese menus also include crispy Buffalo chicken wings, called McWings. All chicken burgers offered in Chinese McDonald's use thigh fillet (e.g., Premium Grilled Thigh Fillet Burger, Hot and Spicy Grilled Thigh Fillet Burger), rather than breast meat, which is preferred in [[Western world|western countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-05-29/news/31890938_1_mcdonalds-hong-kong-china|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=29 May 2012|title=McDonald's in China serves 'Prosperity Burger'|first=Afp|last=Relaxnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unique ice cream flavors such as Matcha Green Tea ice cream is available.
Pies come in two standard flavors: pineapple or taro, although special flavors including chocolate, apple, banana, and azuki bean have also been offered on a limited basis.

There is a seasonal [[Chinese New Year]] meal available, including the Grilled Chicken Burger and curly fries, with a [[horoscope]] of the twelve zodiac animals of [[Chinese astrology]] and traditional red packets (''[[Red envelope|lai see]]'').

A unique feature of Chinese McDonald's locations is the "McExpress" walk-up window, which sells a small range of drinks and ice cream desserts. Most McExpress windows are attached to restaurants, but in some cases, they can be physically independent, typically in locations such as shopping malls, department stores and subway stations. Most major urban locations offer delivery for an extra fee. Deliveries are usually made by electrically powered scooters, although in several cities where motorcycle bans are in place, a conventional courier bicycle is used. The food is normally carried in a large insulated backpack.

====Hong Kong====
Hong Kong hosts some of the world's busiest McDonald's with many operating 24 hours a day. Breakfasts include pasta soups with sausage or chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2011/10/twisty-pasta-breakfast-hong-kong.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Twisty Pasta Breakfast – Hong Kong – Various Dates |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations offer cups of corn as substitutes for French fries or à la carte. Desserts include soft serve ice cream in azuki bean and mung bean flavors; pineapple or red bean sundaes are sometimes offered.

A selection of seasonal or other limited-time foods is available, such as spicy French fries, the Shogun Burger (a [[teriyaki]] pork patty with lettuce served on a sesame seed bun), salads, soups such as tomato and pumpkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2012/02/pumpkin-soup-hong-kong-february-2012.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Pumpkin Soup – Hong Kong – February 2012 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; taco flatbreads, the Rice Fantastic (a burger-like entree with rice patties instead of buns). Other such specialties have included shrimp burgers, [[Wasabi]] Filet O' Fish, onion rings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2012/04/onion-rings-hong-kong-april-2012.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Onion Rings – Hong Kong – April 2012 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shake Shake fries, flavored French fries in flavors such as seaweed, chargrill, French onion, and salt and pepper. During the local [[Cheung Chau Bun Festival|Bun Festival]], restaurants on the island of [[Cheung Chau]] sell mushroom burgers instead of hamburgers and other meat products.

Toys,&lt;ref name="happymeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.com.hk/en/food/meals-and-value-explorer-view/happy-meals-explorer-view.html|title=Happy Meal}}&lt;/ref&gt; gift and other non-food promotion products are offered from time to time.

===India===
[[File:McDonald's meal in India.jpg|thumb|McSpicy Chicken, [[McChicken]], Pizza McPuff, [[Chicken McNuggets]] and French fries sold by McDonald's in India.]]
Indian McDonald's serve the Chicken Maharaja Mac, a grilled chicken double patty with habanero sauce&lt;ref name="McDonald's Chicken Maharaja Mac - McDonald's India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcdonaldsindia.net/burgers/chicken-maharaja-mac.aspx | title=McDonald's Chicken Maharaja Mac – McDonald's India | publisher=McDonaldsIndia.net | accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Veg Maharaja Mac, cheese and corn double patty with cocktail sauce.&lt;ref name="McDonald's Veg Maharaja Mac - McDonald's India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcdonaldsindia.net/burgers/veg-maharaja-mac.aspx | title=McDonald's Veg Maharaja Mac – McDonald's India | publisher=McDonaldsIndia.net | accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these, the McSpicy burgers/wraps, McGrill and Pizza McPuff are sold in India.

In 2016, McDonald's released two limited edition burgers called the Mexican and Lebanese McAloo Tikki. The Mexican burger consists of jalapeños, tomatoes and a Mexican marinara sauce; while its Lebanese counterpart is loaded with harissa mayonnaise sauce and gherkins. Both these burgers contain the signature aloo patty with cornmeal dusted buns.&lt;ref name="Mexican McAloo Tikki v/s Lebanese McAloo Tikki"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hungryforever.com/mexican-mcaloo-tikki-vs-lebanese-mcaloo-tikki-poll/ | title=Mexican McAloo Tikki v/s Lebanese McAloo Tikki | publisher=Hungry Forever | accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past promotional items have included the McPaneer and Grilled Chicken Royale,&lt;ref name="McDonald's launches Royale Range premium burgers - Times of India"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/McDonalds-launches-Royale-Range-premium-burgers/articleshow/33787842.cms | title=McDonald's launches Royale Range premium burgers – Times of India | publisher=TNN | date=15 April 2014 | accessdate=3 August 2016 | author=Sushma U N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican Spice Chicken and Veg, Asian Hot Garlic Dip and African Peri Peri Shake Shake (as part of the Spice Fest)&lt;ref name="Spice route"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/spice-route/article3358356.ece | title=Spice route | publisher=The Hindu | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indi-McSpicy and the McCurry Pan.

McDonald's in India do not serve beef products, in deference to [[Hindu]] beliefs. Meat and vegetarian meals are prepared in separate areas of the restaurant due to religious laws; cooks preparing vegetarian dishes wear a distinctive green apron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Vanac |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-bottom-line/2012/09/mcdonalds-goes-meat-less-in-india.html |title=McDonald's is going meat-less in India |publisher=The Columbus Dispatch |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[File:McDonald's Burger Sate Indonesia 1.jpg|thumb|McDonald's Indonesia promo; Burger Sate, McFlurry Rujak Pedas, Markisa soda tea and Fries. Limited in August only, the month of Indonesian Independence.]]
[[File:Congee at McDonald's.jpg|thumb|[[Bubur ayam]] (chicken congee)]]
To accommodate [[Muslim]]-majority population, all McDonald's in [[Indonesia]] are certified [[halal]], which means they do not serve bacon or pork patties, while serving only beef, chicken, and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title  = Sertifikasi Halal | work = McDonald's Indonesia | url = http://mcdonalds.co.id/menu/kualitas-produk/sertifikasi-halal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local items include crispy and spicy [[fried chicken]]; the McRice, a small mound of [[steamed rice]] wrapped in paper and available to supersize; McSoup, a chicken flavored soup with bits of croutons and vegetables; and ''Buryam'' (short for ''[[bubur ayam]]'' or chicken [[congee]]), later renamed as ''Bubur Ayam Spesial'' with the addition of [[fried egg]] topping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bubur Ayam Spesial | work = McDonad's Indonesia | url = http://www.mcdonalds.co.id/menu/item/55?ref=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sambal]]'' chili sauce, an essential component of [[Indonesian cuisine]], and tomato [[ketchup]] are available as condiments.

McDonald's fried chicken, McRice, and fruit tea are sold together as PaNas (''paket nasi'' or "rice package") with an additional sachet of ''sambal'' chili sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title  = PaNas1 | work = McDonald's Indonesia | url = http://www.mcdonalds.co.id/menu/item/64?ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adopts the Indonesians' way of consuming ''[[ayam goreng]]'' (fried chicken) with steamed rice and ''sambal''.

Other than fried chicken with rice and ''bubur ayam'' chicken rice congee, locals' preference of [[rice]]-based food is accommodated further by the introduction of Chicken with Spicy Tomato and Chicken Teriyaki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chicken with Spicy Tomato &amp; Chicken Teriyaki | work = McDonad's Indonesia | url = http://www.mcdonalds.co.id/promo/75?ref=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a bowl of steamed rice topped with strips of fried chicken patty with sauces and vegetables, similar to the Japanese [[donburi]] (rice bowl) fashion of serving.

McDonald's in Indonesia also promotes some seasonal foods, sold only within a limited certain period of time. Those limited periods include Chinese New Year, Ramadhan, and Independence Day specials.

During [[Chinese New Year]], a Beef Prosperity Burger, consisting of two beef patties covered in black pepper sauce and topped with diced onions, is sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ta-chan |url=http://jakartalovestory.blogspot.ca/2012/01/mcdonalds-prosperity-burger.html |title=Jakarta Love Story: McDonald's Prosperity Burger |publisher=Jakartalovestory.blogspot.ca |date=2012-01-15 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Ramadhan]], McDonald's Indonesia has offered BBQ Beef Flatbread (2014), Curry Beef Delight (2015), [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan]] Burger (2016) and Ayam Kremes (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title  = Ayam Kremes | work = McDonald's Indonesia | url = http://mcdonalds.co.id/promo/175?ref=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain periods, such as August (the month of [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]]), McDonald's Indonesia launched local-inspired dishes such as the [[Satay|Burger Sate]], a hamburger with [[Peanut sauce|satay sauce]] (spicy ground peanut sauce), with Teh Soda Markisa (passion fruit tea soda);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title  = Ini Rasa Kita: Burger Sate | work = McDonald's Indonesia | url = http://www.mcdonalds.co.id/promo/99?ref=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local-inspired dessert include [[McFlurry]] with ''markisa'' (passion fruit) and ''rujak pedas'' (spicy mango [[rojak|rujak]]) flavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ini Rasa Kita: McFlurry Markisa &amp; Rujak Pedas | work = McDonald's Indonesia | url = http://www.mcdonalds.co.id/promo/101?ref=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
[[File:Kosher McDonalds.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kashrut|Kosher]] McDonald's]]
{{Main|McDonald's Israel}}
The only entirely [[Kashrut|kosher]] McDonald's are in [[Israel]] and [[Argentina]]. In these locations, patties are barbecued on [[charcoal]] rather than [[frying|fried]].&lt;ref name="frommers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/buenosaires/D55904.html|title=Kosher McDonald's Restaurant Review | location=Buenos Aires | work=Frommers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some kosher locations serve milk based desserts, but in separate booths, allowing for full separation of dairy and meat products in food preparation areas. However, most of the McDonald's outlets in Israel are not kosher service, as they serve cheeseburgers, which mix dairy and meat products.

Specialty items in Israeli McDonald's include the [[Shawarma|McShawarma]] and [[Kebab|McKebab]], both served on flatbread. On January 18, 2011, McDonald's introduced the McFalafel sandwich in Israel, but withdrew the item six months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/12/mcdonalds-withdraws-mcfalafel-israeli-restaurants | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Harriet | last=Sherwood | title=McDonald's withdraws McFalafel from Israeli restaurants | date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the last few years they have added a vegetarian option, corn sticks (which are bite sized corn shniztels).

===Japan===
[[File:Big Mac hamburger - Japan (2).jpg|thumb|right|A Big Mac as served in Japan]]
[[File:Idaho Burger - McDonald's jpn.JPG|thumb|Idaho burgers include bacon, beef, onion, cheese and pepper sauce.]]
Regular menu items in Japanese McDonald's include: the Teriyaki McBurger, with ground pork patties, mayonnaise, lettuce, and teriyaki sauce; Shaka Shaka Chicken, a fried chicken strip served in a paper pouch, with cheese or pepper seasonings to shake in the bag; and the Fillet-O-Ebi (shrimp), with a fried shrimp patty and mustard. Breakfast options include a hot dog with pickle relish, ketchup, and mustard,then for lunch and dinner they serve the Chilli McHotdog with egg and chilli sauce. As well as regular soft drinks (which in Japan include grape flavoured Fanta and iced tea), McDonald's in Japan also serve cartons of milk, Minute Maid orange juice and "Yassai Seikatsu", a type of vegetable juice.

Seasonal and limited-time items have included:
* The Chicken Katsu Burger, a breaded chicken sandwich flavored with soy sauce and ginger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/new-products/view/cheese-katsu-burger|newspaper=Japan Today|title=Cheese Katsu Burger|date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ayam Goreng McD was introduced as McDonald's Fried Chicken in 1986. The product's name was changed to Chicken McCrispy in 2000 and again to Ayam Goreng McD in 2002 to better suit the country's culture.

Other seasonal and limited-time specialties have included the Bubur Ikan McD (a fish variant of the Bubur Ayam McD), the Grilled Chicken Foldover (equivalent to the McArabia), the Grilled Chicken Burger and spicy McNuggets.&lt;ref name="gozonews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gozonews.com/645/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-new-mccafe-in-victoria/|title=Gozo News.Com|work=Gozo News.Com|accessdate=8 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035919/http://gozonews.com/645/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-new-mccafe-in-victoria/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialty desserts have included a kiwifruit sundae, served in 2000 in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

Like in Singapore and Indonesia, during Chinese New Year, Prosperity Burgers are sold. These come in beef and chicken varieties. In 2011, these were served with a McFizz, a specialty beverage mixing [[Minute Maid]] orange juice and [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]], and Curly Fries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonalds.com.my/highlights/prosperity_burger.asp |title=i'm lovin' it!

===Philippines===
Most Filipinos colloquially refer to McDonald's as "McDo" (equivalent to "Mickey D's"), and the term has been adapted by McDonald's Philippines, even naming most of their products after the term. Menu items in McDonald's in the [[Philippines]] include McSpaghetti, Chicken McDo, Burger McDo and Crispy Chicken Sandwich, in order to compete with the country's largest fast food retail [[Jollibee]]. From 2001 to 2006 the McRice, steamed rice formed into buns, was available as a replacement for bread buns on beef and chicken sandwiches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=365232&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=81 |title=A handy rice meal – The Philippine Star » Lifestyle Features » Food and Leisure |publisher=Philstar.com |date=2006-10-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breakfast menus include [[longaniza]], a [[Philippine cuisine|Philippine]] sausage, served with rice and a fried egg, and the Hamdesal, a [[Pandesal]] bun with pineapple glaze syrup, mayonnaise, and Canadian bacon served with scrambled eggs, cheese, or both.

Some pies come in pineapple and [[taro]] flavors, although the McDonald's Apple Pie is served in all locations. Only select locations serve milkshakes. Twister Fries is also served seasonally, as well as Shake Shake Fries, which are McDonald's French Fries that come in a paper bag and served with a packet of flavored powder (Barbeque, Cheesy Butter, Sour Cream, Ketchup, and Pizza flavors); customers must administer the flavoring to the bag of fries themselves, shaking the bag until the powder is evenly distributed among the fries. They are available annually.

McDonald's in the Philippines also promotes movie tie-in products seasonally, such as the Banana-Oreo McFlurry and Banana McFloat during the release of the Minions movie in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/294827/mcdonalds-curly-fries-they-exist-but-probably-not-in-your-neighborhood/ |title=McDonald’s Curly Fries… They Exist, But Probably Not In Your Neighborhood |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
All McDonald's in [[Saudi Arabia]] are certified halal.&lt;ref name=halal/&gt; Saudi locations serve the Spicy McChicken, McArabia, and the Big Tasty, the latter of which is also available in some European locations.

===Singapore===
All McDonald's in Singapore are certified halal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcdonalds.com.sg/eatsmart_faq.html |title=Welcome &amp;#124; McDonald's Singapore |publisher=Mcdonalds.com.sg |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418104608/http://www.mcdonalds.com.sg/eatsmart_faq.html |archivedate=2013-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singaporean locations offer the McSpicy, a spicy chicken burger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.com.sg/eatsmart_menu_mcspicy.html |title=Welcome &amp;#124; McDonald's Singapore |publisher=Mcdonalds.com.sg |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927085810/http://www.mcdonalds.com.sg/eatsmart_menu_mcspicy.html |archivedate=2012-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 24-hour McDelivery service is available in all locations on [[Pulau Ujong|the island]].

The curry sauce is a dip unique to Singapore and is the favourite complementary dip to Chicken McNuggets.

In 2011, due to congestion at the United States' West Coast ports, the popular chicken nugget dip was unavailable for a period of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeo|first1=Miranda|title=McDonald's curry sauce returns today|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/soshiok/mcdonalds-curry-sauce-returns-today|accessdate=3 August 2016|publisher=asiaone|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing a public outcry. A similar crisis happened in 2015.

In July 2016, McDonald's launched a limited edition take-home bottle of the curry sauce (375ml) and is limited to four purchases per single receipt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/lifestyle/mcdonalds-curry-sauce-available-limited-edition-take-home-bottle-july-21|title=McDonald’s Curry Sauce available in limited edition take-home bottle from July 21|publisher=TODAY|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news was met with overwhelming popularity and several outlets ran out of stock on the item extremely quickly.

McDonald's has also introduced several special additions to the Singapore menu, such as the Salted Egg York Chicken Burger in 2016, coupled with salt &amp; pepper shaker fries and Gula Melaka McFlurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mcdonald-s-singapore/2915700.html|title=McDonald's Singapore launches menu inspired by local flavours|publisher=ChannelNewsAsia|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
===Canada===
{{Main|McDonald's Canada}}
French fries may be substituted with McDonald's version of [[poutine]]. Previously, McDonald's poutine was available widely only in Francophone Canada (Quebec and parts of New Brunswick) and available elsewhere on a more limited basis; however, in December 2013, McDonald's formally announced the nationwide availability of poutine at all of its Canadian restaurants, due to popular demand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcdonald-s-poutine-hitting-menus-across-canada-1.2454323 "McDonald's poutine hitting menus across Canada"], CBC News, 06 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise. Deli Choices were introduced throughout Canada in 2006. Unique to Canadian McDonald's locations is the McMini, miniature sandwiches with grilled or crispy chicken; flavors include [[Pesto]] Chicken (later replaced by Zesty [[Mango]]) and Spicy Thai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2011/11/mcmini-thai-chilli-chicken-and-pesto.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Chicken McMini Thai Chilli and Pesto – Lasalle, Canada – May 2010 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the United States, the McRib periodically appears on the menu for limited runs.  The crispy chicken patty used in the McChicken sandwich sold in Canada uses both white and dark meat – it is essentially the same size and taste as the original McChicken that first appeared in the USA in 1980.

Seasonal items previously available in McDonald's in Canada include the McLobster, a [[lobster roll]], available in the [[Maritime Provinces]], called ''McHomard'' in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-biz-mcdonalds-mchomard-canada,0,4348743.photo | work=Chicago Tribune | title=McHomard – Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally a blueberry-shortbread McFlurry is also available.  Discontinued items in Canadian McDonald's include pizzas, including a [[calzone]]-style "McPizza."
The McFlurry Originated in New Brunswick.

===Mexico===
Mexican McDonald's locations do not serve fish, except during the period of Lent. Special items at these locations have included the Flaming Hot [[Doritos]] Quarter Pounder and the BBQ Double Burger. For breakfast, Mexican McDonald's locations serve the McMollete, which is made on an English muffin spread with beans, topped with a slice of melted cheese and pico de gallo.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-caters-to-local-palettes-2011-1?op=1|accessdate=3 August 2012|title=Check out the awesome meals you can buy at McDonald's around the world|author=Johnson, Robert|date=22 January 2011|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican locations also serve a version of the McSkillet burrito known as the "McBurrito".

===United States===
McDonald's restaurants in the United States of America offer various types of [[shellfish]] dishes on a regional basis, such as seasonal [[lobster]] rolls in [[New England]] and [[crab cakes]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].

Hawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald’s Saimin &amp;#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[linguiça|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.

====Puerto Rico====
As in Mexico, Puerto Rican McDonald's do not serve fish and serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==
===Australia===
The most popular Australian McDonald's menu items are the McOz Burger and the Create Your Taste kiosk. You use a touch screen to choose types of bread, beef patties, chicken patties, bacon, cheese, pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato and sauce. Your order is delivered by a waiter when dining in-store. Previous products have included: Shaker Fries, similar to Japan's Shaka Shaka Chicken; a [[BLT]]; the Mc[[Beefsteak]], promoted by [[country music]] singer [[Lee Kernaghan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3WCXJOpv4 |title=McDonalds Commercial – McBeefsteak |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Big [[Kahuna]] Burger, served with pineapple; the Romano Burger, a chicken patty with Italian sauce and mozzarella served on an herbed focaccia bun; the [[Tandoor]]i Burger, a chicken patty with lettuce and mint yogurt sauce served on flatbread; and a [[Chive]] [[Omelette]] Roll.

Current products have included: Chicken Mcbites, Classic Angus and Aussie BBQ Angus.

Every so often (typically once a year) the McOz is sold for a limited time.  The McOz is a quarter-pound burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, ketchup and the so-called Australian ingredients of [[beetroot]] and cooked onion served on a sesame seed bun.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|McDonald's New Zealand}}
[[File:McDonald's Kiwiburger.jpg|thumb|200px|Kiwiburger]]
Many McDonald's menu items in New Zealand are similar to those in Australia. Some unique items include the [[Kiwiburger]], a beef patty with McMuffin egg, tomato, lettuce, cheese, onion, beetroot, ketchup, and mustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestadsontv.com/ad/38826/McDonalds-Kiwiburger |title=TV ad: McDonald's: Kiwiburger |publisher=Bestadsontv.com |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a special "Kiwi Menu" was featured to promote the country's hosting of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].

In April 2012, McDonald's re-released the El Maco, a variant of the product of the same name offered in other markets, such as Scandinavia. El Maco had previously been sold in New Zealand in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McDonald's NZ (maccasnz) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/MaccasNZ/status/189864932047720448|publisher=McDonald's New Zealand, Twitter|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the New Zealand affiliate bought out failing local fast food chain [[Georgie Pie]], which based itself around [[meat pie (Australia and New Zealand)|Australian and New Zealand meat pies]]. McDonald's trialed a partial relaunch of the Georgie Pie brand in May 2013 with one pie flavor sold through eleven of its restaurants. In October 2013, the affiliate announced it would expand the sale of Georgie Pie to 107 of its 161 restaurants by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="NZHreturn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Christopher|title=Georgie Pie now to be sold across NZ|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11132811|accessdate=1 October 2013|newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, two pie flavors are available: Steak Mince 'n' Cheese and Bacon 'n' Egg.

'''John Oliver Wheeler''' (19 December 1924 – 24 May 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Obituary: John Oliver WHEELER |date= 30 May 2015 |newspaper= The Vancouver Sun |url= http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/vancouversun/obituary.aspx?pid=174972148 |accessdate= 15 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Geology|geologist]], who spent most of his career as a research scientist with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]].

==Family==
Wheeler came from a family of [[surveyor]]s. His father, Sir [[Edward Oliver Wheeler]], participated in the first [[Topography|topographical]] survey of [[Mount Everest]] in 1921, and later rose to become [[Surveyor General of India]]. Wheeler's grandfather, [[Arthur Oliver Wheeler]], mapped British Columbia’s [[Selkirk Mountains]] and the [[British Columbia]]-[[Alberta]] border.

==Career==
In 1952, Wheeler joined the Geological Survey of Canada. He worked for them for 39 years. He spent the first 20 years mapping the geology of 100,000 square kilometres. The greatest part of this achievement was the [[American cordillera|Cordillera]] from northern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to eastern [[Alaska]]. He also mapped several regions of the [[Yukon]], including the [[Saint Elias Mountains]], and parts of British Columbia, including the Selkirk Mountains. His work has become the foundation of all subsequent Cordilleran mapping studies and set the standard for geological mapping in Canada. In 1968, Wheeler was appointed head of the Survey’s Cordilleran Section.

In the 1970s, Wheeler moved to [[Ottawa]] to become a manager. He was promoted to Chief Geologist, with responsibility for the scientific program. In the 1980s he returned to Vancouver to be the General Editor of the new 8-volume edition of the ''Geology of Canada''. He prepared many of the large regional and national maps.

In the early 1980s, he lobbied for establishment of the [[Lithoprobe]] project. This 20-year project performed geoscientific studies on and mapped deep [[Seismology|seismic]] [[transect]]s of Canada’s [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. He served as chairman of Lithoprobe’s steering committee for two years.

Wheeler retired in 1990. During his later years he remainined as an unsalaried emeritus research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada in Vancouver, and was a lead author of the 2004 Canada-USA collaborative Geological Map of North America.

== Geological Association of Canada ==
Wheeler became a member of the [[Geological Association of Canada]] in 1957. He was a Councillor from 1968-1972. He served as President from 1970-1971.

==Accolades==
*Elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1969)
*[[Logan Medal]] of the [[Geological Association of Canada]] (1983)
*Honorary Doctorate of Science (''honoris causa'') of the [[University of British Columbia]] (2000)
*[[Massey Medal]] of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] (2002)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8607">[[File:JPADS Illustration.png|thumb|Illustration of how multiple airdrops with multiple drop zones, given they are within 25 miles of each other, can be accomplished at once using JPADS]]
The '''Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS)''' is an American military [[airdrop]] system which uses the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), steerable [[parachute]]s, and an onboard computer to steer loads to a designated point of impact (PI) on a [[drop zone]] (DZ). It integrates the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[Precision and Extended Glide Airdrop System]] (PEGASYS) and the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Precision Airdrop System]] (PADS) program. PEGASYS consists of several precision airdrop systems, ranging from extra light to heavy payloads, while PADS resides on a laptop which computes the release points for non-steerable parachute systems by means of software capable of mission-planning, weather forecasting, and current measurements of wind velocity, altitude, air pressure, and temperature. It can also receive weather updates and en route mission changes through satellite links.

==History==
[[File:070116-F-0000X-002.JPG|thumb|290px|Early JPADS equipment testing]]
[[United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command|U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command]] (RDECOM) was the primary developer for JPADS, which meets several requirements: increased ground accuracy, standoff delivery, increased air carrier survivability, and improved effectiveness/assessment feedback regarding airdrop mission operations. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force began jointly developing this system in 1993. The U.S. Air Force made its first operational/combat use of the system in Afghanistan in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=707|title=Bagram C-130s Use High-Tech Cargo Delivery System|publisher=United States Department of Defense|last= Kurle, USAF|first=Maj. David|date=September 6, 2006|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Preparing the cargo area 130110-F-PM120-391.jpg|thumb|290px|An officer programs a JPADS bundle with drop coordinates in preparation for a resupply mission]]
The steerable parachute or [[parafoil]] is called a "decelerator," and gives the JPADS system directional control throughout its descent by means of decelerator steering lines attached to the Autonomous Guidance Unit (AGU).  They create drag on either side of the decelerator, which turns the parachute, thus achieving directional control.

The AGU contains a GPS, a [[battery pack]], and the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) software package.  It also houses the hardware required to operate the steering lines.  The AGU obtains its position prior to exiting the aircraft, and continues to calculate its position via the GPS throughout descent.  

The Mission Planner software gives the aircrew the ability to plan the mission, in flight if necessary, as well as steer the aircraft to its Computed Air Release Point (CARP), where the load is released.

===Increments===
JPADS involves four increments, categorized by the weight of the cargo to be dropped:

Increment I: JPADS-2K / applies to loads up to 2,200&amp;nbsp;lb / classified as the “extra light” category / commensurate with Container Delivery System (CDS) bundles.

Increment II: JPADS-10K / applies to loads up to 10,000&amp;nbsp;lb.

Increment III: JPADS-30K / applies to loads up to 30,000&amp;nbsp;lb.

Increment IV: JPADS-60K / applies to loads up to 60,000&amp;nbsp;lb.

==Accuracy==
[[File:Hires 060831-F-2185F-053.jpg|thumb|290px|JPADS bundle descends to its preprogramed drop zone over [[Afghanistan]], circa 2006]]
[[File:JPADS guided pallet lands next to its bullseye.jpg|thumb|290px|A JPADS guided bundle lands right next to its programmed target, indicated by the orange marker]]
JPADS is reported to be accurate to {{convert|50-75|m|ft}}, drastically reduces drop zone size requirements; significantly increasing the number of locations which can be used as a drop zone. This reduces both the risk of hostile fire to aircraft and aircrews and the amount of cargo that misses a drop zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/jpads-making-precision-airdrop-a-reality-0678/|title=
JPADS: Making Precision Air-Drops a Reality|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|date=April 27, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
JPADS offers several main benefits, including an increase in the number of available drop zones and an increase in the cargo's precision, which benefits the user.  JPADS also increases the survivability of the delivery aircraft and its crew.

===Ground Accuracy===
Current drop zones are quite large; {{convert|600|yd|m|0|abbr=on}} or more.  Airdropping sequential loads (multiple loads aboard a single aircraft) requires very long drop zones on the order of {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} or more, or else the aircraft must make multiple passes over the same area, a tactically unsound thing to do.  Furthermore, achieving a high degree of accuracy (less than {{convert|100|yd|m|0|abbr=on}}) requires the aircraft to fly at the lowest altitude possible, which can range from {{convert|400|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above ground level to as high as {{convert|1,500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, depending on the altitude of the drop zone, the weight of the load, and the number and type of parachutes required.

JPADs can achieve the same or better accuracy from greater heights, allowing the aircraft to drop the load at a much higher, and usually safer, altitude.

===Standoff Delivery===
Because JPADS allows the aircraft to drop at high-altitude, the aircraft can actually drop the load a good distance away from the drop zone, which affords the aircrew to remain free of enemy threats which may be near the area where the load is being dropped.

===Survivability===
Airdrops are usually performed at slow speeds for an aircraft, usually 130 [[knot (unit)|kts]] for paratroopers and 140 kts for cargo.  When combined with the low altitude required for precision, the aircraft are vulnerable to enemy ground fire.  With JPADS, the aircraft is much more likely to survive, as it can drop at a much higher altitude, above most enemy ground fire.

===Feedback===
Because the system can transmit its current position back to the airdrop aircraft, it provides its exact landing location which the aircrew can then transmit to ground forces which may not have arrived at the drop zone.

'''La Frontera''' is the name given to a geographical region in [[Chile]]. La Frontera can denote either the area just around [[Bío Bío River]] or the whole area between the Bío Bío and [[Toltén River]] being in this later definition largely coterminous with the [[Araucanía (historic region)|historical usage of Araucanía]].

The name comes the times when it was the frontier of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] (a part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Chile]]) with [[Araucanía (historic region)|La Araucanía]], the lands of the [[Mapuche]] nation following their great revolt in 1598.

Following the 1598 revolt and subsequent loss of the cities and forts south of the Bio Bio, the Spanish Empire established a system of forts and fortified towns between the Bio Bio and the [[Itata River]] and some within the Mapuche lands of Araucanía itself. This system continued through the 18th century and into the 19th century.

==Forts and settlements of La Frontera==
The first fortress rebuilt following the 1599 destruction of the forts in [[Catirai]] and its city [[Santa Cruz de Coya]], the cities of [[Valdivia, Chile|Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia]], [[Angol|San Andrés de Los Infantes]] and [[Chillán Viejo|San Bartolomé de Chillán y Gamboa]], was the reconstruction of the city of Chillán by the interim [[Royal Governor of Chile|Governor]] [[Francisco de Quiñónez]].

===17th century===
In 1601 [[Alonso de Ribera]] built [[Fort Talcahuano]] to defend remaining Spanish settlements near [[Penco|Concepción]] and [[Fort Lonquén]] on the [[Lonquén River]] to secure estancias that provided food to the army.

In 1602 Ribera rebuilt the small [[Fort Colcura]] and [[Jesus de Huenuraquí|Fort Guanaraque]] and built a new fort, [[Santa Fe (fort)|Santa Fe]] near the confluence of the Bio Bio and Vergara Rivers.  On the coast Ribera sent captain [[Francisco Hernández Ortiz]] to establish a fort [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] on the site of the ruined city but it had to be abandoned by the starving remnant of its garrison after a terrible two-year siege.

In 1603 Ribera built [[Fort Chepe]] and [[San Pedro de la Paz|Fort San Pedro]] to cover the crossing at the mouth of the [[Bio Bio River]].  He rebuilt [[Arauco, Chile|San Felipe de Araucan]] and [[Lebu, Chile|Santa Margarita de Austria]] on the coast between the [[aillarehue]]s of Arauco and Tucapel and a fort at [[Tucapel]] and [[Paicavi(fort)|Paicavi]] on the [[Paicavi River]].  Also in the same year to the east along the Bio Bio River facing the aillarehues of [[Catirai]] and [[Purén]], he rebuilt [[Yumbel|Santa Lucia de Yumbel]] and built the forts of [[Rere, Chile|Nuestra Señora de la Buena Esperanza]], [[San Rosendo]], [[Nuestra de Senora de Halle]], [[Nacimiento, Chile|Nacimiento de Nuestro Señor]] and [[Negrete|San Francisco de Borja]].  The refugees from the abandoned city of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] under captain Francisco Hernández founded [[Fort Calbuco]] on a channel between the [[Reloncaví Sound]] and the [[Gulf of Ancud]].

In 1606, [[Alonso García de Ramón]] built Fort [[San Ignacio de la Redención]] near [[Boroa]] but it was abandoned soon after the ambush of most of its garrison.

In 1607 García de Ramón rebuilt Fort [[Purén]] and [[San Jerónimo de Millapoa]] but as a result of a peace agreement with the [[Moluche]] of Catirai he soon dismantled the later.

In 1611 [[Luis Merlo de la Fuente]] built fort ''[[Angol|San Luis de Angol]]'' a little to the south of the old city of Angol.

In 1613 Alonso de Ribera built [[Fort Virguenco]] in the upper part of the [[Rehue River]] and rebuilt the fort at Puren again.

In 1621, [[Cristóbal de la Cerda y Sotomayor]] rebuilt the fort of Yumbel the same year it was destroyed.  He also built fort [[San Cristóbal de La Paz]] and fortified the town around the fort San Bartolomé de Chillán.

In 1622, [[Pedro Osores de Ulloa]] built [[Negrete|Fort Negrete]].

8 March 1626, [[Luis Fernandez de Cordova]] established [[Santa Juana, Chile|Santa Juana de Guadalcazar]].

In 1637, [[Francisco Laso de la Vega]] established fort ''[[Angol|San Francisco de la Vega]]'' near the ruined site of the city of Angol, abandoning fort ''San Luis de Angol''.

In 1641, all the Spanish forts south of the Bio Bio were abandoned under the terms of the [[Peace of Quilín]].

In 1647, [[Martín de Mujica y Buitrón]] as a result of the [[Parliament of Quilín (1647)]] was able to reestablish forts at [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]], [[Santa Juana, Chile|Santa Juana]] in 1648, and at [[Boroa]] in 1649.

In 1657 [[Pedro Porter Casanate]] restored the city of San Bartolomé de Chillán following its destruction at the beginning of the [[Mapuche Insurrection of 1655]]. He also built forts [[Rafael, Chile|San Rafael de Coelemu]] and [[San Fabián de Conueo]] northeast of Concepcion.  Meanwhile, captain [[Alonso de Cordova y Figueroa]] built [[Fort Tolpán]] at the confluence of the [[Renaico River|Renaico]] and [[Vergara River]]s.

In 1661 Governor Porter Casanate built fort ''[[San Miguel Arcángel de Colcura]]'' near modern [[Lota, Chile|Lota]] and a fort at [[Talcamávida]].

In 1662 [[Ángel de Peredo]] established a new city of [[Santa Maria de Guadalupe]] and repopulated [[Arauco, Chile|Arauco]] lost in 1655.

In 1663 Paredo rebuilt fort San Cristóbal de La Paz.

In 1665 [[Francisco de Meneses Brito]] established fort [[Fort Virguenco|San Carlos de Virhuenco]] on the upper [[Rehue River]] and rebuilt forts Nacimiento de Nuestro Señor and Puren.

In 1666 Meneses built fort [[Santa Fe (fort)|Santa Fe]] and [[Fort de la Encarnación]] in [[Repucura]]. He also rebuilt [[Yumbel|San Carlos de Austria de Yumbel]].

In 1693 [[Tomás Marín de Poveda]] rebuilt fort [[Rere, Chile|Buena Esperanza de Rere]].

In 1694 Marín de Poveda restored Fort de la Encarnación and a Mission in [[Repucura]].

In 1695 Marín de Poveda built fort [[Angol|Santo Tomás de Colhué]].

===18th century===
In 1724 [[Gabriel Cano de Aponte]] rebuilt forts Nacimiento, [[Santa Juana, Chile|Santa Juana de Guadalcázar]] and Santo Tomás de Colhué. He transferred from  [[Arauco Province]] the garrison and inhabitants of [[Tucapel|Plaza de San Diego de Tucapel]] to the bank of the Laja River near the Andes where a new fort of the same name was built.

In 1739, [[José Antonio Manso de Velasco]] founded [[fort]] Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles.

In 1749 fort Nacimiento was moved to the present site of the modern town of [[Nacimiento, Chile|Nacimiento]].

In 1756, [[Manuel de Amat y Juniet]] founded fort [[Santa Bárbara, Chile|Santa Bárbara]] and established the towns of [[Talcamávida|San Rafael de Talcamavida]] and [[Hualqui|San Juan Bautista de Gualqui]]

In 1757 Amat y Juniet made Nacimiento a town.

In 1764 [[Antonio de Guill y Gonzaga]] established [[Fort de la Encarnación|Fort Repucura]] and a mission at Repucura once again.

In 1777, the then military engineer [[Ambrosio O'Higgins, Marquis of Osorno|Ambrosio O' Higgins]], constructed for [[Agustín de Jáuregui y Aldecoa]], a fort [[Negrete|San Agustín de Mesamávida]].

In 1788 Governor Ambrosio O'Higgins built [[Fort Príncipe Carlos]] on the [[Duqueco River]].

In 1792 the forces of Governor Ambrosio O'Higgins under [[Tomás de Figueroa]] took possession of the site of the city of [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] ruined in 1602, and constructed a fort there.  O'Higgins reestablished it as a city in 1796.

'''Libertatia''' (also known as '''Libertalia''') was a purported [[Anarchism|anarchist]] colony founded in the late 17th century in [[Madagascar]] by [[piracy|pirate]]s under the leadership of Captain James Misson (last name occasionally spelled "Mission", first name occasionally "Olivier"). 

Whether or not Libertalia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Captain Charles Johnson]], an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a [[pseudonym]] of [[Daniel Defoe]]. According to Johnson's description, Libertalia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known; however, most sources say it stretched from the [[Antongil Bay]] to [[Mananjary, Fianarantsoa]], including [[Île Sainte-Marie]] and [[Mahavelona]]. [[Thomas Tew]], Misson and a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] named Signor Caraccioli were involved in founding it.&lt;ref name="mission" /&gt;

==Description==

Libertalia was a legendary free colony forged by [[pirate]]s and the pirate Captain Misson, although some historians have expressed doubts over its existence outside of literature. Historian and activist [[Marcus Rediker]] describes the pirates as follows:

{{quote|These pirates who settled in Libertalia would be "vigilant Guardians of the People's Rights and Liberties"; they would stand as "Barriers against the Rich and Powerful" of their day. By waging war on behalf of "the Oppressed" against the "Oppressors," they would see that "Justice was equally distributed."&lt;ref name="rediker"&gt;Rediker, Marcus (2004), ''Villains of All Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age'', Beacon Press, Beacon, Massachusetts. {{ISBN|0-8070-5024-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the existence of Libertatia is contested, the radical ideas that it represented were very common in various pirate-era events. After the [[American Revolution]], pirates fleeing from [[England]] were wrecked on an island and set up their own Libertatia. They called their new island "the Republic of [[Spensonia]]", after a fictional Utopian country created by the English author and political reformer Thomas Spence. According to [[A. L. Morton]], it "looks backward to the medieval commune and forward to the withering away of the state."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. L. Morton|Morton, A. L.]] (1952), ''The English Utopia'', Lawrence &amp; Wishart. {{ISBN|0-85315-185-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pirates were against the various forms of authoritarian social constructs of their day, [[monarchy|monarchies]], [[slavery]], and [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The pirates practiced forms of [[direct democracy]], where the people as a whole held the authority to make laws and rules, and used systems of councils with delegates, who were supposed to think of themselves as "comerads" of the general population, and not rulers. The pirates [[Constructed language|created a new language]] for their colony and operated a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Cordingly, David (1996), ''Pirates: Terror on the High Seas from the Caribbean to the South China Sea'', 9th ed, World Publications. {{ISBN|1-57215-264-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] pirates were anti-capitalist, opposed to the dispossession that necessarily accompanied the historic ascent of [[wage labor]] and capitalism. They insisted that "every Man was born free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he respired."  They resented the "encroachments" by which "Villains" and "unmerciful Creditors" grew "immensely rich" as others became "wretchedly miserable."  They spoke of the "Natural right" to "a Share of the Earth as is necessary for our Support."  They saw piracy as a war of self-preservation.  [They redefined the] fundamental relations of property and power. They had no need for money "where every Thing was in common, and no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property," and they decreed that "the Treasure and Cattle they were Masters of should be equally divided."&lt;ref name="rediker"/&gt;}}

Misson's crews often were half white and black. The pirates have been reported to have freed enslaved people because the idea of slavery went against their own ideals of freedom.

The [[pirate utopia]]'s motto was "for God and liberty," and its flag was white,&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19564/19564-h/19564-h.htm |title=The Pirates' Who's Who |chapter=Misson, Captain |publisher=Burt Franklin |author=[[Edmund Gosse#Personal life|Philip Gosse]] |year=1924 |pages=211–219 |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;!--This source is a complete public domain account of the history of Libertatia and biography of Captain Misson--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to a [[Jolly Roger]]. They were [[Anarchism|anarchists]], waging war against states and lawmakers, attacking their ships, sparing prisoners, and freeing slaves. They called themselves ''Liberi'', and lived under a communal city rule, a sort of worker owned corporation of piracy. They had [[pirate code|articles]] (shared codes of conduct), and used elected systems of re-callable delegates.

Misson was French, born in Provence, and it was while he was in Rome on leave from the French warship Victoire that he lost his faith, disgusted by the decadence of the Papal Court. In Rome he ran into Caraccioli - a "lewd Priest" who over the course of long voyages with little to do but talk, gradually converted Misson and a sizeable portion of the rest of the crew to his way of thinking:

{{quote|he fell upon Government, and shew'd, that every Man was born free, and had as much Right to what would support him, as to the Air he respired... that the vast Difference betwixt Man and Man, the one wallowing in Luxury, and the other in the most pinching Necessity, was owing only to Avarice and Ambition on the one Hand, and a pusillanimous Subjection on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Defoe|title=A General History of the Pyrates|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=389|ISBN=978-0486404882}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Embarking on a career of piracy, the 200 strong crew of the Victoire called upon Misson to be their captain. They shared the wealth of the ship, deciding "all should be in common."&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt; All decisions were to be put to "the Vote of the whole Company." Thus they set out on their new "Life of Liberty." Off the west coast of Africa they captured a Dutch [[slave ship]]. The slaves were freed and brought aboard the Victoire, Misson declaring that "the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable to the Eyes of divine Justice: That no Man had Power of Liberty of another" and that "he had not exempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own Liberty, to enslave others." At every engagement they added to their numbers with new French, English and Dutch recruits, and freed African slaves.

While cruising round the coast of Madagascar, Misson found a perfect bay in an area with fertile soil, fresh water and friendly natives. Here the pirates built Libertalia, renouncing their titles of English, French, Dutch or African and calling themselves Liberi. They created their own language, a polyglot mixture of African languages, combined with French, English, Dutch, Portuguese and native [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. Shortly after the beginning of building work on the colony of Libertalia, the Victoire ran into the pirate Thomas Tew, who decided to accompany them back to Libertalia. Such a colony was no new idea to Tew; he had lost his quartermaster and 23 of his crew when they had left to form a settlement further up the Madagascan coast. The Liberi - "Enemies to Slavery," aimed to boost their numbers by capturing another slave ship. Off the coast of Angola, Tew's crew took an English slave ship with 240 men, women and children below decks. The African members of the pirate crew discovered many friends and relatives among the enslaved and struck off their fetters and handcuffs, regaling them with the glories of their new life of liberty.

The pirates settled down to become farmers, holding the land in common - "no Hedge bounded any particular Man's Property." Prizes and money taken at sea were "carry'd into the common Treasury, Money being of no Use where every Thing was in common."

==Existence==

The consensus of modern scholarship is that Libertalia (or Libertatia) was not a real place.&lt;ref name="Little-The Golden Age of Piracy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Little|first1=Benerson|title=The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781510713048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2uIDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kevin Rushby toured the area seeking descendants of pirate inhabitants but declined to search the jungles for Libertalia, noting “others have tried and failed many times.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushby|first1=Kevin|title=Hunting Pirate Heaven: In Search of Lost Pirate Utopias|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|location=New York|isbn=9780802779779|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxCiAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were pirate settlements on and around Madagascar, on which Libertalia may have been based: [[Abraham Samuel]] at [[Fort Dauphin (Madagascar)|Port Dauphin]], [[Adam Baldridge]] at [[Ile Ste.-Marie]], and [[James Plaintain]] at [[Rantabe|Ranter Bay]] were all ex-pirates who founded trading posts and towns. These locations appear frequently in official accounts and letters from the period, while Libertalia appears only in Johnson’s ''General History, Volume 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallar|first1=Cindy|title=Pirates &amp; Privateers: the History of Maritime Piracy -      Pirate Havens Madagascar|url=http://www.cindyvallar.com/havens3.html|website=www.cindyvallar.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson’s “Libertalia” has been treated as completely fictional&lt;ref name="Sanders - If a Pirate I Must Be"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=Richard|title=If a pirate I must be: the true story of Bartholomew Roberts, king of the Caribbean|date=2007|publisher=Aurum|location=London|pages=154-155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iB_AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as apocryphal&lt;ref name="Leeson - The Invisible Hook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leeson|first1=Peter|title=The Invisible Hook|journal=NYU Journal of Law and Liberty|date=2009|volume=4|page=155 |url=http://www.peterleeson.com/The_Invisible_Hook.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or as a utopian commentary.&lt;ref name="Fox - Piratical Schemes and Contracts"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Edward Theophilus|title='Piratical Schemes and Contracts': Pirate Articles and Their Society 1660-1730|date=2013|publisher=University of Exeter|location=Exeter UK|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/14872|accessdate=8 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of fictional accounts such as Misson's in ''A General History'' has caused some modern scholars to discount the entire work as a reliable source, though other portions of it have been at least partially corroborated by various sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Gabriel|title=Life Under the Jolly Roger: Reflections on Golden Age Piracy|date=2010|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland CA|isbn=9781604860528|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGX7BgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lists of airports by ICAO code}}

== Y - Australia ==
{{Airport-list|Australia}}

The prefix Y is reserved for Australia. For many (but not all) Australian ICAO codes, the second letter indicates which [[Flight Information Region]] (FIR) the airport belongs to — B Brisbane, S Sydney, M Melbourne and P Perth. However, the Sydney and Perth FIRs no longer exist and have been merged into the Brisbane and Melbourne FIRs, although the airport codes remain unchanged (e.g. Sydney YSSY, Darwin YPDN).

Airport codes with the second letter X are reserved for heliports and are often associated with hospitals (e.g. Canberra Hospital, YXCB)

Format of entries is:
* ICAO (IATA) – Airport Name – Airport Location

This is a list of [[television programs]] that have been broadcast by [[Toon Disney]] in the United States. The channel was launched on April 18, 1998 as a spinoff of [[Disney Channel]], and aired mostly syndicated [[animation|animated]] programming, ranging from action to comedy.

The first program broadcast on Toon Disney was the Mickey Mouse segment from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' titled "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". It was followed by a sampling of other Mickey Mouse shorts and episodes of ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon and Pumbaa]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'',  ''[[Goof Troop]]'', ''[[TaleSpin]]'', and ''[[Aladdin (TV series)|Aladdin]]''.&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt;

The list does not include the programs that were introduced as [[Jetix]], a block on Toon Disney that ran from 2004 to 2009.

An asterisk (*) indicates the show was integrated into [[Disney XD]]'s initial lineup.

[[File:Uluru, helicopter view, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Uluru]], [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]], is often referred to as the biggest monolith, but that is generally avoided by geologists. While the surrounding rocks were eroded, the rock survived as sandstone [[stratum|strata]] making up the surviving Uluru 'monolith'.]]

[[File:Brand hires trimmed.jpg|thumb|[[Landsat 7]] image [[Brandberg Mountain]], [[Namibia]]]]
[[File:Gávea.jpg|thumb|[[Pedra da Gávea|Gavea Rock]], a monolith next to the sea, near [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]]]
A '''monolith''' is a geological feature consisting of a single massive [[rock (geology)|stone]] or rock, such as some [[mountain]]s, or a single large piece of rock placed as, or within, a monument or building.{{fact|date=July 2017}} [[Erosion]] usually exposes the geological formations, which are often made of very hard and solid [[igneous rock|igneous]] or [[metamorphic rock]].

In architecture, the term has considerable overlap with [[megalith]], which is normally used for [[prehistory]], and may be used in the contexts of [[rock-cut architecture]] that remains attached to solid rock, as in [[monolithic church]], or for exceptionally large stones such as [[obelisk]]s, statues, [[monolithic column]]s or large [[architrave]]s, that may have been moved a considerable distance after quarrying. It may also be used of large [[glacial erratic]]s moved by natural forces.

The word derives, via the [[Latin]] ''monolithus'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] word μονόλιθος (''monolithos''), from μόνος ("one" or "single") and λίθος ("stone").

==Life==
[[File:USSR-Stamp-1977-NIVavilov.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Postage stamp, USSR, 1977.]]
Vavilov was born into a merchant family in Moscow, the older brother of renowned physicist [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov]]. "The son of a Moscow merchant who'd grown up in a poor rural village plagued by recurring crop failures and food rationing, Vavilov was obsessed from an early age with ending [[famine]] in both his native Russia and the world."&lt;ref name="siebert"&gt;Siebert, Charles. 2011. "Food Ark." [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'']]. Volume 220 (1), July 2011. Pages 122-126.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Moscow Agricultural Institute]] in 1910 with a dissertation on [[snail]]s as [[Pest (organism)|pests]].  From 1911 to 1912, he worked at the Bureau for Applied Botany and at the Bureau of [[Mycology]] and [[Phytopathology]]. From 1913 to 1914 he travelled in Europe and studied plant [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]], in collaboration with the British biologist [[William Bateson]], who helped establish the science of [[genetics]].

From 1924 to 1935 he was the director of the [[Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences]] at Leningrad. Impressed with the work of Canadian [[phytopathologist]] [[Margaret Newton]] on wheat [[stem rust]], in 1930 he attempted to hire her to work at the institute,&lt;ref name="MNewton"&gt;{{cite book|title=Saskatchewan Agriculture: Lives Past and Present|editor1-last=Dale-Burnett|editor1-first=Lisa Lynne|editor2-last=Mlazagar|editor2-first=Brian|volume=17|series=Trade Books Based in Scholarship|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center|year=2006|isbn=0889771693}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering a good salary and perks such as a camel caravan for her travel. She declined, but visited the institute in 1933 for three months to train 50 students in her research.

While developing his theory on the centres of origin of cultivated plants, Vavilov organized a series of botanical-agronomic expeditions, and collected seeds from every corner of the globe. In [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], he created the world's largest collection of plant seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20100903031501/http://www2.bioversityinternational.org/publications/pgrnewsletter/article.asp?id_article=6&amp;id_issue=124 The Significance of Vavilov's Scientific Expeditions]. ''PGR Newsletter 124''. [[Bioversity International]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Vavilov also formulated the law of homologous series in variation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macroevolution.narod.ru/popov_eng.htm Popov I. Yu (2002). Periodical systems in biology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514194520/http://macroevolution.narod.ru/popov_eng.htm |date=2007-05-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the USSR [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]], President of [[All-Union Geographical Society]] and a recipient of the [[Lenin Prize]].

[[File:Vavilov in prison.jpg|thumb|right|Botanist Nikolai Vavilov's mugshot. Note several deep scars on his right cheek, indicating severe beatings sustained by the scientist in prison]] Vavilov encountered the young [[Trofim Lysenko]] and at the time encouraged him in his work. At the time Lysenko was not the best at growing wheat and peas, but Vavilov continued to support him and his ideas. It was not until later when he was under pressure from the Soviet State that Vavilov began to criticize the non-[[Mendelian]] concepts of Lysenko, who won the support of [[Joseph Stalin]]. As a result, Vavilov was arrested on 6 August 1940, while on an expedition to Ukraine. He was sentenced to death in July 1941. In 1942 his sentence was commuted to twenty years' imprisonment; he died of starvation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.splendidtable.org/story/how-nikolay-vavilov-the-seed-collector-who-tried-to-end-famine-died-of-starvation |title=How Nikolay Vavilov, the seed collector who tried to end famine, died of starvation |publisher = NPR |author=Gary Paul Nabhan |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in prison in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Loren R. Graham]] | title = Science in Russia and the Soviet Union: A Short History | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-521-28789-8 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Leningrad [[seedbank]] was diligently preserved through the 28-month [[Siege of Leningrad]]. While the Soviets had ordered the evacuation of art from the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], they had not evacuated the 250,000 samples of seeds, roots, and fruits stored in what was then the world's largest seedbank. A group of scientists at the Vavilov Institute boxed up a cross section of seeds, moved them to the basement, and took shifts protecting them. Those guarding the seedbank refused to eat its contents, even though by the end of the siege in the spring of 1944, nine of them had died of starvation.&lt;ref name="siebert"/&gt;

In 1943, parts of Vavilov's collection, samples stored within the territories occupied by the German armies, mainly in [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]], were seized by a German unit headed by [[Heinz Brücher]]. Many of the samples were transferred to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Institute for Plant Genetics, which had been established at {{ill|Schloss Lannach|de}} near [[Graz]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/pgrnewsletter/article.asp?lang=en&amp;id_article=48&amp;id_issue=129 Heinz Brücher and the SS botanical collecting command to Russia 1943] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102654/http://www.bioversityinternational.org/publications/pgrnewsletter/article.asp?lang=en&amp;id_article=48&amp;id_issue=129 |date=2007-09-29 }}. ''PGR Newsletter 129''. Bioversity International.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vavilov was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pringle (2008). The Murder of Nikolai Vavilov: The Story of Stalin's Persecution of One of the Great Scientists of the Twentieth Century. Simon and Schuster. p. 137. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6498-3}}. "Despite his strict upbringing in the Orthodox Church, Vavilov had been an atheist from an early age. If he worshipped anything, it was science.&lt;/ref&gt;

== After his death ==

In 1955, Vavilov's death sentence was posthumously reversed at a hearing of the [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]], undertaken as part of a [[de-Stalinization]] effort to review Stalin-era death sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Peter Pringle | title = The Murder of Nikolai Vavilov | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7432-6498-3 | page = 300}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s his reputation was publicly rehabilitated and he began to be hailed as a hero of [[Soviet science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = James W. Atz and Robert J. Winter | title = Further steps in the rehabilitation of N.I. Vavilov | journal = [[The Journal of Heredity]] | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 274–275 | year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Institute of Plant Industry|N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry]] in St. Petersburg still maintains one of the world's largest collections of plant genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vir.nw.ru/ N.I.Vavilov Research Institute of Plant Industry&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.vir.nw.ru&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute began as the Bureau of Applied Botany in 1894, and was reorganized in 1924 into the All-Union Research Institute of Applied Botany and New Crops, and in 1930 into the Research Institute of Plant Industry. Vavilov was the head of the institute from 1921 to 1940. In 1968 the institute was renamed after Vavilov in time for its 75th anniversary.

A [[minor planet]], [[2862 Vavilov]], discovered in 1977 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] is named after him and his brother [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | pages = 235 | edition = 5th | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Springer Verlag]] | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2862+Vavilov+QC2 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The story of the researchers at the Vavilov Institute during the Siege of Leningrad was fictionalized by novelist [[Elise Blackwell]] in her 2003 novel ''Hunger''. That novel was the inspiration for [[the Decemberists]]' song "When The War Came" in the 2006 album ''[[The Crane Wife]]'', which also depicts the Institute during the siege and mentions Vavilov by name.

}}

In much of the "[[Old World]]" (approximately [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]) the [[place name|names of many places]] cannot easily [[etymology|be interpreted or understood]];{{fact|date=April 2017}} they do not convey any apparent meaning in the modern language of the area.  This is due to a general set of processes through which place names evolve over time, until their obvious meaning is lost. In contrast, in the "[[New World]]" (roughly [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Australasia]]), many place names' origins are known.

Although the origin of many place names is now forgotten, it is often possible to establish likely meanings through consideration of early forms of the name. Some general conclusions about the nature of place names, and the way in which place names change, can be made and are examined below. It is also possible to distinguish regional trends and differences in the naming of places, as is also discussed below.

==Types of place name==
There are several clearly definable types of place name, the primary division being between the names of natural features and the names of human settlements. That the latter are 'places' is obvious. The case is slightly more ambiguous for natural features, depending on how exactly 'place' is defined, and what exactly the concept of a 'place' is used for. If, as is probable, natural features were originally given names to distinguish nearby hills, streams etc. from each other, then these features can be thought of as places, in that they represent distinct geographic locations. However, as names are applied on a larger scale, they may become less useful as place names. For instance, a relatively small, distinct upland valley (e.g. [[Swaledale]]) clearly represents a definable geographic location. However, the broad, extended valley of a major river, such as the [[River Trent|Trent]], is not easily understood as a single location. That notwithstanding, it is probable that the origins of the names of both settlements and natural features is the same, namely to distinguish one from another; and thus that both should be considered place names.

Many other types of place name can be defined, for example those relating to tribal or personal names. Previously names relating to pagan religion were extensively studied as these were thought to be early. Another class studied was those relating to particular people, example: the Ancient British.

==Toponymic processes==
There are identifiable processes which occur over time to place names, and which alter the place names in such a way that their original meanings are lost. These apply to both the names of settlements and natural features, although more so to the former.

The processes by which place names change include abbreviation, conflation, convergence, development in the parent language (but [[Stasis (rhetoric)|stasis]] in the place name{{Vague|date=September 2014}}) and replacement of the parent language. The latter in particular can result in dramatic shifts in place names, since the original meaning (and often sounds) are not conveyed in the new language, the place name thus shifts to a form appropriate for the new language.

*Abbreviation tends to break down a name into a more easily pronounced form, e.g.''Cantwaraburh'' to ''Canterbury''; ''Dornwaracaster'' to ''Dorchester''.
*Conflation is where two similar elements of place names become confused, for instance the Old English roots ''den'' (hill) and ''don'' (valley) are conflated in place names e.g. ''[[Willesden]]'' ('stream hill'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Middlesex/Willesden |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Croydon]]'' ('crocus valley').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=8264 |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Convergence occurs when place names drift towards other familiar phonemes in place names; e.g. in ''[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]]'' (''Aebbeduna'', 'Aebbe's hill'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Berkshire/Abingdon%20and%20St%20Helen%20Without |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the middle sound has converged to the familiar 'ing' found in many place names (usually meaning 'people of').
*Evolution of the parent language may not change a place name by itself; indeed names may show more inertia to change than languages themselves. However, evolution of the parent language permits other processes to occur. For instance, if a name no longer means anything in the modified language, it may drift towards a new form; e.g. ''Maethelac'' ('Moot-oak') to ''Matlock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Matlock  |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, as the parent language changes, attributes which already form part of a name may be appended to the name. For instance ''[[Portsea Island]]'' ('Port-island island');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Hampshire/Portsea%20Island |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; once the meaning of ''Portsea'' became obscure, it became necessary to add ''island''.
*Replacement of the parent language is one of the most dramatic processes of change. If, for whatever reason, a new language becomes spoken in the area, a place name may lose all meaning. At its most severe, the name may be completely replaced. However, often the name may be recycled and altered in some way. Typically, this will be in one of the above ways; as the meaning of place-name is forgotten, it becomes changed to a name suitable for the new language. For instance Brittonic ''Eborakon'' (perhaps 'place of the yew trees') became Anglo-Saxon ''Eoforwic'' ('Boar-town'), then Old Norse ''Jorvik'' ('Horse-bay'), and modern English ''[[York]]''.
*Elaboration of place names often occurred to make distinctions between similarly named settlements. For instance, in England, two nearby and related settlements often became 'lower/nether' and 'upper/higher';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=14567 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 'little' and 'great'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=5869 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or the equivalent in Latin, ''parva'' and ''magna''). Alternatively, two geographically separated places might be distinguished by local features; e.g. ''[[Newcastle-under-Lyme]]'' and ''[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]''; or ''[[Newton-le-Willows]]'', ''[[Newton-by-Frodsham]]'', ''[[Newton under Roseberry]]'' (and so on). In England, many additions were made in the medieval period, to show that settlements were ruled by certain families, e.g. as ''[[Stoke Mandeville]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=11347 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elaborations (particularly in Latin) date back to medieval times, such as ''[[Weston-super-Mare]]'' ('Weston-on-sea'), while others were added relatively recently, for instance ''[[Bognor Regis]]'' ('Bognor of the King').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=6919 |accessdate=July 22, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Backformation: the process whereby names are derived from one another in the opposite direction to that which would be expected - in many cases a river with an obsolete or forgotten name is renamed after a town on its banks rather than vice versa. For example, the river running through Rochdale became known as the 'Roch' through this process. Cambridge perhaps uniquely illustrates both normal and back formation. Originally ''Grantabrice'', a bridge on the Granta, the name became ''Cantebrugge'', and then ''Cambrigge'', from which the river was renamed 'Cam'.

==Problems of interpretation==
Place names often need specialists to interpret their meanings. Some of the main problems are:

*'''Language'''. Sometimes the language used in the formation of a place name is unclear; for example, some names may be plausibly derived from either Old English or Celtic roots. In recent years there has been a tendency to seek Celtic origins for names in England that were previously taken to be Anglo-Saxon.
*'''Element order'''. In Germanic languages, and thus in Old English and Old Norse, the substantive element is generally preceded by its modifier, such as "north farm" (''[[Norwich]]''), "Badecca's spring" (''[[Bakewell]]'').  In Celtic place names the order is usually reversed with the thing being described (hill, valley, farm, etc.) as the first element, for example "settlement of the Cuebris" (''[[Tregonebris]]''), "mouth of the Dee" (''[[Aberdeen]]'').  However, this is not true of all Celtic names, for example "bald hill" (''[[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]'').
*'''Translation'''. The general similarity of Old Norse and Old English meant that the place names in the Danelaw were often simply "norsified". For instance, in ''[[Askrigg]]'' ('[[ash (tree)]] ridge') in Yorkshire, the first element is indubitably the Norse ''asc'' (pronounced ask), which could easily represent a "norsification" of the Old English element ''aesc'' (pronounced ash) with the same meaning.
*'''False analogy'''.  Sometimes, however, the place names were changed by new settlers to match  pronunciation habits without reference to the original meaning.  For example, the Old English name ''Scipeton'' ("sheep farm"), which would normally become *''Shipton'' in modern English, instead was altered to ''[[Skipton]]'', since Old English ''sc'' (pronounced 'sh') was usually cognate with Old Norse ''sk'' — thus obscuring the meaning, since the Old Norse word for 'sheep' was entirely different.
*'''Lost reason'''. Interpreting some names can be difficult if the reason for the name is no longer evident.  Some names originally referred to a specific natural feature such as a river, ford or hill that can no longer be identified. For example, ''[[Whichford]]'' (Warwickshire) means "the ford of the [[Hwicce]]", but the location of the ford is lost.
*'''Confusion between elements'''. Pairs of original elements can produce the same element in a modern place name. For example, the Old English elements ''den'' (valley) and ''dun'' (hill) are sometimes confused, as they can now lack obvious meanings.  [[Croydon|Croy''don'']] is in a valley and [[Willesden|Willes''den'']] is on a hill.
*'''Multiple meanings'''. Some elements, such as ''wich'' and ''wick'', can have many meanings.  Generally ''wich/wick/wyke'' indicates a farm or settlement (e.g. ''Keswick'' "cheese farm"). However, some of the sites are of Roman or early Post-Roman origin, in which the ''wich'' represents Latin ''vicus'' ("place"). These ''vici'' seem to have been trading-posts. On the coast, ''wick'' is often of Norse origin, meaning "bay" or "inlet" (e.g. ''[[Lerwick]]'').

==Names of landscape features==
The names of natural or man-made features in the landscape tend to be older than those of settlements since the former are often more widely known. Names are given to water features, hills and valleys, islands and marshes, as well as woods and districts. Man-made landscape features that have been given names include roads and trackways as well as burial mounds, etc. Many topographic elements become incorporated into settlement names, together with plant, creature names or personal names. Many topographical words convey not just an image of the place but also a wealth of information about the likely size, status and pattern of farming practised by the community living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Landscape of Place-Names|authors=Gelling and Cole|date=2000|isbn=978-1-900289-26-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water was of major importance to the early settlers of an area, both for subsistence and for religious reasons. Names were given to springs, streams, rivers and lakes as well as marshes, bays and seas. [[Eilert Ekwall]] carried out an early study of river names in England&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ekwall, Eilert|title=English River Names|place=Oxford|date=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Krahe conducted a European-wide examination of river names which showed that there were common roots in the names over a wide area. There is still controversy over the language of these roots. Sometimes a generic word was adopted as a specific label, for example the Celtic word for river was ''afon'' which is used in many cases as the name (Avon) of rivers in England.

Land characteristics were important to both hunters and farmers, and there are many terms relating to different types of hills and valleys. Some terms, like ''cumb'' and ''penn'', were adopted from Celtic by Anglo-Saxons. Other terms relate to the expansion of farming.

Topographical names were held in low esteem by early place name scholars but their importance was raised in a book by [[Margaret Gelling]], first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Place Names in the Landscape|author=Gelling, Margaret|date=1993 |isbn=978-0-460-86086-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discusses the many elements of topographical place names, with updates in 1988 and 1997.

==Names of settlements==
Most pre-modern settlement names contain a generic element describing the place's function (e.g. 'farm', 'market', 'fort') or a prominent natural feature, or both; if only one of these is present, it is often modified by a personal name or an adjective.

For instance, examples from England:
*Personal name + function + feature - [[Todmorden]] - 'Totta's boundary valley'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=14564 |accessdate=July 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personal name + function - [[Grimsby]] - 'Grimr's farm'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=10469 |accessdate=July 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Existing name + function - [[Exeter]] - 'River Exe (Roman) fort'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research  |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=15743}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Function + natural feature - [[Church Fenton]] - 'Marsh Farm (with a church)'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World-Class Research  |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=14622}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personal name + natural feature - [[Barnsley]] - 'Beorn's clearing'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Yorkshire%20WR/Barnsley |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Existing name + natural feature - [[Cockermouth]] - 'River Cocker mouth'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Cumberland/Cockermouth |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Function - Keswick - 'Cheese farm'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key to English Place-names |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Cumberland/Keswick |accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Natural feature - [[Blackburn]] - 'Black stream'

These basic elements can also be found in place names in other countries; e.g. [[Amsterdam]] ('River Amstel dam'), [[Liechtenstein]] ('Light-stone'), [[Copenhagen]] ('Merchants' harbour), [[Paris]] ('Home of the Parisii'), [[Shanghai]] (approximately 'Seaport'), [[Tashkent]] ('Stone city'). These elements are also clearly present in the less 'weathered' New World place names - e.g. [[Fort Knox]], [[Thunder Bay]], [[Little Rock]] and so on. [[Carson City]], for instance, was named for [[Kit Carson]], and [[Belo Horizonte]] means "beautiful view". However, some apparent meanings may be deceptive; [[New York (state)|New York]] was not directly named after the English city of [[York]] but after [[James II of Great Britain|the Duke of York]], who was the head of the British Navy at the time of the British take-over, and [[Los Angeles]] was not named after angels but after the Virgin Mary, or the Queen of the Angels (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles).

Countries which have seen repeated large-scale cultural and/or linguistic changes, such as [[England]] or [[France]], tend to have more broken down place names, as the original meaning is forgotten and drifts more quickly. They may also have more linguistically diverse place names; for instance in England place names may have Pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, or Norman-French origins. Conversely, countries with a more uniform cultural/linguistic history tend to have less broken down and diverse place names - [[Wales]] for instance (especially when compared to neighbouring England).

==Place name origins in Britain and Ireland==
{{Main|Toponymy in the United Kingdom and Ireland}}
Various names have been used for the island of Britain, see [[Britain (name)]]. The origin of place names of the countries within Britain are discussed below. Each country is divided into a number of counties. {{Further|List of generic forms in place names in the United Kingdom and Ireland|Etymological list of counties of the United Kingdom}}

===England===
{{Main|English toponymy}}
Most English place-names are either Old Norse or Anglo-Saxon but there is a scattering of Celtic names over the whole country. Other place-names are hybrids of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon elements. There are a high level of personal names within the place names, presumably the names of local landowners at the time of naming. In the north and east, there are many place names of Norse origin; similarly, these contain many personal names. In general, the Anglo-Saxon and Norse place names tend to be rather mundane in origin, the most common types being [personal name + settlement/farm/place] or [type of farm + farm/settlement] (almost all towns ending in -wich, -ton, -ham, -by, -thorpe, -stoke/stock are of these types).

In [[Cornwall]] most place-names are [[Cornish language|Cornish]] in origin, whilst in [[Cumbria]] there remain a number of place names in [[Cumbric]], the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] language of this region; examples including [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Helvellyn]] and [[Blencathra]].
{{Further|Cumbrian toponymy}}

Most old Roman settlements, whether actually inhabited or not, were given the title of chester/caster in Anglo-Saxon (from the Latin Castrum, 'camp'); the specific names for each may only have little relation to the Roman names (e.g. Chester - 'Deva', Winchester - 'Venta Belgarum' etc.).

Many English places derive part of their name from the river upon which they were built, but in the 16th century many English rivers were renamed with [[back-formation]]s from towns on their banks.  [[Cambridge]], perhaps uniquely, illustrates both effects: originally ''Grontabricc'', a bridge on the Granta, the name became ''Cantebruge'' and then ''Cambrugge'', from which the river was renamed [[river Cam|Cam]].

===Wales===
{{Main|Welsh toponymy}}
The vast majority of place names in Wales are Welsh by origin, containing elements such as Llan-, Aber-, Pen- etc. Along the south coast of Wales, where English has historically been more widely spoken, many place names are commonly [[anglicization | anglicized]], such as [[Pontypool]], derived from ''Pont-y-Pŵl''. Many places throughout Wales have alternative names in English unrelated to the name in Welsh, for example, [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] (where the Welsh name ''Casnewydd'' means "New Castle") and [[Swansea]] (derived from the Norse meaning "Svein's island") for the Welsh ''Abertawe'' (Mouth of the [[River Tawe]]. In some cases these are in fact related to their Welsh name, but disguised through linguistic processes of [[Welsh morphology|mutation]], for example [[Monmouth]] and the Welsh ''Trefynwy'' both referring to the [[River Monnow]] (Mon- &lt; Monnow &lt; ''Mynwy'' &gt; ''-fynwy'').

Welsh place names tend to be associated with natural features rather than people, hence elements describing rivers, hills and valleys are common. The exceptions are places with the prefix ''Llan'', meaning 'Church', which often contain the name of the Saint the church is dedicated to e.g. [[Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain|Llansantffraid]] - 'Church of St. Bridget'.

===Scotland===
{{Main|Scottish toponymy}}
In the islands of Scotland, particularly [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], but also the [[Western Isles]], there are many names of [[Old Norse|Norse]] origin; this is also true of the coasts of the mainland.

In the Highlands, the names are primarily in [[Scottish Gaelic]], with emphasis on natural features; elements such as Glen- (valley) and Inver- (confluence, mouth) are common. These have replaced [[Pictish language|Pictish]] names that still occur on the east coast.

In lowland Scotland, names are of more diverse origin. Many are Gaelic, but many are also from the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] branch of Celtic languages (such as [[Ayr]]). There are also place names from [[Old English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]], such as [[Edinburgh]].

===Isle of Man===
Most place-names are of Gaelic or Norse origin but there are traces of an earlier language in some names.

===Channel islands===
Most place names derive from Norman-French.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Place names in Ireland}}
The vast majority of placenames in [[Ireland]] are [[anglicization]]s (adaptations to English [[phonology]]) of [[Irish language]] names. However, some names come directly from the [[English language]] or [[Scots language]], and a handful come from [[Old Norse]].

==Place name origins in the United States==
{{further|List of U.S. state name etymologies}}

Place names in the [[United States]] are often taken from the European nation that first colonized the land. Many names that have been transferred from Britain, as is the case with [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]] and [[Danbury, Connecticut]].  Many others are of French origin, such as [[Detroit]], Michigan, which was established along the banks of the river they called ''le détroit du lac Érié'', meaning the strait of Lake Erie. Many in the former [[New Netherland]] colony are of Dutch origin, such as [[Harlem]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[Rhode Island]]. Many place names are taken from the languages of [[Native Americans in the United States|native peoples]].  Specific (personal or animal) names and general words or phrases are used, sometimes translated and sometimes not.

A great many names that appear to be Native American in origin were created by non-Natives with at best a rudimentary grasp of native languages. [[Pasadena, California]]'s early Anglo residents, looking for a pleasant sounding ([[phonaesthetics|euphonious]]) name for the town, used the Ojibwe word ''pa-sa-de-na'', which means ''of the valley''.  Similarly, [[Negaunee, Michigan]]'s name is derived from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''nigani'' meaning ''foremost, in advance, leading'', which was determined to be the closest Ojibwe approximation to the English word ''pioneer''.

Nine counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] have names invented by [[Henry Schoolcraft]], usually adapted from parts of Native American words, but sometimes having parts from Greek, Arabic and Latin roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenks |first1=William L. |title=History and Meaning of the County Names of Michigan |work=Collections and Researches of the Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society |volume=38 |year=1912 |pages=439–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''(see [[List of counties in Michigan]].)''  In some cases the native meanings of a place name are wholly lost, despite guesses and theories, for example [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Oregon (toponym)|Oregon]].

Place names in the United States tend to be more easily traceable to their origins, such as towns simply named after the founder or an important politician of the time, with no alterations except a simple suffix, like -town. Carson City, for instance, was named for Kit Carson.

==Place name origins in Canada==
French, English and Gaelic derived names occur in Canada. There are also aboriginal place names.

==Place name origins in Australia==
{{Further|List of Australian place names of Aboriginal origin|List of reduplicated Australian place names}}

Australian place names are mainly a mixture of aboriginal and British-derived toponyms.

==Place name origins in New Zealand==
{{Main|New Zealand place names}}

New Zealand place names derive mostly from Maori and from British sources. The Maori named most of New Zealand's natural features. When Europeans began arriving in New Zealand from the 17th century they gave their own names to many geographical features and settlements, often after places in Britain or important settlers or famous British people. Recently there has been a movement to revive some Maori names.

'''Susupe''' is a [[village]] on [[Saipan]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Susupe is also known as Susupi. As of 2000, its population is 2,083.

==Judicial capital==

[[Capitol Hill, Saipan|Capitol Hill]] is the seat of government for the Commonwealth but the judicial branch is headquartered at the House of Justice in Susupe. Thus, the CNMI is one of three U.S. jurisdictions whose supreme courts are not located in the state/commonwealth capitol proper.  The other two jurisdictions are [[California]], whose seat of government is 
[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] but the judicial capital is [[San Francisco]]; and [[Louisiana]], whose supreme court remained in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] when the state capital was moved to [[Baton Rouge]].

==Education==
[[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Public School System]] serves the town. [[Marianas High School]] is located in Susupe, across the street from the House of Justice.

Joeten-Kiyu Public Library (JKPL) of the [[State Library of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] is in Susupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvariety.com/community-bulletin-sp-595/95224-joeten-kiyu-public-library-calendar-of-events|title=Joeten-Kiyu Public Library calendar of events|publisher=''[[Marianas Variety]]''|date=2017-05-12|accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[File:CNMI DPS Police Division Building.JPG|thumb|left|[[Northern Mariana Islands Department of Public Safety]] Police Division Building in Susupe]]
Three major hotels serve the Susupe area and its surrounding neighborhoods. (Several little hotels also provide the area with more affordable options.)
* Kanoa Resort Saipan (formerly Grand Hotel)
* Aquarius Beach Tower
* Saipan World Resort (formerly Diamond Hotel)

==Lake Susupe==
[[Image:Lakesusupe.JPG|thumb|250px|Lake Susupe pier looking towards the southern end of the island.]]
Lake Susupe is the only lake in Saipan and is located in the village of Susupe. It is home to a few species of birds found only in the Marianas. One of the endangered birds, the [[Mariana common moorhen]], has a Saipan population of 30-40. It is unknown what natural trees grew here because they were cleared in the 1930s to make room for sugar cane fields and the native fish died when the [[tilapia]] was introduced in the 1960s. Today, large [[ironwood]] trees grow and, in some places, very thick {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} reeds. There are also 17 little ponds around the lake. The ponds and even the lake are home to very large fancy-tail guppies. The lake is often visited by birds from Asia which migrate to Lake Susupe during the winter.

Phone numbers in [[Lesotho]] are eight digits long, the first two digits being the area code. Previously, Lesotho had area codes, which were integrated into the [[South Africa]]n [[Telephone numbers in South Africa|telephone numbering plan]], and calls could be made from South Africa using the regional code '''050'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j75IAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=swaziland+%220194%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%220194%22 ''Pretoria Telephone Directory''], Department of Posts and Telecommunications, 1991, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to call a number in [[Maseru]], subscribers would dial '''0501''', while to call a number in [[Mazenod, Lesotho|Mazenod]], they would dial '''05022'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ig4vAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=lesotho+%220501%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%220501%22 ''Lesotho Telephone Directory''], Lesotho.

* 27,52 Reserved for fixed mobile (corporated direct)
* 6x Reserved for cellular use

==Errata==
There had been some interest in using part of this country's numbering scheme to run international [[SMS]] promotions or competitions, as when [[List of international call prefixes|+]]CNN is spelt out on an [[E.161]] standard telephone keypad, it translates to [[List of international call prefixes|+]]266.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10362374 SMS company's message has ring of confidence], ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' Jan 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]]'s degree of interest in the idea was unknown at the time.

[[File:Locator Prince-Bishopric of Tournai (1350).svg|thumb|200px|right|location of the Tournaisis]]
The '''Tournaisis''' (or '''Tournai and the Tournaisis''') was a small territory in the [[Low Countries]] independent during the Middle Ages, consisting of the city of [[Tournai]] (Dutch: ''Doornik'') and the surrounding area. 

It was one of the great centres of [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish (or 'Flemish') painting]]. [[Robert Campin]] settled there and attracted students including [[Rogier Van Der Weyden]] and [[Jacques Daret]]. 

It also produced the important [[Franco-Flemish]] composers [[Pierre de la Rue]] and [[Marbrianus de Orto]].

The Tournaisis was situated between two larger neighbours: the [[County of Flanders]], and the [[County of Hainaut]]. Its origins lie in a Roman ''[[pagus]]'' within the ''civitas'' of the [[Menapii]], of which it became the chief city in late Roman times. It had some independence and power in the Middle Ages because it became the seat of the [[Bishopric of Tournai]].

The territory, like that of Flanders, but unlike neighbouring Hainaut, was part of early medieval [[West Francia]], which evolved into France. However, this rule was not always effective. It came under French rule during the reign of [[Philip IV of France]], and remained under French control until it was [[Siege of Tournai (1521)|conquered]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] in 1521. It remained part of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] until 1789, eventually becoming part of modern [[Belgium]].

The Tournaisis was considered part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]].
