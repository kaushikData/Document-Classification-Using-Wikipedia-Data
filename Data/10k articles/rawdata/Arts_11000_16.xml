'''Ajaz Anwar''' [ [[Urdu]]: اعجاز انور ] is a distinguished [[Painting|painter]] of [[Pakistan]]. He was a gold medalist at Punjab University &amp; he completed his M.A in Fine Arts from Punjab University. Later, he went to [[teacher|teach]] at [[National College of Arts]] [[Lahore]]. His [[watercolour]] [[paintings]] show the grandeur of the old buildings and the cultural life in [[Lahore]].

==Life==
Born in [[Ludhiana]] in 1946, his father was a [[cartoonist]] who apparently had stirred his passion from childhood and from whom he drew his inspiration. After obtaining his M.A. in [[Fine Arts]] and a [[Gold medal]] in 1967 from Punjab University (PUCAD) Lahore, he completed his Ph.D in [[Muslim]] architecture, in [[Turkey]] in 1978 and proceeded to do a course on Conservation of Cultural Property at [[UNESCO]], [[Rome]] in 1977. From 1972 he has been lecturing until he became Professor and Director of Art Gallery NCA, [[Lahore]] to date.

==Old buildings==
The old buildings of [[Lahore]] are the main theme of his paintings. He has tried to preserve those buildings in his paintings which are replaced by new style buildings or they are crumbling. These are the buildings of old Lahore; not all are historical, but common homes of common people are the centre of his attention. Natural lively colours bring the buildings to life.

==People in his paintings==
Although buildings are the main theme of his paintings and people are just there to make a normal life but the characters he used in his paintings are the quintessential of daily life in [[Lahore]] or [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The characters are faceless but they represent the common people found in the bazaars: A Tonga rider, women walking in the bazaar, children playing, milkman, old people talking, and sellers of all kinds.
[[File:Ajaz Anwar in his home.JPG|thumb|right|In his own home]]

==Kites==
Kites are almost always present in his paintings. His main themes are common homes or buildings and on the roof of every building there is a kite lover and on the sky above there are lot of kites colouring the sky.

==Life in detail==
With close observation we find a detailed life in his paintings. A woman is peeping from the window or behind the curtain, a cock is searching for food bits in the garbage.

==Comments on his work==
"In my paintings, I highlight the parts of [[Lahore]] that must be preserved. I remove skyscrapers and instead incorporate tongas and sweetmeat shops," he said in an interview. The main focus of his paintings are not human figures. "The [[human]] figures are only used to bring these crumbling buildings to life. People are not important aspects of my art because they are born and reborn whereas these buildings, once destroyed, will be lost forever."

Ajaz Anwar was the recipient of the President’s "Pride of Performance in Painting" in 1997.

==Exhibitions==
[[Lahore]], [[Ankara]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Rome]], [[Kampala]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Delhi]] and [[London]].

Ajaz Anwar leads Lahore Conservation Society and doing his utmost to preserve the [[Lahore]] as it was and preserving Lahore's heritage has become a personal crusade. "This is not in good taste and it does not resemble the original shape of these shops at all," said Ajaz Anwar to [[BBC]].

'''Alborz High School''' (in [[Persian language|Persian]]:'''{{lang|fa|دبیرستان البرز}}'''), is a college-preparatory [[high school]] located in the heart of [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. It is one of the first modern high schools in Asia and the Middle East, built by Americans, named after the [[Alborz]] mountain range, north of Tehran. Its place in the shaping of Iran's intellectual elite compares with that of [[Eton College]] in England and institutions such as [[Phillips Academy]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], and [[Milton Academy]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ibexpub.com/index.php?main_page=pubs_product_book_info&amp;products_id=90 | title=خاطرات محمدعلی مجتهدی، ریس دبیرستان البرز : Ibex Publishers, English &amp; Persian (Farsi) Books about Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The school was founded as an elementary school in 1873 by a group of [[United States|American]] missionaries led by '''[[James Bassett (missionary)|James Bassett]]'''. This was in the 26th year of the reign of [[Nasereddin Shah]] Qajar, 22 years after [[Amir Kabir]] founded the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] school in Tehran, and 33 years before the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution in Persia]] (as it was known back then; later it became "Iran" during the Reza Shah Era).

When Dr. [[Samuel M. Jordan|Samuel Jordan]] arrived in Persia in 1898, he instituted change; subsequently, Alborz became a 12-year elementary and secondary school, with its share of college courses. Thereafter, the institution came to be known as the '''American College of Tehran'''.&lt;ref name="DictofIran"&gt;Lorentz, J. ''Historical Dictionary of Iran''. 1995. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Jordan remained president of Alborz for 42 years (1899–1940). During his tenure, Alborz grew from an elementary school to a high school and college.

In 1932, the school received a permanent charter from the Board of Regents of the [[State University of New York]].

In 1940 and during [[World War II]], by the order of  [[Shah]] [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]], Alborz was removed from American management and placed under the auspices of the Iranian Ministry of Education as part of Reza Shah's modernization reforms. The school's name was changed from "''College''" back to "''Alborz''", and it was reinstated as a high school.

In 1944, Professor [[Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi]], member of [[University of Tehran]]'s faculty, was appointed as the president of Alborz. From then until 1979, and continuing after the [[Iranian Revolution]], Alborz had the most successful period of its history.

The early 1980s, saw a burgeoning Indian arts scene and a renewed government focus on developing arts across the nation, through regional centres for arts in state capital cities. The initiative in Madhya Pradesh was taken by cultural administrator, [[Ashok Vajpeyi]],&lt;ref&gt;Vajpeyi later remained, chairman, [[Lalit Kala Akademi]], India's National Academy of Arts (2008-2011).&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]]-officer in state Ministry of Education (1966-1992), who was behind the setting up of literary organization, 'Kalidas Academy' in [[Ujjain]], which opened in 1983.

The '''''Calligraphic Galleon''''' is an example of [[Islamic calligraphy]] dating to the mid-18th century. Attributed to a calligrapher in the [[Ottoman Empire]], the work depicts a [[galleon]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman navy]]. The ship is inscribed with the names of the [[Seven Sleepers]], a group of men who were protected by the [[Abrahamic God]], likely to confer a blessing of protection on the ship. It is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/454611?searchField=All&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;where=Asia&amp;high=on&amp;ao=on&amp;od=on&amp;ft=*&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=80&amp;pos=44|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== Background ===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
[[Calligraphy]] has had a long and storied history in the [[Islamic world|Islamic World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Arabic Calligraphy, a brief history |url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |author=Mamoun Sakkal |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the art form was most commonly reserved for writing or inscribing, some individual works of art were entirely made using calligraphy. Known as "calligrams",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; these images depicted a number of subjects. One such subject was ships, with calligrams of ships being especially popular in the Ottoman Empire. Some practitioners of [[Sufism]] attached a degree of mystical importance to these works of art, which were displayed inside of ritual spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A similar art-form—[[Pictorial Writing]]—was also prevalent in [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Blair, Sheila S. ''Islamic Calligraphy''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp. 449–56, 506–8, 558–59, ill. fig. 10.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Calligraphic Galleon'' ===
The Met's galleon is done in ink-and-gold on paper. The prominently displayed ship depicted by the calligram is a galleon, a large warship famously used by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires during the [[Age of Sail|Age of sail]].&lt;ref&gt;Little, Benerson (2010). "Spanish Galleons and Portuguese Carracks". ''Pirate Hunting: The Fight Against Pirates, Privateers, and Sea Raiders from Antiquity to the Present''. Washington, DC: Potomac. p. 145. {{ISBN|978-1-59797-291-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Ottoman navy frequently encountering the large Spanish ships in the Mediterranean, the empire's navy built a number of their own galleons to counter the Spanish threat. Thus, the Met's calligram was likely created in honor of the commissioning of new galleons into the Ottoman navy. An example of a similar calligram, depicting a 17th-century oared ship, is in the collection of the [[Topkapı Palace Museum]] in [[Istanbul, Turkey]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, Maryam, Sheila R.

The calligram's creator inscribed characters representing the story of the [[Seven Sleepers]] (the Ashab al-Kahf in Arabic), a group of seven men who were given refuge in a cave by God, onto the galleon; it has been posited that such an inscription on the work was intended to protect the ship from harm, just as God protected the seven sleepers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the Ottoman navy was dedicated to the Seven Sleepers, all of whom's names can be seen on the galleon's hull and deck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Chicken Little''', also known as '''Henny Penny''' and sometimes as '''Chicken Licken''', is a European [[Folklore|folk tale]] with a moral in the form of a [[cumulative tale]] about a [[chicken]] who believes the world is coming to an end. The phrase {{nowrap|"'''The sky is falling!'''"}} featured prominently in the story, and has passed into the English language as a common idiom indicating a [[Hysteria|hysterical]] or mistaken belief that disaster is imminent. Versions of the story go back more than 25 centuries;&lt;ref name="Jataka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl142.html#jat322|title=Jataka Tales of the Buddha, Part III, retold by Ken &amp; Visakha Kawasaki|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be referred to in a variety of media.

==The story and its name==
[[File:Henny penny.JPG|thumb|right|upright-1.3|Illustration for the story "Chicken Little", 1916]]
The story is listed as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson-Uther]] type 20C, which includes international examples of folktales that make light of paranoia and mass hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20000620145435/http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2033.html The End of the World The Sky Is Falling, folktales of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 20C (including former type 2033), in which storytellers from around the world make light of paranoia and mass hysteria]'', selected and edited by [[D. L. Ashliman]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  
There are several Western versions of the story, of which the best-known concerns a chick that believes the sky is falling when an [[acorn]] falls on its head. The chick decides to tell the King and on its journey meets other animals (mostly other fowl) which join it in the quest. After this point, there are many endings. In the most familiar, a fox invites them to its lair and then eats them all. Alternatively, the last one, usually Cocky Lockey, survives long enough to warn the chick, who escapes. In others all are rescued and finally speak to the King.

In most retellings, the animals have rhyming names, commonly Chicken Licken or Chicken Little, Henny Penny or Hen-Len, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky or Ducky Daddles, Drakey Lakey, Goosey Loosey or Goosey Poosey, Gander Lander, Turkey Lurkey and Foxy Loxy or Foxy Woxy.

The [[moral]] to be drawn changes, depending on the version. Where there is a "happy ending", the moral is not to be a "Chicken" but to have courage. In other versions where the birds are eaten by the fox, the fable is interpreted as a warning not to believe everything one is told.

In the [[United States]], the most common name for the story is "Chicken Little", as attested by illustrated books for children dating from the early 19th century. In Britain and its other former colonies, it is best known as "Henny Penny" and "Chicken Licken", titles by which it also went in the United States.{{#tag:ref|Before Lightnin' Hopkins' "Henny Penny Blues" from the 1940s, there was a 1906 comic strip version.&lt;ref&gt;C365 in the Opie Collection.

''The Yale Book of Quotations'' cites the nursery tale "Chicken Licken" as the source for 'the sky is falling' and the character is mentioned in [[John Cheever]]'s short story [http://members.multimania.co.uk/shortstories/cheeverfivefortyeight.html "The 5.48".]|group=note}}

==History==
[[File:Kylling Kluk.png|thumb|250px|"There was once a little chick named Kluk": beginning of the 1823 Danish version of the story.]]

The story was part of the oral folk tradition and only began to appear in print after the [[Brothers Grimm]] had set a European example with their collection of German tales in the early years of the 19th century. One of the earliest to collect tales from Scandinavian sources was [[Just Mathias Thiele]], who in 1823 published an early version of the Henny Penny story in the [[Danish language]].&lt;ref name="thiele"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The names of the characters there are Kylling Kluk,&lt;ref name="kylling_kluk"&gt;''Kylling'' means "chick" (baby chicken); ''Kluk'' is an onomatopoeic representation of a chicken's vocalization, similar to English "cluck"&lt;/ref&gt; Høne Pøne,&lt;ref name="hone_pone"&gt;''Høne'' means "hen"; ''Pøne'' means "penny"&lt;/ref&gt; Hane Pane,&lt;ref name="hane_pane"&gt;''Hane'' means "cock"/"rooster"&lt;/ref&gt; And Svand,&lt;ref name="and_svand"&gt;''And'' means "duck"&lt;/ref&gt; Gaase Paase,&lt;ref name="gaase_paase"&gt;''Gaase'' (modern Danish ''Gåse'') means "goose"&lt;/ref&gt; and Ræv Skræv.&lt;ref name="raev_skraev"&gt;''Ræv'' means "fox"&lt;/ref&gt; In Thiele's untitled account, a nut falls on Kylling Kluk's back and knocks him over. He then goes to each of the other characters, proclaiming that "I think all the world is falling" and setting them all running. The fox Ræv Skræv joins in the flight and, when they reach the wood, counts them over from behind and eats them one by one. Eventually the tale was translated into English by [[Benjamin Thorpe]] after several other versions had appeared.

Once the story began to appear in the English language, the titles by which they went varied considerably and have continued to do so. John Greene Chandler (1815-1879), an illustrator and wood engraver from [[Petersham, Massachusetts]], published an illustrated children's book titled ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'' in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little |last=Chandler |first=John Greene |year=1840 |location=Roxbury, MA |publisher=J.G.

[[File:Chicken Little 1 2.png|thumb|250px|First two pages of the 1840 children's illustrated book: ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'']]
A [[Scots language|Scots]] version of the tale is found in [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|
Robert Chambers]]'s ''Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland'' of 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland |first=Robert |last=Chambers |year=1842 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=William and Robert Chambers |oclc=316602150 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dpWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It appeared among the "Fireside Nursery Stories" and was titled "The hen and her fellow travellers". The characters included Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Daddles, Goosie Poosie, and an unnamed "tod" (fox). Henny Penny became convinced that "the lifts were faun" (the heavens were falling) when a pea fell on her head.

In 1849, a "very different" English version was published under the title "The Story of Chicken-Licken" by Joseph Orchard Halliwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James Orchard |last=Halliwell |title=Popular rhymes and nursery tales: a sequel to the Nursery rhymes of England |year=1849 |location=London |publisher=John Russell Smith |oclc=3155930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0P4O6K5zIAC |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Chicken-licken was startled when "an acorn fell on her bald pate" and encounters the characters Hen-len, Cock-lock, Duck-luck, Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander, Turkey-lurkey and Fox-lox.

It was followed in 1850 by "The wonderful story of Henny Penny" in Joseph Cundall's compilation, ''The Treasury of pleasure books for young children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeMqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT94&amp;dq=%22Henny%20Penny%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryChVOGSJouqU8O5gaAL&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Henny%20Penny%22&amp;f=false|title=The Treasury of pleasure books for young children|date=1 January 1850|publisher=W.G. Baker|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each story there is presented as if it were a separate book, and in this case had two illustrations by [[Harrison Weir]]. In reality the story is a repetition of the Chambers narration in standard English, except that the dialect phrase "so she gaed, and she gaed, and she gaed" is retained and the cause of panic is mistranslated as "the clouds are falling".

Benjamin Thorpe's translation of Thiele's Danish story was published in 1853 and given the title "The Little Chicken Kluk and his companions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorpe describes the tale there as "a pendant to the Scottish story…printed in Chambers" (see above) and gives the characters approximately the same names as in Chambers.

Comparing the different versions, we find that in the Scots and English stories the animals want "to tell the king" that the skies are falling; while in the American story, as in the Danish, they are not given any specific motivation. In all versions they are eaten by the fox, although in different circumstances.

==Idiomatic usage==
[[File:Chicken Little Title.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little'']]
The name "Chicken Little"&amp;nbsp;— and the fable's central phrase, ''The sky is falling!''&amp;nbsp;— have been applied to people accused of being unreasonably afraid, or those trying to incite an unreasonable fear in those around them.

The first use of the name "Chicken Little" to "one who warns of or predicts calamity, especially without justification" recorded by the [[Merriam-Webster]] [[Dictionary]] is in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA213&amp;lpg=RA1-PA213&amp;dq=chicken+little+++%221895%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=38-iJ3YjV3&amp;sig=cwSqhSKst9G4G0eqSsVwlDsfDSg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wcdLTdvYOoiChQfelPWsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicken%20little%20%20%20%221895%22&amp;f=false|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but idiomatic use of the name significantly predates that attestation. In fact, this usage is recorded in the United States very soon after the publication of Chandler's illustrated children's book in 1840.  Already, in 1842, a journal article about the [[Government of Haiti]] referred to "Chicken Little" in an offhand manner.&lt;ref&gt;"Life in Hayti", in {{cite book |title=The Knickerbocker, or New York monthly magazine, volume xix |location=New York |publisher=John Bisco |year=1842 |url=https://archive.org/details/knickerbockeror89unkngoog/page/n462 |pages=454}}:  "In the words of an infantile philosopher, yclept 'Chicken Little', how can he ''help'' knowing it?"&lt;/ref&gt;  An "oration" delivered to the city of Boston on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 1844, contains the passage:  {{quote|To hear their harangues on the eve of the election, one would suppose that the fable of Chicken Little was about to become a truth, and that the sky was actually falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Morals of Freedom: An Oration delivered Before the Authorities of the City of Boston July 4, 1844 |author=Chandler | first=Peleg W. |location=Boston, MA |publisher=John H. Eastburn |oclc=982157 |pages=29 |url=https://archive.org/details/moralsoffreedomo00chan/page/28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Fear mongering]]&amp;nbsp;— whether justified or not&amp;nbsp;— can sometimes elicit a societal response called ''Chicken Little syndrome'', described as "inferring catastrophic conclusions possibly resulting in paralysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Landry | first = John R. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.2917 | title = Can Mission Statements Plant the "Seeds" of Dysfunctional Behaviors in an Organization's Memory? in Proceedings of the Thirty-First Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences | page = 169 | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a sense of despair or passivity which blocks the audience from actions".&lt;ref&gt;Li, Xinghua, [http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&amp;context=etd "Communicating the "incommunicable green": a comparative study of the structures of desire in environmental advertising in the United States and China"], PhD diss., p.81, University of Iowa, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term began appearing in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AJssAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22chicken+little+syndrome%22&amp;dq=%22chicken+little+syndrome%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dvpjTb6IF5L4sAONu6DBCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDjSAQ Audio Visual Communication Review], v.3-4, pp. 226-227, National Education Association of the United States Dept. of Audiovisual Instruction, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; and the phenomenon has been noted in many different societal contexts.

==Adaptations==
[[Walt Disney Pictures]] has made two animated versions of the story. The first was ''[[Chicken Little (1943 film)|Chicken Little]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walt Disney (1943), available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vnp4kj5lLOU at Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1943 [[animated short]] released during [[World War II]] as one of a series produced at the request of the U.S. government for the purpose of discrediting [[Nazism]]. It tells a variant of the parable in which Foxy Loxy takes the advice of a book on psychology (on the original 1943 cut, it is ''[[Mein Kampf]]'') by striking the least intelligent first. Dim-witted Chicken Little is convinced by him that the sky is falling and whips the farmyard into [[mass hysteria]], which the unscrupulous fox manipulates for his own benefit. The dark comedy is used as an allegory for the idea that fear-mongering weakens the war effort and costs lives. It is also one of the versions of the story in which Chicken Little appears as a character distinct from Henny Penny.

The second Disney film was the very loosely adapted ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', released in 2005 as a 3D [[computer animation|computer-animated]] feature. It is an updated [[science fiction]] sequel to the original fable in which Chicken Little is partly justified in his fears. In this version, Foxy Loxy is changed from a male to a female, and from the main antagonist to a local bully. Another film adaptation was the animated TV episode "Henny Penny" (1999), which was part of the series ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]''. In this modern update, the story is given a satirical and political interpretation. 

There have also been a number of musical settings. American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] used the fable as the plot of his only opera ''The Sibyl: A Parable of Chicken Little'' (Parable XX), op. 135 (1976), which premiered in 1985. On the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', there was a 1991 episode in which the characters perform a short musical based on the fable (here titled "Henny Penny") at a school recital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHNtqFt9Ck|title=Henny Penny|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, there was Joy Chaitin and Sarah Stevens-Estabrook's equally light-hearted musical version of the fable, "Henny Penny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRx_Mf-0fh0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22henny+penny%22++musical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QM1wQDgvNd&amp;sig=U6pH-Bmv1I2H886UonGifWrevkY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6XIwTLrZAYju0wThpMWWAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henny%20penny%22%20%20musical&amp;f=false|title=Henny Penny: A Play with Optional Music|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed for between six and a hundred junior actors, it has additional characters as optional extras: Funky Monkey, Sheepy Weepy, Mama Llama, Pandy Handy and Giraffy Laughy (plus an aggressive oak-tree).

In Singapore, a more involved musical was performed in 2005. This was Brian Seward's '' The Acorn - the true story of Chicken Licken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsS/seward-brian.html|title=Brian Seward - Playwright|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tale of mixed motivations as certain creatures (including some among the 'good guys') take advantage of the panic caused by Chicken Licken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us-1Gq0_5UU|title=The True Story of Chicken Licken|work=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 American singer and composer [[Gary Bachlund]] set the text of Margaret Free's reading version of "Chicken Little" (''The Primer'', 1910) for high voice and piano. In his note to the score Bachlund makes it clear that he intends a reference to alarmism and its tragic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bachlund.org/Chicken_Little.htm|title=Chicken Little (2007), Margaret Free and Harriette Taylor Treadwell, originally for high voice and piano|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many novels, films, CDs and songs titled "The Sky is Falling", but the majority refer to the idiomatic use of the phrase rather than to the fable from which it derives. The following are some lyrics which genuinely refer or allude to the story:

==Related stories==
A very early example containing the basic motif and many of the elements of the tale is some 25 centuries old and appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the ''Daddabha [[Jataka]]'' (J 322).&lt;ref name="Jataka" /&gt; In it, [[the Buddha]], on hearing about some particular religious practices, comments that there is no special merit in them, but rather that they are "like the noise the hare heard." He then tells the story of a hare disturbed by a falling fruit who believes that the earth is coming to an end. The hare starts a stampede among the other animals until a lion halts them, investigates the cause of the panic and restores calm. The fable teaches the necessity for deductive reasoning and subsequent investigation.

The Tibetan version of the Jataka tale has been told in rhyme by Australian author [[Ursula Dubosarsky]] in her book ''The Terrible Plop'' (2009), which has since been dramatised, using the original title ''Plop!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvictory.org/show.m?showID=1034027 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511215004/http://www.newvictory.org/show.m?showID=1034027 |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the animal stampede is halted by a bear, rather than a lion. The ending has been changed from the Tibetan original as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weheartbooks.com/2009/04/23/the-terrible-plop |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226121408/http://weheartbooks.com/2009/04/23/the-terrible-plop/ |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exists a [[Br'er Rabbit]] story that is closer to the Eastern versions. In this story, Br'er Rabbit initiates the panic but does not take part in the mass flight, although Br'er Fox does. In this case it is Br'er [[Terrapin]] that leads the animals back to question Br'er Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Chandler Harris, ''Nights with Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation'' (Boston and New York: Houghton, Mifflin, and Company, 1883), no. 20, pp. 108-13.

'''Desert X''' is a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]], [[contemporary art]] exhibition that was installed in the [[Coachella Valley]] in California from February 25 to April 30, 2017.  

==Background==
Desert X was formed by Desert Biennial, a [[501(c) organization|501(C)]] charitable organization founded in 2015.  The exhibit is meant to bring attention to the valley's environment through the display of works by emerging artists. Themes include [[climate change]], [[immigration]], [[tourism]], [[Indian gambling|gambling]], and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anna Rumer |url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/02/25/massive-desert-x-art-exhibit-debuts-palm-springs-area/98404980/ |title=Massive Desert X art exhibit debuts in Palm Springs area |publisher=Desertsun.com |date=2017-02-25 |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Knight |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-desert-x-coachella-review-20170309-htmlstory.html|title= International art invades the suburban Coachella Valley: The best of 'Desert X' |publisher = latimes.com |date = 2017-03-09|accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/arts/2017/03/16/how-desert-x-concept-making-art-accessible-became-reality/99217496/|title= How Desert X concept of making art accessible became a reality |publisher = desertsun.com |date = |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The '''Eastman Dental Dispensary''' was constructed between 1915 and 1917 in the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] architectural style by architects Gordon, Madden, and Kaelber.  In October 1915, [[George Eastman]] provided the funds to build a free dispensary in [[Rochester, New York]] that provided oral health benefits to the entire community.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/dentistry/about/history.aspx|title=History of Eastman Dental - Eastman Institute of Oral Health - University of Rochester Medical Center|website=www.urmc.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dispensary would serve as the central location for dental services in the Rochester community, supplementing many other smaller offsite locations that had been constructed by other area philanthropists such as [[Henry Lomb]] and William Bausch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  On May 9, 1917 the dispensary was dedicated and on October 15, 1917 the dispensary officially opened to the public. 1917 also saw the graduation of the first class of the Dental Hygiene School.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Over the next few years the dispensary continued to grow, prompting George Eastman to make an endowment of 1,000 additional [[Kodak]] stock shares in 1919.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This endowment provided necessary funds for the dispensary to aid in the treatment of nose and throat disorders, as well as provide orthodontics services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This endowment also provided the necessary means for the dispensary to open a tonsil-adenoid clinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mr. Eastman continued to be a major benefactor of the dispensary even into his death in 1932, leaving a bequest of an additional $1 million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1941 the dispensary officially gained its name as the '''Eastman Dental Dispensary'''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  By 1978, [https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/dentistry.aspx Eastman Dental], as the organization came to be known, moved to a new larger building, the [https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/dentistry.aspx Eastman Dental Center] at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]] campus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/libraries/bibby/history.aspx|title=History - Basil G.

'''Eaton Operatic Society''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] musical organization located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] that presented [[opera]]s, [[operetta]]s, [[Musical theatre|musical]]s, and [[choir|choral]] works from 1919 to 1965. Originally a choir that specialized in mounting [[oratorio]]s, the group eventually morphed into a light opera company in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/eaton-operatic-society-emc/|title=Eaton Operatic Society|first=Don|last=Sedgwick|date=|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally a choir, the Eaton Operatic Society was titled the '''Eaton Choral Society''' when it was formed by employees of the T. Eaton Co department store in 1919. The group performed annual concerts in [[Massey Hall]], assembling an orchestra mainly of players from the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]].  Notable performers to have appeared with the choir included harpist [[Carlos Salzedo]] and singer [[Paul Althouse]].  Herbert M. Fletcher was the group's first conductor, serving in that role until 1925 when he was succeeded by T.J. Crawford.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

In 1931 the organization was retitled the Eaton Operatic Society and then began to produce operetta productions in addition to presenting choral concerts, at a new auditorium at [[The Carlu]]. Eventually the choir was completely disbanded during the mid-1930s. The first operetta staged by the society was [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Iolanthe]]'' at the [[Eaton Auditorium]] on 2 March 1932. The group continued to mount operettas at the Eaton Auditorium every Spring through 1965. The group also toured frequently with their productions to other cities in southern Ontario and performed at Canadian army bases during [[World War II]]. In its early years, the [[Savoy operas]] of Gilbert and Sullivan were the chief part of the society's repertoire, including ''Iolanthe'' (1932, 1938, 1950), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1933, 1939, 1948, 1954), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1934, 1940, 1949), ''[[The Yeoman of the Guard]]'' (1935, 1941, 1952), and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1936, 1942, 1953).   Beginning in 1954, the society's repertory consisted exclusively of musicals and other operettas, including ''[[The Vagabond King]]'' (1957, 1965) and ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

In 1947 [[Harry Norris]] succeeded T.J. Crawford as the Eaton Operatic Society's music director. He left after only one season when [[Godfrey Ridout]] became director. Ridout remained for nine years, and then was succeeded by Lloyd Bradshaw (1959-1961) and Horace Lapp (1962-1965).  [[Lois Marshall]] performed with the company.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;

'''Farah Pahlavi''', née '''Diba''' ({{lang-fa|فرح پهلوی}}; born 14 October 1938) is the widow of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and the exiled ''[[shahbanu]]'' ([[Empress consort|empress]]) of [[Iran]].

==Childhood==
[[File:Fpboyscout.jpg|thumb|left|Farah Diba, with Iranian boyscouts in [[Paris]]]]
Farah Diba was born on 14 October 1938 in [[Tehran]] to an upper-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The life and times of the Shah|first=Gholam Reza|last=Afkhami|page=44|isbn=978-0-520-25328-5|publisher=University of California Press|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shakibi, Zhand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZlptU4A2HkUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 |title=Revolutions and the Collapse of Monarchy: Human Agency and the Making of Revolution in France, Russia, and Iran|publisher= I.B. Tauris|year=2007|ISBN= 1-84511-292-X|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taheri, Amir 1991. p. 160"&gt;Taheri, Amir. ''The Unknown Life of the Shah''. Hutchinson, 1991. {{ISBN|0-09-174860-7}}; p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Born as Farah Diba, she was the only child of Captain Sohrab Diba (1899–1948) and his wife, Farideh Ghotbi (1920–2000). Farah's father's family is of [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani origin]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taheri, Amir 1991. p. 160"/&gt; In her memoir, the former Shahbanu writes that her father's family were natives of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] while her mother's family were of [[Gilak]] origin, from [[Lahijan]] on the Iranian coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref name=enduring&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. 'An Enduring Love: My life with The Shah. A Memoir' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her father, Farah came from a relatively affluent background. In the late 19th century her grandfather had been an accomplished diplomat, serving as the Iranian [[Ambassador]] to the [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Court in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Her own father was an officer in the [[Imperial Iranian Armed Forces]] and a graduate of the prestigious French Military Academy at [[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|St. Cyr]].

Farah wrote in her memoir that she had a close bond with her father, and his unexpected death in 1948 deeply affected her.&lt;ref name=enduring/&gt; The young family was in a difficult financial state. In these reduced circumstances, they were forced to move from their large family villa in northern [[Tehran]] into a shared apartment with one of Farideh Ghotbi's brothers.

==Education and engagement==

The young Farah Diba began her education at Tehran's Italian School, then moved to the French Jeanne d'Arc School until the age of sixteen and later to the [[Razi High School|Lycée Razi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farahpahlavi.org/sports.html|title=Empress Farah Pahlavi Official Site - سایت رسمی‌ شهبانو فرح پهلوی|work=farahpahlavi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an accomplished athlete in her youth and became captain of her school's basketball team.  Upon finishing her studies at the [[Razi High School|Lycée Razi]], she pursued an interest in architecture at the [[École Spéciale d'Architecture]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=8NIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=farah+diba+studied+architecture+at+the+Ecole+sp%C3%A9ciale+d'architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kovbhEnTXQ&amp;sig=Wi2o03DAsyhT7h2Tx72NxxvQQ2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLvta0-KzXAhXC0hoKHZIdBSYQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Translation, History and Arts: New Horizons in Asian Interdisciplinary Humanities Research|last=Meng|first=J. I.|date=2013-07-29|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443851176|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was a student of [[Albert Besson]].

Many Iranian students who were studying abroad at this time were dependent on State sponsorship. Therefore, when the [[Shah]], as head of state, made official visits to foreign countries, he frequently met with a selection of local Iranian students.  It was during such a meeting in 1959 at the Iranian Embassy in [[Paris]] that Farah Diba was first presented to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.

After returning to Tehran in the summer of 1959, the Shah and Farah Diba began a carefully choreographed courtship, orchestrated in part by the Shah's daughter [[Shahnaz Pahlavi|Princess Shahnaz]]. The couple announced their engagement on 23 November 1959.

==Marriage and family==

[[File:CoronationShahanshahShahbanou.jpg|thumb|left|Mohammad Reza crowned Farah, 26 October 1967]]
Farah Diba married [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah Mohammed Reza]] on 20 December 1959, aged 21.  The young Queen of Iran (as she was [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] at the time) was the object of much curiosity and her wedding received worldwide press attention. Her gown was designed by [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], then a designer at the house of [[Dior]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2012/02/wedding-wednesday-empress-farahs-gown.html|title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Wedding Wednesday: Empress Farah's Gown|work=orderofsplendor.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she wore the newly commissioned [[Noor-ol-Ain Diamond]] [[tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=gO9nBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=farah+diba+noor-ol-ain+tiara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGjuC8urTXAhULfhoKHWVeCxcQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=farah%20diba%20noor-ol-ain%20tiara&amp;f=false|title=World Clothing and Fashion: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Social Influence|last=Snodgrass|first=Mary Ellen|date=2015-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317451679|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the pomp and celebrations associated with the imperial wedding, the success of this union became contingent upon the queen's ability to produce a male heir. Although he had been married twice before, the Shah's previous marriages had given him only a daughter who, under [[agnatic primogeniture]], could not inherit the throne. The pressure for the young queen was acute.  The shah himself was deeply anxious to have a male heir as were the members of his government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. 'An Enduring Love: My Life with The Shah. A Memoir', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was known that the dissolution of the Shah's previous marriage to [[Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary|Queen Soraya]] had been due to her infertility.&lt;ref&gt;Queen of Iran Accepts Divorce As Sacrifice, The New York Times, 15 March 1958, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had four children:

* Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]] of Iran (born 31 October 1960)
* Princess [[Farahnaz Pahlavi]] of Iran (born 12 March 1963)
* Prince [[Ali Reza Pahlavi II|Ali Reza Pahlavi]] of Iran (28 April 1966 – 4 January 2011)
* Princess [[Leila Pahlavi]] of Iran (27 March 1970 – 10 June 2001)

==As Queen and Empress==
[[File:Fpkermanshah.jpg|thumb|Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi visits [[Kermanshah]]]]
[[File:Empress Farah Office.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Shahbanu]]'' Farah at work in her office in [[Tehran]], 1970s.]]
The exact role the new Queen would play, if any, in public or government affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply to give the Shah a male heir.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession.  However, after the birth of the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear [[elevator shoes]] to disguise this fact.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both would be sitting in a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Like many other Royal consorts, the young Queen initially limited herself to a ceremonial role. In 1961 during a visit to France, the [[Francophile]] Farah befriended the French culture minister [[André Malraux]], leading her to arrange the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian art galleries and museums, a lively trade that continued until the Islamic revolution of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 279&lt;/ref&gt; Farah and Mohammad Reza usually spoke French rather than Farsi to their children.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Abbas ''The Shah'', London: Macmillan, 2011 page 347&lt;/ref&gt; She spent much of her time attending the openings of various education and health-care institutions without venturing too deeply into controversial issues.  However, as time progressed, this position changed. The Queen became much more actively involved in government affairs where it concerned issues and causes that interested her.  She used her proximity and influence with her husband, the [[Shah]], to secure funding and focus attention on causes, particularly in the areas of women's rights and cultural development.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Farah's concerns were the "realms of education, health, culture and social matters" with politics being excluded from her purview.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, Mohammad Reza's politically powerful twin sister Princess Ashraf came to see Farah as a rival. It was the rivalry with Princess Ashraf that led Farah to press her husband into reducing her influence at the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farah Pahlavi with crown.jpg|thumb|Empress Farah after her coronation]]
One of the Empress Farah's main initiatives was founding [[Pahlavi University]], which was meant to improve the education of Iranian women, and was the first American style university in Iran; before then, Iranian universities had always been modeled on the French style.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Empress wrote in 1978 that her duties were:

[[File:Photograph of First Lady Betty Ford with the Shahbanou (Empress) of Iran on the Steps Leading to the Truman Balcony... - NARA - 186813.tif|thumb|left|190px|U.S. First Lady [[Betty Ford]] (left) with Farah Pahlavi, 1975]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could not write in detail of all the organizations over which I preside and in which I take a very active part, in the realms of education, health, culture and social matters. It would need a further book. A simple list would perhaps give some idea: the Organization for Family Well Being-nurseries for the children of working mothers, teaching women and girls to read, professional training, family planning; the Organization for Blood Transfusion; the Organization for the Fight Against Cancer; the Organization for Help to the Needy, the Health Organization ... the Children's Centre; the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children ... the Imperial Institute of Philosophy; the Foundation for Iranian Culture; the Festival of Shiraz, the Tehran Cinema Festival; the Iranian Folklore Organization; the Asiatic Institute; the Civilisations Discussion Centre; the Pahlavi University; the Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Farah worked long hours at her charitable activities, from about 9 am to 9 pm every weekday.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Eventually, the Queen came to preside over a staff of 40 who handled various requests for assistance on a range of issues. She became one of the most highly visible figures in the Imperial Government and the patron of 24 educational, health and cultural organizations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Her humanitarian role earned her immense popularity for a time, particularly in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945049-2,00.html| work=Time|title=The World: Farah: The Working Empress|date=4 November 1974|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she travelled a great deal within Iran, visiting some of the more remote parts of the country and meeting with the local citizens.
Her significance was exemplified by her part in the 1967 Coronation Ceremonies, where she was crowned as the first ''[[shahbanu]]'' (empress) of modern Iran. It was again confirmed when the Shah named her as the official [[regent]] should he die or be incapacitated before the Crown Prince's 21st birthday. The naming of a woman as regent was highly unusual for a Middle Eastern or Muslim monarchy.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt; The great wealth generated by Iran's oil encouraged a sense of Iranian nationalism at the Imperial Court. The Empress Farah recalled of her days as a university student in 1950s France about being asked where she was from:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I told them Iran ... the Europeans would recoil in horror as if Iranians were barbarians and loathsome. But after Iran became wealthy under the Shah in the 1970s, Iranians were courted everywhere. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, Your Majesty. If you please, Your Majesty. Fawning all over us. Greedy sycophants. Then they loved Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;Zonis, Marvin ''Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contributions to art and culture==
[[File:Fpresayeh.jpg|thumb|left|Shahbanu Farah visiting an orphanage.]]
[[File:Roudaki Hall opening, Shah and R.E. Warren.jpg|thumb|Shah and Shahbanu opens [[Roudaki Hall]]]]
From the beginning of her reign, the Empress took an active interest in promoting culture and the arts in Iran.  Through her patronage, numerous organizations were created and fostered to further her ambition of bringing historical and contemporary Iranian Art to prominence both inside Iran and in the Western world.

In addition to her own efforts, the Empress sought to achieve this goal with the assistance of various foundations and advisers. Her ministry encouraged many forms of artistic expression, including traditional Iranian arts (such as weaving, singing, and poetry recital) as well as Western theatre. Her most recognized endeavour supporting the performing arts was her patronage of the [[Shiraz Arts Festival]]. This occasionally controversial event was held annually from 1967 until 1977 and featured live performances by both Iranian and Western artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.20 |title=The Shiraz Arts Festival: Western Avant-Garde Arts in 1970s Iran |author=Robert Gluck |website=Mitpressjournals.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of her time, however, went into the creation of museums and the building of their collections.

As a former architecture student, the Empress's appreciation of it is demonstrated in the [[Niavaran Complex|Royal Palace of Niavaran]], designed by Mohsen Foroughi, and completed in 1968: it mixes traditional Iranian architecture with 1960's contemporary design. Nearby is the personal library of the Empress, consisting of 22,000 books, comprising principally works on Western and Eastern art, philosophy and religion; the interior was designed by Aziz Farmanfarmayan.

===Ancient art===
Historically a culturally rich country, the Iran of the 1960s had little to show for it. Many of the great artistic treasures produced during its 2,500-year history had found their way into the hands of foreign museums and private collections. It became one of the Empress's principal goals to procure for Iran an appropriate collection of its own historic artifacts. To that end, she secured from her husband's government permission and funds to "buy back" a wide selection of Iranian artifacts from foreign and domestic collections. This was achieved with the help of the brothers Houshang and Mehdi Mahboubian, the most prominent Iranian antiquities dealers of the era, who advised the Empress from 1972 to 1978.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-market-mysterious-gifts-from-the-east-who-is-the-man-who-has-collected-islams-finest-treasures-and-offered-them-to-britain-as-a-pounds-1bn-bequest-geraldine-norman-finds-out-1563284.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Mysterious gifts from the East| date=13 December 1992|accessdate=16 March 2012|first=Geraldine|last=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these artifacts she founded several national museums (many of which still survive to this day) and began an Iranian version of the [[National Trust]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/07/art.iran|work=The Guardian| location=London|title=Lifting the veil|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Christopher|last=de Bellaigue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums and cultural centres created under her guidance include the Negarestan Cultural Center, the [[Reza Abbasi Museum]], the [[Khorramabad]] Museum with its valuable collection of [[Lorestān bronze]]s, the [[Carpet Museum of Iran|National Carpet Gallery]] and the [[Abgineh Museum of Tehran|Glassware and Ceramic Museum of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Pahlavi, Farah.

[[File:Fpchina.jpg|thumb|Farah in China]]

===Contemporary art===
[[File:Farah Pahlavi in Sabzevar 3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Farah Pahlavi in Jame Mosque of [[Sabzevar]]]]
Aside from building a collection of historic Iranian artifacts, the Empress also expressed interest in acquiring contemporary Western and Iranian art. To this end, she put her significant patronage behind the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The fruits of her work in founding and expanding that institution are perhaps the Empress' most enduring cultural legacy to the people of Iran.

Using funds allocated from the Government, the Empress took advantage of a somewhat depressed art market of the 1970s to purchase several important works of Western art. Under her guidance,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} the Museum acquired nearly 150 works by such artists as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Claude Monet]], [[George Grosz]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Today, the collection of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant outside Europe and the United States. According to [[Parviz Tanavoli]], a modern Iranian sculptor and a former Cultural Adviser to the Empress, that the impressive collection was amassed for "tens, not hundreds, of millions of dollars".&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; Today, the value of these holdings are conservatively estimated to be near US$2.8 billion.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=4406991&amp;page=1|title=Iran: We Will Put American Art Treasures on Display|publisher=ABC News|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection created a conundrum for the anti-western [[Islamic Revolution|Islamic Republic]] which took power after the fall of the [[Pahlavi Dynasty]] in 1979. Although politically the fundamentalist government rejected Western influence in Iran, the Western art collection amassed by the Empress was retained, most likely due to its enormous value. It was, nevertheless, not publicly displayed and spent nearly two decades in storage in the vaults of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]]. This caused much speculation as to the fate of the artwork which was only put to rest after a large portion of the collection was briefly seen again in an exhibition that took place in Tehran during September 2005.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

==Iranian Revolution==
[[File:Farah pahlavi-125462.jpg|thumb|Picture of ''[[Shahbanu]]'' Farah defaced by anti-Pahlavi protesters]]
{{further|Iranian Revolution|Causes of the Iranian Revolution}}
In Iran by early 1978, a number of factors contributed to the internal dissatisfaction with the [[Pahlavi Dynasty|Imperial Government]] becoming more pronounced.

Discontent within the country continued to escalate and later in the year led to demonstrations against the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/5/newsid_2538000/2538427.stm|work=BBC News| title=1978: Iran's PM steps down amid riots|date=5 November 1978|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahlavi wrote in her memoirs that during this time "there was an increasingly palpable sense of unease". Under these circumstances most of the Shahbanu's official activities were cancelled due to concerns for her safety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As the year came to a close, the political situation deteriorated further.  Riots and unrest grew more frequent, culminating in January 1979. The government enacted [[martial law]] in most major Iranian cities and the country was on the verge of an open revolution.

It was at this time, in response to the violent protests, that Mohammad Reza and Farah decided to leave the country. They both departed Iran via aircraft on 16 January 1979.

==After leaving Iran==
The question of where the Shah and Shahbanu would go after leaving Iran was the subject of some debate, even between the monarch and his advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Answer to History, Stein &amp; Day Pub, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, Mohammad Reza had maintained close relations with [[Egypt]]ian President [[Anwar Sadat]] and Farah had developed a close friendship with the President's wife, [[Jehan Sadat]]. The Egyptian President extended an invitation to the Imperial Couple for asylum in Egypt which they accepted.

[[File:Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his wife.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], The Shah of Iran, and his wife, Empress Farah, wave goodbye prior to boarding an aircraft after a visit to the [[United States-Iran relations|United States]].]]
Due to the political situation unfolding in Iran, many governments, including those which had been on friendly terms with the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iranian Monarchy]] prior to the revolution, saw the Shah's presence within their borders as a liability.  The [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Revolutionary Government]] in Iran had ordered the arrest (and later death) of both the Shah and the Shahbanu.  The new Iranian Government would go on to vehemently demand their extradition a number of times but the extent to which it would act in pressuring foreign powers for the deposed monarch's return (and presumably that of the Empress) was at that time unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time Magazine|title=Shah's Dilemma|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947015,00.html?promoid=googlep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial couple were aware of the potential danger which their presence carried to their hosts. In response, they left Egypt, beginning a fourteen-month long search for permanent asylum and a journey which took them through many  countries.  After [[Egypt]], they traveled to [[Morocco]], where they were briefly the guests of [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]].

After leaving [[Morocco]], the Shah and Empress were granted temporary refuge in the [[Bahamas]]. After their Bahamian visas expired and were not renewed, they made an appeal to Mexico, which was granted, and rented a villa in [[Cuernavaca]] near [[Mexico City]].

===Shah's illness===
[[File:Shah Farah Leave.jpg|thumb|left|The Shah and Shahbanu Farah shortly before leaving Iran in 1979]]
After leaving Egypt the Shah's health began a rapid decline due to a long-term battle with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. The seriousness of that illness brought the now exiled Imperial couple briefly to the [[United States]] in search of medical treatment. The couple's presence in the United States further inflamed the already tense relations between [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] and the revolutionaries in [[Tehran]]. The Shah's stay in the US, although for medical purposes, became the tipping point for renewed hostilities between the two nations. These events ultimately led to the attack and takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran in what became known as the [[Iran hostage crisis]].

Under these difficult circumstances, the Shah and Empress were not given permission to remain in the United States.  Shortly after receiving basic medical attention, the couple again departed for [[Latin America]], although this time the destination was [[Contadora Island]] in [[Panama]].

By now, both the Shah and Empress viewed the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] with some antipathy in response to a lack of support and were initially pleased to leave.  That attitude, however soured as speculation arose that the [[Panama]]nian Government was seeking to arrest the Shah in preparation for extradition to Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Time Magazine|title= The Shah's Flight|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921924-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions the Shah and Empress again made an appeal to President Anwar Sadat to return to Egypt (for her part Empress Farah writes that this plea was made through a conversation between herself and Jehan Sadat). Their request was granted and they returned to [[Egypt]] in March 1980, where they remained until the Shah's death four months later on 27 July 1980.

==Life in exile==
[[File:Farah Pahlavi 2016-03-12.JPG|thumb|Farah Pahlavi in [[Washington D.C.]] in 2016]]
After the Shah's death, the exiled Shahbanu remained in Egypt for nearly two years. [[Anwar El Sadat|President Anwar Sadat]] gave her and her family use of [[Koubbeh Palace]] in Cairo. A few months after President Sadat's [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassination]] in October 1981, the Shahbanu and her family left Egypt. President [[Ronald Reagan]] informed her that she was welcome in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Pahlavi, Farah. "An Enduring Love: My life with Shah. A Memoir" 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

She first settled in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], but later bought a home in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]].  After the death of her daughter [[Leila Pahlavi|Princess Leila]] in 2001, she purchased a smaller home in [[Potomac, Maryland]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], to be closer to her son and grandchildren. Farah now divides her time between [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Paris]]. She also makes an annual July pilgrimage to the late Shah's [[mausoleum]] at Cairo's [[al-Rifa'i Mosque]].

Farah supports charities, including the Annual Alzheimer Gala IFRAD (International Fund Raising for Alzheimer Disease) held in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/07/mar/1060.html|title=Enduring Friendship: Alain Delon and Shahbanou Farah Pahlavi at annual Alzheimer Gala in Paris|publisher=Payvand|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farah Pahlavi continues to appear at certain international royal events, such as the 2004 wedding of [[Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark]], the 2010 wedding of [[Prince Nikolaos of Greece and Denmark]], the 2011 wedding of [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] and the 2016 wedding of [[Crown Prince Leka II of Albania]].

===Grandchildren===
Farah Pahlavi currently has three grandchildren (granddaughters) through her son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran]] and his wife [[Yasmine Pahlavi|Yasmine]].

* [[Princess Noor Pahlavi]] (born 3 April 1992)
* Princess Iman Pahlavi (born 12 September 1993)
* Princess Farah Pahlavi (born 17 January 2004)

Farah Pahlavi also has one granddaughter through her late son [[Alireza Pahlavi II|Alireza Pahlavi]] and his companion Raha Didevar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezapahlavi.org/details_article.php?english&amp;article=535|title=Announcement of Birth|publisher=Reza Pahlavi|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930111308/http://www.rezapahlavi.org/details_article.php?english&amp;article=535|archivedate=30 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoir===
In 2003, Farah Pahlavi wrote a book about her marriage to Mohammad Reza entitled ''[[An Enduring Love: My Life with the Shah]]''.  The publication of the former Empress's memoirs attracted international interest. It was a best-seller in Europe, with excerpts appearing in news magazines and the author appearing on talk shows and in other media outlets. However, opinion about the book, which ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called "a candid, straightforward account" and ''the [[Washington Post]]'' called "engrossing", was mixed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Elaine Sciolino]], ''[[The New York Times]]'''s Paris bureau chief, gave the book a less than flattering review, describing it as "well translated" but "full of anger and bitterness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elaine |last=Sciolino|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/books/the-last-empress.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=The Last Empress|newspaper= The New York Times|date= 2 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; But ''[[National Review|National Review's]]'' [[Reza Bayegan]], an Iranian writer, praised the memoir as "abound[ing] with affection and sympathy for her countrymen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Reza |last=Bayegan|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/210633/shah-she/reza-bayegan|title=The Shah &amp; She|publisher= National Review|date=13 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentaries and theater play===
In 2009 the Persian-Swedish director [[Nahid Persson Sarvestani]] released a [[feature film|feature length]] documentary about Farah Pahlavi's life, entitled ''[[The Queen and I (film)|The Queen and I]]''. The film was screened in various International film festivals such as [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam|IDFA]] and  [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sundance.org/films/5861|title=The Queen and I|work=sundance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Dutch director Kees Roorda made a theater play inspired by the life of Farah Pahlavi in exile. In the play Liz Snoijink acted as Farah Diba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farah Diba, World's Prettiest Woman: Premiere in Haarlem|url=http://iranian.com/main/blog/pejman7/premiere-farah-diba-holland|publisher= iranian.com|year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4399">'''Film rights''' are rights under [[copyright]] law to produce a [[film]] as a [[derivative work]] of a given item of [[intellectual property]]. In [[US law]], these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or "[[option (filmmaking)|option]]") them to someone in the film industry—usually a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]], or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as "exhibition rights" or "public-performance rights".

==Origins==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from [[case law]].  In 1907, the [[Kalem Company]] produced a one-reel [[silent film]] version of General [[Lew Wallace]]'s [[novel]] ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' without first securing film rights.  Wallace's estate and his American publisher, [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] sued for [[copyright infringement]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the [[precedent]] that all adaptations are subject to copyright.

== Options ==
When producers '''option''' a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property.  A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it "greenlit".    Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.

The contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.

== Chain of title ==
As it is common for scripts to be stuck in [[development hell]], the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights.  This lineage is referred to as the [[chain of title]].  This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided.  Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.

In some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights.  It is important for an [[entertainment lawyer]] to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.

[[File:210 11th Av 25 St jeh.jpg|thumb|210 11th Avenue]]
The '''Fischbach Gallery''' is an [[art gallery]] in  [[New York City]]. It was founded by [[Marilyn Cole Fischbach]] in 1960 at 799 [[Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Marilyn Fischbach, 72, Art Gallery Founder | work = New York Times | date = June 20, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E0DA1E38F933A15755C0A9659C8B63 | accessdate = September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The gallery in its early days became known for hosting the first significant solo exhibitions of now leading art world figures including [[Alex Katz]] and [[Eva Hesse]].  [[Knox Martin]] had four solo shows at the gallery in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knoxmartin.com/exhibitions.html Knox Martin – Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;The Fischbach Gallery would later move to two consecutive locations on 57th Street. In the 1970s Marilyn Fischbach hired Aladar Marberger as gallery director. Marberger shifted the gallery's emphasis from [[Avant-Garde]] Art to [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Glueck | first = Grace | title = A. A. Marberger, 41, Art Dealer Who Directed Fischbach Gallery | work = New York Times | date = November 3, 1988 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D61331F930A35752C1A96E948260 | accessdate = September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery included artists [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Ian Hornak]] and [[Neil Welliver]].

In the early 1980s, Marilyn Fischbach decided to take on three additional investors in the gallery, although she remained a partial owner until her death in 2003. One of the investors, Beverly Zagor, became an active partner until her death in May 2011. Another investor and active partner, Lawrence L. DiCarlo, is gallery director.

The Fischbach Gallery remains open and has relocated to 210 Eleventh Avenue in New York. It focuses primarily on contemporary [[realism (visual arts)|realism]].

'''Gilles Deleuze''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|l|uː|z}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒil dəløz|lang}}; 18 January 1925&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1960s until his death in 1995, wrote on [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[film]], and [[fine art]]. His most popular works were the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'': ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]].  His metaphysical treatise ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 February 2011}} See also: "''Difference and Repetition'' is definitely the most important work published by Deleuze." (Edouard Morot-Sir, from the back cover of the first edition of the English translation), or James Williams' judgment: "It is nothing less than a revolution in philosophy and stands out as one of the great philosophical works of the twentieth century" (James Williams, ''Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Critical Introduction and Guide'' [Edinburgh UP, 2003], p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], citing [[Bernard Williams]]'s criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the "greatest philosophers".&lt;ref name="Moore" &gt;[[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=vo-ZLmfwe_oC&amp;pg=PA543  ''The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things''], Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 543: 'intellectual power and depth; a grasp of the sciences; a sense of the political, and of human destructiveness as well as creativity; a broad range and a fertile imagination; an unwillingness to settle for the superficially reassuring; and, in an unusually lucky case, the gifts of a great writer.'&lt;/ref&gt; His work has influenced a variety of disciplines across philosophy and art, including [[literary theory]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name="See 1991"&gt;See, for example, [[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]], ''Postmodern Theory'' (Guilford Press, 1991), which devotes a chapter to Deleuze and Guattari.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in [[Paris]] and lived there for most of his life. His initial schooling was undertaken during [[World War II]], during which time he attended the [[Lycée Carnot]]. He also spent a year in [[khâgne]] at the [[Lycée Henri IV]]. During the [[Nazi occupation of France]], Deleuze's older brother, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the [[French Resistance]], and died while in transit to a concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Dosse]], ''Gilles Deleuze and [[Felix Guattari]]: Intersecting Lives'', trans. Deborah Glassman (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[Ferdinand Alquié]], and [[Maurice de Gandillac]], and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers. In addition, Deleuze found the work of non-academic writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attractive.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogues'', p. 12: "At the Liberation we were still strangely stuck in the history of philosophy. We simply plunged into [[Hegel]], [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]]; we threw ourselves like puppies into a scholasticism worse than that of the [[Medieval France|Middle Ages]]. Fortunately there was [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. Sartre was our Outside, he was really the breath of fresh air from the backyard."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
Deleuze passed the [[agrégation]] in philosophy in 1948, and taught at various [[Secondary education in France|lycées]] (Amiens, Orléans, [[Lycée Louis le Grand|Louis le Grand]]) until 1957, when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953, he published his first monograph, ''Empiricism and Subjectivity'', on [[David Hume]]. This monograph was based on his DES thesis (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) which was conducted under the direction of Hyppolite and Canguilhem.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Voss, ''Conditions of Thought: Deleuze and Transcendental Ideas'', Edinburgh University Press, 2013, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the [[French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]]. During this time he published the seminal ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'' (1962) and befriended [[Michel Foucault]]. From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the [[University of Lyon]]. In 1968 he published his two dissertations, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (supervised by Gandillac) and ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (supervised by Alquié).

In 1969 he was appointed to the [[University of Paris VIII]] at Vincennes/St. Denis, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of talented scholars, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]]. Deleuze taught at [[Vincennes]] until his retirement in 1987.

He married Denise Paul "Fanny" Grandjouan in 1956. When once asked to talk about his life, he replied: "Academics' lives are seldom interesting."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus:

{{quote|What do you know about me, given that I believe in secrecy?&amp;nbsp;... If I stick where I am, if I don't travel around, like anyone else I make my inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions, and express very obliquely and circuitously in what I write.&amp;nbsp;... Arguments from one's own privileged experience are bad and reactionary arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
Deleuze, who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age,&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Deleuze and Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', trans D. Glassman, CUP 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; developed [[tuberculosis]] in 1968 and underwent a [[thoracoplasty]] (lung removal).&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Deleuze and Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', trans D. Glassman, CUP 2010, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ammppu.org/litterature/deleuze.htm#(4) Gilles Deleuze et les médecins]&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. On November 4, 1995, he committed suicide, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156476/Gilles-Deleuze|title=Gilles Deleuze|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his death, Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled ''La Grandeur de Marx'' (''The Greatness of Marx''), and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled ''Ensembles and Multiplicities'' (these chapters have been published as the essays "Immanence: A Life" and "The Actual and the Virtual").&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', pp. 454–455.  "Immanence: A Life" has been translated and published in ''Pure Immanence'' and ''Two Regimes of Madness'', while "The Actual and Virtual" has been translated and published as an appendix to the second edition of ''Dialogues''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the cemetery of the village of [[Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccnoblat.fr/otsi_v2/images/publications/guides/Saint%20Leonard%20de%20Noblat.pdf Communauté de Communes de Noblat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018104643/http://www.ccnoblat.fr/otsi_v2/images/publications/guides/Saint%20Leonard%20de%20Noblat.pdf |date=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Deleuze's works fall into two groups: on one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers ([[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Michel Foucault]]) and artists ([[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e.g., difference, sense, events, schizophrenia, cinema, philosophy).

=== Metaphysics&lt;!--'Transcendental empiricism' and 'Transcendental Empiricism' redirect here--&gt; ===
Deleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and [[Difference (poststructuralism)|difference]]. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that "X is different from Y" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, "given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus."&lt;ref&gt;"Bergson's Conception of Difference", in ''Desert Islands'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as "X" are composed of endless series of differences, where "X" = "the difference between x and x'", and "x'" = "the difference between...", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls "difference in itself." "If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its ''internal difference''."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls "the virtual". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: "real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.")&lt;ref&gt;Proust, ''Le Temps Retrouvé'', ch. III.&lt;/ref&gt; While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble [[Plato]]'s forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. "The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Method of Dramatization" in ''Desert Islands'', and "Actual and Virtual" in ''Dialogues II''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a '''transcendental empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang|fr|empirisme transcendantal}}), alluding to Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', Continuum, 2004[1968], pp. 56 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Parr (ed.), ''The Deleuze Dictionary (Revised Edition)'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, p. 289: "Unlike Kant, Deleuze does not conceive of [...] unthought conditions as abstract or necessary philosophical entities, but as contingent tendencies beyond the reach of empirical consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see ''[[#Epistemology|Epistemology]]'').

Simultaneously, Deleuze claims that [[univocity of being|being is univocal]], i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] [[univocity]]'' from the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]]. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that "God is good", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that "God is good", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says "Jane is good". That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as [[good and evil|goodness]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[reason]], and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.

Deleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. "With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one [[substance theory|substance]], [[God]] or [[Nature]]. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating [[process philosophy|process]], an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula "[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] = [[monism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Thousand Plateaus'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), a "[[body without organs]]"; in ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991), a "[[plane of immanence]]" or "chaosmos".

=== Epistemology ===
Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical [[epistemology]], or what he calls a transformation of "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Edmund Husserl]], misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. "Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of [[concept]]s. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's [[theory of forms|ideas]], Descartes's ''[[cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'', or Kant's doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept "posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created."&lt;ref&gt;''What Is Philosophy?'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of [[John Locke]] or [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).

In his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls "[[percept]]s" and "[[Affect (philosophy)|affects]]"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the [[speed of light]] or [[absolute zero]] (which Deleuze calls "functives"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, "separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 125. Cf. Spinoza's claim that the mind and the body are different modes expressing the same substance.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as "is it true?" or "what is it?", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: "what does it do?" or "how does it work?"&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 21: "We're strict functionalists: what we're interested in is how something works".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Values&lt;!--'Society of control', 'Societies of control' and 'Socius (philosophy)' redirect here--&gt; ===
In ethics and politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract [[natural rights]] or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word "individual" suggests). Guided by the [[Ethical naturalism|naturalistic ethics]] of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69-79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980)), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of "[[desiring-production]]" (a concept combining features of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] drives and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Labour economics|labor]]) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and [[capitalism]] (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following [[Karl Marx]], welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.  

The first part of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' undertakes a [[universal history]] and posits the existence of a separate '''socius'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the social body that takes credit for [[Production (economics)|production]]) for each [[mode of production]]: the earth for the [[tribe]], the body of the [[Despotism|despot]] for the [[empire]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] for [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 July 2018}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 essay "Postscript on the Societies of Control" ("Post-scriptum sur les sociétés de contrôle"), Deleuze builds on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as "masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'." The mechanisms of modern '''societies of control'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|title=Postscript on the Societies of Control|journal=MIT Press|date=October 1992|volume=59|pages=3–7|jstor=778828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or [[Immanence|immanent]]: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. "Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?"&lt;ref&gt;''Essays Critical and Clinical'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deleuze's interpretations ===
Deleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', for example, Deleuze claims that Nietzsche's ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887) is an attempt to rewrite Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781),&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the ''Genealogy'', and the ''Genealogy'''s moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kant's book. Likewise, Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as "[[buggery]] (''enculage'')", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 6. See also: Daniel W. Smith, "The Inverse Side of the Structure: Zizek on Deleuze on Lacan", ''Criticism'' (2004): "Deleuze's all-too-well-known image of philosophical "buggery," which makes thinkers produce their own "monstrous" children"; Robert Sinnerbrink (in "Nomadology or Ideology? Zizek’s Critique of Deleuze", ''Parrhesia'' 1 (2006): 62–87) describes the "popular topic" of Deleuze's "notorious remarks"; Donald Callen (in "The Difficult Middle", ''Rhizomes'' 10 (Spring 2005)) describes "intellectual buggery" as "what Deleuze himself famously said about his encounters with the works of other philosophers." Deleuze's buggery analogy is also cited by, among many others, Brian Massumi, ''A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' (MIT Press, 1992), p. 2; Slavoj Žižek, ''Organs without Bodies'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 48; Ian Buchanan, ''A Deleuzian Century?'' (Duke UP, 1999), p. 8; Jean-Jacques Lecercle, ''Deleuze and Language'' (Macmillan, 2002), p. 37; [[Gregg Lambert]], ''The Non-Philosophy of Gilles Deleuze'' (Continuum, 2002), p. x; Claire Colebrook, ''Understanding Deleuze'' (Allen &amp; Unwin, 2003), p. 73; and Charles Stivale, ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'' (McGill-Queen's, 2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's ''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|Study after Velázquez]]''—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon "gets Velasquez wrong".&lt;ref&gt;''Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation'', pp. 46f: "[Bacon] let loose ... presences" already in Velázquez's painting. Cf. the passage cited above, from ''Negotiations'', p. 136: "The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say."&lt;/ref&gt; Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, ''pace'' critics such as [[Alan Sokal]]: "I'm not saying that [[Alain Resnais|Resnais]] and [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]], or [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] and [[René Thom|Thom]], are doing the same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of "left-wing Nietzscheanism" as an intellectual stance.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the approving reference to Deleuze's Nietzsche study in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay "''Différance''", or [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s monograph ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle'', dedicated to Deleuze. More generally, see D. Allison (ed.), ''The New Nietzsche'' (MIT Press, 1985), and L. Ferry and A. Renaut (eds.), ''Why We Are Not Nietzscheans'' (University of Chicago Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  His books ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969) led [[Michel Foucault]] to declare that "one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, "Theatrum Philosophicum", ''Critique'' 282, p. 885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was "a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 4. However, in a later interview, Deleuze commented: "I don't know what Foucault meant, I never asked him" (''Negotiations'', p. 88).&lt;/ref&gt;)  In the 1970s, the ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes in the same sentence: "one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the [[Socius (philosophy)|socius]]" (''Anti-Oedipus'', p. 347).&lt;/ref&gt; offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, and dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]].  In 1994 and 1995, ''[[L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze]]'', an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and [[Claire Parnet]], aired on France's [[Arte]] Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langlab.wayne.edu/CStivale/D-G/ABC1.html An English language summary can be found here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's books were translated into English.  Deleuze's work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his contemporaries Foucault, [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], Deleuze's influence has been most strongly felt in North American humanities departments, particularly in [[literary theory]], where ''Anti-Oedipus'' and ''A Thousand Plateaus'' are oft regarded as major statements of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]],&lt;ref name="See 1991"/&gt; though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms. Likewise in the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Simon Glendinning, ''The Idea of Continental Philosophy'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze has attracted critics as well. The following list is not exhaustive, and gives only the briefest of summaries.

Among French philosophers, [[Vincent Descombes]] argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'') is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in ''Anti-Oedipus'' is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descombes|first=Vincent|title=Modern French Philosophy|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-29672-2|pages=155–6, 175–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Pascal Engel]], Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: "When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith (ed.), ''European Philosophy and the American Academy'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alain Badiou]] claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom [[monism|monist]]. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic [[fatalism]] akin to ancient [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Deleuze: the clamor of being|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=0-8166-3139-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European philosophers have criticized Deleuze's theory of subjectivity.  For example, [[Manfred Frank]] claims that Deleuze's theory of [[individuation]] as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Manfred|title=What Is Neostructuralism?|year=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=385|isbn=978-0816616022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slavoj Žižek]] claims that Deleuze's [[ontology]] oscillates between [[materialism]] and [[idealism]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''Organs without Bodies'', 2004, pp. 19–32, esp. p. 21: "Is this opposition not, yet again, that of materialism versus idealism? In Deleuze, this means ''The Logic of Sense'' versus ''Anti-Oedipus''." See also p. 28 for "Deleuze's oscillation between the two models" of becoming.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Deleuze of ''Anti-Oedipus'' ("arguably Deleuze's worst book"),&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; the "political" Deleuze under the "'bad' influence" of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as "the ideologist of late capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, pp. 32, 20, and 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to "just another" substance and thereby failing to grasp the [[nothingness]] that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines [[subjectivity]]. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to Žižek's own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, p. 68: "This brings us to the topic of the ''subject'' that, according to Lacan, emerges in the interstice of the 'minimal difference,' in the minimal gap between two signifiers. In this sense, the subject is 'a nothingness, a void, which exists.' ... This, then, is what Deleuze seems to get wrong in his reduction of the subject to (just another) substance. Far from belonging to the level of actualization, of distinct entities in the order of constituted reality, the dimension of the 'subject' designates the ''reemergence of the virtual within the order of actuality''. 'Subject' names the unique space of the explosion of virtuality within constituted reality."&lt;/ref&gt;

English-speaking philosophers have also criticized aspects of Deleuze's work. [[Stanley Rosen]] objects to Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche's [[eternal return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-49546-6|pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Todd May]] argues that Deleuze's claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i.e., his monism. However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a [[Wittgenstein]]ian [[holism]] without significantly altering his practical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Pennsylvania State Univ Pr| isbn = 978-0-271-01657-3| last = May| first = Todd| title = Reconsidering Difference: Nancy, Derrida, Levinas, and Deleuze| date = 1997-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Peter Hallward]] argues that Deleuze's insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material, actual conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze's thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the [[theophany|theophanic]] self-creation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallward|first=Peter|title=Out of This World|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=New York|isbn=978-1844675555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (1997), physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they don't object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being "abused" by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the "abuse" of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze's wider contributions.&lt;ref name="SokalBricmont1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Sokal|author2=Jean Bricmont|title=Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM8zAd3z3ugC|date=29 October 1999|publisher=St Martins Press (ny)|isbn=978-0-312-20407-5|pages=22–25, 154–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuntu Repertory Theatre''' was a primarily student-based, [[African American|African-American]] [[repertory theatre]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. 

Dr. [[Vernell A. Lillie]] founded it in 1974 at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] as a way of showcasing the playwright [[Rob Penny]]. The next year Penny's friend, [[August Wilson]], brought his play ''Homecoming'' to Kuntu; it was his first play to be produced by a resident company. The theater group remained part of the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Africana Studies through the 2010-2011 season when Lillie retired as a professor at Pitt.&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/theater-dance/curtain-falls-on-kuntu-repertory-theatre-684728/|title=Curtain falls on Pittsburgh's Kuntu Repertory Theatre|first=Mackenzie|last=Carpenter|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=April 24, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson, Penny, and poet [[Maisha Baton]] also started the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring African-American writers together in discussion and to assist them in publication and production. 

The Kuntu Repertory Theatre has won multiple awards, including several Onyx and People's Choice awards from the African American Council of Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05178/528952-42.stm | title=African American Council of Arts presents awards for achievement | first=Phillip A. | last=Stephenson | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2005-06-27 | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=541 | title=ONYX Awards For Pitt’s Kuntu Rep | first=Stephanie C. | last=Lilavois | newspaper=Pitt Chronicle | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2007-07-23 | accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has also participated in the [[Pittsburgh New Works Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/magazine/19990910newworks5.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first1=John | last1=Hayes | title=The New Works Festival has become a must-see event}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuntu's primary venues when based at the University of Pittsburgh were the [[Stephen Foster Memorial]], and later, through the 2010-11 season, the seventh-floor auditorium of the university's [[Alumni Hall (University of Pittsburgh)|Alumni Hall]]. In 2011 Kuntu moved to a new home at the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]]'s Homewood branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newpittsburghcourieronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5938:kuntu-splits-from-pitt&amp;catid=44:entertainment&amp;Itemid=48 | work=New Pittsburgh Courier | first1=Genea | last1=Webb | title=Kuntu splits from Pitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12025/1205678-500.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first1=Christopher | last1=Rawson | title=Creativity shines through despite tight staging in Kuntu's 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to funding difficulties, the Kuntu Repertory Theatre announced it was closing after the 2012-2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/theater-dance/kuntu-repertory-theatre-to-shut-down-after-current-season-684674/|title=Kuntu Repertory Theatre to shut down after current season|first=Mackenzie|last=Carpenter|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spleen et ideal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Spleen et idéal'', by [[Carlos Schwabe]], 1907]]
'''''Le Spleen de Paris''''', also known as '''''Paris Spleen''''' or '''''Petits Poèmes en prose''''', is a collection of 50 short [[prose poetry|prose poems]] by [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The collection was published posthumously in 1869 and is associated with [[literary modernism]].

Baudelaire mentions he had read [[Aloysius Bertrand]]'s ''[[Gaspard de la Nuit (book)|Gaspard de la nuit]]'' (considered the first example of prose poetry) at least twenty times before starting this work. Though inspired by Bertrand, Baudelaire's prose poems were based on Parisian contemporary life instead of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] background which Bertrand employed. He said of his work: "These are [[Les Fleurs du mal|the flowers of evil]] again, but with more freedom, much more detail, and much more mockery." Indeed, many of the themes and even titles from Baudelaire's earlier collection ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' are revisited in this work.

These poems have no particular order, have no beginning and no end and they can be read like thoughts or short stories in a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] style. The point of the poems is "to capture the beauty of life in the modern city," using what [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] has labeled as being his [[Existentialism|existential]] outlook on his surroundings.

Published twenty years after the fratricidal [[June Days uprising|June Days]] that ended the ideal or "brotherly" [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]], Baudelaire makes no attempts at trying to reform society he has grown up in but realizes the inequities of the progressing modernization of Paris. In poems such as "The Eyes of the Poor" where he writes (after witnessing an impoverished family looking in on a new cafe): "Not only was I moved by that family of eyes, but I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and decanters, larger than our thirst...", showing his feelings of despair and class guilt.

The title of the work refers not to the abdominal organ (the [[spleen]]) but rather to the second, more literary meaning of the word, "melancholy with no apparent cause, characterised by a disgust with everything".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from ''Le Nouveau Petit Robert 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major themes in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' ==

=== Pleasure ===
''Le Spleen de Paris'' explores the idea of pleasure as a vehicle for expressing emotion. Many of the poems refer to sex or sin explicitly (i.e. "Double Bedroom," "A Hemisphere in a Head of Hair", "Temptations"); others use subtle language and imagery to evoke sensuality (i.e. "the Artist's Confiteor"). In both cases, the diction is undeniably sexual; for example, in "Double Bedroom", "Muslin rains abundantly over the windows and around the bed in a snowy cascade. Within this bed is ensconced the Idol, queen of dreams."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=9}} Baudelaire's obsession with pleasure reflects his love for scandal and wickedness, as well as his philosophy that by seeking pleasure, man taps into his authentic "evil" self.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Joanna. Baudelaire. St. Martin's Press: New York, 1994. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sobriety and intoxication ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems openly advocate drinking and intoxication, such as "Be Drunk". Intoxication (or any equal pleasure such as creative work, sex, virtue, etc.) creates a euphoria and timelessness that allows you to transcend the limitations of time and truly live "in the moment". In "Be Drunk", the speaker commands the reader to engage in something intoxicating: "You must be drunk always... Time crushes your shoulders and bends you earthward, you must be drunk without respite."{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=71}} Sobriety, in contrast, forces you to address the harsh realities of the world around you. However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by some critics, who claim that Baudelaire was actually being ironic in his advocacy for drunkenness. Maria Scott, a literary scholar, claims that Baudelaire believed "artificial toxication was ... far inferior to 'successive work' and the 'regular exercise of will', that artificial stimulants ... actually ''amplify'' time."{{sfn|Scott|2005|pp=196–197}} Thus, it is debatable whether intoxication refers to literal drunkenness as an escape or if symbolizes the pleasure found in writing and expressing oneself.

=== The artist/poet ===
In ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the concept of artist and poet intermingle. Baudelaire saw poetry as a form of art, and thus in many of the prose poems the artist is a substitute for a traditional poet or speaker. In "The Desire to Paint", the artist attempts to depict his beautiful muse with images, just as the poet attempts to express his emotions with language. The relationship between the artist and poet reflects the need to evoke a particular feeling or idea, and this thread is carried through almost every single poem in the text. Ultimately, the artist and the poet become one, since they share the same purpose – to describe beauty. In this sense, the work itself (and every individual poem within) is beautiful, a "work of art" due to its innovative, interesting form. Thus, the poem, according to Baudelaire, is as much an "aesthetic experience" as it is a literary one.&lt;ref&gt;Hiddleston, J. A. ''Baudelaire and Le Spleen de Paris''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Women are both admired and ridiculed in ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Some poems, such as "The Desire to Paint", reflect female power and sexuality in a somewhat positive manner. However, a larger portion of the poems in Baudelaire's work debase women as evil, gaudy, and cold. Many are represented as prostitutes, and according to scholars, "the courtesan would seem to be a virtual incarnation, for Baudelaire, of all that is artificial and misleading."{{sfn|Scott|2005|p=54}} In "The Rope", the speaker's apprentice hangs himself, and his mother comes to collect the rope. The speaker is shocked to discover that she did so not to "preserve them as horrible and precious relics", but to sell them for a morbid profit.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|pp=62–64}} Baudelaire rejects the concept of maternal love and replaces it with a cold economic reality. Still, women are inherently sexual, and in some regards, Baudelaire admires their sensual beauty (connects back to themes of intoxication, pleasure).

=== Mortality and the passage of time ===
Many of Baudelaire's prose poems are dominated by the concept of time, usually negatively. The speaker in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' fears the passage of time and his/her own mortality. As a result, intoxication, women, pleasure, and writing are all forms of escape from this unavoidable hell. "Be Drunk" and "Already!" exemplify Baudelaire's infatuation with the idea of time. In "Already!" the speaker is incapable of matching the infiniteness and simplicity of nature, and at the end, comes face to face with his own death: "I felt pulled down deathwards; which is why, when companions said, 'At last!' I could only cry, '''Already!''"{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=73}} Also, this theme supports Baudelaire's admiration of art and poetry because although man cannot defeat time and death, a work of art can. Art, poetry, life, and death are inextricably linked within Baudelaire's poems, and perhaps reflect a personal obsession with mortality.

===The city===
For Baudelaire, the setting of most poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is the Parisian metropolis, specifically the poorer areas within the city. Notable poems within ''Le Spleen de Paris'' whose urban setting is important include “Crowds” and “The Old Mountebank.” Within his writing about city life, Baudelaire seems to stress the relationship between individual and society, frequently placing the speaker in a reflective role looking out at the city. It is also important to note that Baudelaire's Paris is not one of nice shops and beautiful streets. Instead, Baudelaire focuses on dirty, poverty-stricken areas of Paris with social problems rather than the Paris of the upper class.

===Poverty/class===
In connection with the theme of the Parisian metropolis, Baudelaire focuses heavily on the theme of poverty and social class within ''Le Spleen de Paris''. Important poems from the collection which embody these themes include "The Toy of the Poor", "The Eyes of the Poor", "Counterfeit Money", and "Let's Beat Up the Poor". In these poems Baudelaire introduces slightly differing views of the urban poor. In "The Toy of the Poor" Baudelaire heavily stresses the need for equality between social classes in Paris. In comparison, "Counterfeit Money" and "Let's Beat Up the Poor" seem to use a sarcastic tone to instil empathy in the reader for those people in poverty. In [[Michael Hamburger]]'s introduction to his translation, ''Twenty Prose Poems of Baudelaire'', the scholar notes a highly sympathetic view of the poor in ''Le Spleen de Paris''; Baudelaire seems to relate to the poor and becomes an advocate for them in his poetry.{{sfn|Hamburger|1946|pp=vii–xii}}

===Religion/good vs. evil===
Many poems in ''Le Spleen de Paris'' incorporate a central theme of religion or the relationship between good and evil in human nature. "Cake", which centers on a moral battle addressing the question of whether humans are inherently good or evil stands out as an especially important poem within the collection. "Loss of a Halo" also incorporates similar themes, literally discussing the role of angels as well as the relationship between mankind and religious ideology, questioning the goodness of Christian ideals. Along these lines, Baudelaire repeatedly addresses the theme of sin within his poetry as well as questioning how the hierarchy of class could affect the hierarchy of goodness, implying that those of higher social class tend not to be morally superior to those of lower classes. Many critics of Baudelaire address the prominent role of religion in the poet's life and how that might have affected his writing. Some suspect that since Baudelaire internalized Christian practices, he thought himself capable of accurately portraying God in his writing. Yet by representing God's message within his poetry, Baudelaire placed himself in a position of patriarchal authority, similar to that of the God depicted in Christianity.

==Poet/reader relationship==
The following passage is taken from the preface to the 2008 Mackenzie translation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', entitled "To Arsène Houssaye":

{{quote|My dear friend, I send you here a little work of which no one could say that it has neither head nor tail, because, on the contrary, everything in it is both head and tail, alternately and reciprocally. Please consider what fine advantages this combination offers to all of us, to you, to me, and to the reader. We can cut whatever we like—me, my reverie, you, the manuscript, and the reader, his reading; for I don't tie the impatient reader up in the endless thread of a superfluous plot. Pull out one of the vertebrae, and the two halves of this tortuous fantasy will rejoin themselves painlessly. Chop it up into numerous fragments, and you'll find that each one can live on its own. In the hopes that some of these stumps will be lively enough to please and amuse you, I dedicate the entire serpent to you.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=3}}}}

While writing ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire made very conscious decisions regarding his relationship with his readers. As seen in the preface to the collection, addressed to his publisher, Arsène Houssaye, Baudelaire attempted to write a text that was very accessible to a reader while pulling the most appealing aspects of both prose and poetry and combining them into the revolutionary genre of prose poetry. For Baudelaire, the accessibility of the text and ability for a reader to set down the book and pick it up much later was crucial, especially considering his implied opinions of his readers. Baudelaire's tone throughout the preface, "The Dog and the Vial" as well as other poems throughout ''Le Spleen de Paris'' seem to illustrate Baudelaire's opinions of superiority over his readers. In "The Dog and the Vial", a man offers his dog a vial of fancy perfume to smell and the dog reacts in horror, instead wishing to sniff more seemingly unappealing smells, specifically excrement. The poem concludes with the frustration of the speaker with his dog, expressed as the speaker states: "In this respect you, unworthy companion of my sad life, resemble the public, to whom one must never present the delicate scents that only exasperate them, but instead give them only dung, chosen with care".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=14}} One can extrapolate this poem to apply more figuratively to the larger themes of the poet-reader relationship, in which Baudelaire deprecates his readers, viewing them as unintelligent and incapable of appreciating his work.

== Style ==
''Le Spleen de Paris'' represents a definitive break from traditional poetic forms. The text is composed of "prose poems" which span the continuum between "prosaic" and "poetic" works. The new, unconventional form of poetry was characteristic of the modernist movement occurring throughout Europe (and particularly in Paris) at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marshall. "Baudelaire: Modernism in the Streets." ''All that is Solid Melts Into Air: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Penguin Group Inc., 1988. 148. Google Books. 2009. 21 May 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mox1ywiyhtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''Le Spleen de Paris'', Baudelaire describes that modernity requires a new language, "a miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and striking enough to suit lyrical movements of the soul, undulations of reverie, the flip-flops of consciousness", and in this sense, ''Le Spleen de Paris'' gives life to modern language.{{sfn|Waldrop|2009|p=3}} Baudelaire's prose poetry tends to be more poetic in comparison to later works such as Ponge's [[Le parti pris des choses]], but each poem varies. For an example of a more poetic poem, see "Evening Twilight"; for a prosaic example, see "The Bad Glazier".

== Publication history, influences, and critical reception ==
Baudelaire's ''Le Spleen de Paris'' is unique in that it was published posthumously by his sister in 1869, two years after Baudelaire died. In fact, it was not until his waning years, plagued by physical ailments and the contraction of syphilis that he created a table of contents for the book. Baudelaire spent years 1857 to 1867 working on his book of poems that chronicled daily life in the city of Paris. These poems aimed at capturing the times in which they were written, from the brutally repressed upheavals of 1848 (after which the government censored literature more than ever), the 1851 ''coup d'état'' of Louis Bonaparte and generally Paris of the 1850s, demolished and renovated by Napoleon III's prefect, Baron Haussman. In displaying the social antagonisms of the age, Baudelaire drew influence from many great artists of the time. In fact, an active critical essayist himself, his critical reviews of other poets "elucidate the recesses of the mind that created ''Les Fleurs du Mal'' and ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

'''Influence:''' While there is much speculation regarding direct influence and inspiration in the creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris'', the following colleagues seem to have clearly influenced the book of small poems:

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]: "Indeed, Poe illustrates his claim with several examples which seem to summarize with uncanny precision the temperament of Baudelaire himself (Poe 273–4).{{Incomplete short citation|date=August 2018}} The affinity between the two writers in this regard seems beyond dispute ... Moreover, 'Le Démon de la perversité' is less a tale than a prose poem, and both its subject-matter and its movement from general considerations to specific examples leading to an unexpected conclusion may have influenced Baudelaire in his creation of ''Le Spleen de Paris''."

Aloysius Betrand's ''Gaspard de la nuit'': Baudelaire himself is quoted as citing this work as an inspiration for ''Paris Spleen''.

Gustave Flaubert: Magazine article "No ideas but in Crowds: Baudelaire's ''Paris Spleen''" cites similarities between the writers in that like Baudelaire, Flaubert held the same motives and intentions in that he too wanted "to write the moral history of the men of my generation – or, more accurately, the history of their feelings."

'''Critical reception:''' The way in which the poem was received certainly lends to understanding the climate in which Baudelaire created ''Le Spleen de Paris'', in that "It appears to be almost a diary entry, an explicit rundown of the day's events; those events seem to be precisely the kind that Charles Baudelaire would have experienced in the hectic and hypocritical world of the literary marketplace of his day."

Notable critical reception: In order to truly understand how ''Le Spleen de Paris'' was received, one must first be acquainted with Baudelaire's earlier works. The repressions and upheavals of 1848 resulted in massive censorship of literature, which did not bode well for Baudelaire's perhaps most famous work, ''Les Fleurs du Mal''. Society was so shocked by the satanic references and sexual perversion in the book that at the time it was a critical and popular failure. This put the anticipated reception of ''Le Spleen de Paris'' at a disadvantage. Like ''Flowers of Evil'', it wasn't until much later that ''Paris Spleen'' was fully appreciated for what it was, a masterpiece that "brought the style of the prose poem to the broader republics of the people". That being said, just four years after Arthur Rimbaud used Baudelaire's work as a foundation for his poems, as he considered Baudelaire a great poet and pioneer of prose.

'''Appearance in Media:''' A 2006 film ''Spleen'', written by Eric Bomba-Ire, borrowed its title from Baudelaire's book of prose poems. Baudelaire expressed a particular feeling that he called 'Spleen' which is a mixture of melancholy, rage, eros, and resignation, which ties in well with the movie's darkly woven tale of love, betrayal and passion.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0816659|Spleen|(2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable quotations==
{{importance section|date=April 2013}}
In "Let us beat up the poor", Baudelaire makes up a parable about economic and social equality: no one is entitled to it; it belongs to those who can win it and keep it. And he taunts the social reformer: "What do you think of that, Proudhon?"{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=36}}

"At One in the Morning" is like a diary entry, a rundown of the day's events. In it, Baudelaire recognizes that he is part of a society full of hypocrites. His individual self becomes "blurred...by a hypocrisy and perverseness which progressively undermine the difference between the self and others." This is at least partly what Baudelaire meant by "a modern and more abstract life."{{sfn|Hill|2006}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

"The Thyrsus" is a piece addressed to composer [[Franz Liszt]]. The ancient Greek thyrsus had connotations of "unleashed sexuality and violence, of the profound power of the irrational." Baudelaire believed the thyrsus to be an acceptable object of representation for Liszt's music.

In "The Bad Windowpane Maker" Baudelaire speaks of a "kind of energy that springs from ennui and reverie" that manifests itself in a particularly unexpected way in the most inactive dreamers. Doctors and moralists alike are at a loss to explain where such mad energy so suddenly comes from to these lazy people, why they suddenly feel the need to perform such absurd and dangerous deeds.{{sfn|Hill|2006|p=56}}

The prefatory letter Baudelaire wrote to Arsene Houssaye, the editor of ''La Presse'', was not necessarily intended to be included in the publication. When Baudelaire drew up his table of contents for the projected book form, he did not include the letter. It is possible, then, that the letter only appeared in ''La Presse'' as a means of flattery to ensure that Houssaye would publish the poems.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2008|p=xiii}} Nevertheless, it allows us to understand Baudelaire's thinking about the genre of prose poetry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Who among us has not dreamed, in his ambitious days, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm or rhyme, supple enough and jarring enough to be adapted to the soul's lyrical movements, the undulations of reverie, to the twists and turns that consciousness takes?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Luke Oliver Johnson''' (born 2 February 1962), is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entrepreneur]], best known for his involvement with [[Pizza Express]] chain. He is a former chairman of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and [[Channel 4]]. He writes a weekly column for ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. Johnson calls himself a "projector", in line with the 17th century term for a man involved in many different businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3021321.stm|title=Pizza Express entrepreneur looks to the future|last=Cummings|first=Laura|date=15 May 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others regard him as just a serial entrepreneur.
He is the part owner and chairman of [[Patisserie Valerie]], Gail's Artisan Bakery and [[Feng Sushi]] among other businesses. He is a former owner of [[The Ivy]], Le Caprice and J Sheekey restaurants and a former part owner of [[Giraffe Restaurants]].

==Early years==
The son of historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] and brother of [[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]], he spent his early years in [[Iver]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and was educated at the state run [[Langley Grammar School]] in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], [[Berkshire]], and at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

Whilst at university Johnson together with fellow student [[Hugh Osmond]] (later founder of [[Punch Taverns]]) interviewed [[Richard Branson]] on his houseboat in [[London]] for the student newspaper. This gave the pair the inspiration to go into business and they began running the ''Era'' nightclub in [[Oxford]]. By the time of graduation, he and Osmond were running businesses from software to clubs.

He initially studied medicine but, like Hugh Osmond, only completed the first part of the course, graduating from Oxford University with a BA in Physiological Sciences in 1983. He began his career as a media analyst at [[stockbroker]] Grieveson Grant (subsequently [[Kleinwort Benson]] Securities).

==Business career==

===Restaurants and leisure===
[[File:Pattisserie Valerie Sutton Surrey London.JPG|thumb|A [[Patisserie Valerie]] store in [[Sutton High Street]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], Greater London]]
In 1993, Johnson and Osmond took control of [[Pizza Express]], with Johnson becoming chairman. They expanded the business from 12 owned restaurants to over 250, and the share price from 40p to over 900p.&lt;ref name="aboutluke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukejohnson.org/about|title=About Luke Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; After selling the business in 1999 Johnson started Signature Restaurants, a ‘crown jewels’ collection of London restaurants which included [[The Ivy]] and Le Caprice, as well as the [[Belgo]] chain. He also started [[Strada]] restaurants from scratch, taking the chain to 30 units. He sold both businesses in 2005; the total proceeds from these two disposals were in excess of £90 million.&lt;ref name="aboutluke" /&gt;

Whilst chairman of the Belgo group, Johnson took part in the [[BBC]] programme "''Back to the Floor''", a programme in which top executives spent a week at the "coal face" of their business.  Some reviewers of the programme were uncomplimentary about Johnson.

From 1993 to date, Johnson has been involved as director and/or owner of various companies in retailing, pubs and bars, including [[Whittard of Chelsea]], My Kinda Town and the private companies Giraffe,&lt;ref&gt;Shrimpton, David (25 March 2004).

Johnson also purchased in 2010 a stake in [[artisan]] bakery Flour Power City, which supplies restaurants, hotels, and caterers. Flour Power City also operates stalls in locations such as [[Borough]] Market in [[London]]. This business also became part of Patisserie Holdings.

=== Patisserie Holdings ===
Johnson is the Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and a 37% shareholder [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/~/media/Files/P/Patisserie-Valerie-IR/results-presentations/20171222-patisserie-holdings-annual-report.pdf] of [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/ Patisserie Holdings pl]  &lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Jennifer (20 September 2006).[http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/593433/C4-chairman-Johnson-buys-stake-Patisserie-Valerie/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH "C4 chairman Johnson buys stake in Patisserie Valerie"]. ''Brand Republic''. Retrieved 28 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[London Stock Exchange]] EPIC code: CAKE [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/summary/company-summary/GB00BM4NV504GBGBXAMSM.html?lang=en]). The principal trading brand is [[Patisserie Valerie]]; the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker &amp; Spice, and Flour Power City Bakery. The company's auditor is [[Grant Thornton International|Grant Thornton]]. 

On 19 May 2014 the company was admitted to the [[Alternative Investment Market]] [http://investors.patisserieholdings.co.uk/~/media/Files/P/Patisserie-Valerie-IR/documents/14052014a.pdf]. The company had a market value of £446.13 million at close of business on 9th October 2018 [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/exchange-insight/company-news.html?fourWayKey=GB00BM4NV504GBGBXAMSM]  [https://www.dropbox.com/s/axtaoxyb4wd83dk/Market%20cap%20Oct%202018.jpg?dl=0], the closing price being quoted as 425.9 pence [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/other/13822977.html]. That evening [[Sky News]] published a news item headed: 'Patisserie Valerie owner faces crisis 'over £20m accounting hole' [https://news.sky.com/story/patisserie-valerie-owner-faces-crisis-over-20m-accounting-hole-11522365].

==== Fraud investigation at Patisserie Holdings ====
On 10th October the company's shares were suspended from trading. An announcement included information that the board had been notified of significant and potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities, that a potential material mis-statement of the company's accounts had significantly impacted the company's cash position, and that Chris Marsh, the Chief Financial Officer, had been suspended from his role [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13822979.html]. 

On 11 October the company announced that there was a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business and that without an immediate injection of capital the directors were of the view that there would be no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form. This announcement also stated that the directors and the company's professional advisers were assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading.[https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13825482.html].

On 12 October Hertfordshire police issued a statement saying that 'A 44-year old man from St Albans has been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation. He has been released under investigation.' It was widely reported that the individual concerned was Marsh [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/12/finance-director-of-crisis-hit-patisserie-valerie-arrested-chris-marsh], [https://news.sky.com/story/crisis-hit-patisserie-valerie-finance-chief-arrested-by-police-11524081]. The [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] announced on its website that it had opened an investigation into an individual at the company [https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2018/10/12/patisserie-holdings-plc/]. Later that day the company announced details of a rescue plan under which it would borrow £20 million from Johnson [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13827568.html] and place 31,451,100 ordinary shares at 50 pence to raise new capital of approximately £15.7m before payment of expenses [https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/CAKE/13827697.html]. Johnson faced the choice of letting the company fail (at which point he would still have been worth over £100m), or lending money to it, albeit on terms that the majority of the loans would be repaid by the proceeds of the placings. The rescue plan prevented the imminent bankruptcy of the company and subsequent loss of 2500 jobs, but was criticised in The Telegraph as being against the interests of smaller shareholders.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/13/30m-rescue-deal-ignored-patisserie-valerie-bosses/] 

On 14 October it was reported that two unauthorised and unreported overdrafts of almost £10m had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/patisserie-valeries-secret-overdrafts-xdn0l7dl6|title=Patisserie Valerie’s secret overdrafts|last=Shah|first=Oliver|date=2018-10-14|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Directors' share dealings ====
Johnson was the only director of the company never to have sold shares after flotation {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Earlier in 2018 Paul May, the company's CEO, and Marsh both exercised share options at a price of 418p, allegedly making £1 million and £680,000, respectively. At the end of June Lee Ginsberg, deputy chairman and head of the audit committee, sold 40,000 shares at 469p, making almost £190,000 [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/patisserie-valerie-owner-on-brink-of-collapse-sd5jwpd0k]. These figures relate to legitimate transactions pre-dating the crisis, with no suggestion that the board extracted cash from the company in such a way as to contribute to the alleged accounting fraud. 

==== Criticisms ====
The events at the company have been criticised in a statement that 'If wonky accounting can go unnoticed at a plain-vanilla business like Patisserie Holdings, investors really have nowhere to feel safe.' [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-10/a-cake-based-accounting-scandal-how-very-british]

'''''The Merry Trio''''' is an oil painting by [[Judith Leyster]] in the Collection Noortman.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter&gt;Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age, by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #9&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a work by [[Frans Hals]] until 1903.

==Provenance==
The painting was together with Leyster's ''[[The Last Drop by Leyster|The Last Drop]]'' in the collection of the British dealer/auction house Sir George Donaldson (1845-1925) where it was documented in 1903.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; The two may be pendants, as they were then reported to have the same measurements.

According to Hofrichter, the scene shows the popular ''Merry company'' theme common in 17th-century ''commedia dell'arte'' plays.&lt;ref name=Hofrichter/&gt; This daylight scene serves as a contrast to its candlelit pendant which warns of the dangers of drinking and smoking. Clearly, Leyster preferred the sober yet festive daytime scene, because she selected the musician on the right to illustrate her [[Self-portrait by Judith Leyster|self-portrait]].

'''Miriam Schapiro''' (also known as Mimi) (November 15, 1923 – June 20, 2015) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born artist based in the [[United States]].  She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of [[feminist art]]. She was also considered a leader of the [[Pattern and Decoration]] art movement.&lt;ref name="cotternyt"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Schapiro's artwork blurs the line between fine art and craft. She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association with women and femininity.  Schapiro’s work touches on the issue of feminism and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract art.  Schapiro honed in her domesticated craft work and was able to create work that stood amongst the rest of the high art. These works represent Schapiro’s identity as an artist working in the center of contemporary abstraction and simultaneously as a feminist being challenged to represent women’s "consciousness" through imagery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She often used icons that are associated with women, such as hearts, floral decorations, geometric patterns, and the color pink. In the 1970s she made the hand fan, a typically small woman's object, heroic by painting it six feet by twelve feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Linda|title=Miriam Schapiro: Woman-Warrior with Lace|journal=Fiberarts|date=1998|issue=24|pages=35–40|ref=Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson).}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The fan-shaped canvas, a powerful icon, gave Schapiro the opportunity to experiment... Out of this emerged a surface of textured coloristic complexity and opulence that formed the basis of her new personal style. The kimonos, fans, houses, and hearts were the form into which she repeatedly poured her feelings and desires, her anxieties, and hopes".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Miriam Schapiro's estate is exclusively represented by the Eric Firestone Gallery in New York.

==Early life and education==
Schapiro was born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name=Bloch /&gt; She was the only child of two Russian Jewish parents. Her Russian immigrant grandfather invented the first movable doll’s eye in the United States&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/miriam-schapiro/|title=Miriam Schapiro|last=Ficpatrik|first=Milja|date=|website=Widewalls|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufactured "Teddy Bears."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schapiro-miriam|title=MIRIAM SCHAPIRO|last=Salus|first=Carol|date=2009|website=Jewish Women's Archive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Theodore Schapiro, was an artist and an intellectual who was studying at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, in New York, when Schapiro was born. He was an industrial design artist who fostered her desire to be an artist and served as her role model and mentor. Her mother, Fannie Cohen,a homemaker and a Zionist, encouraged Schapiro to take up a career in the arts. At age six, Schapiro began drawing.&lt;ref name="Gouma-Peterson"&gt;Gouma-Peterson, Thalia.  Miriam Schapiro: An Art of Becoming.  American Art 11.1 (1997) :  10-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Schapiro was taught by Victor d’ Amico, her first modernist teacher at the Museum of Modern Art. In the evenings she joined WPA classes for adults to study drawing from the nude model. In 1943, Schapiro entered Hunter College in New York City, but eventually transferred to the University of Iowa. At the University of Iowa, Schapiro studied painting with Stuart Edie and James Lechay. She studied printmaking under [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and was his personal assistant, which then led her to help form the Iowa Print Group.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Miriam Schapiro: Shaping the Fragments of Art and Life|last=Gouma-Peterson|first=Thalia|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Publishers|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasanky taught his students to use several different printing techniques in their work and to study the masters' work in order to find solutions to technical problems.

At the [[State University of Iowa]] she met the artist [[Paul Brach]], whom she married in 1946.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;Avital H. Bloch, Lauri Umansky, ''Impossible to Hold: Women and Culture in the 1960s'', NYU Press, 2005, p319. {{ISBN|0-8147-9910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Brach and Schapiro graduated in 1949, Brach received a  job in the University of Missouri as a painting instructor. Schapiro did not receive a position, and was very unhappy during their time there. By 1951 they moved to [[New York City]] and befriended many of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract expressionist]] artists of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], including [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[Knox Martin]] and [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]].  Schapiro and Brach lived in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. Miriam and Paul had a son, Peter Brach, in 1955. Before and after the birth of her son Peter, Schapiro struggled with her identity and place as an artist. Miriam’s Schapiro’s successive studios, after this period of crisis, became both environments for and reflections of the changes in her life and art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She died on June 20, 2015 in [[Hampton Bays, New York]], aged 91.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/216461/remembering-miriam-schapiro-1923-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/arts/design/miriam-schapiro-91-a-feminist-artist-who-harnessed-craft-and-pattern-dies.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Schapiro not only honored the craft tradition in women's art, but also paid homage to women artists of the past. In the early 1970s she made paintings and collages which included photo reproductions of past artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]]. In the mid 1980s she painted portraits of [[Frida Kahlo]] on top of her old self-portrait paintings. In the 1990s Schapiro began to include women of the Russian Avant Garde in her work. The Russian Avant Garde was an important moment in Modern Art history for Schapiro to reflect on because women were seen as equals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=Susan|title=Gainesville, Georgia|journal=Art Papers|date=2004|volume=28.4|pages=42–43|ref=Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1953 and 1957, Schapiro created a substantial body of work in which she focused on the dominant style of the period: Abstract Expressionism. Miriam created her own gestural language: "painting thinly and wiping out", in which the wiped area played a significant role as the painted area. Although these works were abstracted such as her work Beast Land and Plenty, Schapiro based them off of black and white illustrations of works by the "old masters". In December 1957, [[André Emmerich]] selected one of her paintings for the opening of his gallery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Early in her career, Schapiro started looking for maternal symbols to unify her own roles as a woman. Her series, ''Shrines'' was created in 1961-63 with this in mind. Beginning in 1960 Schapiro began to eliminate abstract expressionist brushwork from her paintings and began to introduce a variety of geometric forms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is one of her earliest group of work that was also an autobiography. Each section of the work show an aspect of being a woman artist. They are also symbolic of her body and soul. The play between the illusion of depth and the acceptance of the surface became the main formal strategy of Miriam's work for the rest of the decade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Miriam Schapiro Works on Paper a Thirty Year Retrospective|last=Yassin|first=Robert|publisher=Tucson Museum of Art|year=1999|isbn=|location=Tucson, Arizona|pages=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shrines enabled Schapiro to discover the multiple and fragmented aspects of herself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1964 Schapiro and her husband Paul both worked at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. One of Schapiro's biggest turning points in her art career was working at the workshop and experimenting with [[Josef Albers]]' Color-Aid paper, where she began making several new shrines and created her first collages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1967, Schapiro and Brach moved to [[California]] so that both could teach in the art department at the University of California, San Diego. There Miriam met her close friend David Nalibof, a physicist who worked for General Dynamics. Nalibof formulated computer programs that could plot and alter Miriam Schapiro's drawings. This was how her first feminist work, ''Big Ox #1'' from 1968 was created. The diagonals of which represented the limbs of the "Vitruvian man," while the O depicted the center of the women, the vagina, the womb. This work is described as "a newly invented, body-based, archetypal emblem for female power and identity, realized in brilliant red-orange, silver, and 'tender shades of pink'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684924?mobileUi=0&amp;journalCode=amart|title=Miriam Schapiro (1923-2015)|last=Braude|first=Norma|date=2015|website=The University of Chicago Press|access-date=|doi=10.1086/684924|volume=29|pages=132–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O is also thought to symbolize the egg, which exists as the window into the maternal structure with outstretched limbs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Subsequently, she was able to establish the Feminist Art Program at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], in Valencia with [[Judy Chicago]]. The program set out to address the problems in the arts from an institutional position and focused on the expansion of a female environment in Downtown, L.A. In ''[[Womanhouse]]'' women were able to turn their invested creativity in rewarding their families with supportive environments toward themselves by allowing their fantasies to take over all rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They wanted the creation of art to be less of a private, introspective adventure and more of a public process through consciousness raising sessions, personal confessions and technical training.&lt;ref&gt;Arnason, H.H.; Mansfield, E.C.  History of Modern Art. Prentice Hall. 2010. pp604.  {{ISBN|0-205-67367-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "('House') became the repository of female fantasy and womanly dreams". Schapiro participated in the ''[[Womanhouse]]'' exhibition in 1972. Schapiro's smaller piece within ''Womanhouse'', called "[[Dollhouse]]", was constructed using various scrap pieces to create all the furniture and accessories in the house.  Each room signified a particular role a woman plays in society and depicted the conflicts between them.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Schapiro, Miriam.  The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse.  Art Journal 31.3 (1972) :  268-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schapiro's work from the 1970s onwards consists primarily of [[collage]]s assembled from fabrics, which she called "femmages". In the early seventies, succeeding Schapiro’s collaboration in ''Womanhouse'', she made her first fabric collages in her studio in Los Angeles, which looked much like a room in a house. From the male technological world of computers Schapiro moved into a woman’s decorated house. In this home-like studio, Schapiro monumentalized her fabric cabinet and its significance for women, in a number of large femmages, including ''A Cabinet for All Seasons''. This was her poetic version of the representation of continuous changes and repetitions in all women’s bodies and lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In her definition of femmage, Schapiro wrote that the style, which simultaneously recalls quilting and Cubism, has a "woman-life context" and that it "celebrates a private or public event." As Schapiro traveled the United States giving lectures, she would ask the women she met for a souvenir.  These souvenirs would be used in her collage like paintings. Schapiro also did collaborative art projects, like her series of etchings ''Anonymous was a Woman'' from 1977. She was able to produce the series with a group of nine women studio-art graduates from the University of Oregon. Each print is an impression made from an untransformed doily that was placed in soft ground on a zinc plate, then etched and printed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Her 1977-1978 essay ''Waste Not Want Not: An Inquiry into What Women Saved and Assembled - FEMMAGE'' (written with [[Melissa Meyer]]) describes femmage as the activities of collage, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[découpage]] and [[photomontage]] practised by women using "traditional women's techniques - sewing, piercing, hooking, cutting, appliquéing, cooking and the like..."&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles, Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'', University of California Press, 1996, pp151-4. {{ISBN|0-520-20253-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1975, Schapiro returned to New York and with what she made after selling some paintings, she not only had a room but a studio of her own. Decoration and "collaboration," are central to her artwork and both play a significant role in her house as well as in her studio.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The studio became Schapiro’s own room and at moments of great personal conflict, the only connection with her creative self. Her various studios throughout the span of her career have reflected the changes in both the outer and the inner realities of her life. They have expressed her changing self-conceptions in accordance with or in against society, which keeps gender roles separate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Schapiro's studios have also become metaphors for her creative work, as well as spaces in which she could live her life and fulfill her dreams as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the process of taking on different projects, Schapiro’s studio expanded and eventually became portable, following her as she traveled from place to place. It was during the same time of her Oregon collaborative project with the nine women that Schapiro also created her first "Collaboration Series" with women artists of the past. This series combined reproductions of the work of Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot with colorful and sensuous fabric borders in patterns inspired by quilts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''Mary Cassatt and Me'', Schapiro overlapped her own mental image of her mother with Cassatt's maternal ideal–her mother reading a newspaper.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s Schapiro began exploring her Jewish identity further in her painting. Her painting ''My History'' (1997) she used the same structure as the ''House''  project and built rooms of different memories surrounding her Jewish heritage. Her most explicit Jewish-themed statement in art was ''Four Matriarchs'', stained glass windows portraying the biblical heroines Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. This was a colorful piece combining identity symbology and her older domesticated art to create the true vision of what high art meant to the public. ''Mother Russia'' (1994), was a fan piece made by Schapiro that drew from her family's Russian background. She depicts the powerful women from Russia each on a row of the hand held fan with a hat and a veil. She added pieces from each artist work in her "collaborative" style to join them as revolutionary women and give hidden figures praise. Her background in both the Russian and Jewish culture have very much attributed to what Schapiro’s collection of work represents. The foundation and collective use of patterns and colors describe Miriam's work and allow us to see her culture and female voice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Nat Sherman''' is the [[brand name]] for a line of handmade [[cigars]] and "[[fashion brands|luxury]] [[cigarette]]s." The company, which began as a retail [[tobacconist]], continues to operate a flagship retail shop now located on 42nd Street, off Fifth Avenue, in [[New York City]]. Corporate offices are now located at the foot of the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[New Jersey]].

==Company history==

===Origin===
[[File:Inside the Nat Sherman Townhouse.jpeg|thumb|right| Inside the Nat Sherman Townhouse]]
Before he was involved in the [[tobacco]] industry, Nat Sherman made his fortune running a prominent [[speakeasy]] in New York City during the 1920s, when [[Prohibition]] made such a business extremely lucrative, albeit risky.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;Margulis, Ronald. "Nat Sherman's Long March to Success," ''Cigar Magazine,'' vol. 3, no. 4 (Winter 2006), pp. 70–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps as the result of settlement of a gambling debt, his son later speculated, Sherman wound up as half owner of Traub Brothers and Bear, makers of  the Epoca cigar brand, which introduced the [[nightclub]] proprietor into the world of tobacco manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Joel" /&gt; Sherman subsequently bought out his partner to become sole owner of the Epoca brand, which was made in [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]], [[Cuba]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

Later a prominent New York [[real estate developer]] named Abe Gubertz had cash-flow difficulties during the construction of a 38 story building located at 1400 Broadway, on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]]. Sherman provided the struggling developer with a loan, taking retail space located in the lobby as partial payment.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The shop sold cigarettes and cigars in substantial quantities to those who worked in the building and proved a means of distributing its own cigars, including Epoca and Nat Sherman-branded product.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The company also was the exclusive importer and distributor of the Cuban-made [[Bolivar (cigar brand)|Bolivar]] brand in the United States.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

===1950s===
In the 1950s, an adjoining retail space was obtained on the street, which initially was used as a candy store. The wall between the two establishments was later broken down, paving the way for an expansion of the tobacco shop, which catered to an elite customer base, which included leaders in the fashion industry, theatre, and politicians.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; Prominent members of [[organized crime]] "families" also frequented the shop, which was regarded as "neutral ground."&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

Nat Sherman's son Joel, company president and CEO into the 21st century, later recalled of the shop's most dangerous customers:
{{quote|These people drank the best liquor, drove the most expensive cars, had the most beautiful women, and they smoked the best cigars. You'd find people from opposing crime families meeting in the store. They'd buy each other cigars while their bodyguards stood outside.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;}}

===1960s===
[[File:Nat Sherman Townhouse in New York City.jpeg|thumb|Nat Sherman Townhouse in New York City]]
In 1950, Sherman introduced the plastic-tipped cigar to the industry, called Sherman's #25. The cigar was produced in Tampa for Sherman by [[Carl Cuesta]], an American manufacturer of cigars for [[Partagas (cigar brand)|Partagas]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The company applied for a [[patent]] for its cigar tip, which was never granted. Nevertheless, for 32 years the company successfully bluffed away rivals by marking its packaging with the words "patent pending" and by threatening legal action.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

Sherman was also a pioneer in the manufacture of cigarettes which made use of cigar tobacco, launching a product called Havana Ovals #149 early in the 1950s. According to company lore, the move to specialty small cigars and cigarettes was made at the request of an irate customer who had been unable to smoke a cigar on an airplane and who had specifically requested a cigarette which tasted like a cigar.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

During the 1960s, the Sherman shop expanded its wares to include [[tobacco pipe|pipes]]. Over 1,000 pipes were offered for sale in a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} long case hung along the wall of the store.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The company also began to sell pipe tobacco under the "Nat Sherman" brand name.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; At the time of its expansion, the company's pipe department was perhaps the largest in New York City and the United States.&lt;ref name="Joel"&gt;Sherman, Joel. [http://pipesmagazine.com/blog/pipe-manufacturer-retailer-spotlight/an-interview-with-joel-sherman-of-nat-sherman/ "An Interview with Joel Sherman of Nat Sherman"], ''PipesMagazine.com'', November 25, 2009. Retrieved February 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, a move was made to expand both the wholesale operations of the company and its cigarette manufacturing arm. The company's previous manufacturing facility in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pennsylvania]], was shuttered and a move made to a new and larger facility in [[Englewood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

===1970s and '80s===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
In the autumn of 1976, Nat Sherman opened a shop on New York's [[Fifth Avenue]] to bolster his tobacco brand's status. A new location was opened at 711 Fifth Avenue, near the [[Plaza Hotel]], across from [[Tiffany &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; After a period of differences with his father, Joel Sherman left the business for about a decade.

===1990s===
[[File:Nat Sherman Naturals Original Cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|Naturals Selection Originals]]
[[File:Nat Sherman Metropolitan Selection.png|thumb|250px|Nat Sherman Metropolitan Selection]]
Joel Sherman returned to the company in 1990, the year after his father's death,&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; He became the company's president and CEO, terminated many of the existing management staff, and set the company on the course of developing unique, elite, high-end products.

The company lost its lease at 711 Fifth Avenue and moved to a new {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location on 42nd Street, around the corner from the [[New York Public Library]]. A total of $1.5 million were spent on the development of the new store, which boasts an inventory of about 500,000 cigars and a second floor walk-in [[humidor]] and smoking room adorned with leather-backed chairs.&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

Sherman's cigar line Metropolitan has been manufactured since the 1990s by [[MATASA]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; Its Gotham 1400 and Omerta products are manufactured and distributed by [[Santa Clara, Inc.]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt; The company's cigarette manufacturing is conducted in its own facility in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="CM" /&gt;

===2000s===
On January 17, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. announced that it acquired the privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (Nat Sherman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170117005886/en/Altria-Announces-Acquisition-Sherman-Group-Holdings-LLC |title=Altria Announces Acquisition of Sherman Group Holdings, LLC |publisher=''Business Wire''|date=17 January 2017 | accessdate= 3 September 2017 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Sherman advertised during [[New York Giants]] radio broadcasts. Every major play during the game, Giants commentator [[Bob Papa]] exclaimed "Get that man a Nat Sherman cigar!".

Slang terminology for a [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]-laced tobacco cigarette is a "sherm" or "sherman", named for the brand.

The shop also makes an appearance in Kramer v Kramer, where Dustin Hoffman walks past it in a scene.

In the live version of the song "Do You Feel Like We Do," Peter Frampton sings "Champagne for breakfast, got a Sherman in my hand."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21295">'''Naval heraldry''' is a form of identification used by naval vessels from the end of the 19th century onwards, after distinguishing features such as [[Figurehead (object)|figureheads]] and [[gilding]] were discouraged or banned by several navies.
[[File:Rodman Beatty.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The badge of {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} was displayed on the [[tampion]]s of her main guns in 1917, before the standardisation of Royal Navy designs]]
Naval heraldry commonly takes the form of a badge, seal, crest, or coat of arms designed specifically for a ship (or a series of ships bearing the same name), which in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies takes the form of a large plaque, referred to as the '''ship's badge''', mounted on the superstructure of the ship, and in the [[United States Navy]] is known as the '''ship's seal''' or '''ship's crest''', and is primarily found on crew uniform patches. An item of naval heraldry is seen as the identifying logo of the vessel, and is commonly reproduced on hats, stationery, trophies, souvenirs, and gifts related to the ship. In many navies, the ship's badge is also displayed on the [[tampion]]s - the covers for the gun [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan P.|last=Major|title=Maritime antiques: an illustrated dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oS7etEGs91EC|date=1 April 1981|publisher=A. S. Barnes|isbn=978-0-498-02496-2|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naval heraldric tradition follows the heraldic traditions of the country, with some distinctive variations.

''Note: Although ships are commonly referred to in this article, identical or similar forms of heraldry are used for bases and facilities, organisational divisions, and land-based naval units.''

==Portuguese Navy==
[[File:Brasao CCF.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Coat of arms of the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] (''Corpo de Fuzileiros'') of the Portuguese Navy.]]
The system of naval heraldry used by the [[Portuguese Navy]] was established and regulated in 1972, being slightly reviewed by an ordinance of February 18, 2010. 

The coats of arms consist of a [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|round tip shield]] (Portuguese shield), topped by a [[naval crown]] and under which is placed a scroll with the [[motto]] or the name of the body or unit. A scroll with the [[Battle cry|war cry]] of the unit can be placed above the naval crown. The coat of arms may also include [[supporter|tenants or supporters]], trophies and [[Military awards and decorations|decorations]]. A coat of arms can also be used as a badge, in which case an entirely round shield is used, surrounded by a branch of laurel on the right and by a branch of oak on the left.

The following bodies and units are entitled to the use of coat of arms:
# The Portuguese Navy itself;
# Naval and maritime zones commands;
# Bodies dependent from the Naval Command led by officers with the rank of commander or higher;

The coats of arms of the flag officers consist of the shield of the body or unit they command, replacing the  naval crown for a helmet with a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The heraldic rank insignia of the officer (consisting of one or two anchors) is placed under the shield.

The commands and the units of the Portuguese Navy are also entitled to the use of [[heraldic flag]]s, that - depending on the type of unit - can be in the form of a [[Heraldic standard|standard]], a [[guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]] or a [[pennon]].

==Royal Australian Navy==
[[File:HMAS melbourne 2 crest.png|thumb|right|120px|The ship's badge of the Australian aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}. This is the current (post 1975) version of the badge.]]
An item of naval heraldry in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) is referred to as a ''ship's badge'', although the incorrect ''ship's crest'' is sometimes used.&lt;ref name=cass191&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the badges were designed and assigned to ships by the [[Royal Navy]]. After [[World War II]], an Australian body, the Badges, Names and Honours Committee, was created to take responsibility for creating RAN ships' badges.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt; At the first meeting, it was decided that all RAN badges would follow the Royal Navy format: a circle of rope in which the individual design would be placed, capped by a [[naval crown]] and a scroll with the ship's name.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt; A second, longer scroll was located below the rope circle for the ship's motto.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt; To identify the ship as Australian, the badge included a [[boomerang]] between the rope circle and motto scroll.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt; The design was revised soon after to also incorporate a [[nulla nulla]] and a stone axe, intertwined with the boomerang.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt;

Initially, there were gaps between the naval crown, name scroll, and rope circle.&lt;ref name=cass192.3&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', pp. 192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The name and motto scrolls were intended to be light blue with black lettering, although in practice they were painted dark blue, making the text hard to read.&lt;ref name=cass192.3/&gt; In 1964, the gaps between the crown, scroll, and circle were closed up, and the scrolls were changed to black with gold edging and lettering.&lt;ref name=cass192.3/&gt; The lettering style was also simplified.&lt;ref name=cass194&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, a minor change was made to the naval crown, with one of the pennants on top of the sails altered to point left instead of right.&lt;ref name=cass192.3/&gt; Another minor change was made to the crown in 1974, with the curvature of the sails altered.&lt;ref name=cass194/&gt; In 1975, the weapons below the rope circle were reorganised so the nulla nulla and axe were superimposed over the boomerang, and were redrawn slightly: one of the major changes being thicker hafts on the crossed weapons.&lt;ref name=cass194/&gt;

===Size and use===
Ship's badges are used equally by the RAN for ships, shore establishments, and organisations within the RAN. The standard badge measures {{convert|755|by|620|mm|in}}, with the rope circle having a diameter of {{convert|350|mm|in}} from the outside edge and {{convert|295|mm|in}} from the inside edge.&lt;ref name=cass195&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; "Boat's badges" were created for small craft belonging to a ship: the weapons and motto are omitted.&lt;ref name=cass195/&gt; Boat's badges are either {{convert|127|mm|in}} or {{convert|203|mm|in}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=cass195/&gt; Following the introduction of [[Attack class patrol boat|''Attack'' class patrol boats]] and [[Oberon class submarine|''Oberon'' class submarines]] into the RAN fleet in the early 1960s, a scaled-down badge design was created for all commissioned ships of less than {{convert|40|m|ft}} in length and all submarines, measuring {{convert|440|by|365|mm|in}} but with no other modifications.&lt;ref name=cass195/&gt; For the patrol boats, it was decided that a full-size badge was not appropriate for such small ships.&lt;ref name=cass195/&gt; The reduced size for submarines was a practical necessity: the badge had to fit through the external hatch, as it was only displayed on the fin while in port.&lt;ref name=cass195/&gt;

[[File:Chief Of Navy Australia.png|thumb|left|120px|The badge for the office of [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Navy]], a non-commissioned administrative division]]
For non-commissioned units and establishments, an altered badge design was used. The first establishment to wear a non-commissioned badge was the RAN/[[RAAF]] [[Australian Joint Anti-Submarine School]] (AJASS) in 1967.&lt;ref name=cass197/&gt; Being a joint unit, it was decided that the badge design would be based on the RAAF unit badge, with a double circle of gold rope surrounding the collar on which the unit name was written, but with an alteration in colouring to the black and gold system used on the scrolls of ships' badges.&lt;ref name=cass197&gt;Cassells, ''The Capital Ships'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The [[royal crown]] was used instead of the naval crown.&lt;ref name=cass197/&gt; The badge entered use with all non-commissioned RAN units, such as the dockyards, naval police, and administrative divisions.&lt;ref name=cass197/&gt; In 1979, all of the altered badges (excluding the joint-operated AJASS) were changed from the royal crown to the naval crown.&lt;ref name=cass197/&gt;

==Royal Canadian Navy==
Ships in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] receive badges, specifically designed for each ship. Using a circular design, they are topped with the naval crown and surrounded by a gold rope. Three maple leaves at the bottom of the rope circle distinguish Canadian badges from those of other Commonwealth navies.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt;

During [[World War II]], the number of ships being built and commissioned outstripped the ability of a central authority to design and approve. Local authority to the commanding officers of the ships resulted in humorous and risque badges, including some cartoon characters. These badges are not considered to be official.

Currently, all badges are reviewed by the Director of Ceremonial and recommended to the Governor General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-museum.mb.ca/badges/index.htm Naval Museum of Manitoba - Canadian Naval History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

CFB Esquimalt Naval &amp; Military Museum has an extensive collection of official Canadian naval ship, naval establishments and naval air unit badges 1910-1948. Lieutenant-Commander (Ret'd) David J. Freeman heads the Badge Project, capturing photographic or digital images of all the badges worn by HMC ships before 1948, and is in the process of completing a book on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/badge/badgegallery.html |title=Canadian naval ship, naval establishments and naval air unit badges  1910-1948. |access-date=2011-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623125355/http://www.navalandmilitarymuseum.org/resource_pages/badge/badgegallery.html |archive-date=2011-06-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Norwegian Navy==
It is customary for each individual ship and other units in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] to receive an individually designed coat of arms. These coats of arms follow the [[Norwegian heraldry|Norwegian heraldic tradition]] of being very simple in design. They often feature only one colour, one metal and one motive. They all have the same shield shape and are surrounded by a rope. The shield is surmounted by the heraldic [[Crown of Norway]] atop the ship's name.

The design of the individual shield is often inspired by connections the ship name gives. [[HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen (F310)|HNoMS ''Fridtjof Nansen'']] is given a shield inspired by the family coat of arms of the [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen family]]. Others are given shields based on the unit's function. The Naval Schools have a shield depicting a golden anchor and two silver torches of wisdom. All naval coats of arms have to be approved by the [[King of Norway]].

==Royal Navy==

During the [[Age of Sail]], ships were identified by [[Figurehead (object)|figureheads]] and gilded carvings.&lt;ref name=cass189&gt;Vic Cassells (2000). ''The Capital Ships'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extravagance of these decorations began to reach the point of flamboyance, and an [[Admiralty]] directive in the early 18th century restricted the amount that could be spent, and eventually banned it outright.&lt;ref name=cass189/&gt;

Ships' badges first appeared in the 1850s, as identification markings on the stationery used by some [[Royal Navy]] ships.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; These marks were quickly used to mark the boats assigned to a ship, to aid crew in finding their boat at a dark or crowded wharf.&lt;ref name=cass189/&gt; The creation of badges was haphazard, and eventually came into use for the ships themselves.&lt;ref name=cass189/&gt; In 1918, [[Charles ffoulkes]], the curator of the newly established [[Imperial War Museum]] was asked by the commanding officer of [[HMS Tower (1917)|HMS ''Tower'']] to design a badge for his ship.&lt;ref name=cass189/&gt; He quickly received requests to create badges for other [[Royal Navy]] vessels, and on 10 December 1918, ffoulkes was appointed the Admiralty advisor on [[heraldry]].&lt;ref name=cass189/&gt; Shortly prior to this, a Ships' Badge Committee had been established to regulate the creation and use of ships' badges.&lt;ref name=cass190&gt;Vic Cassells (2000). ''The Capital Ships'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 the badges were standardized as four shapes: Circular (Battleships &amp; Battle Cruisers), Pentagonal (Cruisers), Shield (Destroyers) and Diamond (all other types and shore establishments).&lt;ref name="Drury 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drury |first1=Tom |title=Royal Navy Ship's Badges |url=http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/BADGES.htm |website=royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing was carried out to ensure that the badges were designed appropriately to identify ships.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; Cardboard mockups were created, gilded, and installed on a police launch, which was observed on patrol of the [[Thames]] by a captured German submarine moored outside [[Westminster Palace]].&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; It was decided to use different shapes to identify different types of vessel: circles for [[battleship]]s, pentagons for [[cruiser]]s, 'U'-shaped shields for [[destroyer]]s, and diamonds for auxiliary units, including depot ships, small war vessels, and [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt;

In 1940, the designs for all ships were standardised to a circular design.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; This was primarily due to wartime shortages, although another factor was to eliminate difficulties caused when a ship was commissioned with a previously-used name but was a different type of vessel, requiring the badge to be redesigned for the new shape.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; At the same time, the use of scaled-down badges for a ship's boats was suspended, and as of 2000 has not been resumed.&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; After the war, the pentagonal badge shape was assigned to [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessels, and the diamond to [[Stone frigate|commissioned shore bases]].&lt;ref name=cass190/&gt; Before [[World War II]], the design of badges for ships in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies was the responsibility of the Royal Navy Ships' Badge Committee, but this responsibility was assigned to the relevant nations after the war.&lt;ref name=cass191/&gt;

Ships' badges are reused along with the ship name. When the Queen approves the name of a new ship she will also approve the new ship's badge, which may have changed if the shape needs to change.

[[HMS Chatham (F87)|HMS ''Chatham'']] was a ship serving in the Royal Navy with an original badge, since none of the previous ''Chatham''s bore a badge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/nav.3650 Ship's Badges : Ship's Badges and Flags : The RN Today : Training and People : Royal Navy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==South African Navy==
A few ships of the South African Navy adopted badges during World War II, but they appear to have been unofficial. Only one, that of the reserve base HMSAS ''Unitie'', conformed to the Royal Navy pattern of enclosing the badge in a 'U'-shaped frame of golden cable, ensigned of a naval crown resting on a name plaque.

Badges were formalised after the war, the Royal Navy model being followed. At first, badges were diamond-shaped, but after a few years they were changed to circular frames. ''Unitie'' retained her shield-shaped badge, and in the 1980s, pentagonal badges were introduced for Navy Headquarters and the headquarters of the regional commands. The naval crown was replaced by the red lion crest of the national coat of arms in 1954, and this in turn was replaced by the secretary-bird crest of the new national arms in 2002.

Where ships and shore units are named after provinces and towns, their badges incorporate elements of the provincial or civic arms, for example the ox-wagon in the badge of the frigate [[SAS Transvaal|SAS ''Transvaal'']]. Those named after historical personalities incorporate their namesakes' personal coats of arms, or elements of their arms, in their badges, for example the shield of the Van Riebeeck arms in the badge of the destroyer [[SAS Jan van Riebeeck|SAS ''Jan van Riebeeck'']]. For some categories of ships, including the [[Daphné class submarine|''Daphné''-class submarines]], [[Sa'ar 4 class missile boat|Minister-class strike craft]], and [[River class minehunter|River-class minehunters]], standard badges were designed, which were then differenced to identify individual vessels. The submarines' badges depicted a trident (emblem of the submarine branch) surmounted by a lozenge displaying the arms of the lady after whom the vessel was named. The strike craft badges depict a Viking longboat in full sail, with elements of the arms of the cabinet minister after which the ship was named on the sail. The minehunters' badges depict a bridge across a river, with an additional device above the bridge alluding to the name of the river.

Badges are designed and approved by the [[South African National Defence Force]]'s heraldry section, and registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry (South Africa)|Bureau of Heraldry]] to provide legal protection against misuse.

==United States Navy==
[[File:Mahan crest gif.gif|right|thumb|120px|A uniform patch showing the coat of arms of the United States destroyer {{USS|Mahan|DDG-72|6}}]]
[[File:CVN-70 Seal.jpg|left|thumb|120px|Crest of the United States aircraft carrier {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|6}}]]
It is the custom in the [[United States Navy]] (USN) for ships, bases and other commands to receive an individually designed heraldic emblem. Due to [[United States heraldry|heraldic traditions in the U.S.]], these emblems usually take the form of ''seals'' or ''crests''; the terms are used often interchangeably, although the emblems are different. These items of naval heraldry are most commonly found on uniform patches for the ship's crew; unlike ships in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies, which display their symbols on plaques and [[battle honor]] boards fixed to the superstructure of the ship, USN ships are not allowed to paint or otherwise fix the ship's heraldry to the exterior of the ship.&lt;ref name=coatofarms&gt;Bob Ohl (1954). ''A Naval 'Coat of Arms' for Your Ship'', in ''All Hands'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

From World War I to the beginning of World War II, some U.S. Navy ships had these insignia, but World War II brought them into general use.&lt;ref name=coatofarms/&gt; Some designs were created by the ship's personnel, while others were commissioned by professional artists.&lt;ref name=coatofarms/&gt; The [[Korean War]] saw another upsurge in interest in crests and coats of arms.&lt;ref name=coatofarms/&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, OPNAVINST 5030.2B encouraged ships to design their own crests, and laid out the procedure for receiving official approval.&lt;ref name=coatofarms/&gt;

Today, the prospective commanding officers of new ships are responsible for designing the crests and submitting them for approval. They have great leeway in determining the design, and may optionally use the services of the U.S. Army's heraldry branch. Seals for destroyers tend to be oval in shape, whereas seals for submarines and aircraft carriers tend to be circular. Littoral combat ship and aircraft carrier crests also tend to feature a profile illustration of the ship on the crest, whereas destroyer crests do not.

'''Norman Forbes-Robertson''' (September 24, 1858 &amp;ndash; September 25, 1932) was the son of John Forbes-Robertson (1822–1903) and one of the 11 siblings of [[Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson]]. He was also a notable actor and a friend of [[Ellen Terry]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Edward Elgar]] and [[Henry Irving]].  Together with [[Bram Stoker]], he helped to organize Irving's funeral; a large body of letters connected with this event still exist.

Forbes-Robertson was a prominent member of [[London]]'s exclusive [[Garrick Club]].  According to "The History of the Tie", one afternoon in the 1920s, he wore a salmon-and-cucumber tie to lunch at the Garrick Club, joking that it was the official club tie.  Thereafter it was adopted as such.

In the early 20th century, he owned and restored [[Stocks Mill, Wittersham|Stocks Mill]] in [[Wittersham]], [[Kent]]. Forbes-Robertson was knocked down by a motor car in September 1932 and died in [[Exeter]], [[Devon]].&lt;ref name=Finch&gt;{{cite book | first = William| last = Coles Finch| authorlink=William Coles Finch| year = 1933| title = Watermills and Windmills| pages = 94, 304| publisher = C W Daniel Company| location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an early motorist, employing his own chauffeur.  He was the father of Norman, Olivia and Jill.

The '''Palestine Poster Project Archives''' (PPPA) was founded as a means of collecting and digitally displaying a wide variety of works in the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] [[poster]] genre.  The Palestine poster genre is more than a century old and growing. The Palestine Poster Project Archives continues to expand as the largest online collection of such posters.

A majority of the works included in this archives are created by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] artists, although the collection also features many works created by [[international]], [[Zionist]], and [[Israelis|Israeli]] artists.  More than 8,600 posters created by at least 1,750 artists are currently available on the Palestine Poster Project Archives’ website for public viewing.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/|title=Palestine Poster Project Archives: Official Website|publisher=Liberation Graphics|accessdate=2013-05-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As a [[Peace Corps]] volunteer in [[Morocco]] during the 1970s, Dan Walsh began a lifelong hobby of collecting Palestinian posters, the majority of which dealt with the theme of [[nationalism]].  Walsh initially received support from Dr. [[Edward Said]] through the American Palestine Education Foundation to transform his hobby into a public archive.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSdF21WB-U|title= 'The Palestine Poster: A Pixel is Worth a Thousand Verbs' by Dan Walsh|publisher=Columbia University, Center for Palestine Studies|date=2010-12-02|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, Walsh founded the Palestine Poster Project Archives, an online public database that is frequently updated.  He continues to avidly collect, document, and archive Palestinian posters from across the world today.

The Palestine Poster Project Archives was a key component of Walsh’s thesis as a student in [[Georgetown University]]’s Master of Arts in Arab Studies program at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.  This database was originally created for [[historians]], [[educators]], and advocates of [[public diplomacy]].

==Definition==
The Palestine poster genre dates back to the late nineteenth century. The Palestine Poster Project Archives entails that a poster with any of the following elements can be classified as a "Palestine poster":

* Any poster with the word "Palestine" in it, in any language, from any source or time period.
* Any poster created or published by any artist or agency claiming Palestinian nationality or Palestinian participation.
* Any poster published in the geographical territory of historic Palestine, at any point in history, including contemporary Israel.
* Any poster published by any source that relates directly to the social, cultural, political, military or economic history of Palestine.
* Any poster related to Zionism or anti-Zionism in any language, from any source, published after August 31, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Palestine Poster Project Archives|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/content/about-the-palestine-poster-project-archives|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Some of the earliest posters produced about Palestine were made by tourist companies in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s, [[Zionist]] groups started making posters encouraging [[Jewish]] groups to immigrate to historic Palestine and urging international support for a Jewish state. In 1897, at the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Switzerland]], attendants decided to adopt poster production as a significant resource to communicate and disseminate information. Intense production of Zionist posters continued for about fifty years, after which it waned.

When Palestinians experienced mass dislocation and exile in 1948, a series of events referred to as the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]], known in Arabic as ''al-Nakba'' ("the Catastrophe"), some prominent artists in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and other [[Arab countries]] began producing posters to convey support for a [[Palestinian state]].  According to Dan Walsh, founder of the Palestinian Poster Project Archives, as a result of the [[Battle of Karameh]] ([[Jordan]]) in 1968, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] began to more seriously consider the importance of [[international solidarity]] and information production and dissemination.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;

The [[PLO]] supported a particular style of Palestinian visual arts, leading to the rise of pamphleteer art and nationalist paintings that employed iconic imagery, symbols, and slogans for the Palestinian struggle.&lt;ref name="nadir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/rev_linke/sanat/jihad/jihad.htm |title=Interview with 'Jihad Mansour' (Marc Rudin) |publisher=Nadir.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian poster was seen as an especially useful medium for generating solidarity, representing narratives, and even mediating internal disagreements in Palestinian society.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;  By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the production of Palestinian nationalist posters was prolific.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Boullatta&gt;{{cite book|last=Boullatta |first=Kamal|title=Artists Remember Palestine in Beirut |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, there were few major professional institutions or gallery spaces available to display work in the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name=Boullatta /&gt;{{rp|74}} Therefore, artists often hung their posters in [[schools]], [[town halls]], union offices, [[public libraries]], and other shared public spaces. Artist Marc Rudin explained, "The posters had to be designed to be posted in the [[refugee camps]], in its narrow alleys, in Palestinian homes. But they were also to be used for information campaigns abroad".&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt; Artists designed their posters to be aesthetically pleasing, meaningful, and in many cases, communicative for both the Palestinian public and an international audience. Many Palestinian nationalist posters were displayed not only in public spaces in Palestinian towns and cities, but also in major urban spaces and capital cities throughout the [[Arab world]] and [[Europe]].

Documentation of the Palestinian nationalist posters genre's evolution was fragmented, and at times violently interrupted, in the mid and late twentieth century. Ezzedin Kalak, the PLO's representative in [[France]], was collecting hundreds of [[posters]] and [[postcard]]s for a book about the significance of Palestinian posters when he was [[assassinated]] by the [[Israel]]i national intelligence agency ([[Mossad]]) in 1978. Kalak's project was never completed or published.

Palestine poster artists continue to contribute works to the ever-growing genre today. The majority of posters displayed in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are originally printed on paper. From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, most Palestine posters were printed in a single location and then distributed worldwide. Increased [[internet access]] in the Arab world and globally, in tandem with rising costs for print production en masse, has led many Palestine poster artists to localize printing operations rather than utilize large and centralized printing companies.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt; An increasing number of new Palestine posters are being created digitally and then printed and distributed locally.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

==Organization of posters==
The PPPA works are organized under various subcategories to ease a user's search.  The "Special Categories" include a section entitled "Artists and Collectives" where some of the most prolific artists' works are gathered.  Other sections under "Special Categories" include "Exhibits and Catalogs;" "Historical Figures and Themes;" "Political, Cultural, and Social Publishers;" and "Museums, Libraries, Private Collections, Universities, and Archives."

The PPPA also has a section entitled "Iconography" under which 40 types of reoccurring imagery, symbols, and representation are categorized.  Some of these categories include "[[woman]]/female," "[[stone]]," "[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] flag," and "[[olives]]/[[trees]]/[[branches]]."

==Artists==
According to Walsh, works featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives can be divided into four major “wellsprings” or origins: Israeli and Zionist artists and agencies, Palestinian nationalist artists and agencies, [[Muslim]] and Arab artists and agencies, and international artists and agencies.&lt;ref name="youtube" /&gt;

Some artists featured in the Palestine Poster Project Archives are not Palestinian, [[Jewish]], or [[Israelis|Israeli]] by origin.  The Palestine Poster Project Archives currently holds posters made by artists from more than 55 countries.  For example, Marc Rudin, a Swiss-born artist with no Arab or Palestinian ancestry, worked as a graphic artist for the PLO between 1980 and 1991.&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt;  During that time, he went by the [[pseudonym]] Jihad Mansour.  Rudin produced nearly 200 posters about Palestine and worked most closely with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="nadir" /&gt;  

Some Palestinian poster artists are [[Arab people|Arab]] by descent, but not Palestinian.  For instance, artist Burhan Karkoutly was Syrian by birth and created numerous posters for the PLO during the 1970s.  Due to his commitment to and understanding of the Palestinian cause, Karkoutly was considered as one of the leading “Palestinian artists” of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sabella|first=Steve|title=Reconsidering the Value of Palestinian Art and its Journey in to the Art Market

==Uses==
Dan Walsh, the founder of the Palestine Poster Project Archives, originally envisioned that the archive would be useful for American high school educators teaching the history of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineposterproject.org/sites/aod/files/thesis_daniel_j_walsh-1_0.pdf|title=The Palestine Poster Project Archives: Origins, Evolution, and Potential|publisher=Dan Walsh|date=2011-12-19|accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives could be incorporated into curricula for [[visual anthropology]], [[art history]], [[media studies]], [[graphic design]], and a variety of other subjects.  Dan Walsh said in an interview with [[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al-Akhbar]] English: "There are two [[narratives]] presented at my website, the Palestinian nationalist and the political Zionist, and they've never been put together like this before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/palestine-poster-project-virtual-memory-struggle-and-everyday|title=The Palestine Poster Project: A Virtual Memory of Struggle and the Everyday|publisher=Leah Caldwell from Al-Akhbar English|date=2001-12-06|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestine Poster Project Archives provides some context about the production of each poster, which typically includes the date that it was printed, the organization for which it was commissioned, and the artist's name. Sometimes information about the poster’s dimensions (size) and medium are also included. Many of the posters with [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] text have been translated into [[English language|English]].

==Presentations==
In June 2012, the Palestinian American Research Center (PARC) sponsored Dan Walsh to present the Palestine Poster Project Archives in cities across the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://parc-us-pal.org/conferences.htm|title= Preserving, Promoting and Celebrating the Palestine Poster Genre
|publisher=Palestinian American Research Center (PARC)|date=2012-06-30|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time that the Palestine Poster Project Archives was formally presented in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], although Walsh has made several media appearances and delivered lectures to promote the PPPA at various locations in the [[United States]].

[[File:Mpv3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Commercial pastels]]
A '''pastel''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|æ|s|t|əl}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|æ|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|l}}) is an [[art medium]] in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered [[pigment]] and a [[binder (material)|binder]]. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including [[oil paint]]s; the binder is of a neutral hue and low [[Color saturation|saturation]]. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. Viking Adult; 5th revised and updated edition, 1991. {{ISBN|0-670-83701-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastels have been used by artists since the [[Renaissance]], and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium.

An artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). ''Pastel'' used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective it means pale in color.

==Pastel media==

Pastel sticks or crayons consist of pure powdered pigment combined with a  binder. The exact composition and characteristics of an individual pastel stick depends on the type of pastel and the type and amount of binder used. It also varies by individual manufacturer.

Dry pastels have historically used binders such as [[gum arabic]] and [[gum tragacanth]]. [[Methyl cellulose]] was introduced as a binder in the twentieth century. Often a [[chalk]] or [[gypsum]] component is present. They are available in varying degrees of hardness, the softer varieties being wrapped in paper. Some pastel brands use pumice in the binder to abrade the paper and create more tooth.

Dry pastel media can be subdivided as follows:
* ''Soft pastels'': This is the most widely used form of pastel. The sticks have a higher portion of pigment and less binder, resulting in brighter colors. The drawing can be readily smudged and blended, but it results in a higher proportion of dust. Finished drawings made with soft pastels require protecting, either framing under glass or spraying with a fixative to prevent smudging; hairspray also works, although caution should be taken, as fixatives may affect the color or texture of the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Lydie Joffre. "Should I 'fix' my Pastels and, if so, how?" 10 Aug 2013. http://www.marielydiejoffre.com/english/resource/faq_pastel_framing.html#fixation&lt;/ref&gt; White chalk may be used as a filler in producing pale and bright hues with greater luminosity.&lt;ref name="Martin_p8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pan pastels'': These are formulated with a minimum of binder in flat compacts (similar to some makeup) and applied with special Soft micropore sponge tools. No liquid is involved. A 21st-century invention, pan pastels can be used for the entire painting or in combination with soft and hard sticks.
* ''Hard pastels'': These have a higher portion of binder and less pigment, producing a sharp drawing material that is useful for fine details. These can be used with other pastels for drawing outlines and adding accents. Hard pastels are traditionally used to create the preliminary sketching out of a composition.&lt;ref name="Martin_p8" /&gt; However, the colors are less brilliant and are available in a restricted range in contrast to soft pastels.
* ''Pastel pencils'': These are pencils with a pastel lead. They are useful for adding fine details.
In addition, pastels using a different approach to manufacture have been developed:
* ''[[Oil pastel]]s'': These have a soft, buttery consistency and intense colors. They are dense and fill the grain of paper and are slightly more difficult to blend than soft pastels, but do not require a fixative. They may be spread across the work surface by thinning with turpentine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Water-soluble pastels'': These are similar to soft pastels, but contain a water-soluble component, such as [[Polyethylene glycol]]. This allows the colors to be thinned out to an even, semi-transparent consistency using a water wash. Water-soluble pastels are made in a restricted range of hues in strong colors. They have the advantages of enabling easy blending and mixing of the hues, given their fluidity, as well as allowing a range of color tint effects depending upon the amount of water applied with a brush to the working surface.

There has been some debate within art societies as to what exactly counts as a pastel. The Pastel Society within the UK (the oldest pastel society) states the following are acceptable media for its exhibitions: ''"Pastels, including Oil pastel, Charcoal, Pencil, [[Conté]], [[Sanguine]], or any dry media".'' The emphasis appears to be on "dry media" but the debate continues.

==Manufacture==
In order to create hard and soft pastels, pigments are ground into a paste with water and a gum binder and then rolled or pressed into sticks. The name "pastel" comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''pastellum'', woad paste, from [[Late Latin]] ''pastellus'', paste. The [[French language|French]] word ''pastel'' first appeared in 1662.

Most brands produce gradations of a color, the original pigment of which tends to be dark, from pure pigment to near-white by mixing in differing quantities of [[chalk]]. This mixing of pigments with chalks is the origin of the word "pastel" in reference to "pale color" as it is commonly used in cosmetic and fashion venues.

A pastel is made by letting the sticks move over an abrasive ground, leaving color on the grain of the paper, sandboard, canvas etc. When fully covered with pastel, the work is called a pastel ''painting''; when not, a pastel ''sketch'' or ''drawing''. Pastel paintings, being made with a medium that has the highest pigment concentration of all, reflect light without darkening [[refraction]], allowing for very [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] colors.

==Pastel supports==
Pastel supports need to provide a "tooth" for the pastel to adhere and hold the pigment in place.  Supports include:

* [[laid paper]] (e.g. Ingres, Canson Mi Teintes)
* abrasive supports (e.g. with a surface of finely ground [[pumice]], marble dust, or [[rottenstone]])
* velour paper (e.g. Hannemühle Pastellpapier Velour) suitable for use with soft pastels is a composite of synthetic fibers attached to acid-free backing &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-052462-7| last = Mortensen| first = Andreas| title = Concise Encyclopedia of Composite Materials| date = 2006-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Pastel Book | publisher=Watson-Guptill | date=1999-08-01 | last=Creevy | first=Bill | location=New York; Great Britain | page=33 | isbn=978-0-8230-3905-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of pastel artworks==
[[Image:Scenery painter Schlosspark Charlottenburg berlin 20080423.jpg|thumb|Scenery painter in [[Charlottenburg|Schlosspark Charlottenburg]], Berlin]]
Pastels can be used to produce a permanent work of art if the artist meets appropriate archival considerations.  This means:

* Only pastels with lightfast pigments are used. As it is not protected by a binder the pigment in pastels is especially vulnerable to light. Pastel paintings made with pigments that change color or tone when exposed to light suffer comparable problems to gouache paintings using the same pigments.
* Works are done on an acid free archival quality support.  Historically some works have been executed on supports which are now extremely fragile and the support rather than the pigment needs to be protected under glass and away from light.
* Works are properly mounted and framed under glass so that the glass does not touch the artwork. This prevents the deterioration which is associated with environmental hazards such as air quality, humidity, mildew problems associated with condensation and smudging.
* Some artists protect their finished pieces by spraying them with a [[fixative (drawing)|fixative]].  A pastel fixative is an aerosol varnish which can be used to help stabilize the small charcoal or pastel particles on a painting or drawing. It cannot prevent smearing entirely without dulling and darkening the bright and fresh colors of pastels. It is also toxic, therefore it requires careful use. The use of hairspray as a fixative is generally not recommended as it is not acid free and therefore can degrade the artwork in the long term. Traditional fixatives will discolor eventually.

For these reasons, some pastelists avoid the use of a fixative except in cases where the pastel has been overworked so much that the surface will no longer hold any more pastel. The fixative will restore the "tooth" and more pastel can be applied on top. It is the tooth of the painting surface that holds the pastels, not a fixative. Abrasive supports avoid or minimize the need to apply further fixative in this way. SpectraFix, a modern casein fixative available premixed in a pump misting bottle or as concentrate to be mixed with alcohol, is not toxic and does not darken or dull pastel colors. However, SpectraFix takes some practice to use because it's applied with a pump misting bottle instead of an aerosol spray can. It is easy to use too much SpectraFix and leave puddles of liquid that may dissolve passages of color; also it takes a little longer to dry than conventional spray fixatives between light layers.

[[Glassine]] (paper) is used by artists to protect artwork which is being stored or transported.  Some good quality books of pastel papers also include glassine to separate pages.

==Techniques==
[[File:Frottage 02.jpg|thumb|A pastel frottage created by rubbing pastel on paper laid over stone]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - On the Cliff - Theodore Robinson.jpg|thumb|''On the Cliff'' by [[Theodore Robinson]], 1887. A warm beige paper is used as a colored ground to enhance the pink colors. The rough textured ground provided by the paper also enhances the impressionistic style of the pastel work.]]

Pastel techniques can be challenging since the medium is mixed and blended directly on the working surface, and unlike paint, colors cannot be tested on a palette before applying to the surface. Pastel errors cannot be covered the way a paint error can be painted out. Experimentation with the pastel medium on a small scale in order to learn various techniques gives the user a better command over a larger composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastels have some techniques in common with painting, such as blending, [[masking (art)|masking]], building up layers of color, adding accents and highlighting, and [[shading]]. Some techniques are characteristic of both pastels and sketching mediums such as charcoal and lead, for example, [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]], and [[gradation (art)|gradation]]. Other techniques are particular to the pastel medium.

* Colored grounds: the use of a colored working surface to produce an effect such as a softening of the pastel hues, or a contrast
* Dry wash: coverage of a large area using the broad side of the pastel stick. A cotton ball, paper towel, or brush may be used to spread the pigment more thinly and evenly.
* Erasure: lifting of pigment from an area using a [[kneaded eraser]] or other tool
* [[Feathering]]
* [[Frottage (art)|Frottage]]
* [[Impasto]]: pastel applied thickly enough to produce a discernible texture or relief
* [[Pounce (art)|Pouncing]]
* [[Resist techniques (art)|Resist techniques]]
* Scraping out
* [[Scumbling]]
* [[Sfumato]]
* [[Sgraffito]]
* [[Stippling]]
* Textured grounds: the use of coarse or smooth paper texture to create an effect, a technique also often used in watercolor painting
* Wet brushing

==Health and safety hazards==
Pastels are a dry medium and produce a great deal of dust, which can cause respiratory irritation. More seriously, pastels use the same pigments as artists' paints, many of which are [[toxic]]. For example, exposure to [[cadmium pigments]], which are common and popular bright yellows, oranges, and reds, can lead to [[cadmium poisoning]]. Pastel artists, who use the pigments without a strong painting binder, are especially susceptible to such poisoning. For this reason, many modern pastels are made using substitutions for cadmium, chromium, and other toxic pigments, while retaining the traditional pigment names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyofcanadianartists.com/content/page.aspx?section=68&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 "Dry Pastel"], Society of Canadian Artists. Retrieved 26 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastel art in art history==
The manufacture of pastels originated in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Monnier"&gt;Monnier, Geneviève, "Pastel", Oxford Art Online&lt;/ref&gt; The pastel medium was mentioned by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who learned of it from the French artist [[Jean Perréal]] after that artist's arrival in Milan in 1499.&lt;ref name="Monnier" /&gt; Pastel was sometimes used as a medium for preparatory studies by 16th-century artists, notably [[Federico Barocci]]. The first French artist to specialize in pastel portraits was [[Joseph Vivien]].

During the 18th century the medium became fashionable for [[portrait]] painting, sometimes in a mixed technique with [[gouache]]. Pastel was an important medium for artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Perronneau]], [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (who never painted in oils),&lt;ref&gt;Monnier, Geneviève, "Maurice-Quentin de La Tour", Oxford Art Online&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rosalba Carriera]]. The pastel [[still life]] paintings and portraits of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] are much admired, as are the works of the Swiss-French artist [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]]. In 18th-century England the outstanding practitioner was [[John Russell (painter)|John Russell]]. In [[Colonial America]], [[John Singleton Copley]] used pastel occasionally for portraits.

In France, pastel briefly became unpopular during and after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], as the medium was identified with the frivolity of the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name="Werner_15" /&gt; By the mid-19th century, French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and especially [[Jean-François Millet]] were again making significant use of pastel.&lt;ref name="Werner_15"&gt;Werner, A., &amp; Degas, E. (1977). ''Degas pastels''. New York: Watson-Guptill Publications. p. 15. {{ISBN|082301276X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their countryman [[Édouard Manet]] painted a number of portraits in pastel on canvas, an unconventional ground for the medium. [[Edgar Degas]] was an innovator in pastel technique, and used it with an almost [[expressionist]] vigor after about 1885, when it became his primary medium.&lt;ref name="Werner_15" /&gt; [[Odilon Redon]] produced a large body of works in pastel.

[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] produced a quantity of pastels around 1880, including a body of work relating to Venice, and this probably contributed to a growing enthusiasm for the medium in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/amdr2/hd_amdr2.htm |title=Nineteenth-Century American Drawings |author= |date= |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he demonstrated how few strokes were required to evoke a place or an atmosphere. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist active in France, introduced the Impressionists and pastel to her friends in Philadelphia and Washington.

According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ''Time Line of Art History: Nineteenth Century American Drawings'': {{quote|[Among American artists] by far the most graphic and, at the same time, most painterly wielding of pastel was Cassatt's in Europe, where she had worked closely in the medium with her mentor Edgar Degas and vigorously captured familial moments such as the one revealed in ''Mother Playing with Child''.}}

On the East Coast of the United States, the Society of Painters in Pastel was founded in 1883 by [[William Merritt Chase]], Robert Blum, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Merritt Chase: A Modern Master|last=Smithgall|first=Elsa, et al.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300206265|location=New Haven|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Pastellists]], led by [[Leon Dabo]], was organized in New York in late 1910 and included among its ranks [[Everett Shinn]] and [[Arthur Bowen Davies]].  On the American West Coast the influential artist and teacher [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]], who served as Chief Administrator of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] and Director of the [[Stanford University]] Museum and Art Gallery, popularized pastels in regional exhibitions.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=64–65, pls. 3b, 5a, 7a-11b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1919 de Lemos published a series of articles on “painting” with pastels, which included such notable innovations as allowing the intensity of light on the subject to determine the distinct color of laid paper and the use of special optics for making “night sketches” in both urban and rural settings.&lt;ref&gt;School Arts Magazine (Worcester, Mass.): 18.7, 1919, pp. 353–356; 19.10, 1920, pp. 596–600; 25.2, 1925, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  His night scenes, which were often called “dreamscapes” in the press, were influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], and especially [[Odilon Redon]].

Pastels have been favored by many modern artists because of the medium's broad range of bright colors. Modern notable artists who have worked extensively in pastels include &lt;!--NOTABLE artists with art in MUSEUM COLLECTIONS only, please--&gt; [[Fernando Botero]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Daniel Greene (artist)|Daniel Greene]], [[Wolf Kahn]], and [[R. B. Kitaj]].

'''''Perseus Freeing Andromeda''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Piero di Cosimo]], c. executed in 1510 or 1513&lt;ref name="f202"&gt;Fossi, 202&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

The painting is mentioned in 1568 by [[Giorgio Vasari]], who states that it was commissioned by [[Filippo Strozzi the Elder]], and gifted by Giovanni Battista Strozzi to a member of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]]'s personnel. 

The work shows the [[Greek mythology|mythological hero]] [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] killing the monster who had entrapped [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. Piero gave a great deal of attention to the background, perhaps inspired to the contemporary Flemish school:&lt;ref name="f202"/&gt; details include   the two characters with a [[turban]] on the left, the very detailed painting of the water on the shore, and the fantastic musical instruments.

[[File:PeterPan Statue Londres.jpg|thumb|Statue in Kensington Gardens]]
[[File:Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan in 1906]]

The '''''Peter Pan'' statue''' is a bronze sculpture of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s character [[Peter Pan]]. It was commissioned by Barrie and made by Sir [[George Frampton]].  The original statue is displayed in [[Kensington Gardens]] in London, to the west of [[The Long Water]], close to Barrie's former home on [[Bayswater Road]].  Barrie's stories were inspired in part by the gardens: the statue is located at the place where Peter Pan lands in Barrie's book ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' after flying out of his nursery.  Six other casts made by the original artist have been erected in other locations around the world.

==Statue in Kensington==
The sculpture stands about {{convert|14|ft}} high.  It has a tall conical form, like a tree stump, topped by a young boy, approximately life size for an eight year old, wearing a nightshirt and blowing a thin musical instrument like a trumpet or flute, sometimes interpreted as [[pan pipes]].  The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies.  Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of [[Michael Llewelyn Davies]] wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood.

A completed plaster model of the work was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in May 1911.  Barrie had the original bronze erected in London on 30 April 1912, without fanfare and without permission, so that it might appear to children that the fairies had put it in place overnight.  He published a notice in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper the following day, 1 May: "There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning. Down by the little bay on the south-western side of the tail of the Serpentine they will find a May-day gift by Mr J.M. Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around. It is the work of Sir George Frampton, and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived." 

He donated the sculpture to the city of London, although some critics objected to him advertising his works by erecting a sculpture in a public park without permission.  It became a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1970. A plaque was unveiled by [[Princess Margaret]] in 1997.

==Other casts==
Frampton made a series of small bronze reproductions of the Pan figure from 1913 to his death in 1928.  Examples were sold at [[Bonham's]] in March and November 2015, and one was sold in Scotland in 2016 for £60,000.

Frampton made six other full-size casts from the original moulds, which are situated in:
* {{Interlanguage link|Egmont Park|fr|Parc d'Egmont}}, in [[Brussels]], donated to the Belgian state by Frampton in 1924 to recognise the Anglo-Belgian friendship during the First World War; it suffered bullet damage in the Second World War, and was listed as a Belgian historical monument in 1975.
* [[Bowring Park (St. John's)|Bowring Park]], in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], erected on 29 August 1925, as a tribute to Betty Munn, the daughter of [[John Shannon Munn]], who had died aged three on 23 February 1918 in the sinking of [[SS Florizel|SS ''Florizel'']].
*[[Sefton Park]], in [[Liverpool]], erected overnight on 16 June 1928; it was vandalised in 1990; restored, it was relocated to a position in the grounds of the [[palm house]]; it received a Grade II listing in 1985.
* [[Queens Gardens, Perth|Queens Gardens]], in [[Perth, Western Australia]], erected overnight on 10 June 1929, and donated by [[Rotary International]] to the [[Perth City Council]] to celebrate the centenary of the state of [[Western Australia]] (founded in 1829 as [[Swan River Colony]]).
* [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada; erected on 14 September 1929 by the [[College Heights Association]] in a park that became known as "Peter Pan Park" after the statue, but later renamed [[Glenn Gould Park]].
* The grounds of [[Rutgers University]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], by [[Eldridge R. Johnson]] in 1929, and located outside the Walt Whitman Arts Center.

The memorial to George Frampton in the Crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] sculpted by Edward Gillick in 1930 depicts a young child holding in his hand a miniature replica of his statue of Peter Pan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/London_City2_StPaul.html|title=City of London – 2: St. Paul's Cathedral|publisher=Church Monuments Society|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sculptures==
Other sculptors have created statues of Peter Pan, including two by [[Alistair Smart]] near the birthplace of J. M. Barrie in [[Kirriemuir]] in Scotland; [[Charles Andrew Hafner]]'s 1928 sculpture in [[Carl Schurz Park]] in New York City; [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]]'s sculpture given to the [[Red Cross Children's Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]] in 1959; [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]'s 1965 sculpture in [[Dunedin Botanic Garden]], and [[Diarmuid Byron O'Connor]]'s 2000 sculpture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London.

==Transportation seating==
[[File:Poltrona_frau,_modello_177,_1915.jpg|thumb|Model 177, 1915]]
In addition to designing seating for yachts, airplanes and helicopters,&lt;ref name="movetotolentino"/&gt; Poltrona Frau has designed leather interiors for automobiles since 1988, when Lancia asked the company to design and manufacture interiors for their new version 8.32 Thema model.  Poltrona Frau has since made interiors from automotive companies ranging from [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Lancia]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Maserati]] to [[Mini]], [[Fiat]], [[Infiniti]] and [[Chrysler]].&lt;ref name="hauteliving.com"/&gt;

In 2002 the company's leathersmiths created red leather seating and pillions for a special edition of the [[Moto Guzzi California|California]] model of noted Italian motorcycle manufacturer [[Moto Guzzi]], in celebration of the company's 80th anniversary.&lt;ref name="guzzi"&gt;{{cite news

==Museum==
To mark its centennial in 2012, the company opened the Poltrona Frau Museum, designed by Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, formerly of the [[Memphis Group]],&lt;ref name="nyt01"&gt;{{cite news

The museum features approximately sixty of the company's emblematic furniture pieces, many from the collection of board chairman Franco Moschini, and organizes the company's history and production with examples of furniture, drawings, images and manufacturing materials in a 1400 square meter building under the theme “l’intelligenza delle mani," which translates "intelligence of the hands," or roughly "manual know-how".&lt;ref name="lucchi"&gt;{{cite news

A primary video gallery highlights a technical glossary of the company: nine hand tools, methods and materials &amp;mdash; including the curved needle, nails, horsehair, quilting and the hammer &amp;mdash; the tools and materials required to fold, stitch, attach and work leather.&lt;ref name="lucchi"/&gt;

'''''Portrait of Manuel Godoy''''' is a large 1801 oil on canvas painting by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco de Goya]], now in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. It was commissioned by the Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel Godoy]] to commemorate his victory in the brief [[War of the Oranges]] against [[Portugal]].

The portrait is an incisive psychological characterisation. The subject's self belief is depicted via his unusual reclining posture, the surrounding horses, and the phallic baton situated between his legs.&lt;ref&gt;Bozal, 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; The painting metaphorically places Godoy sitting at the apex of the Spanish government. The artist captures Godoy's arrogance through his posture, and the inclusion of Portuguese flags.&lt;ref&gt;Glendinning, 44–48&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of lighting gives intensity to the piece.

In 1801 Godoy was the height of his power, having won in the [[War of the Oranges]] he was now Generalissimo of "land and sea" and "Prince of Peace"; pompous titles he willingly accepted. He and Goya were friends, Godoy owned two of the artist's portraits of [[Majo|Majas]], which he may have commissioned. He was close to and held influence over the [[Charles IV of Spain]]'s wife, [[Maria Luisa of Parma]], and married into the royal family via the [[Countess of Chinchon]], a cousin of the king. Goya had earlier portrayed Godoy in 1794 when he was Duke of Alcudia, with a small equestrian portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Braham, 621&lt;/ref&gt; His career ended in disgrace and after the [[Spanish War of Independence]], after which he was banished to live in poverty. He died in exile in Paris in 1851. Despite his fall he continued to speak favourably for the artist, and in his memoirs referred to Goya's ''[[Caprichos]]'' with extreme favour, as if he himself had seen them published.

[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of painting and frame restoration – before and after]]

'''Restoration''' is a process that attempts to return [[cultural heritage]] to some previous state that the restorer imagines was the "original". This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of [[conservation-restoration]] was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it "look good." The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.
 
==Techniques==
[[File:Carroll Wales, Art Restorer, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration- Boston.jpg|thumbnail|Restoration of [[Kariye Camii]], Istanbul, 1957]]
Art conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. [[Michelangelo]]'s [[David (Michelangelo)|statue of David]] has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.

Art restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry.  It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.

===Watercolor on fresco===
The use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year [[Conservation-restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper|restoration of Da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been "re-painted", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly "stippling" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.

===Painting with light===

In 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by [[Mark Rothko]] from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room.  It restored the works to their original appearance by digitally projecting light carefully calibrated at each pixel from a photograph of the original colors, which made up the difference between the current and original appearance without damaging the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-06-03|accessdate=2015-06-07|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rothko-harvard-murals/32374/|title=Harvard uses projection technology to shine new light on faded Rothko murals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/about/press/mark-rothko%E2%80%99s-harvard-murals-feature-harvard-art-museums%E2%80%99-inaugural-special-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shop fitting''' ('''shopfitting''') is the trade of fitting out [[retail]] and service [[Retailing|shops]] and [[Retailing|stores]] with equipment, fixtures and fittings. The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to [[hypermarket]]s. A '''shop fitter''' executes planning, [[design]]s shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting [[business entity|firm]] typically incorporates professional expertise in [[interior design]], manufacturing of [[bespoke]] furniture, signage and fittings (with own or [[outsourcing|outsourced]] facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.

A shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke furniture, delivers and physically installs them—until the shop is ready for daily operation.

There are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. [[Fashion]] shop design requires up-to-the-minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in.

==Systems==
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Shopfitting system''' refers to a product range made to satisfy the needs of shopfitters and ultimately retailers for display and [[merchandising]] goods. A shopfitting system can be adapted from combinations of standardized components for a particular retail application. A manufacturer would normally launch new shopfitting systems on a 2-year basis. Leading manufacturers would offer design oriented systems, followers would reinterpret them making the display solution achievable with as many as existing items as possible, hoping that retailers will choose their product because of the cheap price.

Shopfitting systems are usually connected to a "modular" concept, meaning that each item has more than one use. This economically goes into the rules of "network", where one element has the value of three, if added to another element, because 1x1=1 but 2x2=4: an extra item designed and compatible with others, has very high value.

== Shop Fitting Profession ==
'''Shop Fitting''' is a profession that involves the fitting of retail outlets like corner shops, department stores, convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets with equipment, fixtures and fittings. It’s carried out by a shop fitter who executes all planning, design, layout and installation of equipment and services. A '''shop fitter''' brings interior design expertise and assists in the design of bespoke furniture, fittings and signage and also with the buying of retail equipment.

The process begins with a survey of the retail premises and measurement of available space. The next stage is the preparation of design, which is then submitted to the client for review and approval. Some clients provide their own design drawings that are prepared by another interior designer.  Finally, the shop fitter arranges for the purchase of standard equipment and the production of the bespoke furniture, which is delivered and installed – ready for the shop operation. 

Shop fitting is a precision orientated profession that requires intricacy and exceptional attention to detail in order to meet client requirements. Visual elements heavily impact customer behaviour hence why shop fitting is now at the forefront of attracting new customers to stores across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lake|first1=Dean|title=Shop Fitting|url=https://lakecontracts.co.uk/service/shop-fitting/|website=Lake Contracts|publisher=Lake Contracts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skadarlija''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Скадарлија}}) is a [[vintage]] street, an [[List of Belgrade neighborhoods|urban neighborhood]] and former municipality of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]]. It is located in the Belgrade municipality of [[Stari Grad, Belgrade|Stari Grad]] (Old town) and generally considered the main [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] quarter of Belgrade, similar to Paris' [[Montmartre]]. After [[Kalemegdan]], Skadarlija is the second most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade,&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/72010/Beograd/Skadarlija-vraca-izgubljeni-boemski-duh |author=Daliborka Mučibabić|title= Skadarlija vraća izgubljeni boemski duh|date=21 January 2010|publisher=[[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to one third of the city's foreign currency income.&lt;ref name=dusa&gt;{{ cite news | author = Branka Vasiljević, Ana Vuković | title = Duša i gostoljublje Skadarlije | trans-title = Soul and hospitality of Skadarlija | newspaper = Politika | page = 18 | language = Serbian | date = 30 April 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/402862/Dusa-i-gostoljublje-Skadarlije }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Skadarlija is located less than {{convert|300|m|yd}} north-west of [[Terazije]], central Belgrade. It begins right below the [[Republic Square (Belgrade)|Republic Square]] and stretches along the short, winding Skadarska Street. One of the most famous streets in Belgrade, it is less than {{convert|400|m|yd}} long. It connects the Despot Stefan Boulevard with the Dušanova Street, near the Bajloni open greenmarket and the Mira Trailović Square, where it extends into the neighborhood of [[Dorćol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beograd - plan i vodič |edition=III |publisher=Geokarta |year=2007 |page=21 | ISBN=978-86-459-0297-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though today the term is mostly applied to the street only, Skadarlija is a former municipality of Belgrade and a wider quarter which includes some 20 neighboring streets.&lt;ref name=dusa/&gt;

== Administration ==
Skadarlija became a separate municipality of Belgrade in 1952, after the previous post-[[World War II]] division of Belgrade into [[raion]]s from 1945 to 1952 ended. That municipality included a large portion of urban Belgrade, mainly the [[Danube]] oriented neighborhoods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mala enciklopedija Prosveta |edition=I |volume=Vol. II |year=1959 |publisher=[[Prosveta Publishing House]] |location=Belgrade |page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Dorćol, [[Jalija]], Stari Grad, etc. By the 1953 census, municipality of Skadarlija had a population of 31,281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Popis stanovništva 1953, Stanovništvo po narodnosti (pdf)|date=|publisher=Savezni zavod za statistiku, Beograd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1957 it merged into the new municipality of Stari Grad and Skadarlija became a "local community" (''mesna zajednica''), sub-municipal administrative unit, within the municipality. According to the censuses, the local community of Skadarlija had a population of 7,399 in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Osnovni skupovi stanovništva u zemlji – SFRJ, SR i SAP, opštine i mesne zajednice 31.03.1981, tabela 018|date=1983|publisher=Savezni zavod za statistiku (txt file)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7,074 in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stanovništvo prema migracionim obeležjima – SFRJ, SR i SAP, opštine i mesne zajednice 31.03.1991, tabela 018|date=1983|publisher=Savezni zavod za statistiku (txt file)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 5,942 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popis stanovništva po mesnim zajednicama, Saopštenje 40/2002, page 4|date=26 July 2002|publisher=Zavod za informatiku i statistiku grada Beograda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipality of Stari Grad later abolished local communities.

The history of Skadarlija began in 1830 with the settlement of [[Romani people|Gypsies]] in the abandoned trenches in front of the [[defensive wall|rampart]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://turizam.bg-info.org/ulice-trgovi/skadarska-ulica-d1713 |title= Skadarlija |publisher= www.bg-info.org |date= 2014 |accessdate= 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1854 town plan of Belgrade reveals that the Gypsy hovels had been replaced by brick buildings into which artisans, caterers, petty clerks and others moved. The whole locality was referred to as the ''Gypsy Quarter'', ''Gypsy Alley'' or ''Šićan Mala'' and remained a Romani settlement until 1870. In that period, the stream called ''Bibijin potok'' ("Bibija stream"), which originates under the modern [[Politika]] building in the ''Makedonska'' street, flowed down the alley, crossing it. The stream was named after Bibija, the Romani deity of salvation.&lt;ref name="obnova"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/380450/Pocinje-obnova-cesme-i-platoa-u-Skadarliji | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Počinje obnova česme i platoa u Skadarliji | trans-title = Reconstruction of the drinking fountain and the plateau in Skadarlija begins | date = 13 May 2017 | publisher = Politika | page = 15 | language = Serbian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sican"&gt;{{Citation | author = Ana Vuković | title = Očuvanje tradicije i duha boemske četvrti | trans-title = Preservation of the tradition and spirit of the bohemian quarter | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 23 July 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/385374/Ocuvanje-tradicije-i-duha-boemske-cetvrti }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Belgrade was divided into quarters, and the stream was an administrative border between the quarters of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]] and Dorćol (Stari Grad). As Palilula limited the playing of music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dorćol section to continue with festivities.&lt;ref name=dusa/&gt;

An aqueduct was later constructed which conducted the stream underground, which still flows below the street. The largest arch of the aqueduct was named [[Skadar]], after the town, so in 1872 the street was named ''Skadarska ulica''. Serbian for "Skadar street", it is still the street's official name.&lt;ref name="obnova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sican"/&gt; As of 2018, Skadarska is among only 29 streets in Belgrade which never changed their names since the first naming of the city streets in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Dejan Spalović | title = Knez Mihailova kroz vekove | trans-title = Knez Mihailova through centuries | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 21 February 2009 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/76168/Beograd/Knez-Mihailova-kroz-vekove }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901, when the well-known ''Dardaneli'' inn, located where the [[National Museum in Belgrade]] is today, was demolished and its guests, prominent writers and actors, moved to the Skadarlija inns or [[kafana]]s.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; In the early 20the century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: ''Tri šešira'' ("Three Hats"), ''Dva jelena'' ("Two Deer"), ''Zlatni bokal'' ("The Golden Chalice"), ''Bandist'', ''East'', ''Guild'', ''[[Vuk Karadžić]]'', ''Bums keler'', ''Miloš Obilić'' and ''The two Sergeants''. The first three of these still survive today, accompanied by some new restaurants like ''Ima dana'' ("There will be days"), ''Skadarlija'' (demolished in 2006), ''Dva bela goluba'' ("Two White Doves"). In the late 19the century, the beginning of the street was a location of "Pašonin bulevar", the very first Belgrade's [[music hall]].&lt;ref name="mjuzikhol"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = M.Janković | title = Otvara se letnja sezona u Skadarliji |newspaper= [[Politika]] | pages = 16 | language = Serbian | date = 29 April 2017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end section of Skadarlija is known as the Skadarlija [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. It is mostly occupied by the brewery that belonged to one of the most distinguished Belgrade families before World War II, the [[Czechs|Czech]]-originating Bajloni family. It produced "Aleksandar" beer, made from thermal waters that spring out in the brewery's backyard. When Bajloni began digging for the foundations of his brewery in 1892, he discovered the bones of the mammoths and skulls of the Neanderthal [[Krapina Neanderthal site|Krapina man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Nikola Bilić | title = Putovanje kroz istoriju beogradskim metroom | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 30 October 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/196102/Putovanje-kroz-istoriju-beogradskim-metroom }}&lt;/ref&gt; The well is located 80 to 300 meters (250 to 1000 feet) under the surface. After 1945, the brewery became part of the "BIP" brewery, but was later closed. The spring water was bottled for drinking until the early 2000s. Under the brewery is a complex of ''lagums''  (subterranean galleries or [[catacombes]]), which were used as a storage rooms for the beer barrels. By 2008, the entire inner complex is abandoned and slated for demolition. However, as the project of massive reconstruction failed, the brewery became home for many coffeehouses and clubs.&lt;ref name="novosti"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/beograd.74.html:593517-Od-Skadarlije-prave-Savamalu|author=M.V.|title= Od Skadarlije prave Savamalu|date=1 March 2016 |publisher=[[Večernje Novosti]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house of [[Đura Jakšić]], a well-known writer and painter who lived and died in Skadarlija, has been turned into a meeting place for the poets participating in the Skadarlija Evenings event.  Its renovation and restoration began in 1968&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; in accordance with the designs made by a group of prominent artists: architect [[Uglješa Bogunović]] (1922–94), writer and painter [[Zuko Džumhur]] (1921–89), painter [[Mario Maskareli]] (1918–96), sculptor [[Milica Ribnikar-Bogunović]] (1931), painter and writer [[Momo Kapor]], among others. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduce modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of youth and bohemian artists of Belgade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mala enciklopedija Prosveta |edition=IV |volume=Vol. III |year=1986 |publisher=Prosveta |location=Belgrade |page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for further adaptations were made in 1977, but remained on paper until 2008.

In 1985 theatre director [[Zorica Jevremović Munitić]] founded Children's Street Theater /Ulično dečje pozorište/ in Skadarlija. The core of the troupe was made up of Romany children who lived in Skadarlija, 'white' children' from Dorcol (a nearby prestigious Belgrade neighborhood), Romany children from the favelas of the Belgrade suburb of Mirijevo (who sell flowers in Skadarlija), professional actors and painters who live in Skadarlija, a Skadarlija fortune-teller, clowns, fire eaters, and alternative artists (musicians, painters).

The present Skadarlija, a short and curved street, is a remarkable Belgrade tourist attraction.  It includes well-known restaurants, hotels (e.g. [[Le Petit Piaf]]), art galleries, antique and souvenir shops. At the end of the street there is the ''Sebilj'' fountain. It is an [[Sebil (fountain)|ornamented drinking fountain]], copy of the [[Sebilj in Sarajevo|Sebilj fountain]] in [[Baščaršija]] in [[Sarajevo]], and gift from Sarajevo to Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Borislav Stojkov | title = Ругло и брука у центру Београда | trans-title = Eyesore and disgrace in downtown Belgrade  | newspaper = Politika | page = 23 | language = Serbian | date = 24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups playing Serbian brass or traditional urban music and actors dressed in traditional Serb costumes perform down the street. Unlike other similar and popular places in Belgrade that are considered [[wikt:posh|posh]], Skadarlija is known as a place visited by young couples and entire families with children. Restaurants offer the [[Serbian cuisine|typical national cuisine]], most notably the ''roštilj'' (grilled meat) with ''pivo'' (beer). Skadarlija's [[café]]s, restaurants, art exhibits and cobblestone (''kaldrma'') promenade attract up to {{formatnum:20000}} people daily. The street is a [[car-free zone]] but it would be unsuited for traffic anyway because it is too narrow and with bumpy cobblestones.

=== Bohemian life ===
[[Image:Skadarlija Belgrade.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Putujući glumac restaurant along Skadarska street.]]

Well-known but mostly poor poets and writers became regular visitors of Skadarlija in the early 20th century, not just from Serbia but from the wider [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] areas, even before the Yugoslav state was formed as such in 1918. The most prominent residents and visitors in Skadarlija's Bohemian history include  Đura Jakšić, [[Dobrica Milutinović]], [[Žanka Stokić]],&lt;ref name="obnova"/&gt; [[Ilija Stanojević]],&lt;ref name="obnova"/&gt; [[Tin Ujević]], [[Gustav Krklec]], [[Stevan Sremac]], [[Antun Gustav Matoš]], [[Zuko Džumhur]], [[Momo Kapor]] and [[Silvana Armenulić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H6XtL6XNO9oC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=silvana+armenulic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F9XSUKP9FMT72QXAuYGgCA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silvana%20armenulic&amp;f=false |title= Newly Composed Folk Music of Yugoslavia; page 74 |publisher= books.google.com |date= 2002 |accessdate= 2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After decades of performing in Skadarlija's restaurants and outdoors, some singers and performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers [[Šaban Šaulić]], [[Toma Zdravković]], [[Olga Jančevecka]], [[Divna Đokić]], [[Sofka Vasiljković]], [[Mila Matić]], actress [[Ljubica Janićijević]] who impersonated Gypsy fortune-tellers, and [[Radomir Šobota]] as a drummer.&lt;ref&gt;''Skadarlija - duh boemije koji iščezava''; [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] documentary on Skadarlija; 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurants are proud of their lists of worldwide celebrities and epicurians who visited them over the decades. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ended his diet in Skadarlija [http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/229543/Hickok-u-Skadarliji--prekinuo-dijetu]. Often, they post photographs of their visits on the walls. For example, over the years, ''Tri šešira'' welcomed numerous famous guests such as guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]], politicians [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[Sandro Pertini]], and [[chess]] player [[Anatoly Karpov]]. Other celebrities who visited Skadarlija include queen [[Elizabeth II]], politicians [[Willy Brandt]], [[Gianni de Michelis]], [[Helmut Kohl]], [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], [[Yevgeny Primakov]], [[Igor Ivanov]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], author [[Alberto Moravia]], actors [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Vladimir Visotsky]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Alain Delon]], film director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]], etc.&lt;ref name=dusa/&gt;&lt;ref name="sican"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mjuzikhol"/&gt; Visitors from the later period include [[Joe Biden]] and [[Johannes Hahn]].&lt;ref name="obnova"/&gt;

As similar Bohemian quarters, Skadarlija and Parisian Montmartre [[Twin town|twinned]] on 22 October 1977. A group of French artists visited Belgrade to mark the occasion. They were joined by large crowds of Belgraders, and they formed a joint procession which walked from the [[Monument of Gratitude to France]] in [[Kalemegdan Park]], through [[Knez Mihailova Street]] and [[Republic Square, Belgrade|Republic Square]], to Skadarlija. The photos of the event are kept in the archive of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Miroslav Stefanović | title = Мајстор фотографије се не предаје | trans-title = The master of photography is not giving up | newspaper = Politika-Magazin, No. 1102 | pages = 24-25 | language = Serbian | date = 11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two identical plaques, commemorating the event, are placed in May 1978. In Montmartre, the plaque is placed on the building of the [[:fr:République de Montmartre|Free Commune of Montmartre]] while artist Branimir Bane Minić, who authored the plaque, was dubbed the Knight of Montmartre. In Belgrade, the plaque is placed across the house of Đura Jakšić.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Branimir Bane Minić| title=  Među nama – Plaketa na Monmartru | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = January 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a "bohemian flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = N.Belić | title = Boemski barjak u Skadarskoj ulici | newspaper = Politika | pages = 23 | language = Serbian | date = 2008-04-23 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flagpole]] is located in front of the ''Zlatni bokal'' restaurant. The ceremony is always attended by celebrities, including popular and opera singers, actors, and artists. The season usually begins in the late April/early May.

There is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. The code was rescinded in 1975 but was reintroduced in 2010. It includes the types of dishes that can be found on the menues, what types of uniforms, table clothes or music are allowed and the knowledge of foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

The entire season consists of a series of festivities and celebrations: Summer Saint Nicholas Feast, Skadarlija Fest, Flower Festival (''Festival cveća''), Hat Fesival (''Šeširijada''), [[Tamburica]] Fest, Miss Skadarlija Paegeant, children's cooking festival ''Varjačići'' (visited by [[Jamie Oliver]]), wine exhibitions, painting and poetry evenings, theatrical shows, Snail Race for choosing the slowest bicycle rider, dancing shows for the old-style dances, etc.&lt;ref name=dusa/&gt;

The symbol of Skadarlija is a [[Fedora]]-type hat. There are numerous folk songs which mention the hat, they are dedicated to it or named after it. This especially goes for the songs in the style of [[starogradska muzika]], which is another emblematic feature of Skadarlija.&lt;ref name=dusa/&gt;

=== Greenmarket ===
At the end of the street, across the ''Dušanova'' Street, there is an open greenmarket, officially named Skadarlija Greenmarket. It developed spontaneously in the 19th century for the customers from the lower [[Dorćol]] neighborhood, for whom the central city market, the Great Market, was too distant and uphill. It was established on an empty lot in front of the Filip's Brewery, which was later renamed to Bajloni Brewery and the market became known as the Bajloni Market (''Bajlonijeva pijaca'').&lt;ref name=pijaca&gt;{{Citation | author = Dragan Perić | title = Beogradski vremeplov - Pijace: mesto gde grad hrani selo | trans-title = Belgrade chronicles - greenmarkets: a place where village feeds the city | newspaper = Politika-Magazin, No. 1047 | pages = 26–27 | language = Serbian | date = 22 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 the Great Market was finally closed and city founded several new markets throughout the city, further from the downtown: [[Zeleni Venac]], [[Kalenić, Belgrade|Kalenić]] and Jovanova market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = D.J.S. | title= Pijace slave Svetog Andreja Prvozvanog | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 13 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Dragan Perić| title = Šetnja pijacama i parkovima| newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin No 1021 | pages = 28–29  | language = Serbian | date = 23 April 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, the Bajloni market was also adapted that year: it got new market stalls, a fence, quality stores for the meat, eggs and dairy products and improved hygiene. Though officially named Skadarlija today, the citizens refer to the market only as Bajloni.&lt;ref name=pijaca/&gt;

== 21st century ==
In February 2008, plans were announced for the complete reconstruction of the lowest section of Skadarlija (Skadarlija atrium, an area of about {{convert|1.5|ha|acre}}) bounded by the streets of ''Skadarska'', ''Zetska'', ''Cetinjska'' and ''Dušanova''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Skadarlija 2010 - novi život boemske četvrti | newspaper = Politika | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 2008-02-20 | url = http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Beograd/Skadarlija-2010-novi-zivot-boemske-chetvrti.lt.html | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works are scheduled to begin in September 2008 and due to be finished by December 2010. A new multi-functional center will include two hotels, subterranean garage, restaurants, museum and a new pedestrian zone comprising a wide promenade between the ''Skadarska'' and ''Cetinjska'' streets. The restaurant ''Stara Skadarlija'', two authentic walls of the brewery, the old tower and shopping mall, boiler room and ''lagums'' will be preserved but with additional functions. The tower will be illuminated and visible from the city neighborhoods below. The shopping mall's higher floors will be turned into a hotel. Lagums will be open for the public and turned into souvenir and gift shops. The atrium will be turned into a new commercial shopping mall and a hotel with subterranean garage of {{formatnum:1000}} parking spaces. Water springs will be co-opted and protected, and new drills will be added to the existing three springs, as a sort of a tourist attraction. The most controversial aspect at the moment appears to be the concept of a glass box-shaped membrane, lit from the inside, which is supposed to engulf the ''Stara Skadarlija'' restaurant. The idea is opposed by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Zasijaće Skadarlija | newspaper = [[Večernje Novosti]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 2008-02-23 | url = http://www.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=14&amp;status=jedna&amp;vest=116681&amp;datum=2008-02-23 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for ''Stara Skadarlija'', changes will mainly occur in the side from the ''Cetinjska'' street which is considered a low preservation urban area, unlike the Skadarlija side, which is protected by the law and no new construction works will be allowed. As the altitude difference from top to bottom of the projected area is {{convert|17|m|ft}}, it is ''[[de facto]]'' going to be step-like dug into the ground for almost three floors. The project was scrapped in the later years due to the unsolved property ownership issues,&lt;ref name="novosti"/&gt; as the BIP sold the brewery to the Italian company "Star Immobiliare" in 2006 which in turn sold it to the British "Invest Balkan Properties PLC" in 2007. Company "Elgin" acquired the building in 2010. They claimed that by the end of 2011, they will announce which of the world-famous [[hotel chain]]s will build a hotel but nothing happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Treća sreća za BIP-ovu Skadarliju | newspaper = Politika | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 31 October 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/196258/Beograd/Treca-sreca-za-BIP-ovu-Skadarliju}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016-17 reconstruction ===
Instead, reconstruction of the street was announced  by the city government in October 2016, as the cobblestones and the façades became damaged in time. Works were scheduled for the spring of 2017, but were moved to October 2017,&lt;ref name="mjuzikhol"/&gt; as the city decided to accept the proposition of the kafana owners to postpone it until after the touristic season is over. However, they decided to renovate the drinking fountain, which was to be finished in July 2017. As the fountain is at the beginning of the street, the tourists routinely avoid the street thinking it is completely closed, while those who enter the restaurants' terraces and gardens often leave as the dust is everywhere, especially in the initial section of the street. The number of visitors dwindled and the restaurateurs accused the city administration of "ruining the 2017 season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_id=1271802 |author=Večernje Novosti |title= "Ko je ovo odlučio - uništio nas u Skadarliji" |date=14 June 2017 | publisher= B92|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fountain was restored according to the original 1966 project of Bogunović and Ribnikar, and the works were finished on 7 July 2017, 10 days ahead of the schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = | title = Završena pre roka: Obnovljena česma na Skadarliji puštena u rad | newspaper = [[Blic]]| pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 7 July 2017 | url = http://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/zavrsena-pre-roka-obnovljena-cesma-na-skadarliji-pustena-u-rad/ckgk64y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone fountain, which was built on the location of an old, one-pipe fountain from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, was fully renovated and the stone bench made of the yellow [[Ljig]] sandstone, which was projected in 1966, was finally built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author =Branka Vasiljević  | title = Obnovljena Skadarlijska česma | newspaper = Politika | pages = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 8 July 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reconstruction began on 16 October 2017 and was projected to last until the spring of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Milan Janković | title = Od danas radovi u Skadarliji | trans-title = Works in Skadarlija start today | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 16 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 photos appeared showing that the trademark stone ''kaldrma'' has been removed and that street was paved with the [[asphalt concrete]]. It prompted a major public outburst and protests, so the city authorities explained that the asphalt is just the substrate and that stones will be washed and placed on top of the asphalt. As the works were under the tougher public scrutiny since then, it was obvious that the old stone was replaced with the new, imported one, produced in Greece in 2016. City then announced that the old and new stones will be mixed, but instead of a colorful stones of the old ''kaldrma'', the new one is uniformly gray, described as the "dark shroud, in contrast to the previous playful and diverse one, which took [from Skadarlija] its joy and vibrancy and killed its Dionysian spirit".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74253">'''Harmony Classic''' is a women's [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] competition for small and mid-sized choruses run by [[Sweet Adelines International]] as part of the organisation's annual convention since 2010. The results of the competition are as follows.&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmony Classic|url=http://www.barbershophistory.com/scoresstats/harmony-classic/|website=Barbershop History|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoofiles&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmony Classic|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SweetAdelinesScores/files/Harmony%20Classic/|website=Sweet Adelines Scores (Yahoo Group)|accessdate=27 April 2015|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a full explanation of the scoring system, qualification process, awards and records, see [[Sweet Adelines International competition]].

[[File:Metro Nashville Chorus Houston 2011-1018.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Metro Nashville Chorus]] having just become the "Mid-Size Chorus" (Division AA) [[#Harmony Classic champions|Harmony Classic champions]] in Houston, 2011]]
Qualification for the competition happens as part of the regional chorus competition. The five highest-scoring small (division A, fewer than 30 singers) and midsize (division, AA 31–60 singers) choruses across all regional competitions qualify directly for the Harmony Classic of the following year. With five choruses in each of the two divisions (A &amp; AA) a total of 10 choruses compete in this competition each year. Only one chorus from a region may compete in each of the divisions and the previous year's winner may not compete in the same division again the following year. Furthermore, a chorus may not compete in both the main competition and also the Harmony Classic at the same year. A chorus may potentially qualify for both the main chorus competition as well as the Harmony Classic, but are only permitted to compete in one, thereby making a space available for the next highest qualifier to take their place at the other competition.{{sfn|Competition Handbook|2015|p = 11}}

[[File:Taste bud.svg|thumb|right|Taste bud]]
'''Taste''', '''gustatory perception''', or '''gustation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Adjectival form]]: [[wikt:gustatory|gustatory]]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the five traditional [[sense]]s that belongs to the '''gustatory system'''.

Taste is the sensation produced when a substance in the mouth [[biochemistry|reacts chemically]] with [[taste receptor]] cells located on [[taste bud]]s in the [[oral cavity]], mostly on the [[tongue]]. Taste, along with smell ([[olfaction]]) and [[trigeminal nerve]] stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines [[flavor]]s of [[food]] and/or other substances. Humans have taste receptors on taste buds (gustatory calyculi) and other areas including the upper surface of the [[tongue]] and the [[epiglottis]].&lt;ref name=kids&gt;[http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/taste_buds.html What Are Taste Buds?] kidshealth.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;ots=D2KQ-D740L&amp;dq=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q=taste%20bud%20concentrated&amp;f=false Human biology (Page 201/464)] Daniel D. Chiras. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gustatory cortex]] is responsible for the perception of taste.

The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name = Schacter169&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|year=2009|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"&gt;Boron, W.F., E.L. Boulpaep. 2003. Medical Physiology. 1st ed. Elsevier Science USA.&lt;/ref&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

The sensation of taste includes five established basic tastes: [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Taste#Saltiness|saltiness]],  [[Bitter (taste)#Bitterness|bitterness]], and [[umami]].&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|title=The science of satisfaction|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-science-of-satisfaction|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072592/|title= How does our sense of taste work?|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=6 January 2012 |website= PubMed |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions. Sweet, savory, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to [[G protein-coupled receptors]] on the [[cell membrane]]s of taste buds. Saltiness and sourness are perceived when [[alkali metal]] or [[hydrogen]] [[ions]] enter taste buds, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th Edition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic tastes contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include [[Odor|smell]],&lt;ref name=kids/&gt; detected by the [[olfactory epithelium]] of the nose;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/nosek.html Smell - The Nose Knows] washington.edu, Eric H.

Rosenthal. Springer, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; temperature, detected by [[thermoreceptor]]s; and "coolness" (such as of [[menthol]]) and "hotness" ([[pungency]]), through [[chemesthesis]].

As taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.&lt;ref name=aa&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=two-great-tastes-not-great-together Why do two great tastes sometimes not taste great together?] scientificamerican.com. Dr. Tim Jacob, Cardiff University. 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=Sweet here, salty there: Evidence of a taste map in the mammilian brain.|journal=Science|date=2 September 2011|volume=333|issue=6047|page=1213|doi=10.1126/science.333.6047.1213|bibcode=2011Sci...333.1213M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[human]]s, taste perception begins to fade around 50 years of age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in [[saliva]] production.&lt;ref name="SeidelBall2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry M Seidel|author2=Jane W Ball|author3=Joyce E Dains|title=Mosby's Guide to Physical Examination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7HSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303|date=1 February 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-07357-8|page=303|authormask=|trans-title=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can also have distortion of tastes through [[dysgeusia]]. Not all [[mammal]]s share the same taste senses: some [[rodent]]s can taste [[starch]] (which humans cannot), [[cat]]s cannot taste sweetness, and several other [[carnivores]] including [[hyena]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[sea lion]]s, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scully|first1=Simone M.|title=The Animals That Taste Only Saltiness|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-animals-that-taste-only-saltiness|website=Nautilus|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tastes==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
Taste in the gustatory system allows humans to distinguish between safe and harmful food, and to gauge foods’ nutritional value. [[Digestive enzyme]]s in saliva begin to dissolve food into base chemicals that are washed over the papillae and detected as tastes by the taste buds. The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are visible to the naked eye.  Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.&lt;ref name="Schacter169"/&gt; The exception to this are the [[filiform papillae]] that do not contain taste buds. There are between 2000 and 5000&lt;ref name="Boron, W.F. 2003"/&gt; taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.  Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat. Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.

[[Bitter (taste)|Bitter]] foods are generally found unpleasant, while [[sour]], [[saltiness|salty]], [[sweet]], and [[umami]] tasting foods generally provide a pleasurable sensation.  The five specific tastes received by [[taste receptor]]s are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and ''[[umami|savoriness]]'', often known by its Japanese term "umami" which translates to ‘delicious’. As of the early twentieth century, Western physiologists and psychologists believed there were four basic tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, and bitterness. At that time, savoriness was not identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | title=New Seasonings | journal=Chemical Senses |origyear=First published 1909 | year= 2002 | volume=27 | issue=9 | pages= 847–849 |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/27/9/847|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1093/chemse/27.9.847 | pmid=12438213}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now a large number of authorities recognize it as the fifth taste.

One study found that both salt and sour taste mechanisms detect, in different ways, the presence of [[sodium chloride]] (salt) in the mouth, however, acids are also detected and perceived as sour.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lindemann | first=Bernd | title=Receptors and transduction in taste| journal=Nature |date=13 September 2001 | volume=413 |pages= 219–225|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6852/pdf/413219a0.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 December 2007 | doi=10.1038/35093032| pmid=11557991 | issue=6852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of salt is important to many organisms, but specifically mammals, as it serves a critical role in ion and water [[homeostasis]] in the body.  It is specifically needed in the mammalian [[kidney]] as an osmotically active compound which facilitates passive re-uptake of water into the blood.{{citation needed|reason=Which studies purport this?|date=September 2016}} Because of this, salt elicits a pleasant taste in most humans.

Sour and salt tastes can be pleasant in small quantities, but in larger quantities become more and more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals [[acids]], which can cause serious tissue damage.

The bitter taste is almost universally unpleasant to humans. This is because many [[nitrogenous]] [[organic compound|organic molecules]] which have a [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effect on humans taste bitter. These include [[caffeine]], [[nicotine]], and [[strychnine]], which respectively compose the stimulant in [[coffee]], addictive agent in [[cigarettes]], and active compound in many [[pesticides]]. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. Many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.

Sweet taste signals the presence of [[carbohydrates]] in solution. Since carbohydrates have a very high calorie count ([[saccharides]] have many bonds, therefore much energy), they are desirable to the human body, which evolved to seek out the highest calorie intake foods. They are used as direct energy ([[sugars]]) and storage of energy ([[glycogen]]). However, there are many non-carbohydrate molecules that trigger a sweet response, leading to the development of many artificial sweeteners, including [[saccharin]], [[sucralose]], and [[aspartame]]. It is still unclear how these substances activate the sweet receptors and what adaptational significance this has had.

The [[umami|savory]] taste (known in Japanese as "umami") was identified by Japanese chemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]] of [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], which signals the presence of the [[amino acid]] [[L-glutamate]], triggers a pleasurable response and thus encourages the intake of [[peptides]] and [[proteins]]. The amino acids in proteins are used in the body to build muscles and organs, transport molecules ([[hemoglobin]]), [[antibodies]], and the organic catalysts known as [[enzymes]]. These are all critical molecules, and as such it is important to have a steady supply of amino acids, hence the pleasurable response to their presence in the mouth.

In [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of mainly [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] cultural influence, [[pungency]] (piquancy or hotness) had traditionally been considered a sixth basic taste.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In 2015, researchers suggested a new basic taste of fatty acids called fat taste,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keast|first=Russell SJ|last2=Costanzo|first2=Andrew|date=2015-02-03|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

===Sweetness===
{{Main|Sweetness}}
[[File:Signal Transaction of the Sweet Taste.svg|thumb|The diagram above depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sweet taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is one taste cell of the taste bud, and object C is the neuron attached to the taste cell. I. Part I shows the reception of a molecule. 1. Sugar, the first messenger, binds to a protein receptor on the cell membrane. II. Part II shows the transduction of the relay molecules. 2. G Protein-coupled receptors, second messengers, are activated. 3. G Proteins activate adenylate cyclase, an enzyme, which increases the cAMP concentration. Depolarization occurs. 4. The energy, from step 3, is given to activate the K+, potassium, protein channels.III. Part III shows the response of the taste cell. 5. Ca+, calcium, protein channels is activated.6. The increased Ca+ concentration activates neurotransmitter vesicles. 7. The neuron connected to the taste bud is stimulated by the neurotransmitters.]]
Sweetness, usually regarded as a pleasurable sensation, is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s and a few other substances. Sweetness is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]]. Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein coupled receptor]]s coupled to the [[G protein]] [[gustducin]] found on the [[taste bud]]s. At least two different variants of the "sweetness receptors" must be activated for the brain to register sweetness. Compounds the brain senses as sweet are thus compounds that can bind with varying bond strength to two different sweetness receptors. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for all sweet sensing in humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhao |first=Grace Q. |author2=Yifeng Zhang |author3=Mark A.

For [[lactose]] it is 30 millimoles per liter, with a sweetness index of 0.3,&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt; and [[5-Nitro-2-propoxyaniline]] 0.002 millimoles per liter. “Natural” sweeteners such as [[saccharide]]s activate the GPCR, which releases [[gustducin]]. The gustducin then activates the molecule [[adenylate cyclase]], which catalyzes the production of the molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], or adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. This molecule closes potassium ion channels, leading to depolarization and neurotransmitter release. Synthetic sweeteners such as [[saccharin]] activate different GPCRs and induce taste receptor cell depolarization by an alternate pathway.

===Sourness===
{{Redirect|Sour}}[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Sour &amp; Salty.svg|thumb|The diagram depicts the signal transduction pathway of the sour or salty taste. Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1.

Cation, such as K+, channels are opened. III. Part III is the response of the cell. 3. An influx of Ca+ ions is activated.4. The Ca+ activates neurotransmitters. 5. A signal is sent to the neuron attached to the taste bud.]]

Sourness is the taste that detects [[acid]]ity. The sourness of substances is rated relative to dilute [[hydrochloric acid]], which has a sourness index of 1.

Sour taste is detected by a small subset of cells that are distributed across all taste buds in the tongue. Sour taste cells can be identified by expression of the protein [[PKD2L1]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060823184824.htm| title=Biologists Discover How We Detect Sour Taste |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this gene is not required for sour responses. There is evidence that the protons that are abundant in sour substances can directly enter the sour taste cells through apically located ion channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= A proton current drives action potentials in genetically identified sour taste cells|author1=Rui Chang, Hang Waters  |author2=Emily Liman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date= 2010 | volume=107 | issue=51 | pages=22320–22325 | pmc= 3009759

It has also been proposed that weak acids such as acetic acid, which is not fully dissociated at physiological pH values, can penetrate taste cells and thereby elicit an electrical response. According to this mechanism, intracellular hydrogen ions inhibit potassium channels, which normally function to hyperpolarize the cell.
By a combination of direct intake of hydrogen ions (which itself depolarizes the cell) and the inhibition of the hyperpolarizing channel, sourness causes the taste cell to fire action potentials and release neurotransmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The K+ channel KIR2.1 functions in tandem with proton influx to mediate sour taste transduction | author=Ye, W., Chang, R.

The most common food group that contains naturally sour foods is [[fruit]], such as [[lemon]], [[grape]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tamarind]], and sometimes [[melon]]. [[Wine]] also usually has a sour tinge to its flavor, and if not kept correctly, [[milk]] can spoil and develop a sour taste. Children in the US and UK show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heightened Sour Preferences During Childhood |author1=Djin Gie Liem  |author2=Julie A.

Many of these candies contain citric acid or [[malic acid]].

===Saltiness===
{{Redirect|Saltiness|the saltiness in the water|Salinity}}
The simplest receptor found in the mouth is the [[sodium chloride]] (salt) receptor. Saltiness is a taste produced primarily by the presence of [[sodium ion]]s. Other ions of the [[alkali metals]] group also taste salty, but the further from sodium, the less salty the sensation is.  A [[sodium channel]] in the taste cell wall allows sodium [[cation]]s to enter the cell. This on its own depolarizes the cell, and opens [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s, flooding the cell with positive calcium ions and leading to [[neurotransmitter]] release. This sodium channel is known as an [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC) and is composed of three subunits. An ENaC can be blocked by the drug [[amiloride]] in many mammals, especially rats. The sensitivity of the salt taste to amiloride in humans, however, is much less pronounced, leading to conjecture that there may be additional receptor proteins besides ENaC to be discovered.

The size of [[lithium]] and [[potassium]] ions most closely resemble those of sodium, and thus the saltiness is most similar. In contrast, [[rubidium]] and [[caesium]] ions are far larger, so their salty taste differs accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The saltiness of substances is rated relative to sodium chloride (NaCl), which has an index of 1.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee /&gt; Potassium, as [[potassium chloride]] (KCl), is the principal ingredient in [[salt substitute]]s and has a saltiness index of 0.6.&lt;ref name=" textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g. [[ammonium]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g. calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an [[action potential]]. But the chloride of calcium is saltier and less bitter than potassium chloride, and is commonly used in pickle brine instead of KCl.

===Bitterness===
{{See also|Bitter taste evolution}}
[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Bitter.svg|thumb|The diagram depicted above shows the signal transduction pathway of the bitter taste. Bitter taste has many different receptors and signal transduction pathways. Bitter indicates poison to animals. It is most similar to sweet. Object A is a taste bud, object B is one taste cell, and object C is a neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of a molecule.1. A bitter substance such as quinine, is consumed and binds to G Protein-coupled receptors.II. Part II is the transduction pathway 2. Gustducin, a G protein second messenger, is activated. 3. Phosphodiesterase, an enzyme, is then activated. 4. Cyclic nucleotide, cNMP, is used, lowering the concentration 5. Channels such as the K+, potassium, channels, close.III. Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron.]]

Bitterness is the most sensitive of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various [[bittering agent]]s. Common bitter foods and beverages include [[coffee]], unsweetened [[Hot chocolate|cocoa]], South American [[Mate (beverage)|mate]], [[bitter gourd]], [[Olive (fruit)|olives]], [[Peel (fruit)|citrus peel]], many plants in the family [[Brassicaceae]], [[dandelion]] greens, wild [[chicory]], and [[escarole]]. The ethanol in [[alcoholic beverages]] tastes bitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scinska A, Koros E, Habrat B, Kukwa A, Kostowski W, Bienkowski P |title=Bitter and sweet components of ethanol taste in humans |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |date=August 2000  |pmid=10940547 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00149-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including [[hops]] in [[beer]] and orange in [[bitters]]. [[Quinine]] is also known for its bitter taste and is found in [[tonic water]].

Bitterness is of interest to those who study [[evolution]], as well as various health researchers&lt;ref name="textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psychologyofeating&amp;drinking"&gt;Logue, A.W. (1986) ''The Psychology of Eating and Drinking''. New York: W.H. Freeman &amp; Co.{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since a large number of natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important protective function.&lt;ref name="textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed" /&gt;&lt;ref name= psychologyofeating&amp;drinking/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Glendinning, J.

The threshold for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages a concentration of 8 μ[[Molarity|M]] (8 micromolar).&lt;ref name="textbookofmedicalphysiology8thed"&gt;Guyton, Arthur C.

Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as [[TAS2R38]] coupled to the [[G protein]] [[gustducin]] are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maehashi, K., M.

Gustducin is made of three subunits. When it is activated by the GPCR, its subunits break apart and activate [[phosphodiesterase]], a nearby enzyme, which in turn converts a precursor within the cell into a secondary messenger, which closes potassium ion channels.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Also, this secondary messenger can stimulate the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to release Ca2+ which contributes to depolarization. This leads to a build-up of potassium ions in the cell, depolarization, and neurotransmitter release. It is also possible for some bitter tastants to interact directly with the G protein, because of a structural similarity to the relevant GPCR.

Some savory taste buds respond specifically to glutamate in the same way that "sweet" ones respond to sugar.

This causes the G-protein complex to activate a secondary receptor, which ultimately leads to neurotransmitter release. The intermediate steps are not known.

==Measuring relative tastes==
Measuring the degree to which a substance presents one basic taste can be achieved in a subjective way by comparing its taste to a reference substance.

==Functional structure==
[[File:1402 The Tongue.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Taste buds and papillae of the tongue]]

In the human body a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] refers to a form of energy which elicits a physiological or psychological action or response. [[Sensory receptors]] are the structures in the body which change the stimulus from one form of energy to another. This can mean changing the presence of a chemical, sound wave, source of heat, or touch to the skin into an electrical [[action potential]] which can be understood by the brain, the body’s control center. Sensory receptors are modified ends of sensory [[neurons]]; modified to deal with specific types of stimulus, thus there are many different types of sensory receptors in the body. The neuron is the primary component of the nervous system, which transmits messages from sensory receptors all over the body.

Taste is a form of [[chemoreception]] which occurs in the specialised [[taste receptor]]s in the mouth. To date, there are five different types of taste receptors known: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Each receptor has a different manner of [[sensory transduction]]: that is, of detecting the presence of a certain compound and starting an action potential which alerts the brain. It is a matter of debate whether each taste cell is tuned to one specific tastant or to several; Smith and Margolskee claim that "gustatory neurons typically respond to more than one kind of stimulus, [a]lthough each neuron responds most strongly to one tastant". Researchers{{who|date=September 2016}} believe that the brain interprets complex tastes by examining patterns from a large set of neuron responses. This enables the body to make "keep or spit out" decisions when there is more than one tastant present. "No single neuron type alone is capable of discriminating among stimuli or different qualities, because a given cell can respond the same way to disparate stimuli."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As well, [[serotonin]] is thought to act as an intermediary hormone which communicates with taste cells within a taste bud, mediating the signals being sent to the brain. Receptor molecules are found on the top of [[microvilli]] of the taste cells.

;Sweetness
Sweetness is produced by the presence of [[sugar]]s, some proteins, and a few other substances.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It is often connected to [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, which contain a [[carbonyl group]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Sweetness is detected by a variety of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s coupled to a [[G protein]] that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, [[gustducin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/04/science/how-the-taste-bud-translates-between-tongue-and-brain.html?pagewanted=all How the Taste Bud Translates Between Tongue and Brain] nytimes.com, 4 August 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, etal |title=The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste |journal=Cell |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=255–66 |date=October 2003  |pmid=14636554 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Saltiness
Saltiness is a taste produced best by the presence of [[ion|cations]] (such as {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|K|+}} or {{chem|Li|+}})&lt;ref name=ion/&gt; and is directly detected by cation influx into glial like cells via leak channels causing depolarisation of the cell.&lt;ref name=ion/&gt;

Other [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[cations]], e.g., [[ammonium]], {{chem|NH|4|+}}, and [[divalent]] cations of the [[alkali earth metal]] group of the [[periodic table]], e.g., calcium, {{chem|Ca|2+}}, ions, in general, elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, too, can pass directly through [[ion channel]]s in the tongue.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

;Bitterness
Research has shown that TAS2Rs (taste receptors, type 2, also known as T2Rs) such as [[TAS2R38]] are responsible for the human ability to taste bitter substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maehashi K, Matano M, Wang H, Vo LA, Yamamoto Y, Huang L |title=Bitter peptides activate hTAS2Rs, the human bitter receptors |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=365 |issue=4 |pages=851–5 |date=January 2008  |pmid=18037373 |pmc=2692459 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.070}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are identified not only by their ability to taste certain bitter ligands, but also by the morphology of the receptor itself (surface bound, monomeric).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindemann B |title=Receptors and transduction in taste |journal=Nature |volume=413 |issue=6852 |pages=219–25 |date=September 2001  |pmid=11557991 |doi=10.1038/35093032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further sensations and transmission==
The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the [[somatosensory]] system. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves.  The [[facial nerve]] (VII) carries taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the [[tongue]], the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) carries taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity.

The [[trigeminal nerve]] (cranial nerve V) provides information concerning the general texture of food as well as the taste-related sensations of peppery or hot (from [[spices]]).

===Pungency (also spiciness or hotness)===
{{Main|Pungency|Scoville scale}}

Substances such as [[ethanol]] and [[capsaicin]] cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve reaction together with normal taste reception. The sensation of heat is caused by the food's activating nerves that express [[TRPV1]] and [[TRPA1]] receptors. Some such plant-derived compounds that provide this sensation are capsaicin from [[chili pepper]]s, [[piperine]] from [[black pepper]], [[gingerol]] from [[ginger root]] and [[allyl isothiocyanate]] from [[horseradish]]. The [[pungency|piquant]] ("hot" or "spicy") sensation provided by such foods and spices plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world—especially in equatorial and sub-tropical climates, such as [[Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[peruvian cuisine|Peruvian]], [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Cuisine of Korea|Korean]], [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]], [[Cuisine of Laos|Lao]], [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]], [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]], [[New Mexican cuisine|New Mexican]], [[Singaporean cuisine|Singaporean]], [[Southwest China|Southwest Chinese]] (including [[Szechuan cuisine]]), [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], and [[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] cuisines.

This particular sensation, called [[chemesthesis]], is not a taste in the technical sense, because the sensation does not arise from taste buds, and a different set of nerve fibers carry it to the brain. Foods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly; the sensation interpreted as "hot" results from the stimulation of somatosensory (pain/temperature) fibers on the tongue. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, [[Cornea|surface of the eye]] or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to hotness agents. [[Asia]]n countries within the sphere of, mainly,  [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] cultural influence, often wrote of [[pungency]] as a fifth or sixth taste.

===Coolness===
Some substances activate cold [[trigeminal]] receptors even when not at low temperatures. This "fresh" or "minty" sensation can be tasted in [[peppermint]], [[spearmint]], [[menthol]], ethanol, and [[camphor]]. Caused by activation of the same mechanism that signals cold, [[TRPM8]] ion channels on [[neuron|nerve cells]], unlike the actual change in temperature described for sugar substitutes, this coolness is only a perceived phenomenon.

===Numbness===
Both Chinese and [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]] cooking include the idea of 麻 (''má'' or ''mati rasa''), a tingling numbness caused by spices such as [[Sichuan pepper]]. The cuisines of [[Sichuan]] province in China and of the Indonesian province of [[North Sumatra]] often combine this with [[chili pepper]] to produce a 麻辣 ''málà'', "numbing-and-hot", or "mati rasa" flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Zant_pip.html|title=Spice Pages:  Sichuan Pepper (Zanthoxylum, Szechwan peppercorn, fagara, hua jiao, sansho 山椒, timur, andaliman, tirphal)|first=Gernot|last=Katzer|website=gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sensations although not taste fall into a category of [[Chemesthesis]].

===Astringency===
Some foods, such as unripe fruits, contain [[tannins]] or [[calcium oxalate]] that cause an astringent or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include [[tea]], [[red wine]], [[rhubarb]], some fruits of the genus ''[[Syzygium]]'', and unripe [[persimmon]]s and [[banana]]s.

Less exact terms for the astringent sensation are "dry", "rough", "harsh" (especially for wine), "tart" (normally referring to sourness), "rubbery", "hard" or "styptic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peleg|first1=Hanna|last2=Gacon|first2=Karine|last3=Schlich|first3=Pascal|last4=Noble|first4=Ann C|title=Bitterness and astringency of flavan-3-ol monomers, dimers and trimers|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|date=June 1999|volume=79|issue=8|pages=1123–1128|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199906)79:8&lt;1123::AID-JSFA336&gt;3.0.CO;2-D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to wine, ''dry'' is the opposite of ''sweet,'' and does not refer to astringency. Wines that contain tannins and so cause an astringent sensation are not necessarily classified as "dry", and "dry" wines are not necessarily astringent.

In the Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic tradition]], one of the six tastes is astringency (''kasaaya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008083229/http://www.ayurshop.com/diet/rasas.html|date=8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sinhala Language|Sinhala]] and [[Sri Lankan English]] it is referred to as ''kahata''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirisgala.net/Updates/SL_English_Updates_K.html|title=Sri Lankan English - Updates K|website=www.mirisgala.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Tamil it is referred to as thuvarppu.

===Metallicness===
A metallic taste may be caused by food and drink, certain medicines or [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink. A metallic taste may be caused by [[Galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions in the mouth. In the case where it is caused by dental work, the dissimilar metals used may produce a measurable current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toothbody.com/art-battery-in-your-mouth.php|title=Is there a Battery in your Mouth? |publisher=www.toothbody.com |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the [[TRPV1]] receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Riera |first1=Céline E. |last2=Vogel |first2=Horst |last3=Simon |first3=Sidney A. |last4=le Coutre |first4=Johannes |title=Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate TRPV1 receptors. |date=2007 |journal=American Journal of Physiology |volume=293 |number=2 |pages=R626-R634 |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00286.2007 |pmid=17567713 |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/293/2/R626 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many people consider [[blood]] to have a metallic taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willard|first=James P.|year=1905|title=Current Events|journal=Progress: A Monthly Journal Devoted to Medicine and Surgery|volume=4|pages=861–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xygAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monosson|first=Emily|title=Evolution in a Toxic World: How Life Responds to Chemical Threats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqtrn8iwtecC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2012|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781597269766|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms [[dysgeusia]] or [[parageusia]], referring to distortions of the sense of taste,&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=E.

Other possible fat taste receptors have been identified. [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s [[GPR120]] and [[Free fatty acid receptor 1|GPR40]] have been linked to fat taste, because their absence resulted in reduced preference to two types of fatty acid ([[linoleic acid]] and [[oleic acid]]), as well as decreased neuronal response to oral fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Proposed alternate names to fat taste include oleogustus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Running |first1=Cordelia A. |last2=Craig |first2=Bruce A. |last3=Mattes |first3=Richard D. |date=3 July 2015 |title=Oleogustus: The Unique Taste of Fat |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/07/02/chemse.bjv036.abstract?sid=f45a0d90-7258-44e9-ac06-35ffde1b9bb1 |journal=Chemical Senses |publisher= |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages= 507–516|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjv036 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pinguis,&lt;ref name="Reed 353S–360S"/&gt; although these terms are not widely accepted. The main form of fat that is commonly ingested is [[triglycerides]], which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are hydrolysed into fatty acids via lipases. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, a high concentration of fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible.&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/research-confirms-fat-is-sixth-taste-names-it-oleogustus.html |title=Research confirms fat is sixth taste; names it oleogustus |last1=Neubert |first1=Amy Patterson |date=23 July 2015 |website=Purdue News |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish fat taste from other tastes, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual "creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of [[fatty acids]] is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as "more of a warning system" that a certain food should not be eaten.&lt;ref name="oleogustus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/2044-7248-4-5|title=Is fat the sixth taste primary?

There are few regularly consumed foods rich in fat taste, due to the negative flavor that is evoked in large quantities. Foods whose flavor to which fat taste makes a small contribution include olive oil and fresh butter, along with various kinds of vegetable and nut oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldhausen |first=Teresa Shipley |date=31 July 2015 |title=The five basic tastes have sixth sibling: oleogustus |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-basic-tastes-have-sixth-sibling-oleogustus |newspaper=[[Science News]] |access-date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heartiness (''kokumi'')===
Some Japanese researchers refer to the ''kokumi'' of foods. This sensation has also been described as mouthfulness,&lt;ref name="foodprot"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hettiarachchy |editor1-first=Navam S. |editor2-last=Sato |editor2-first=Kenji |editor3-last=Marshall |editor3-first=Maurice R. |title=Food proteins and peptides: chemistry, functionality interactions, and commercialization |date=2010 |publisher=CRC |location=Boca Raton, Fla. |isbn=9781420093414 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-h8UEImN7SAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=kokumi |accessdate=26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}} and appears to be related to a number of {{nowrap|[[alpha and beta carbon|γ]]-[[dextrorotation and levorotation|L]]-[[glutamic acid|glutamyl]] peptides}}, which activate a [[calcium-sensing receptor]] which is also sensitive to [[glutathione]].&lt;ref name="foodprot"/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can be an essential element of the taste experience. Food and drink that—in a given culture—is traditionally served hot is often considered distasteful if cold, and vice versa. For example, alcoholic beverages, with a few exceptions, are usually thought best when served at room temperature or chilled to varying degrees, but soups—again, with exceptions—are usually only eaten hot. A cultural example are [[soft drinks]]. In North America it is almost always preferred cold, regardless of season.

===Starchiness===
A 2016 study suggested that humans can taste [[starch]] (specifically, a [[glucose]] [[oligomer]]) independently of other tastes such as sweetness. However, no specific chemical receptor has yet been found for this taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapis|first=Trina J.|last2=Penner|first2=Michael H.|last3=Lim|first3=Juyun|date=23 August 2016|title=Humans Can Taste Glucose Oligomers Independent of the hT1R2/hT1R3 Sweet Taste Receptor|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/wp-content/uploads/lapis-etal-2106.pdf|journal=Chemical Senses|language=en|pages=bjw088|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjw088|issn=0379-864X|pmid=27553043|volume=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alexa J.|last1=Pullicin|first2=Michael H.|last2=Penner|first3=Juyun|last3=Lim|title=Human taste detection of glucose oligomers with low degree of polymerization|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|journal=PLOS ONE|date=29 August 2017|issn=1932-6203|pages=e0183008|volume=12|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0183008|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1283008P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104244-there-is-now-a-sixth-taste-and-it-explains-why-we-love-carbs/|title=There is now a sixth taste – and it explains why we love carbs|last=Hamzelou|first=Jessica|date=2 September 2016|website=[[New Scientist]]|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nerve supply and neural connections==

The [[Pterygopalatine ganglion|pterygopalatine ganglia]] are ganglia (one on each side) of the [[soft palate]]. The [[greater petrosal nerve|greater petrosal]], [[lesser palatine nerve|lesser palatine]]  and [[zygomatic nerve]]s all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the [[nasal cavity]]; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the [[lacrimal nerve]] that activate the [[lacrimal gland]]; which is the reason that spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are [[maxillary nerve]]s (from the [[trigeminal nerve]]).

The [[special visceral afferent]]s of the [[vagus nerve]] carry taste from the [[epiglottis|epiglottal]] region of the tongue.

The lingual nerve (trigeminal, not shown in diagram) is deeply interconnected with chorda tympani in that it provides all other sensory info from the ⅔ of the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Mu, Liancai, and Ira Sanders.

==Other concepts==
===Taste as a philosophical concept===
{{See also|Philosophy of perception}}

Taste can be objective in terms of the five tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter, and savory) but it can also be subjective in terms of what we deem "good" and "bad." Taste is "subjective, objective, and qualitative".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of it being a philosophical concept, taste is hard to define because it is essentially subjective when pertaining to the personal preferences of individuals i.e. "'de gustibus non est disputandum' (there is no disputing taste)".&lt;ref name="Schehr, Lawrence R. 2001"/&gt; We cannot tell someone they do not ''think'' something tastes good because we do not agree, and vice versa. In order to evaluate taste in this context, we must explore all the ways in which taste can be defined. According to Alan Weiss, taste fulfills the purpose of six functions: taste is the tool in which we use to define flavor; it is also flavor and how we categorize flavor (sweet or salty); it is the preference, we as the tastemakers, place on specific flavors and our demand for those flavors; it is whether we choose to like or dislike a certain taste and therefore allow it into our general society of acceptable tastes or exile it; it is the value in which we place on certain taste (one might believe one's taste in Bach or Rothko earns one capital); and lastly, with good judgement comes good taste and therefore, one with expressively good taste are expected to have good judgement, just as those in bad taste are expected to be in bad judgement &lt;ref&gt;Schehr, Lawrence R., and Allen S. Weiss. French Food: On the Table, on the Page, and in French Culture. New York: Routledge, 2001. 228-41. Print.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supertasters===
{{Main|Supertaster}}

A supertaster is a person whose sense of taste is significantly more sensitive than average. The cause of this heightened response is likely, at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartoshuk L. M. |author2=Duffy V. B. | year = 1994 | title = PTC/PROP tasting: anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects." 1994 | url = | journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1165–71 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90361-1 | pmid=7878086|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat and sugar in their food to get the same satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person. This is due to their heightened sense of the taste of bitterness, and the presence of salt drowns out the taste of bitterness. (This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Amanda|title=Love salt? You might be a 'supertaster'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/06/16/salt.taste/index.html|publisher=CNN Health|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftertaste===
{{Main|Aftertaste}}

Aftertastes arise after food has been swallowed. An aftertaste can differ from the food it follows. [[Medicine]]s and tablets may also have a lingering aftertaste, as they can contain certain artificial flavor compounds, such as [[aspartame]] (artificial sweetener).

===Acquired taste===
{{Main|Acquired taste}}

An acquired taste often refers to an appreciation for a food or beverage that is unlikely to be enjoyed by a person who has not had substantial exposure to it, usually because of some unfamiliar aspect of the food or beverage, including bitterness, a strong or strange odor, taste, or appearance.

==Clinical significance==
Patients with [[Addison's disease]], pituitary insufficiency, or [[cystic fibrosis]] sometimes have a hyper-sensitivity to the five primary tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK385/|title=Clinical Methods: The History, Physical, and Laboratory Examinations|last=Walker|first=H. Kenneth|year=1990|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorders of taste===
* [[ageusia]] (complete loss of taste)
* [[hypogeusia]] (reduced sense of taste)
* [[dysgeusia]] (distortion in sense of taste)
* [[hypergeusia]] (abnormally heightened sense of taste)

The Ancient Chinese regarded [[spiciness]] as a basic taste.

==Research==
The [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for the basic tastes of bitter, sweet and savory have been identified. They are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bachmanov | first1 = AA. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = GK. | title = Taste receptor genes. | journal = Annu Rev Nutr | volume = 27 | issue =  1| pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 | PMID = 17444812 | pmc=2721271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells that detect sourness have been identified as a subpopulation that express the protein [[PKD2L1]].

As for the assignment of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points. Glucose remains about three-quarters as sweet as sucrose whether displayed as 75 or 0.75.

'''''The Five Orders of Architecture''''' (''Regola delle cinque ordini d'architettura'') is a book on classical architecture by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] from 1562, and is considered "one of the most successful architectural textbooks ever written",&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evers|first=Vernd|title=Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present |year=2003|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-1699-8|pages=845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5OK-Yw-A3cC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having no text apart from the notes and the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=The classical language of architecture|year=1963|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69012-6|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57aoJE26kQkC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Vignola+%22no+text%22+orders&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wn5TIeqFI2P4gap2qHnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22no%20text%22%20orders&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in Italian as ''Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura'', it has been fully or partially translated in English with different titles, including ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Vignola: an elementary treatise on architecture comprising the complete study of the five orders, with indication of their shadows and the first principles of construction''; ''The Five Orders of Architecture according to Giacomo Barozzio of Vignola, to Which are Added the Greek Orders''; and ''The five orders of architecture, the casting of shadows and the first principles of construction based on the system of Vignola''.

==Contents==
The book tackles the five orders, [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], Doric, [[Ionic order|Ionic]], Corinthian, and [[Composite order|Composite]] in separate sections, each subdivided in five parts on the [[colonnade]], [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]], arcade with [[pedestal]], individual pedestals, and [[entablature]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. Following those 25 sections were some less related parts on [[cornice]]s and other elements. Written during the 1550s, it was published in 1562, and was soon considered the most practical work for the application of the five orders. Apart from the introduction, the book existed solely of 32 annotated plates, with views from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] illustrating the [[Corinthian order]] and the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] for the [[Doric order]]. Later editions had more illustrations.

==Author==
Vignola was an Italian [[Renaissance]] architect who was the assistant of [[Michelangelo]] during his work on the [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. He was also one of the architects of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] and the [[Church of the Gesu]]. Following the examples of the Classical Roman work of [[Vitruvius]] and the five books of the ''Regole generali d'architettura'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]] from 1537 on, Vignola started writing an architecture rule book on the [[classical order]]s. His work was more practical than the preceding two books which were more philosophical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallgrave|first=Harry Francis|title=An Anthology from Vitruvius to 1870|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0258-2|pages=590|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxo8t5cZf6MC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions and translations==
It was over the next centuries often reprinted, translated, and used as an inspiration, e.g. for [[William Robert Ware]]'s main work ''The American Vignola'' from 1904. By 1700, it had been reprinted 15 times in Italian, and was translated in Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=William R.|title=The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture|year=1994|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28310-4|pages=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, more than 250 editions of the book had been published,&lt;ref name=Taschen/&gt; marking it as "the most widely used architectural textbook of all up to the nineteenth century [...] forming one of the universal bases of courses of architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruft|first=Hanno-Walter|title=A history of architectural theory: from Vitruvius to the present|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-010-2|pages=706|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPTfVyHyVW4C&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=Vignola+cinque&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YP_4TLpXiJWzBqXhobQD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20cinque&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufism===
In 1970 Bayrak met [[Muzaffer Ozak]], who became his spiritual teacher, at the Jerrahi Lodge in Instanbul.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rory Dickson, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=HCiLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=jerrahi+america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj0IvShLDeAhUMC8AKHfz9BuQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jerrahi%20america&amp;f=false Living Sufism in North America: Between Tradition and Transformation], p. 108. [[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781438457581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayrak became a Sheikh of the Halveti-Jerrahi order and resided near the Jerrahi Order of America mosque in [[Spring Valley, New York]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sufism.org/books/names.html#tosun The Most Beautiful Names]&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as the spiritual guide of the Jerrahi Order of the Americas starting from 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html The Meaning of Age] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040626145532/http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html |date=2004-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and he founded the official mosque of the Order's American branch in [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; Though at one time an admirer of [[Fethullah Gülen]], Bayrak condemned the [[Gülen movement]] at a winter 2016 art exhibit in Istanbul due to the movement's alleged involvement in the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

{{cquote|“Service should be from the moment you are born until the moment you give your last breath, but you have to find out in what way. That's what's most important. We have to find out in what manner we are supposed to serve.” &lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks]], which ended as Bayrak was planning a Friday sermon, he declared that the perpetrators were insane, not Muslims, and opposed the key teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lerner and Richard Liebson, [https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2015/01/09/local-muslims-jews-horrified-terror-france/21530145/ Local Muslims, Jews horrified by terror in Paris]. [[The Journal News]], 9 January 2015. Accessed 1 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayrak passed away in New York on 15 February 2018 at the age of 92.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Works==
===Artisty===
Bayrak taught art and art history at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], where he helped to establish the Fine Arts Division.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; His work was exhibited widely in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html The Tree of Being] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072115/http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim]] fellow in 1965.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Authors/Detail.asp?AuthorID=97&amp;WhatType=1 Tosun Bayrak]&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from the art world in the 1970s and devoted his life to the study and teaching of [[Islam]] and Sufism. 

{{cquote|“Both my wife and I were artists, and we felt very strongly that it was feeding our egos. Art, art exhibitions, and the consequences of being accepted and successful are incredible food for your ego, which is the Sufi's enemy. The final straw was when we went to Rome to visit a friend, a sculptor, and there was a very pretty young girl there whom my friend introduced me to. And she was so adoring to me. She said, "Ohhh, I know you. I love your art." She was completely praising me, and I saw the ego suddenly rise up and say, "Aha! This beautiful, spiritual girl is telling you that you are a great artist." So I said, "Oh, my God! That's it. It's over." I hit the ego on the head and decided I was finished with it all.&lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Translation===
Bayrak translated dozens of books on Islamic spirituality, but he was particularly known for his efforts on the works of the Sufi mystic [[Ibn Arabi]]. One of his best known works is ''Ibn Arabi: The Tree of Being''. His translations of classic works of Sufism include [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]'s ''Secret of Secrets'', ''Inspirations'', and ''The Book of Sufi Chivalry'', ''[[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]]: The Shape of Light'', ''The Name and the Named: Divine Attributes of God'', and [[Imam Birgivi]]'s ''The Path of Muhammad''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

A '''used book''' or '''secondhand book''' is a [[book]] which has been owned before by an owner other than the [[publisher]] or [[retailer]], usually by an individual or [[library]]. 

Used books typically become available on the market when they are sold or given to a [[second-hand shop]] or [[used bookstore]]; they are usually sold for about half or three-quarters the price of what they would cost new, though rare books and others still in demand or hard to obtain might sell for more than this. 

Some new [[book shop]]s also carry used books, and some used book shops also sell new books. Though the original [[author]]s or [[publisher]]s will not benefit financially from the sale of a used book, it helps to keep old books in circulation. Sometimes very old, rare, [[Edition (book)|first edition]], [[antique]], or simply [[out of print]] books can be found as used books in used book shops.

A reading copy of a book may be well-used, may include highlighting or [[marginalia]], and is suitable for reading, but is not collectible. This is a term used in the used book business, to indicate the lack of collectible value, while claiming that the book is in sufficiently good condition for a purchaser whose interest is primarily in actually reading the book. A reading copy is typically less expensive than a collectible copy.

==Booktowns==
A number of small towns have become centres for used book sellers, most notably [[Hay-on-Wye]] in [[South Wales]]. They act as a magnet for buyers, and are located in country areas of great scenic beauty.

'''Maria Evangelina Leonel Gandolfo''' (4 May 1963 – 14 July 2014), known as '''Vange Leonel''', was a [[Brazil]]ian [[singer-songwriter]], rhythm guitarist, [[journalist]], [[blog]]ger, [[Crônica|chronicler]], novelist, playwright, [[beer sommelier]], and [[Feminism|feminist]] and [[LGBT]] activist.

Known for her distinctive [[Soul music|soulful]], [[blues]]y vocals heavily inspired by [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Janis Joplin]], she was famous for her work with [[post-punk]] band Nau, active from 1985–89, before beginning a solo career in 1991.

==Biography==
Vange Leonel was born in [[São Paulo]] in 1963; great-granddaughter of [[General officer|General]] [[Ataliba Leonel]], who fought in the [[Constitutionalist Revolution|1932 Constitutionalist Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://minasprogramam.com/vange-leonel/ Vange Leonel #minasprogramam]&lt;/ref&gt; and cousin of former [[Titãs]] member [[Nando Reis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://som13.com.br/nau/biografia Nau's biography by former member Zique] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; her first musical ventures were with the [[post-punk]] band Nau ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "[[carrack]]"), which was founded in 1985. Nau released an [[Nau (album)|eponymous album]] by [[CBS Records International|CBS]] in 1987, and also took part in the compilation ''[[Não São Paulo, Vol. 2]]'', released by [[Baratos Afins]]; however, it would disband in 1989, after plans for a second studio album fell through, and Vange followed with a solo career.

Her first solo album, ''[[Vange (album)|Vange]]'', was released in 1991 by [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment]], and spawned her most well-known song, "Noite Preta", which was used as the opening theme of the popular Brazilian ''[[telenovela]]'' ''[[Vamp (telenovela)|Vamp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantorasdobrasil.com.br/cantoras/vange_leonel.htm Cantoras do Brasil - Vange Leonel] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another song off the album, "Esse Mundo", would be used as the opening theme for another ''telenovela'', ''[[Perigosas Peruas]]''.

Her second solo release, the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Vermelho]]'', came out in 1996 by the independent label Medusa Records, founded by Vange and her [[Domestic partnership|domestic partner]], journalist Cilmara Bedaque, in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1996/12/13/ilustrada/36.html ''Vange mostra "Vermelho"'']. ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 13 December 1996 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bedaque also co-authored numerous of Vange's songs since the times of Nau. ''Vermelho'' was not as well-regarded as her previous album though, and Vange abandoned the musical career to devote herself to literature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Vange [[Coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]] in 1995, and since then began to milit toward the gay cause and [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/250603/p_072.html ''A força do arco-íris'']. Camila Antunes, ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]'', 25 June 2003 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 she published her first book, ''Lésbicas'', that was followed by ''Grrrls: Garotas Iradas'' in 2001; both were compilations of articles she wrote for now-defunct [[LGBT]] magazine ''Sui Generis'' from 1997 to 2000. She also wrote for the ''[[Revista da Folha]]'', ''[[CartaCapital]]'' and [[Mix Brasil]], and alongside Cilmara Bedaque she also had a [[beer]]-related blog named "Lupulinas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lupulinas.cartacapital.com.br/ Lupulinas official blog]; accessed 25 August 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she wrote her first [[play (theatre)|theatre play]], ''As Sereias da Rive Gauche'', that was performed in the same year under [[Regina Galdino]]'s direction&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u1301.shtml ''Vange Leonel estreia peça sobre lésbicas dos anos 20''], Marcelo Rubens Paiva, ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 20 June 2000 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published as a book in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u27329.shtml ''Vange Leonel lança segunda-feira o livro "As Sereias da Rive Gauche"'']. ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 13 September 2002 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first and only novel, ''Balada para as Meninas Perdidas'', was released in 2003.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Her fifth and last literary work was the play ''Joana Evangelista'', which came out in 2006; a modern-day reimagining of [[Joan of Arc]]'s life, it deals with the theme of [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/guia/te0704200602.shtml ''Novo texto de Vange Leonel enfoca aborto'']. ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 2006 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Vange stated that she was working on a translation to Portuguese of [[Djuna Barnes]]' 1928 novel ''[[Ladies Almanack]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acapa.virgula.uol.com.br/revista/no-brasil-ainda-tem-muito-artista-dentro-do-armario-diz-vange-leonel/13/38/15708 ''"No Brasil ainda tem muito artista dentro do armário", diz Vange Leonel'']. Paco Llistó and Lufe Steffen, ''A Capa'', 6 February 2012 {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, however, no further announcements regarding the translation were given, and it is unknown if she got to finish the translation prior to her death.

On 6 November 2014, Vange was posthumously awarded the [[Ordem do Mérito Cultural|Order of Cultural Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultura.gov.br/o-dia-a-dia-da-cultura/-/asset_publisher/waaE236Oves2/content/omc-2014/10883 Ministério da Cultura - OMC 2014]; accessed 25 August 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In mid-June 2014, Vange was diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]], and was admitted to the Santa Isabel Hospital in São Paulo for treatment. The cancer eventually [[Metastasis|metastasized]] to her [[gastric mucosa]], evolving to a [[Terminal illness|terminal]] stage; thus, whatever treatment proved to be unsuccessful, and Vange died, aged 51, on 14 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ego.globo.com/famosos/noticia/2014/07/morre-cantora-vange-leonel-aos-51-anos.html ''Morre cantora Vange Leonel aos 51 anos''], globo.com; accessed 25 August 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was [[Cremation|cremated]] and her ashes were buried the next day at the Horto da Paz Cemetery, in [[Itapecerica da Serra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ego.globo.com/famosos/noticia/2014/07/corpo-de-vange-leonel-e-velado-em-sao-paulo.html "Corpo de Vange Leonel é velado em São Paulo"], globo.com; accessed 25 August 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Vange began a relationship with Cilmara Bedaque in 1986, and the couple registered their [[domestic partnership]] in 1995. It lasted until Vange's death in 2014.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

A '''variorum''', short for ''(editio) cum notis variorum'', is a work that collates all known variants of a text.  It is a work of [[textual criticism]], whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.

==Etymology==
The word ''variorum'' is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase ''cum notis variorum'' ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.

==Original meaning==
An older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'.  Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] publishers of the 17th century, including the house of [[Elsevier]].  In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period;  the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators.  The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information.  Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, [[Nicolas Heinsius]]'s edition of [[Claudius Claudianus|Claudian]] (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.

==Notable variorum editions==
A variorum of the [[Bible]] has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with {{em|all}} variants in wording, from {{em|all}} known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.

There have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], including the readings of all [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos and folios]]; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of [[Isaac Reed]] in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.

[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times.  A variorum&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Morse, ed. (1959), ''The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Variorum Text'', [[Philadelphia]]: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1959.

There is also a variorum of ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. [[Walt Whitman]] produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime. The [[New York University Press]] produced a variorum in 1980 of these various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Sculley, Harold W. Blodgett and William White, eds. (1980), ''Leaves of Grass: A Textual Variorum of the Printed Poems, 1855-1891''; 3 vol., (Series: ''The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman''); New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Strachey]] translation of [[Freud]]'s ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in volumes four and five of ''[[The Standard Edition of The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud]]'' collates eight editions.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s works have been collated to produce a voluminous digital variorum. It can be viewed on the [http://bichitra.jdvu.ac.in Bichitra] website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">A '''Wallbook''' is a large printed [[book]] that is designed also to be mounted on a wall. For example, its design may be [[concertina]] folded so it can be read like a book or hung on a wall.

==Etymology==
The name was coined by [[Christopher Lloyd (world history author)]], creator of the 2010 ''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' which claims to be the first ever attempt to illustrate the entire history of everything from the [[Big Bang]] to the present day on a single [[timeline]].{{deadlink|date=August 2017}}
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebookseller.com/news/127565-publisher-launches-with-versatile-wallbook--.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and contents==
Reviewing the book for the ''Telegraph's'' Family Book Club, the writer Christopher Middleton encapsulates the work as a "7-foot, six-inch-long chart, which starts out some four billion years ago, with the explosion that triggered the Earth’s birth, and ends just a matter of months ago, with the election of [[Barack Obama]] and the [[Global credit crunch of 2008|global credit crunch]]" of 2008.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' is notable for its use of a [[logarithmic time]]scale. At the beginning of the timeline 1&amp;nbsp;cm represents the passage of 1 billion years but by the end of the timeline the same space accounts for just five years. A total of 12 changes of scale accounts for how the whole of the past can be graphically represented on a single piece of paper.

The wallbook’s 1,000 pictures and captions are arranged into 12 streams of colours which provide the [[Painted photography backdrops|backdrops]] along which the major events of [[Natural history|natural]] and [[human history]] unfold. The section, "Space, Earth, Sky, Sea, Land and Humanity" accounts for the story of [[evolution]] while [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], [[Africa]] and [[Australasia]] convey the rise and fall of human civilisations.

At the top of the timeline is a series of globes that start by showing the movement of the world’s [[continental plates]] but later chart the rise and fall of major human [[empire]]s.

==Distribution==
''The What on Earth? Wallbook'' was launched exclusively through [[The Daily Telegraph]] newspaper on Saturday 4 September 2010.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookclub/7979831/Family-Book-Club-The-What-on-Earth-Wallbook.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Since the launch of the ''What on Earth? Wallbook'' the word ''wallbook'' has been defined in ''Macmillan's Open Dictionary'' as a new noun meaning: "a large printed book which can be mounted on a wall". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macmillandictionary.com/open-dictionary/entries/wallbook.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the theatre director|the railway engineer|William Bridges Adams}}

'''William Bridges-Adams''' (1 March 1889 – 17 August 1965) was an English theatre director and designer, associated closely with the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], from 1919 until 1934.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
William Bridges-Adams was born in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], England, the only son of Walter Bridges Adams, tutor, and his wife, [[Mary Bridges-Adams|Mary Jane ''née'' Daltry]] (1854–1939)&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Speaight, Robert, Adams, William Bridges- (1889–1965), rev. Stanley Wells, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32068, accessed 18 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and grandson of the author and inventor [[William Bridges Adams]]. He was educated at [[Bedales School]] and [[Worcester College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''The Times'', 19 August 1965, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Oxford, Bridges-Adams joined the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] and played the leading roles of Leontes in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' and Prospero in ''[[The Tempest]]'', but his talent for direction and design was already leading him from acting to a backstage role. He staged two operas for [[Hugh Allen (conductor)|Sir Hugh Allen]], and directed the Oxford millenary pageant.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His design was influenced by the [[Post-Impressionists]] and by personal contacts with [[Charles Ricketts]] and [[Charles Haslewood Shannon|Charles Shannon]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Directing and designing===
After Oxford, Bridges-Adams began working in the professional theatre in 1911 under the managements of [[Laurence Sydney Brodribb Irving|Laurence Irving]], [[William Poel]], [[Harley Granville-Barker]] and [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]]. During this period Bridges-Adams occasionally worked as an actor, but more usually as a director and as a designer for other directors' productions. His first London production was in 1912 (a play called ''Job'', for the Norwich Players),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 November 1912, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and he became producer for the [[Bristol Old Vic]] repertory seasons, 1914–1915, and the [[Liverpool Playhouse|Playhouse Theatre]], Liverpool, 1916–1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowuk.co.uk/doc.do?ResultsID=115B799FA7A1&amp;SortType=relevance&amp;searchType=quick&amp;ItemNumber=2 ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black.] Accessed 18 November 2007 (requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; His designs for stage scenery included ''The Loving Heart'' at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in 1918 ("Quite the happiest feature of the production is Mr Bridges-Adams's scenery," said ''[[The Times]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 June 1918, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and no fewer than nine [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas for the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], beginning with ''[[Iolanthe]]'' in 1915, followed by ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1918), ''[[The Sorcerer]], [[The Pirates of Penzance]], [[Princess Ida]], [[The Mikado]], [[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (second act), all in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, Cyril and R. John Witts. ''The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' (1961) London: Michael Joseph Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 October 1921, p. 8. ''Rollins &amp; Witts'' incorrectly gives the year as 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespeare at Stratford===
In 1919, Bridges-Adams was appointed director of the Stratford-on-Avon Festival in succession to [[Francis Robert Benson|Sir Frank Benson]]. There were doubts about the continuing viability of the festival, and Bridges-Adams realised that changes and new ideas would be necessary. He threw himself into the task with great enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; His ambition was to win for Stratford an international status on a par with that of the [[Salzburg Festival]]. He secured the services of [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]] to direct ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'', and he himself produced 29 of Shakespeare's plays between 1919 and his retirement in 1934.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;
Unusually for the times, he presented Shakespeare's plays without cuts in the text, thereby earning the nickname 'Mr Unabridges-Adams'.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The original Memorial Theatre at Stratford was gutted by a disastrous fire in March 1926. Bridges-Adams' design for the stage layout of the replacement theatre (now the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre]]) was followed by architect [[Elisabeth Scott]] when the new theatre was built in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title= Trial flight for the Swan of Avon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1740490,00.html |work= |publisher= [[The Guardian|Guardian]]|date=27 March 1932 |accessdate=22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 he resigned as director of the festival. ''The Times'', in its obituary notice states, possibly tactfully, that he felt new blood was needed, but the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' states that he was frustrated by the governors' failure to back him in his attempts to gain an international status for the theatre with more guest directors of international repute.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

===Later years===
In 1936 Bridges-Adams directed [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Oedipus Rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], and he was appointed to the council of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and to the building advisory committee for the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]. From 1937 to 1944 he worked as dramatic adviser to the [[British Council]], promoting foreign tours of British works by British stage companies.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

His publications include: ''The Shakespeare Country'', 1932; ''The British Theatre'', 1944; ''Looking at a Play'', 1947; ''The Lost Leader'', 1954; ''The Irresistible Theatre'', 1957; ''To Charlotte While Shaving'' (verse), 1957; and, posthumously, a collection of his letters edited  by Robert Speaight, 1971.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

William Bridges-Adams died at his home in [[Bantry]], Ireland, aged 76, and was buried in the Abbey cemetery at Bantry.
