The '''Nicosia Britannia disaster''' was the death of 126 passengers and crew on a [[Bristol Britannia]] of the Swiss airline [[Globe Air]] when it flew into the ground {{convert|3.5|km|mi}} south of [[Nicosia Airport]], in [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="ASN" /&gt;

==Accident==
The Britannia was operating a charter flight bringing tourists from [[Bangkok]] in Thailand to [[Basel]] in Switzerland with stopovers in Colombo, Bombay, and Cairo.&lt;ref name="ASN" /&gt; The flight stopped at [[Colombo]] in Sri Lanka and then [[Bombay]] in India with the next stop due to be [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="ASN" /&gt; The crew diverted the flight to [[Nicosia]] due to bad weather at Cairo.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The aircraft was on the third attempt to land on Runway 32 in a violent thunderstorm when it flew into a hill near the village of [[Lakatamia]] and burst into flames.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

At the time of the crash, both pilots had exceeded their authorized duty time by three hours. The flight's first officer had less than 50 hours flying time in Britannia aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aviation Disasters Second Edition |last1=Gero |first1=David |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |year= 1996 |page=72|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two German (Christa Blümel and Peter Femfert) and two [[Swiss]] (Veronika Gysin and Nicolas Pulver) passengers survived; three of them were seriously injured and were treated at a United Nations field hospital near Nicosia, the fourth, Nicolas Pulver, was reported to be unhurt.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

'''Abacá''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|b|ə|ˈ|k|ɑː}} {{respell|ah-bə|KAH|'}}; {{lang-fil|Abaka}} {{IPA-tl|ɐbɐˈka|}}), binomial name '''''Musa textilis''''', is a species of [[banana]] native to the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{harvnb|Agricultural Research Services Botanists|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. The plant, also known as '''Manila hemp''',&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; has great economic importance, being harvested for its [[fiber]], also called [[Manila hemp]], extracted from the leaf-stems.&lt;ref name=bail/&gt; 

The plant grows to {{convert|13|-|22|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; and averages about {{convert|12|ft|m}}. The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes.  It is classified as a [[Leaf fiber|hard fiber]], along with [[coir]], [[henequin]] and [[sisal]].

==Description==
The abacá plant is stoloniferous, meaning that the plant produces runners or shoots along the ground that then root at each segment.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; Cutting and transplanting rooted runners is the primary technique for creating new plants, since seed growth is substantially slower.{{refn|group=nb|A plant grown from a shoot takes three years to maturity; while a plant grown from a seed takes four years to maturity.&lt;ref name=wor&gt;{{harvnb|Worcester|1899|p=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|Roberts|2005|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abacá has a "false trunk" or pseudostem about {{convert|6|-|15|in|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=bail/&gt; The leaf stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) are expanded at the base to form [[Leaf sheath|sheath]]s that are tightly wrapped together to form the pseudostem. There are from 12 to 25 leaves, dark green on the top and pale green on the underside, sometimes with large brown patches. They are oblong in shape with a deltoid base.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; They grow in succession. The petioles grow to at least {{convert|1|ft|cm}} in length.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; 

When the plant is mature, the flower stalk grows up inside the pseudostem. The male flower has five petals, each about {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} long.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; The leaf sheaths contain the valuable fiber. After harvesting, the coarse fibers range in length from {{convert|6|-|12|ft|cm}} long.&lt;ref name=bail/&gt; They are composed primarily of [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[pectin]].

The fruit, which is inedible&lt;ref name=bail/&gt; and is rarely seen as harvesting occurs before the plant fruits, grows to about {{convert|2|-|3|in|cm}} in length and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt; It has black turbinate seeds that are {{convert|0.167|in|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=bail2/&gt;

==Systematics==
The abacá plant belongs to the [[banana]] family, [[Musaceae]]; it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. Its scientific name is ''Musa textilis''. Within the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', it is placed in section ''Callimusa'' (now including the former section ''Australimusa''), members of which have a [[diploid]] [[chromosome]] number of 2n = 20.&lt;ref name=Wong02&gt;{{harvnb|Wong|Kiew|Argent|Set|2002|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Abaca fiber drying in Abaca farm, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Abaca fiber drying in abaca farm, [[Costa Rica]]]]
[[File:Abaca fiber.jpg|thumb|Abaca Fiber in [[Lagonoy, Camarines Sur]], [[Philippines]]]]
Before synthetic textiles came into use, ''M.&amp;nbsp;textilis'' was a major source of high quality fiber: soft, silky and fine.&lt;ref name=Ploe07&gt;{{harvnb|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestors of the modern abaca are thought to have originated from the Eastern Philippines where there are lot of rains (no pronounced dry season), in fact wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of Catanduanes Island which is often not cultivated. 

Today, Catanduanes  has many other modern kinds of abaca which are more competitive. For many years, breeders from various research institutions have made the cultivated varieties of Catanduanes Island even more competitive in local and international markets. This results in the optimum production of the island which had a consistent highest production throughout the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Europeans first came into contact with Abaca fibre when [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] made land in the Philippines in 1521, as the natives were cultivating it and utilizing it in bulk for textiles already.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; By 1897, the Philippines were exporting almost 100,000 tons of abacá,&lt;ref name=wor/&gt; and it was one of the three biggest cash crops, along with tobacco and sugar.&lt;ref name=dolan&gt;{{harvnb|Seekins|1993|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, from 1850 through the end of the 19th century, sugar or abacá alternated with each other as the biggest export crop of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=dolan/&gt; This 19th-century trade was predominantly with the United States and the making of ropes was done mainly in New England, although in time the rope-making was moved back to the Philippines.&lt;ref name=dolan/&gt; 

Excluding the Philippines, abacá was first cultivated on a large scale in [[Sumatra]] in 1925 under the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had observed its cultivation in the Philippines for [[cordage (rope)|cordage]] since the nineteenth century, followed up by plantings in [[Central America]] in 1929 sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also was transplanted into [[India]] and [[Guam]].&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;  Commercial planting began in 1930 in [[British North Borneo]]; with the commencement of World War II, the supply from the Philippines was eliminated by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

In the early 1900s, a train running from [[Danao, Cebu|Danao]] to [[Argao]] would transport Philippine abaca from the plantations to [[Cebu City|Cebu city]] for export.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tampos|first1=Nikki|title=What happened to Cebu's old train?|url=http://www.everythingcebu.com/lifestyle/what-happened-to-cebus-old-train/|website=www.everythingcebu.com|publisher=Everything Cebu|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train and tracks were destroyed during the Second world war, however the Abaca plantations continue and are now transported to Cebu by road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmera|first1=Erica Jean|title=The Sugbo railway|url=http://www.rafi.org.ph/news-highlights/sugbo-railway/|website=www.rafi.org.ph|publisher=RAFI|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] started production in [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; Today, abacá is produced primarily in the Philippines and Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/economic/futurefibres/fibres/abaca0/en/|title=Future Fibres: Abaca|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines produces between 85%&lt;ref name="NIMBB"/&gt; and 95%&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; of the world's abacá, and the production employs 1.5 million people. Production has declined because of virus diseases.&lt;ref name="NIMBB"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abacá Mat.jpg|thumb|Mats made from woven Abacá fibers from the [[Philippines]]]]

==Uses==
Due to its strength, it is a sought after product and is the strongest of the natural fibers.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; It is used by the paper industry for such specialty uses such as [[tea bags]], banknotes and decorative papers.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; It can be used to make handcrafts such as bags, carpets, clothing and furniture.  

Abacá rope is very durable, flexible and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in [[hawser]]s, ship's lines and [[fishing net]]s.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;  A {{convert|1|in|cm}} rope can require {{convert|4|MT|lb}} to break.&lt;ref name="Colliers"&gt;{{harvnb|Borneman, Jr.|1997|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abacá fiber was once used primarily for rope, but this application is now of minor significance.  Lupis is the finest quality of abacá.&lt;ref name="bab1"&gt;{{harvnb|Gove|1976|p=1347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinamay is woven chiefly from abacá.&lt;ref name="bab2"&gt;{{harvnb|Gove|1976a|p=2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textiles===
The inner fibers are used in the making of hats, including the "Manila hats," hammocks, matting, [[cordage (rope)|cordage]], ropes, coarse twines, and types of canvas. It is called [[Manila hemp]] in the market although it is unlike true hemp, and is also known as Cebu hemp and Davao hemp. Abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world, like the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Textile Museum of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abaca cloth|url = http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/abaca-cloth-73450|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Textile Museum of Canada Collection and Exhibitions {{!}} Textile Museum of Canada Collection and Exhibitions|url = http://collections.textilemuseum.ca/index.cfm?page=collection.browse&amp;sub=Yarn,_Fabric_and_Fabric_Finishing_Material&amp;cat=ArtifactType&amp;id=668|website = collections.textilemuseum.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippine indigenous tribes still weave abaca-based textiles like ''[[t'nalak]]'', made by the [[Tboli people|Tiboli]] tribe of [[South Cotabato]], and ''dagmay'', made by the [[Bagobo]] people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flysfo.com/museum/exhibitions/philippine-basketry-luzon-cordillera&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
The plant is normally grown in well-drained [[loam]]y soil, using [[rhizomes]] planted at the start of the rainy season.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; In addition, new plants can be started by seeds.&lt;ref name=van/&gt; Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months after an initial growth period of 12–25 months.&lt;ref name=bail/&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; Harvesting is done by removing the leaf-stems after flowering but before fruit appears.&lt;ref name=bail/&gt; The plant loses productivity between 15 and 40 years.&lt;ref name=bail&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|1947|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slopes of volcanoes provide a preferred growing environment.&lt;ref name="Colliers"/&gt; Harvesting generally includes several operations involving the leaf sheaths:
* tuxying (separation of primary and secondary sheath)
* stripping (getting the fibers)
* drying (usually following the tradition of sun-drying).

When the processing is complete, the bundles of fiber are pale and lustrous with a length of {{convert|6|-|12|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{harvnb|Considine|Considine|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Costa Rica, more modern harvest and drying techniques are being developed to accommodate the very high yields obtained there.

According to the [[Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority]], the Philippines provided 87.4% of the world's abaca in 2014, earning the Philippines US$111.33 million.&lt;ref name="Malaya2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=PH biggest abaca exporter {{!}} Malaya Business Insight|url=http://www.malaya.com.ph/business-news/business/ph-biggest-abaca-exporter|work=Malaya Business Insight|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The demand is still greater than the supply.&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;  The remainder came from Ecuador (12.5%) and Costa Rica (0.1%).&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;  The [[Bicol region]] in the Philippines produced 27,885 [[metric ton]]s of abaca in 2014, the largest of any [[Philippine region]].&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;  

The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture reported that in 2009-2013, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine abaca production while overwhelming 92% comes from [[Catanduanes|Catanduanes Island]]. Eastern Visayas, the second largest producer had 24% and the Davao Region, the third largest producer had 11% of the total production.  Around 42 percent of the total abaca fiber shipments from the Philippines went to the United Kingdom in 2014, making it the top importer.&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;  Germany imported 37.1 percent abaca pulp from the Philippines, importing around 7,755 metric tons (MT).&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;  Sales of abaca cordage surged 20 percent in 2014 to a total of 5,093 MT from 4,240 MT, with the United States holding around 68 percent of the market.&lt;ref name="Malaya2015" /&gt;

===Pathogens===
Abacá is vulnerable to a number of pathogens, notably [[abaca bunchy top virus]] and [[abaca bract mosaic virus]].&lt;ref name="NIMBB"/&gt;

{{Rquote
 |quote  = ''Atomic s character concentrates in orbitals directed toward electropositive substituents.''
 |align  = center
 |width  = 52%
}}

The [[chemical structure]] of a [[molecule]] is intimately related to its properties and reactivity. [[Valence bond theory]] proposes that molecular structures are due to [[covalent bond]]s between the [[atom]]s and that each bond consists of two overlapping and typically [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridised]] [[atomic orbital]]s. Traditionally, [[p-block]] elements in molecules are assumed to [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridise]] strictly as sp&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is either 1, 2, or 3. In addition, the hybrid orbitals are all assumed to be equivalent (i.e. the {{math|''n'' + 1}} sp&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals have the same p character). Results from this approach are usually good, but they can be improved upon by allowing [[isovalent hybridization]], in which the hybridised orbitals may have noninteger and unequal p character. Bent's rule provides a qualitative estimate as to how these hybridised orbitals should be constructed.&lt;ref name=WeinholdNHO&gt;{{citation|last1=Foster|first1=J. P.|last2=Weinhold|first2=F.|title=Natural hybrid orbitals|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume=102|issue=24|year=1980|pages=7211–7218|doi=10.1021/ja00544a007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bent's rule is that in a molecule, a central atom bonded to multiple groups will hybridise so that orbitals with more s character are directed towards electropositive groups, while orbitals with more p character will be directed towards groups that are more electronegative.  By removing the assumption that all hybrid orbitals are equivalent sp&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals, better predictions and explanations of properties such as [[molecular geometry]] and bond strength can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Orbital Hybridization: a Key Electronic Factor in Control of Structure and Reactivity. Alabugin, I. V.; Bresch S.; Gomes,  G. P. J. Phys. Org. Chem., 2015, 28, 147-162. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/poc.3382/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  Bent's rule has been proposed as an alternative to [[VSEPR theory]] as an elementary explanation for observed molecular geometries of simple molecules with the advantages of being more easily reconcilable with modern theories of bonding and having stronger experimental support.

Bent's rule can be generalized to [[d-block]] elements as well. The hybridisation of a metal center is arranged so that orbitals with more s character are directed towards [[ligand]]s that form bonds with more covalent character. Equivalently, orbitals with more d character are directed towards groups that form bonds of greater ionic character.&lt;ref name=WeinholdTextbook /&gt; The validity of Bent's rule for 75 bond types between the main group elements was examined recently.&lt;ref&gt;Hybridization Trends for Main Group Elements and Expanding the Bent’s Rule Beyond Carbon: More than Electronegativity". Alabugin, I. V.; Bresch S.; Manoharan, M. J. Phys. Chem. A 2014, 118, 3663– 3677. http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp502472u&lt;/ref&gt; For bonds with the larger atoms from the lower periods, trends in orbital hybridization depend strongly on both electronegativity and orbital size.

== History ==
In the early 1930s, shortly after much of the initial development of [[quantum mechanics]], those theories began to be applied towards molecular structure by [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]],&lt;ref name=Pauling&gt;{{citation|last=Pauling|first=L.|title=The nature of the chemical bond. Application of results obtained from the quantum mechanics and from a theory of paramagnetic susceptibility to the structure of molecules|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|volume=53|issue=4|year=1931|pages=1367–1400|doi=10.1021/ja01355a027}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[John C. Slater|Slater]],&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{citation|last=Slater|first=J. C.|title=Directed Valence in Polyatomic Molecules|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=37|issue=5|year=1931|pages=481–489|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.37.481|bibcode=1931PhRv...37..481S}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]],&lt;ref name=Coulson&gt;{{citation|last=Coulson|first=C. A.|title=Valence|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|edition=2nd|year=1961}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and others. In particular, Pauling introduced the concept of [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridisation]], where atomic s and p orbitals are combined to give hybrid sp, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals. Hybrid orbitals proved powerful in explaining the molecular geometries of simple molecules like methane (tetrahedral with an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon). However, slight deviations from these ideal geometries became apparent in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{citation|last=Walsh|first=A. D.| title=The properties of bonds involving carbon|journal=Discuss. Faraday Soc.| volume=2|year=1947|pages=18–25|doi=10.1039/DF9470200018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly well known example is [[water]], where the angle between hydrogens is 104.5°, far less than the expected 109.5°. To explain such discrepancies, it was proposed that hybridisation can result in orbitals with unequal s and p character. [[A. D. Walsh]] described in 1947&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt; a relationship between the electronegativity of groups bonded to carbon and the hybridisation of said carbon. Finally, in 1961, Henry A. Bent published a major review of the literature that related molecular structure, central atom hybridisation, and substituent electronegativities &lt;ref name=BentReview /&gt; and it is for this work that Bent's rule takes its name.

The C-H and C-F bonds are polar and so the electron density will be shifted towards carbon in the C-H bonds and towards fluorine in the C-F bonds. Directing orbitals with more s character towards the hydrogens is stabilizing, while directing orbitals of less s character towards the fluorine is destabilizing but to a lesser extent.]]

=== Polar covalent bonds ===

An informal justification of Bent's rule relies on s orbitals being lower in energy than p orbitals.&lt;ref name=BentReview /&gt; Bonds between elements of different [[Electronegativity|electronegativities]] will be [[Polar bond|polar]] and the electron density in such bonds will be shifted towards the more electronegative element. Applying this to the molecule [[fluoromethane]] provides a demonstration of Bent's rule. Because carbon is more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than hydrogen, the electron density in the C-H bonds will be closer to carbon. The energy of those electrons will depend heavily on the hybrid orbitals that carbon contributes to these bonds because of the increased electron density near the carbon. By increasing the amount of s character in those hybrid orbitals, the energy of those electrons can be reduced because s orbitals are lower in energy than p orbitals.

By the same logic and the fact that fluorine is more electronegative than carbon, the electron density in the C-F bond will be closer to fluorine. The hybrid orbital that carbon contributes to the C-F bond will have relatively less electron density in it than in the C-H case and so the energy of that bond will be less dependent on the carbon's hybridisation. By directing hybrid orbitals of more p character towards the fluorine, the energy of that bond is not increased very much.

Instead of directing equivalent sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals towards all four substituents, shifting s character towards the C-H bonds will stabilize those bonds greatly because of the increased electron density near the carbon, while shifting s character away from the C-F bond will increase its energy by a lesser amount because that bond's electron density is further from the carbon. The atomic s character on the carbon atom has been directed toward the more electropositive hydrogen substituents and away from the electronegative fluorine, which is exactly what Bent's rule suggests.

Although fluoromethane is a special case, the above argument can be applied to any structure with a central atom and 2 or more substituents. The key is that concentrating atomic s character in orbitals directed towards electropositive substituents by depleting it in orbitals directed towards electronegative substituents results in an overall lowering of the energy of the system.  This stabilizing trade off is responsible for Bent's rule.   

=== Nonbonding orbitals ===

Bent's rule can be extended to rationalize the hybridization of nonbonding orbitals as well.  On the one hand, a lone pair (an occupied nonbonding orbital) can be thought of as the limiting case of an electropositive substituent, with electron density completely polarized towards the central atom.  Bent's rule predicts that, in order to stabilize the unshared, closely held nonbonding electrons, ''lone pair orbitals should take on high s character''.  On the other hand, an unoccupied nonbonding orbital can be thought of as the limiting case of an electronegative substituent, with electron density completely polarized towards the ligand.  Bent's rule predicts that, in order to leave as much s character as possible for the remaining occupied orbitals, ''unoccupied nonbonding orbitals should maximize p character''.  

Experimentally, the first conclusion is in line with the reduced bond angles of molecules with lone pairs like water or ammonia compared to methane, while the second conclusion accords with the planar structure of molecules with unoccupied nonbonding orbitals, like monomeric borane and carbenium ions.

== Examples ==
Bent’s rule can be used to explain trends in both molecular structure and reactivity. After determining how the hybridisation of the central atom should affect a particular property, the electronegativity of substituents can be examined to see if Bent’s rule holds.

=== Bond angles ===
Knowing the angles between bonds is a crucial component in determining a molecular structure. In [[valence bond theory]], covalent bonds are assumed to consist of two electrons lying in overlapping, usually hybridised, atomic orbitals from bonding atoms. [[Orbital hybridisation]] explains why [[methane]] is tetrahedral and [[ethylene]] is planar for instance. However, there are deviations from the ideal geometries of sp&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; hybridisation such as in [[water]] and [[ammonia]]. The bond angles in those molecules are 104.5° and 107° respectively, which are below the expected tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. The traditional approach to explain those differences is [[VSEPR theory]]. In that framework, valence electrons are assumed to lie in localized regions and lone pairs are assumed to repel each other to a greater extent than bonding pairs.

Bent’s rule provides an alternative explanation as to why some bond angles differ from the ideal geometry. First, a trend between central atom hybridisation and bond angle can be determined by using the model compounds [[methane]], [[ethylene]], and [[acetylene]]. In order, the carbon atoms are directing sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and sp orbitals towards the hydrogen substituents. The bond angles between substituents are 109.5°, ~120°, and 180°. This simple system demonstrates that hybridised atomic orbitals with higher p character will have a smaller angle between them. This result can be made rigorous and quantitative as Coulson's theorem (see Formal theory section below).

[[File:Angles of Alkane Alkene Alkyne.png|center|600px|Skeletal structures and bond angles of arbitrary alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes.]]

Now that the connection between hybridisation and bond angles has been made, Bent’s rule can be applied to specific examples. The following were used in Bent’s original paper, which considers the [[Electronegativity#Group electronegativity|group electronegativity]] of the methyl group to be less than that of the hydrogen atom because methyl substitution reduces the [[acid dissociation constant]]s of formic acid and of acetic acid.&lt;ref name=BentReview /&gt;

As one moves down the table, the substituents become more electronegative and the bond angle between them decreases. According to Bent's rule, as the substituent electronegativies increase, orbitals of greater p character will be directed towards those groups. By the above discussion, this will decrease the bond angle. This agrees with the experimental results. Comparing this explanation with [[VSEPR theory]], VSEPR cannot explain why the angle in [[dimethyl ether]] is greater than 109.5°

In predicting the bond angle of water, Bent’s rule suggests that hybrid orbitals with more s character should be directed towards the lone pairs, while that leaves orbitals with more p character directed towards the hydrogens, resulting in deviation from idealized O(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) hybrid orbitals with 25% s character and 75% p character.  In the case of water, with its 104.5° HOH angle, the OH bonding orbitals are constructed from O(~sp&lt;sup&gt;4.0&lt;/sup&gt;) orbitals (~20% s, ~80% p), while the lone pairs consist of O(~sp&lt;sup&gt;2.3&lt;/sup&gt;) orbitals (~30% s, ~70% p).  As discussed in the justification above, the lone pairs behave as very electropositive substituents and have excess s character.  As a result, the bonding electrons have increased p character.  This increased p character in those orbitals decreases the bond angle between them to less than the tetrahedral 109.5°. The same logic can be applied to ammonia (107.0° HNH bond angle, with three N(~sp&lt;sup&gt;3.4&lt;/sup&gt; or 23% s) bonding orbitals and one N(~sp&lt;sup&gt;2.1&lt;/sup&gt; or 32% s) lone pair), the other canonical example of this phenomenon.  

The same trend holds for nitrogen containing compounds.  Against the expectations of VSEPR theory but consistent with Bent's rule, the bond angles of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are 107° and 102°, respectively.

Unlike [[VSEPR theory]], whose theoretical foundations now appear shaky, Bent's rule is still considered to be an important principle in modern treatments of bonding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering Chemistry with Natural Bond Orbitals|last=Weinhold|first=F.|last2=Landis|first2=Clark R.|publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=9781118119969|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=67-68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, a modification of this analysis is still viable, even if the lone pairs of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are considered to be inequivalent by virtue of their symmetry (i.e., only s, and in-plane p&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; oxygen AOs are hybridized to form the two O-H bonding orbitals σ&lt;sub&gt;O-H&lt;/sub&gt; and lone pair ''n''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(σ)&lt;/sup&gt;, while p&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes an inequivalent pure p-character lone pair ''n''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(π)&lt;/sup&gt;), as in the case of lone pairs emerging from [[natural bond orbital]] methods.

=== Bond lengths ===
Similarly to bond angles, the hybridisation of an atom can be related to the lengths of the bonds it forms.&lt;ref name=BentReview /&gt; As bonding orbitals increase in s character, the &amp;sigma; bond length decreases.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"

By adding electronegative substituents and changing the hybridisation of the central atoms, bond lengths can be manipulated. If a molecule contains a structure X-A--Y, replacement of the substituent X by a more electronegative atom changes the hybridization of central atom A and shortens the adjacent A--Y bond.

Because fluorine is so much more electronegative than hydrogen, in fluoromethane the carbon will direct hybrid orbitals higher in s character towards the three hydrogens than towards the fluorine. In difluoromethane, there are only two hydrogens so less s character in total is directed towards them and more is directed towards the two fluorines, which shortens the C—F bond lengths relative to fluoromethane. This trend holds all the way to tetrafluoromethane whose C-F bonds have the highest s character (25%) and the shortest bond lengths in the series.

The same trend also holds for the chlorinated analogs of methane, although the effect is less dramatic because chlorine is less electronegative than fluorine.&lt;ref name=BentReview /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"
|- align="center"

|}

The above cases seem to demonstrate that the size of the chlorine is less important than its electronegativity. A prediction based on sterics alone would lead to the opposite trend, as the large chlorine substituents would be more favorable far apart. As the steric explanation contradicts the experimental result, Bent’s rule is likely playing a primary role in structure determination.

=== ''J''&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; Coupling constants ===
Perhaps the most direct measurement of s character in a bonding orbital between hydrogen and carbon is via the [[J-coupling|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&amp;minus;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C coupling]] constants determined from [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectra]]. Theory predicts that ''J''&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; values will be much higher in bonds with more s character.&lt;ref name=NMR1&gt;
{{citation| last1=Muller| first1=N.|last2=Pritchard|first2=D. E.|title = C&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; in Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectra. I. Hydrocarbons| journal= J. Chem. Phys.| volume=31| issue=3|year=1959|pages=768–771|doi=10.1063/1.1730460|bibcode=1959JChPh..31..768M}}

(For instance the pure sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid atomic orbital found in the C-H bond of methane would have 25% s character resulting in a expected coupling constant of 500 Hz × 0.25 = 125 Hz, in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined value.)

As the electronegativity of the substituent increases, the amount of p character directed towards the substituent increases as well. This leaves more s character in the bonds to the methyl protons, which leads to increased ''J''&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; coupling constants.

=== Inductive effect ===
The [[inductive effect]] can be explained with Bent’s rule.&lt;ref name=BentJChemEd&gt;{{citation|last=Bent| first1=H. A.|title = Distribution of atomic s character in molecules and its chemical implications | journal= J. Chem. Educ.| volume=37| issue=12|year=1960|pages=616–624|doi=10.1021/ed037p616|bibcode=1960JChEd..37..616B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inductive effect is the transmission of charge through covalent bonds and Bent’s rule provides a mechanism for such results via differences in hybridisation. In the table below,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Taft Jr.| first1=R. W. |title = Concerning the Electron&amp;mdash;Withdrawing Power and Electronegativity of Groups | journal= J. Chem. Phys.| volume=26| issue=1|year=1957|pages=93–96|doi=10.1063/1.1743270|bibcode=1957JChPh..26...93T}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the groups bonded to the central carbon become more electronegative, the central carbon becomes more electron-withdrawing as measured by the [[Taft equation#Polar Substituent Constants.2C .CF.83.2A|polar substituent constant]]. The polar substituent constants are similar in principle to &amp;sigma; values from the [[Hammett equation]], as an increasing value corresponds to a greater electron-withdrawing ability. Bent's rule suggests that as the electronegativity of the groups increase, more p character is diverted towards those groups, which leaves more s character in the bond between the central carbon and the R group. As s orbitals have greater electron density closer to the nucleus than p orbitals, the electron density in the C&amp;minus;R bond will more shift towards the carbon as the s character increases. This will make the central carbon more electron-withdrawing to the R group.&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt; Thus, the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituents has been transferred to the adjacent carbon, exactly what the inductive effect predicts.

== Formal theory ==
&lt;!-- "Bent's rule" Bond angle section links here --&gt;
&lt;!-- Linked from redirect [[Coulson's theorem]] --&gt;

Bent's rule provides an additional level of accuracy to [[valence bond theory]]. Valence bond theory proposes that covalent bonds consist of two electrons lying in overlapping, usually hybridised, atomic orbitals from two bonding atoms. The assumption that a covalent bond is a [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] of just the two bonding atoms is an approximation (see [[molecular orbital theory]]), but valence bond theory is accurate enough that it has had and continues to have a major impact on how bonding is understood.&lt;ref name=WeinholdTextbook /&gt;

In valence bond theory, two atoms each contribute an atomic orbital and the electrons in the orbital overlap form a covalent bond. Atoms do not usually contribute a pure [[Atomic orbital#Hydrogen-like orbitals|hydrogen-like orbital]] to bonds.&lt;ref name=Pauling /&gt; If atoms could only contribute hydrogen-like orbitals, then the experimentally confirmed tetrahedral structure of [[methane]] would not be possible as the 2s and 2p orbitals of carbon do not have that geometry. That and other contradictions led to the proposing of [[orbital hybridisation]]. In that framework, atomic orbitals are allowed to mix to produce an equivalent number of orbitals of differing shapes and energies. In the aforementioned case of methane, the 2s and three 2p orbitals of carbon are hybridized to yield four equivalent sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals, which resolves the structure discrepancy. Orbital hybridisation allowed valence bond theory to successfully explain the geometry and properties of a vast number of molecules.

In traditional hybridisation theory, the hybrid orbitals are all equivalent.&lt;ref name=Coulson203&gt;{{citation|last=Coulson|first=C. A.|title=Valence|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|edition=2nd|year=1961|pages=203–5 Non-equivalent hybrids}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely the atomic s and p orbital(s) are combined to give four {{math| ''sp&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{fraction|1|{{radical|4}}}}(''s'' +  {{radical|3}}''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} orbitals, three {{math| ''sp&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{fraction|1|{{radical|3}}}}(''s'' +  {{radical|2}}''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} orbitals, or two {{math| ''sp&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{fraction|1|{{radical|2}}}}(''s'' +  ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} orbitals. These combinations are chosen to satisfy two conditions. First, the total amount of s and p orbital contributions must be equivalent before and after hybridisation. Second, the hybrid orbitals must be [[Orthogonal functions|orthogonal]] to each other.&lt;ref name=Coulson203 /&gt; If two hybrid orbitals were not orthogonal, by definition they would have nonzero orbital overlap. Electrons in those orbitals would interact and if one of those orbitals were involved in a covalent bond, the other orbital would also have a nonzero interaction with that bond, violating the two electron per bond tenet of valence bond theory.

To construct hybrid s and p orbitals, let the first hybrid orbital be given by {{math| ''s'' + {{radical|''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is directed towards a bonding group and ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines the amount of p character this hybrid orbital has. This is a weighted sum of the wavefunctions. Now choose a second hybrid orbital {{math| ''s'' + {{radical|''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is directed in some way and ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of ''p'' character in this second orbital. The value of ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and direction of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; must be determined so that the resulting orbital can be normalized and so that it is orthogonal to the first hybrid orbital. The hybrid can certainly be normalized, as it is the sum of two normalized wavefunctions. Orthogonality must be established so that the two hybrid orbitals can be involved in separate covalent bonds. The [[inner product]] of orthogonal orbitals must be zero and computing the inner product of the constructed hybrids gives the following calculation.

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle s+\sqrt{\lambda_i}p_i \mid s+\sqrt{\lambda_j} p_j \rangle &amp; = \langle s \mid s \rangle + \sqrt{\lambda_i} \langle s \mid p_i \rangle + \sqrt{\lambda_j} \langle s \mid p_j \rangle +  \sqrt{\lambda_i \lambda_j} \langle p_i \mid p_j \rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = 1+0+0+ \sqrt{\lambda_i \lambda_j} \cos\omega_{ij} = 1 + \sqrt{\lambda_i \lambda_j} \cos\omega_{ij}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the s orbital is normalized and so the [[Inner product space|inner product]] &lt;math&gt; \langle s\mid s\rangle = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Also, the ''s'' orbital is orthogonal to the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, which leads to two terms in the above equaling zero. Finally, the last term is the inner product of two normalized functions that are at an angle of ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; to each other, which gives cos ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; by definition. However, the orthogonality of bonding orbitals demands that &lt;math&gt; 1 + \sqrt{\lambda_i \lambda_j} \cos\omega_{ij} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so we get Coulson's theorem as a result:&lt;ref name=Coulson203 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \cos\omega_{ij} = -\frac 1 {\sqrt{\lambda_i \lambda_j}} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the four s and p atomic orbitals can be hybridised in arbitrary directions provided that all of the coefficients ''&amp;lambda;'' satisfy the above condition pairwise to guarantee the resulting orbitals are orthogonal.

Bent's rule, that centrals atoms direct orbitals of greater p character towards more electronegative substituents, is easily applicable to the above by noting that an increase in the ''&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' coefficient increases the p character of the {{math| ''s'' + {{radical|''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} hybrid orbital. Thus, if a central atom A is bonded to two groups X and Y and Y is more electronegative than X, then A will hybridise so that {{math| ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}}. More sophisticated theoretical and computation techniques beyond Bent’s rule are needed to accurately predict molecular geometries from first principles, but Bent’s rule provides an excellent heuristic in explaining molecular structures.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
He was born on 29 January 1816 in [[Triest]] ([[Küstenland]], today in [[Italy]]).

After attending the grammar schools (Gymnasium) in [[Padua]] and in [[Ofen]], in 1828 he joined the pioneer-cadet school in [[Tulln]].
As a cadet of the 40th Infantry Regiment, he accepted the 1833 invitation to move to the Austrian Imperial War Navy.
Immediately commanding a ship, he had to acquire his further education largely through self-study.
Line ship transported in 1839, he seized the opportunity to be assigned to the observatory in Vienna,
where he was taught by astronomers [[Karl L. Littrow|Littrow]] and Schaub.
After the end of these studies,
he was with the management of the Naval Observatory in [[Venice]] and the lessons in astronomy and nautical at the Naval Academy operation.
&lt;!-- GERMAN version:
Nach Besuch des Gymnasiums in [[Padua]] und in Ofen trat er 1828 in die Pionierkadettenschule in [[Tulln]] ein. Als Kadett des Infanterieregiments 40 ließ er sich 1833 auf Aufforderung des Hofkriegsrates zur Marine versetzen. Sogleich auf ein Schiff kommandiert, musste er sich seine weitere Ausbildung weitgehend im Selbststudium erwerben. 1839 zum Linienschiffsfähnrich befördert, ergriff er die Gelegenheit, der Sternwarte in Wien zugeteilt zu werden, wo er von bekannten Astronomen, wie [[Karl L. Littrow|Littrow]] und Schaub unterrichtet wurde. Nach Ende dieser Studien wurde er mit der Leitung der Marinesternwarte in [[Venedig]] und dem Unterricht in Astronomie und Nautik auf der Marineakademie betraut.
--&gt;

Through his elegant appearance and his winning nature, he also quickly connected to the Venetian society. Immediately after his marriage to Anna O'Connor of Connaught on 12 April 1848, Venice broke from the revolution. He fled the city with his young wife and, in the course of the escape, her death took place. He traveled immediately to Trieste, where Field Marshal Lieutenant Gyulay had gathered the true-believer remnants of the Navy.
&lt;!-- GERMAN:
Durch sein elegantes Auftreten und seine gewinnende Art fand er auch rasch Anschluss an die venezianische Gesellschaft. Unmittelbar nach seiner Heirat mit Anna O'Connor of Connaught am 12. April 1848 brach in Venedig die Revolution aus.
Er verließ die Stadt mit seiner jungen Frau, die im Verlauf der Flucht den Tod fand. Er meldete sich sogleich in Triest, wo [[Feldmarschallleutnant]] Gyulay die treugebliebenen Reste der Marine gesammelt hatte.
--&gt;

He was an important employee of the reorganization concerned with the Vice-Admiral {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Birch Dahlerup|de|3=Hans Birch Dahlerup|lt=Dahlerup}}. In 1849, he became Lieutenant. The next few years passed, in alternating between staff work and ship commands. In 1855, he was adviser to the new navy commander Archduke &lt;!--Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria--&gt;[[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Max]]. Soon he was able to advance his enthusiastic lord's plan for a voyage around the world: he assisted with its planning in 1856. As line-captain and [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] of the [[frigate]] {{SMS|Novara|1850|2}}, already at the time, he commanded the expedition, which lasted from 30 April 1857 to 26 August 1859. Numerous research findings, rich collections for the Vienna museums, and high reputation for the Imperial Navy were the main results of the voyage around the world. Due to his scientific knowledge, he assisted all oceanographic, hydrographic and meteorological observations.
&lt;!-- GERMAN version:
Er wurde ein wichtiger Mitarbeiter des mit der Reorganisation betrauten Vizeadmirals [[Dahlerup]]. 1849 wurde er Korvettenkapitän. Die nächsten Jahre vergingen im Wechsel zwischen Stabsarbeit und Schiffskommanden. 1855 wurde er Berater des neuen Marinekommandanten Erzherzog [[Ferdinand Maximilian von Österreich|Ferdinand Max]]. Bald konnte er seinen fortschrittsbegeisterten Herrn für den Plan einer Weltumseglung gewinnen, mit deren Planung er 1856 betraut wurde. Als Linienschiffskapitän und [[Kommodore|Commodore]] der [[Fregatte]] [[Novara (Schiff)|Novara]] befehligte er dann selbst die Expedition, die vom 30. April 1857 bis 26. August 1859 dauerte. Zahlreiche Forschungsergebnisse, reiche Sammlungen für die Wiener Museen und hohes Ansehen für die kaiserliche Marine waren die wichtigsten Ergebnissen der Weltumseglung. Er konnte aufgrund seiner wissenschaftlichen Kenntnisse alle ozeanographischen, hydrographischen und meteorologischen Beobachtungen selbst vornehmen. --&gt;

For his scientific achievements, he was added in 1863 as an honorary member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]].
His 3-volume report was published, in 1861, as "''Journey of the Austrian Frigate Novara around the Earth in 1857, 1858, 1859 under the command of Commodore B. von Wüllersdorf-Urbair"''.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;&lt;ref name="BioD"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- GERMAN version:
Für seine wissenschaftlichen Leistungen wurde er u.a. 1863 als Ehrenmitglied in die Kgl. [[Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] aufgenommen. Sein 3-bändiger Bericht „Reise der österr. Fregatte Novara um die Erde in den Jahren 1857, 1858, 1859 unter den Befehlen des Commodore Bernhard von Wüllersdorf-Urbair“, wurde 1861 veröffentlicht. --&gt;

After a deployment in the waters around which the free throngs of [[Garibaldi]] threatened [[Sicily]], he became Rear Admiral and representative of the navy commander at Reichsrat in Vienna. In 1864, he led the [[German-Danish War]], a squadron into the North Sea according to where [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]], even before his arrival, the [[Battle of Heligoland (1864)]] had beaten. This suspended a little justified criticism of him.
&lt;!-- GERMAN:
Nach einem Einsatz in den Gewässern um das von den Freischaren [[Garibaldi]]s bedrohte [[Sizilien]] wurde er Konteradmiral und Vertreter des Marinekommandanten beim Reichsrat in Wien. 1864 führte er im [[Deutsch-dänischer Krieg|deutsch-dänischen Krieg]] eine Eskader in die Nordsee nach, wo [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] schon vor seinem Eintreffen die [[Seegefecht vor Helgoland (1864)|Seeschlacht von Helgoland]] geschlagen hatte. Dies setzte ihn einer kaum gerechtfertigten Kritik aus. --&gt;

In autumn 1865, he was asked by Prime Minister [[Count Richard Belcredi]] to head the Department of Commerce. As Minister in a politically controversial government (in the contemporary press also as a "Three Count Ministry", referring to him as next to Prime Minister Count Belcredi still the Counts Larisch-Mönich and Mensdorff-Pouilly), he tried concluding trade treaties, plus dealt with the communications and postal services. He also led a program designed to supplement the rail network, which largely came to be implemented (see Memorandum 1866, "A railway network for the Austrian monarchy"). Under his leadership office, the expansion of the port of [[Trieste]] was also addressed. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] led him to resign.
&lt;!-- GERMAN:
Im Herbst 1865 wurde er vom Ministerpräsidenten [[Richard Graf Belcredi|Belcredi]] aufgefordert, das Handelsministerium zu übernehmen. Als Minister in einer politisch umstrittenen Regierung (in der zeitgenössischen Presse auch als „Dreigrafenministerium“ bezeichnet, da ihm neben Ministerpräsident Graf Belcredi noch die Grafen Larisch-Mönich und Mensdorff-Pouilly angehörten) bemühte er sich um den Abschluss von Handelsverträgen, befasste sich mit dem Kommunikations- und Postwesen und entwarf ein Programm zur Vervollständigung des Eisenbahnnetzes, das auch großteils zur Ausführung kam (s. Memorandum 1866, "Ein Eisenbahnnetz für die österreichische Monarchie"). Unter seiner Amtsführung wurde auch der Ausbau des Hafens von [[Triest]] in Angriff genommen. Der Ausgleich mit Ungarn 1867 veranlaßte ihn zum Rücktritt. --&gt;

Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair died in [[Bolzano]], which was then part of the old [[county of Tyrol]]. He is buried in the cemetery of the [[Old Parish Church of Gries]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Gries-San Quirino|it}} district.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16795">{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Magnetostatics}}
In [[physics]], specifically [[electromagnetism]], the '''Biot–Savart law''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|oʊ|_|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɑr}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|j|oʊ|_|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɑr}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/biot+savart+law?qsrc=2446 "Biot-Savart law"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an equation describing the [[magnetic field]] generated by a constant [[electric current]]. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. The Biot–Savart law is fundamental to [[magnetostatics]], playing a role similar to that of [[Coulomb's law]] in [[electrostatics]]. When magnetostatics does not apply, the Biot–Savart law should be replaced by [[Jefimenko's equations]]. The law is valid in the [[Magnetostatics|magnetostatic approximation]], and is consistent with both [[Ampère's circuital law]] and [[Gauss's law for magnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson, John David | title=Classical Electrodynamics | edition=3rd | location=New York | publisher=Wiley | year=1999 | isbn=0-471-30932-X | page = Chapter 5 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Félix Savart]], who discovered this relationship in 1820.

==Equation==

===Electric currents (along a closed curve/wire)===
[[File:Magnetic field element (Biot-Savart Law) PRIME.svg|thumb|180px|Shown are the directions of
&lt;math&gt;I d\boldsymbol\ell&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r'}&lt;/math&gt;, and the value of &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{r'}|&lt;/math&gt; ]]
The Biot–Savart law is used for computing the resultant [[magnetic field]] '''B''' at position '''r''' in 3D-space generated by a ''steady'' [[electric current|current]] ''I'' (for example due to a wire). A steady (or stationary) current is a continual flow of [[electric charge|charges]] which does not change with time and the charge neither accumulates nor depletes at any point. The law is a physical example of a [[line integral]], being evaluated over the path ''C'' in which the electric currents flow (e.g. the wire). The equation in [[SI]] units is&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int_C \frac{I d\boldsymbol \ell\times\mathbf{r'}}{|\mathbf{r'}|^3}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where &lt;math&gt;d\boldsymbol \ell&lt;/math&gt; is a vector along the path &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; whose magnitude is the length of the [[infinitesimal|differential]] element of the wire in the direction of ''[[conventional current]]''. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r'} = \mathbf{r} - \boldsymbol \ell&lt;/math&gt; is the full [[displacement vector]] from the wire element (&lt;math&gt;d\boldsymbol \ell&lt;/math&gt;) to the point at which the field is being computed (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;), and μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[magnetic constant]]. Alternatively:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int_C \frac{I d\boldsymbol \ell\times\mathbf{\hat r'}}{|\mathbf{r'}|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat r'}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r'}&lt;/math&gt;. The symbols in boldface denote [[vector (geometry)|vector quantities]].



The integral is usually around a [[closed curve]], since stationary electric currents can only flow around closed paths when they are bounded. However, the law also applies to infinitely long wires (as used in the definition of the SI unit of electric current - the [[Ampere]]).

To apply the equation, the point in space where the magnetic field is to be calculated is arbitrarily chosen (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;). Holding that point fixed, the line integral over the path of the electric current is calculated to find the total magnetic field at that point. The application of this law implicitly relies on the [[superposition principle]] for magnetic fields, i.e. the fact that the magnetic field is a [[vector sum]] of the field created by each infinitesimal section of the wire individually.&lt;ref&gt;The superposition principle holds for the electric and magnetic fields because they are the solution to a set of [[linear differential equation]]s, namely [[Maxwell's equations]], where the current is one of the "source terms".&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a 2D version of the Biot-Savart equation, used when the sources are invariant in one direction. In general, the current need not flow only in a plane normal to the invariant direction and it is given by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; ([[current density]]). The resulting formula is:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\int_C \ \frac{(\mathbf J\, d\ell)\times\mathbf r'}{|\mathbf r'|} = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\int_C \ (\mathbf J\, d\ell)\times\mathbf{\hat r'} &lt;/math&gt;

===Electric current density (throughout conductor volume)===

The formulations given above work well when the current can be approximated as running through an infinitely-narrow wire. If the conductor has some thickness, the proper formulation of the Biot–Savart law (again in [[SI]] units) is:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \mathbf B (\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\iiint_V\ \frac{(\mathbf{J}\,dV)\times\mathbf r'}{|\mathbf r'|^3}&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

or, alternatively:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf B (\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\iiint_V \ \frac{(\mathbf J\,dV)\times\mathbf{\hat r'}}{|\mathbf r'|^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; is the [[volume element]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[current density]] vector in that volume (in SI in units of A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

===Constant uniform current===

In the special case of a steady constant current ''I'', the magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int_C \frac{d\boldsymbol \ell \times \mathbf{r'}}{|\mathbf{r'}|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the current can be taken out of the integral.

===Point charge at constant velocity===

In the case of a point [[charged particle]] ''q'' moving at a constant [[velocity]] '''v''', [[Maxwell's equations]] give the following expression for the [[electric field]] and magnetic field:&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1-v^2/c^2}{(1-v^2\sin^2\theta/c^2)^{3/2}}\frac{\mathbf{\hat r'}}{|\mathbf r'|^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{v} \times  \mathbf{D} &lt;/math&gt; or 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{v} \times  \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \hat r'&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector pointing from the current (non-retarded) position of the particle to the point at which the field is being measured, and θ is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;.

When ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≪ ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the electric field and magnetic field can be approximated as&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd ed.)| publisher=Prentice Hall|pages= 222–224, 435–440 |year=1998 |isbn=0-13-805326-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} =\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\ \frac{\mathbf{\hat r'}}{|\mathbf r'|^2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B} =\frac{\mu_0 q}{4\pi} \mathbf{v} \times \frac{\mathbf{\hat r'}}{|\mathbf r'|^2} &lt;/math&gt;

These equations are called the "Biot–Savart law for a point charge"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxwell.ucdavis.edu/~electro/magnetic_field/pointcharge.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619185915/http://maxwell.ucdavis.edu/~electro/magnetic_field/pointcharge.html |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its closely analogous form to the "standard" Biot–Savart law given previously.  These equations were first derived by [[Oliver Heaviside]] in 1888.

==Magnetic responses applications==
The Biot–Savart law can be used in the calculation of magnetic responses even at the atomic or molecular level, e.g. [[chemical shift|chemical shielding]]s or [[magnetic susceptibility|magnetic susceptibilities]], provided that the current density can be obtained from a quantum mechanical calculation or theory.

==Aerodynamics applications==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vorticity]] --&gt;
[[File:Vortex filament (Biot-Savart law illustration).png|thumb|right|200px| The figure shows the velocity (&lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt;) induced at a point P by an element of vortex filament (&lt;math&gt;dL&lt;/math&gt;) of strength &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The Biot–Savart law is also used in [[aerodynamic]] theory to calculate the velocity induced by [[vortex|vortex lines]].

In the [[aerodynamic]] application, the roles of vorticity and current are reversed in comparison to the magnetic application.

In Maxwell's 1861 paper 'On Physical Lines of Force',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:On_Physical_Lines_of_Force.pdf |title=On Physical Lines of Force |first=J. C. |last=Maxwell |work=Wikimedia commons |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  magnetic field strength '''H''' was directly equated with pure [[vorticity]] (spin), whereas '''B''' was a weighted vorticity that was weighted for the density of the vortex sea. Maxwell considered magnetic permeability μ to be a measure of the density of the vortex sea. Hence the relationship,

{{ordered list
|1='''Magnetic induction current'''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mu \mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;

was essentially a rotational analogy to the linear electric current relationship,
|2='''Electric convection current'''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is electric charge density. '''B''' was seen as a kind of magnetic current of vortices aligned in their axial planes, with '''H''' being the circumferential velocity of the vortices.
}}

The electric current equation can be viewed as a convective current of electric charge that involves linear motion. By analogy, the magnetic equation is an inductive current involving spin. There is no linear motion in the inductive current along the direction of the '''B''' vector. The magnetic inductive current represents lines of force. In particular, it represents lines of inverse square law force.

In aerodynamics the induced air currents form solenoidal rings around a vortex axis. Analogy can be made that the vortex axis is playing the role that electric current plays in magnetism. This puts the air currents of aerodynamics (fluid velocity field) into the equivalent role of the magnetic induction vector '''B''' in electromagnetism.

In electromagnetism the '''B''' lines form solenoidal rings around the source electric current, whereas in aerodynamics, the air currents (velocity) form solenoidal rings around the source vortex axis.

Hence in electromagnetism, the vortex plays the role of 'effect' whereas in aerodynamics, the vortex plays the role of 'cause'. Yet when we look at the '''B''' lines in isolation, we see exactly the aerodynamic scenario in so much as that '''B''' is the vortex axis and '''H''' is the circumferential velocity as in Maxwell's 1861 paper.

''In two dimensions'', for a vortex line of infinite length, the induced velocity at a point is given by

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ is the strength of the vortex and ''r'' is the perpendicular distance between the point and the vortex line. This is similar to the magnetic field produced on a plane by an infinitely long straight thin wire normal to the plane.

This is a limiting case of the formula for vortex segments of finite length (similar to a finite wire):

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\Gamma}{4 \pi r} \left[\cos A - \cos B \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' and ''B'' are the (signed) angles between the line and the two ends of the segment.

==The Biot–Savart law, Ampère's circuital law, and Gauss's law for magnetism==

{{see also|Curl (mathematics)|vector calculus identities}}

In a [[magnetostatic]] situation, the magnetic field '''B''' as calculated from the Biot–Savart law will always satisfy [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]:&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof&gt;See Jackson, page 178–79 or Griffiths p. 222–24. The presentation in Griffiths is particularly thorough, with all the details spelled out.&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Outline of proof&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof /&gt; (Click "show" on the right.)
|-
|Starting with the Biot–Savart law:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B(\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \iiint_V d^3l \mathbf J (\mathbf l) \times \frac{\mathbf r - \mathbf l}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|^3}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbf r - \mathbf l}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|^3} = -\nabla\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and using the [[product rule]] for curls, as well as the fact that '''J''' does not depend on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;, this equation can be rewritten as&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B (\mathbf r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \nabla\times\iiint_V d^3l \frac{\mathbf J (\mathbf l)}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the divergence of a curl is always zero, this establishes [[Gauss's law for magnetism]]. Next, taking the curl of both sides, using the formula for the [[Vector calculus identities#Curl of the curl|curl of a curl]], and again using the fact that '''J''' does not depend on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;, we eventually get the result&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\nabla\iiint_V d^3l \mathbf J (\mathbf l)\cdot\nabla\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right) - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\iiint_V d^3l \mathbf J (\mathbf l)\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, plugging in the relations&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right) = -\nabla_l \left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{|\mathbf r - \mathbf l|}\right) = -4\pi \delta(\mathbf r - \mathbf l)&lt;/math&gt;

(where δ is the [[Dirac delta function]]), using the fact that the divergence of '''J''' is zero (due to the assumption of [[magnetostatics]]), and performing an [[integration by parts]], the result turns out to be&lt;ref name=GaussAmpereProof/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times \mathbf B = \mu_0 \mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]]. (Due to the assumption of [[magnetostatics]], &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbf E / \partial t = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;, so there is no extra [[Ampère's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell–Ampère equation|displacement current term]] in Ampère's law.)
|}

In a ''non''-magnetostatic situation, the Biot–Savart law ceases to be true (it is superseded by [[Jefimenko's equations]]), while [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and the [[Ampère's circuital law|Maxwell–Ampère law]] are still true.

It is used on the corks to make putting the instrument together possible without damaging the cork and therefore possibly damaging the instrument itself. Cork grease also acts as a preservative, keeping the wooden cork moist and thick, in turn ensuring a good seal between parts of the instrument so that no air may leak through joints upon playing. Cork grease can help woodwind players adjust their instruments' tuning pieces (e.g. barrels, necks, bocals, staples) in respect to their pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cork Lubricants|url=http://reedmaster.com/Merchant2/Newsletter3-06/V4N2March2006_files/page0001.htm|volume=4|issue=2|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork grease is made with ingredients such as elm extract, organic sunflower oil,coconut oil and hemp seed oil. In past it was made from animal fat. Overall that is natural organic balm widely used for woodwind instruments.

==History==
Delta Electricity was formed by the [[Government of New South Wales]] in 1996 as part of its reform of the electricity sector in the State, which saw the breakup of the [[Electricity Commission of New South Wales]].

Following a report by the Health Rivers Commission, in 1998 the [[Department of Planning and Infrastructure (New South Wales)|Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning]], [[Craig Knowles]], announced that a small hydro-electric power station would be installed in the [[Chichester Dam]] to generate electricity, reduce greenhouse emissions and allow surplus power to be sold back to the State grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19980602009|title=Legislative Assembly {{ndash}} Chichester Dam Electricity Generation|first=Craig|last=Knowles|authorlink=Craig Knowles|date=2 June 1998|house=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=21 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622030841/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA19980602009|archivedate=22 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mini-power station was completed in 2001 and operated by Delta Electricity, and generates up to {{convert|110|kW|abbr=on}} of electricity at times of peak flow; with an average annual generation of {{convert|0.4|GWh|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Chichester Dam Mini-Hydro"/&gt;

As the [[Kristina Keneally|Keneally]] Labor government moved to [[privatise]] components of the electricity industry in New South Wales including the electricity trading rights of Delta Electricity, on 14 December 2010 four of the five directors of Delta (including the chairman) suddenly stood down in protest over the proposed sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/chaos-hits-53bn-nsw-power-sell-off-as-directors-on-two-boards-quit-in-protest/story-fn59niix-1225971186330 |work=The Australian |title=Chaos hits $5.3bn NSW power sell-off as directors on two boards quit in protest | date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |author1=Salusinszky, Imre |authorlink1=Imre Salusinszky |author2=Hepworth, Annabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 2011, at the direction of the New South Wales Government,&lt;ref name="report2011"&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |accessdate=9 December 2011 |year=2011 |url=http://www.de.com.au/ArticleDocuments/50/2011%20Delta%20Electricity%20Annual%20Report%201OF2.pdf.aspx |title=Annual Report 2011 |publisher=Delta Electricity }}&lt;/ref&gt; the newly constituted Board of Delta entered into contracts with energy retailer, [[TRUenergy]], for the supply of electricity under Generation Trading Agreements from the [[Wallerawang Power Station|Wallerawang]] and [[Mount Piper Power Station]]s. A subsequent NSW Parliamentary Inquiry was held, but the directors of Delta who resigned refused to give evidence before the Inquiry unless guarantees of [[parliamentary privilege]] would be given by the Government. Keneally refused to provides guarantees and, according to the Inquiry chairman, the Government stymied the Inquiry's ability to uncover the facts as to the resignation of the directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://143.119.255.92/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/3f7a0972901ccb96ca25784000069faa/$FILE/100223%20Final%20Report%20Gentrader%20transactions.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Gentrader Transactions |author=Nile, Fred |authorlink=Fred Nile |date=23 February 2011 |publisher=Legislative Council of New South Wales|pages=ix–x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation to sell the State-owned generators. In July 2013, [[EnergyAustralia]] acquired from Delta Electricity Wallerawang and Mount Piper Power Stations, near [[Lithgow, New South Wales]], for A$160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energyaustralia.com.au/about-us/media-centre/current-news/ea-acquires-mtpiper-wallerawang|title=EnergyAustralia acquires Mt Piper and Wallerawang power stations|website=EnergyAustralia|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, EnergyAustralia announced that it would permanently close Wallerawang due to ongoing reduced energy demand, lack of access to competitively priced coal and the power station’s high operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energyaustralia.com.au/about-us/what-we-do/generation-assets/wallerawang-mtpiper-power-station/wallerawang-power-station-closure|title=Closure of Wallerawang power station {{!}} EnergyAustralia|website=EnergyAustralia|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; EnergyAustralia began the process of removing useful equipment from the station in 2015 and began demolition of the site when this process has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energyaustralia.com.au/about-us/media-centre/current-news/salvage-program-to-begin-at-wallerawang|title=Salvage program to begin at Wallerawang power station {{!}} EnergyAustralia|website=EnergyAustralia|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/2802787/wallerawang-power-station-to-be-demolished/|title=Wallerawang Power Station to be demolished|last=ASHWORTH|first=LEN|date=2015-01-08|newspaper=Lithgow Mercury|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, the [[Colongra Power Station]] at Lake Munmorah was sold to [[Snowy Hydro]]. In November 2015, Delta Electricity, which at the time owned only the [[Vales Point Power Station]], was sold to Sunset Power International for $1 million.&lt;ref name="Potter, Ben"/&gt; Delta Electricity was dissolved in October 2016. The NSW Government retained ownership of the decommissioned [[Munmorah Power Station]] (Generation Property Management) which is being demolished.

In [[fluid mechanics]], '''dewetting''' is one of the processes that can occur at a solid–liquid or liquid–liquid [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]. Generally, dewetting describes the process of retraction  of a fluid from a non-wettable surface it was forced to cover. The opposite process—spreading of a liquid on a substrate—is called [[wetting]]. The factor determining the spontaneous spreading and dewetting for a drop of liquid placed on a solid substrate  with ambient gas, is the so-called '''spreading coefficient S:'''  
[[File:Contact angle.svg|thumb|right|Surface tension diagram of a liquid droplet on a solid substrate. The surface of the liquid has the shape of a [[spherical cap]], due to [[Laplace pressure]]]]
&lt;math&gt;S\ = \gamma_\text{SG} - \gamma_\text{SL} - \gamma_\text{LG}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\text{SG}&lt;/math&gt; is the solid-gas [[surface tension]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\text{SL}&lt;/math&gt; is the solid-liquid surface tension and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\text{LG}&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid-gas surface tension (measured for the mediums before they are brought in contact with each other).

When &lt;math&gt;S&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the spontaneous spreading occurs, and if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, partial wetting is observed, meaning the liquid will only cover the substrate to some extent &lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena|last=Rosen|first=Milton J.|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-47818-8|edition=3rd|location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|page=244|oclc=475305499}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The equilibrium [[contact angle]] &lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;is determined from the [[Young-Laplace equation]]. 

[[Spreading]] and dewetting are important processes for many applications, including [[adhesion]], [[lubrication]], painting, printing, and protective coating. For most applications, dewetting is an unwanted process, because it destroys the applied liquid film.

Dewetting can be inhibited or prevented by photocrosslinking the thin film prior to annealing, or by incorporating nanoparticle additives into the film. &lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Gregory T.; Turro, Nicholas J.; Koberstein, Jeffrey T. (2010) ''Patterning Dewetting in Thin Polymer Films by Spatially Directed Photocrosslinking'' Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 351, pp 556-560 {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcis.2010.07.070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surfactants can have a significant effect on the spreading coefficient. When a surfactant is added, it's amphiphilic properties cause it to be more energetically favorable to migrate to the surface, decreasing the interfacial tension and thus increasing the spreading coefficient (i.e. making S more positive). As more surfactant molecules are absorbed into the interface, the free energy of the system decreases in tandem to the surface tension decreasing, eventually causing the system to become completely [[wetting]].

In biology, by analogy with the physics of liquid dewetting, the process of tunnel formation through endothelial cells has been referred to as [[cellular dewetting]].

== Dewetting of polymer thin films ==
In most dewetting studies a thin [[polymer]] film is [[Spin coating|spin-cast]] onto a substrate. Even in the case of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; the film does not dewet immediately if it is in a metastable state, e.g. if the temperature is below the [[glass transition temperature]] of the polymer. Annealing such a metastable film above its glass transition temperature increases the mobility of the polymer-chain molecules and dewetting takes place.&lt;ref name="Leroux"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcis.2008.09.062 |title=Polypropylene film chemical and physical modifications by dielectric barrier discharge plasma treatment at atmospheric pressure |year=2008 |last1=Leroux |first1=Frédéric |last2=Campagne |first2=Christine |last3=Perwuelz |first3=Anne |last4=Gengembre |first4=Léon |journal=Journal of Colloid and Interface Science |volume=328 |pages=412–20 |pmid=18930244 |issue=2|bibcode=2008JCIS..328..412L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karapanagiotis"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.susc.2005.07.023 |title=Polymer film rupturing in comparison with leveling and dewetting |year=2005 |last1=Karapanagiotis |first1=Ioannis |last2=Gerberich |first2=William W. |journal=Surface Science |volume=594 |issue=1–3 |pages=192–202|bibcode = 2005SurSc.594..192K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of dewetting occurs by the nucleation and growth of randomly formed holes, which coalesce to form a network of filaments, before breaking into droplets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Günter|date=1992-01-06|title=Dewetting of thin polymer films|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.75|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=68|issue=1|pages=75–78|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.75}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  When starting from a continuous film, an irregular pattern of droplets is formed. The droplet size and droplet spacing may vary over several orders of magnitude, since the dewetting starts from randomly formed holes in the film. There is no spatial correlation between the dry patches that develop. These dry patches grow and the material is accumulated in the rim surrounding the growing hole. In the case where the initially homogeneous film is thin (in the range of {{Convert|100|nm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}), a [[polygon]] network of connected strings of material is formed, like a [[Voronoi pattern]] of polygons. These strings then can break up into droplets, a process which is known as the [[Plateau-Rayleigh instability]]. At other film thicknesses, other complicated patterns of droplets on the substrate can be observed, which stem from a fingering instability of the growing rim around the dry patch.

The '''Electricity Authority of Cyprus''' (EAC) ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Αρχή Ηλεκτρισμού Κύπρου (ΑΗΚ)'') was founded in 1952 by the British colonial government. The 28 private electricity companies of the time were nationalized and absorbed into the EAC. The Authority never received any subsidies from the government as these have always been prohibited by law. Its head office is located in [[Strovolos]]. The EAC currently holds a near monopoly on electricity generation in Cyprus. It operates through three power stations with a total capacity of 1460 MW:

* [[Dhekelia Power Station]] - 460 MW
* [[Moni Power Station]] - 150 MW
* [[Vasilikos Power Station]] - 868 MW

The company also distributes electricity produced by five privately held windfarms:

* Orites - 82 MW
* Santa Anna - 20 MW
* Alexigros - 31.5 MW
* Koshi - 10.8 MW
* Aeolian - 10.8 MW

Additionally, individuals, private companies, and the Government own almost 54 MW of solar panels and almost 10 MW of biofuel installations and the EAC distributes the electricity these produce too.

In 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eac.com.cy/EN/EAC/FinancialInformation/Documents/Annual%20Report-English%202015-FINAL.pdf|title=Annual Report 2015|last=Electricity Authority of Cyprus|first=|date=|website=www.eac.com.cy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EAC generated a total of 4,128 GWh of electricity consuming 947,226 tonnes of fuel costing €288,632,000. Maximum demand in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus reached 939 MW. A total of 2.0 GWh of the produced electricity in 2015 valued €240,000 ended up in the area occupied by Turkey and no money could be collected for it.

The Authority served 559,700 customers in 2015, that is 280 per employee, up from 260 in 2014. The electricity sales per employee reached 2.02 GWh, up from 1.83 GWh in 2014.

Company investments in 2015 on its assets reached €17,721,000.

On 11 July 2011, a total of 98 containers of munitions stored at [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion|Evangelos Florakis Naval Base]] adjacent to Vasilikos Power Station exploded causing extensive damage to the station. To cope with the extended loss of its largest power station, the Authority had to impose rolling blackouts. In 2010, the maximum demand had reached 1,144 MW, the highest ever, and an even higher one was expected in 2011.

As a precondition to the accession of [[Cyprus]] to the European Union, the local market for electricity generation has been opened to private companies, but so far no private power plants have been built, although four licenses have been granted by [[Cyprus Energy Regulatory Authority]]. In the meanwhile, the EAC diversified into communication and cable television services in cooperation with a private company.

[[File:Cyprus electricity authority.jpg|thumb|right|The headquarters of the Authority]]
In 2005, the company was involved in a high profile scandal involving the alleged theft of millions of Cyprus pounds from the employees' pension scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elias |last=Hazou |coauthors= |title=EAC unrest over Andronikou deal |date=2007-03-03 |publisher= |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=31053&amp;archive=1 |work=[[Cyprus Mail]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-03-04 |language= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014924/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=31053&amp;archive=1 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy in Finland''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Finland]]. [[Energy policy of Finland]] describes the [[politics of Finland]] related to energy. [[Electricity sector in Finland]] is the main article of electricity in Finland.

[[Finland]] lacks domestic sources of [[fossil energy]] and must import substantial amounts of petroleum, natural gas, and other energy resources, including [[uranium]] for [[nuclear power]].

[[Energy consumption]] in Finland per capita is the highest in European Union. Reasons for this include industries with high energy consumption (half of energy is consumed by industry), high standards of living, cold climate (25% of consumption is used in heating) and long distances  (16% of consumption is used in transport).&lt;ref name="CONS_YMP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOTIVA"/&gt;

There was no sustainable decline in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission in Finland during 1990–2007. The energy use decline 2008–2009 is based on recession and at least some paper industry factories relocation abroad. The annual changes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of Finland were in some years 7–20% during 1990–2007. Increase of emissions was 18% in 1996 and 20% in 2006. The [[Peat energy in Finland|peat energy]] use and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per capita had correlation in 1990–2007.&lt;ref&gt;Energy in Finland statistics, Statistics of Finland (Peat TWh)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) based on the [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/default.htm United Nations Statistics Division], [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of electricity generated from [[renewable energy]] in Finland has been stable from 1998 to 2005: 11 to 12 percent plus yearly changing hydropower, together around 24 to 27 percent. The RE of total energy has been 24 percent (1998 to 2005). The forest industry [[black liquor]] and forest industry [[Wood fuel|wood burning]] were 57 percent (1990) and 67 percent (2005) of the RE of total energy.&lt;ref name="tilasto06"&gt;Energy statistics 2006, Finnish statistical center, Tilastokeskus, energiatilasto, Vuosikirja 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest is mainly water power. The most of available hydropower for energy is already in use.

==Consumption==
Final consumption of energy - i.e. after losses through transformation and transmission - was 1 102 petajoules, which equals 202 gigajoules per capita in 2013. 
Of this, 46% is consumed by industry, 16% in transportation and 25% in heating.&lt;ref name="MOTIVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motiva.fi/en/energy_in_finland/energy_use_in_finland/final_consumption_of_energy|title=Final consumption|date=|website=|publisher=Motiva|access-date=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913095104/http://motiva.fi/en/energy_in_finland/energy_use_in_finland/final_consumption_of_energy|archive-date=13 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption per capita in Finland is the highest in EU. Reasons for this include energy-intensive industry, a high standard of living, a cold climate and long distances. Rise of energy consumption stopped in the 21st century, mainly due to changes of industry. There is now less heavy industry and the energy efficiency has improved. New energy consuming business is the data centres of international enterprises.&lt;ref name="CONS_YMP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/en-US/Maps_and_statistics/The_state_of_the_environment_indicators/Climate_change_and_energy/Energy_consumption_no_longer_increasing(28723) |title=Energy consumption no longer increasing |website=Environment.fi |access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption increased 44 percent in electricity and 30 percent in the total energy use from 1990 to 2006. The increase in electricity consumption 15,000 [[Kilowatt hour|GWh]] from 1995 to 2005 was more than the total [[hydropower]] capacity. The electricity consumption increased almost equally in all sectors (industry, homes, and services).

=== Industry ===
Among all industries, the heaviest users are paper and pulp industry, metal industry, oil refining and chemical industry.

The forest industry uses 30 percent of all electricity in Finland (1990–2005). Its process wastes, wood residues and black liquor, gave 7000–8000 GWh RE electricity in 2005. In the year 2005 this and electricity consumption fell 10% compared to 2004 based on the long forest industry strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.fi/tk/yr/fi_nir_150407.pdf Greenhouse gas emissions in Finland 1990–2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116134854/http://www.stat.fi/tk/yr/fi_nir_150407.pdf |date=16 November 2010 }} National Inventory Report to the UNFCCC 15 April 2007, Finnish statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heating ===
Energy consumption for heating has increased, when population and average size of homes has grown.

80% of the energy use of households was spent on heating in 2008–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.fi/til/asen/2011/asen_2011_2012-11-16_tau_001_en.html|title=Statistics Finland -|first=Jonna|last=Hakala|website=Stat.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.fi/til/asen/2011/asen_2011_2012-11-16_tau_001_en.html Energy consumption in households 2008–2011, GWh] 16 November 2012 Statistics Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport ===
Transport uses 30% of all energy, but 40% of the energy produced with oil. Consumption per kilometre has decreased, but amount of kilometres has grown.

The [[Kyoto agreement]] had obligation to restrict the traffic emissions in Finland between 2008–12 in the year 1990 level. According to Ministry report in 2004 the share of [[Transport in Finland|public transport in Finland]] is lower that in the most European countries.&lt;ref&gt;”Joukkoliikenne nousuun!” –mietintö, Liikenne- ja viestintäministeriö 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Export and import ===
In 2014, the energy products import was worth 10 billion euros.

In January to September 2016 the import of energy products was worth of 5 billion euros, 15% less than the year before. The biggest source was Russia, 64% of all imports. Export was worth of 2.8 billion euros, one percent more than the previous year.  78% of export went to OECD countries. Decrease of price of petroleum products has affected the decrease of value of imported energy.&lt;ref&gt;Tammi-syyskuussa Suomeen tuotiin erilaisia energiatuotteita 5,0 miljardin euron arvosta, joka oli 15 prosenttia vähemmän kuin vuotta aiemmin. Niitä tuotiin eniten Venäjältä, jonka osuus tuonnin arvosta oli 64 prosenttia. Energiatuotteita vietiin 2,8 miljardin euron arvosta, joka oli prosentin enemmän vuotta aiempaan verrattuna. Vientiä oli eniten OECD-maihin, joiden osuus viennin arvosta oli 78 prosenttia. Öljyn maailmanmarkkinahinnan lasku on vaikuttanut energiatuotteiden tuonnin arvon supistumiseen.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electricity ===
{{main|Electricity sector in Finland }}
In 2009 the consumption of energy sources in electricity generation by mode of production was: 28% nuclear power, 16% hydro power, 13% coal, 11% natural gas, 5% peat and 10% wood fuels and other renewables. [[trade balance|Net imports]] of electricity in 2009 were 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.fi/til/ehkh/2009/04/ehkh_2009_04_2010-03-24_tau_012.xls Preliminary Energy Statistics 2009] Finnish statistical center 24 March 2010, Table 3.3.1. Consumption of energy sources in electricity generation by mode of production 2009 (preliminary information)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 16% of electricity consumption was derived from imported electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.fi/til/ehk/2011/03/ehk_2011_03_2011-12-16_tie_001_en.html|title=Statistics Finland - Energy supply and consumption|first=Pentti|last=Wanhatalo|website=Stat.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Commission]] (EC) demanded for Finland a €32,000-day penalty from the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] in March 2013 for not implementing the electricity directive in time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/komissio_vaatii_suomelle_yli_30_000_euron_paivittaista_uhkasakkoa/6534253 Komissio vaatii Suomelle yli 30 000 euron päivittäistä uhkasakkoa] [[yle]] 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of electricity generation from renewables in Finland was 40% 2012 and target 33% by 2020. In comparison, unlike Finland most countries have target to increase the share of electricity generation from renewables from 2012 to 2020 in Europe as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf|title=Renewables 2014 Global Status Report, page 119|website=Ren21.net|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy sources ==
During first half of 2015 the most important sources were wood (26% of total consumption), oil (23%), nuclear (18%), coal (9%), gas (7%), hydropower (5%) and peat (5%). Wind power covered one per cent of consumption, other sources in total four per cent.

There are no fossil fuels in Finland.

=== Wood ===
About one quarter of energy production in Finland comes from burning wood. There are no forests grown for fuel. Instead, most firewood is byproduct of other uses of wood. The [[black liquor]] (byproduct of pulp production) and peel and branches (byrpduct of sawmill industry) are used by the forest industry itself in creating its own energy by [[Wood fuel|wood burning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metla.fi/metinfo/tilasto/julkaisut/mtt/2014/puupolttoaine2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=Metsähaketta käytettiin 8,7 miljoonaa kuutiometriä vuonna 2013 – uusi ennätys|website=Metla.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish Association for Nature Conservation]] (FANC) demands Finland not to burn stumps and sturdy wood that are 15% of wood chips burned according to government energy policy. According to [[Chatham House]] such a bioenergy increase the climate change. According to [[Otto Bruun]] Finnish government bioenergy aims will annually reduce Finland’s carbon sink more than the combined air and road travel climate change emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sll.fi/ajankohtaista/verkkouutiset/metsabioenergian_rajoittamaton_kasvu_riski_ilmastolle|title=Metsäbioenergian rajoittamaton kasvu on riski ilmastolle, vahvistaa tuore raportti — Luonnonsuojeluliitto|website=Sll.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petroleum===
Finland does not have any of its own petroleum resources, so it relies 100% on petroleum imports.  In 2007 oil imports were almost 11 million tonnes in Finland. In 2006, Finnish oil imports came from Russia (64 percent), [[Norway]] (11 percent), [[Denmark]] (11 percent), and the rest from United Kingdom, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Algeria]]. Petroleum comprises 24 percent of Finnish energy consumption. Most of petroleum is used in vehicles, but about 260,000 homes are heated by heating oil.

[[Neste Oil]] is the sole [[Oil refinery|oil refiner]] in Finland, exporting petroleum products such as gasoline and [[fuel oil]] to [[Baltic countries]] and North America. Oil imports were valued at 6.5 billion euros and exports 3 billion euros in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oil-gas.fi/index.php?m=4&amp;id=203|title=Öljy- ja biopolttoaineala ry - Öljy- ja biopolttoaineala ry|website=Oil-gas.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
{{main|Nuclear power in Finland}}
As of 2008, [[Finland]]'s [[nuclear power]] program has [[List of nuclear reactors#Finland|four]] [[nuclear reactor]]s in two [[nuclear power plant|power plants]]. The first of these came into operation in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.fr/html/general/profiles/finland.html#nppstatus|title=Country profiles: Finland|website=Nea.fr|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000–2014 the four units have produced annually 21.4–22.7 TWh electricity, which has been 27–35% of energy production and 24–28 % of energy consumption in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pxweb2.stat.fi/sahkoiset_julkaisut/energia2014/data/t03_03.xls |title=Sähkön hankinta energialähteittäin 1990–2014 |publisher=Statistics Finland }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are among the world's most efficient, with average capacity factors&lt;ref&gt;The '''capacity factor''' is the energy produced in a year by a power plant as a percentage of the energy it would have produced had it been operating at full capacity for the entire year.&lt;/ref&gt; of 94% in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf76.html|title=Nuclear Energy in Finland - Finnish Nuclear Power - World Nuclear Association|website=World-nuclear.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth nuclear reactor is under construction in [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]]. The unit is expected to start up by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Olkiluoto-3-begins-instrumentation-and-control-tests-1401164.html Olkiluoto 3 begins instrumentation and control tests] World Nuclear News 14 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

If all planned projects are completed, the share of electricity produced by nuclear could double by 2025, reaching around 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/energy-policies-of-iea-countries-finland-2013_9789264190788-en|title=Energy Policies of IEA Countries, Statistics : Energy Policies of IEA Countries : Energy Policies of IEA Countries: Finland 2013|website=Oecd-ilibrary.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian [[Rosatom]] is the major owner of future nuclear plant [[Fennovoima]] with a share of 34%. Finnish municipals and cities are also major owners. According to Greenpeace in February 2017 there were initiatives to phase out from this nuclear plant in [[Oulu]], [[Helsinki]], [[Vantaa]], [[Hamina]] and [[Nurmijärvi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/finland/fi/media/blogi/totuus-fennovoiman-kotimaisuusasteesta/blog/58629/ Totuus Fennovoiman kotimaisuusasteesta] 1.2.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
{{main|Coal in Finland}}
Coal is imported from Russia and [[Poland]]. 5.6 million tonnes were used in 2007.

According to Finnwatch (27 September 2010) there are 13 coal power plants in Finland. The companies [[Pohjolan Voima]], [[Fortum]], [[Helsingin Energia]] and [[Rautaruukki]] consume coal most. According to the statistics of the Customs 18.3 million tonnes of coal was imported in Finland between 2007–2009 from: 72.5% Russia; 7.3% USA; 6.6%  Canada; 5.9% Australia; 3.0% [[Poland]], 1.4% South Africa; 1.3% [[Colombia]] and 1.1% [[Indonesia]]. The majority of Finnish coal is mined in the [[Kuznetsk Basin]] of the [[Kemerovo Oblast]], Russia.&lt;ref name=finnw&gt;[http://www.finnwatch.org/pdf/ Kivihiilta_idasta_ja_etelasta.pdf Kivihiiltä idästä ja etelästä Vastuullisuus energiayhtiöiden ostoissa] FinnWatch 3/2010 (27 September 2010) page 4-12, page 5 Table of coal imports in 2007–2009 (include www references){{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finnish companies know the country of origin of coal. The specific mine of origin is not always known, especially for the coal blends. According to the Finnwatch inquiry in 2010 none of the Finnish companies have yet made a commitment to give up coal consumption. Based on new investments, companies reported the following reductions in their future coal use: Helsingin Energia −40 % by 2020, Lahti Energia several tens of % by 2012 and Vantaan Energia −30 % by 2014.&lt;ref name=finnw/&gt;

The [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Agreement 176 (1995) addresses health and safety risks in mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C176 |title=C176 - Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176) |publisher=[[International Labour Organization]] |language=en |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland ratified the agreement in 1997. However, as of 2017 the agreement was not ratified in the following countries that export coal to Finland: Canada, Australia, [[Colombia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Indonesia]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:0::NO:11300:P11300_INSTRUMENT_ID:312321 |title=Ratifications of C176 - Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 (No. 176) |publisher=[[International Labour Organization]] |language=en |accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two companies in Finland reported (2010) using the UN Global Compact initiative criteria in their supplier relationships. No Finnish company reported signing the UN Global Compact Initiative. According to the DanWatch report ”The Curse of Coal” Danish [[DONG Energy]] and Swedish [[Vattenfall]] have underlined UN Global Compact Initiative.&lt;ref name=finnw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danwatch.dk/index.php?option=com_fjrelated&amp;view=fjrelated&amp;id=166&amp;Itemid=140&amp;lang=da|title=Kunstudstilling: Ingen protest er forgæves - Danwatch|website=Danwatch.dk|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
In 2010 the share of gas in Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) was about 10%. Finland was 100% dependent on a single supplier in gas, namely [[Energy in Russia|Russia]], and there is no gas storage capacity. However, in Finland, gas is essentially never used in direct heating of homes, which are heated by direct electric heating, oil or district heating. 75% of gas is used for production of electricity or [[combined heat and power]] and in industry, with domestic use being rare. In total, 93% of the gas is sold to large installations directly rather than by retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.energiavirasto.fi/documents/10179/0/Kertomus+maakaasun+toimitusvarmuudesta+2013.pdf/a5d7b7ab-c0d4-4f0e-a8f6-6056c8d40ec3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418233912/http://www.energiavirasto.fi/documents/10179/0/Kertomus+maakaasun+toimitusvarmuudesta+2013.pdf/a5d7b7ab-c0d4-4f0e-a8f6-6056c8d40ec3 |archive-date=18 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Helsinki, however, there are 30,000 network-connected domestic gas users and 300 restaurants. There is an alternative fuel obligation, so that in the event of a gas supply disturbance, other fuels can be immediately substituted. The gas distribution network reaches only the southeastern coast, with the northernmost point at [[Ikaalinen]].

The neighbouring country Sweden was 100% dependent on Danish gas in 2010. The share of gas in Sweden was lower than in Finland, 3.5% in 2009 (13 Twh gas /376 Twh total final use).&lt;ref&gt;[http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=/Broschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f Energy in Sweden 2010, Facts and figures]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016045634/http://webbshop.cm.se/System/TemplateView.aspx?p=Energimyndigheten&amp;view=default&amp;cat=%2FBroschyrer&amp;id=e0a2619a83294099a16519a0b5edd26f |date=16 October 2013 }} Table 7&lt;/ref&gt; The gas dependency in Finland and Sweden was less than in average in OECD countries in 2010. 16 out of 28 IEA member countries are dependent on gas over 20% in TPES.&lt;ref&gt;Gas emergency policy: Where do IEA countries stand?

Natural gas has been used since 1974 after the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oil-gas.fi/index.php?m=4&amp;id=210|title=Öljy- ja biopolttoaineala ry - Öljy- ja biopolttoaineala ry|website=Oil-gas.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gasum]] is the Finnish importer and seller of natural gas, which owns and operates Finnish natural gas transmission system. Natural gas vehicles aren't popular in Finland, but natural gas powered busses exist.

===Peat===
{{main|Peat energy in Finland }}

[[Peat]] and hard coal are the most harmful energy sources for [[global warming]] in Finland. According to [[VTT]] studies peat is often the most harmful one.&lt;ref&gt;Jyri Seppälä, Kaisu Aapala, Kimmo Silvo and Raimo Heikkilä 2008: Muistio Suomen IPCC-ryhmän avoimesta Turpeen ilmastovaikutusten arviointi -seminaarista. Suomen ympäristökeskus.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peat was the most popular energy source in Finland for new energy investments 2005–2015. The new energy plants in Finland starting 2005–2015 have as energy source: peat 36% and hard coal 11%: combined: 47%.

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] country report the Finnish subsidies for peat undermine the goal to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and counteracts other environmental policies and [[w: European Union energy policy|The European Union emissions trading scheme]]. IEA recommends to adhere to the timetable to phase out the peat subsidies in 2010. “To encourage sustained production of peat in the face of negative incentives from the European Union's emissions trading scheme for greenhouse gases, Finland has put in place a premium tariff scheme to subsidise peat. The premium tariff is designed to directly counter the effect of the European Union's emissions trading scheme.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/Publications/free_new_Desc.asp?PUBS_ID=1924|title=IEA - 404 Not Found|website=Iea.org|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy companies have no renewable energy obligations in Finland.

The share of renewable energy in per cent in Finland was 28% in 2012 and 25% in 2000. The share of renewable energy 5 years average 2006–2010 was 24.7  % and 10 years average 2001–2010 was 26.0  %. The EU set target for Finland (38%) by 2020 was reached in 2014, and in 2015 39.3 % of consumed energy was renewable (or 35% based on national calculation: i.e. 454,6 PJ (renewable energy)/ 1306,3 PJ (total energy consumption)). The new target value for renewable energy set by Finland is 50% by 2030 (based on end consumption values).

== Environmental effects ==

=== Global warming ===
In 2008, Finland's greenhouse gas emissions totalled 70.1 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2e). A little over three quarters of them were based on energy or released from the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ilmasto-opas.fi/en/ilmastonmuutos/hillinta/-/artikkeli/0be63fa0-533f-4986-b674-859b6577c8b5/suomen-paastot.html |title=Emissions in 2008  |website=Climate Guide |publisher= |access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carbon dioxide emissions by fossil fuels in 2008 originated from 45% oil, 39% coal and 15% natural gas. In the year 2000 the shares were nearly equal: 48% oil and 37% coal. The fossil traffic fuels: motor petrol, diesel and aviation petrol are oil products. The biomass included 47% of black liquer and 52% of wood in 2008. These shares were practically same during 1990–2006. All biomass and agricultural warming gas emissions are free of charge in the EU emissions trading in 2008–2012. According to the official statistics the annual fossil fuel and coal emissions in Finland have large annual variation. E.g. the fossil fuel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions dropped 18% in the year 2005 and 13% in 2008, but the annual coal emissions increased 22% in 1996, 22% in 2001 and 58% in 2006.

According to the energy statistics the major changing factors for the annual emission changes were the consumption of coal and peat. In 2006  '''the hard coal increase was 92% subject to industry '''  (including energy producing industry) ''' separate electricity generation from hard coal'''. At the same time the controversial peat consumption was increased. The district heating used 42% of hard coal in average 1990–2006, but its annual variation was small compared to the industry separate electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Statistics 2007: Table 2.4.1 Consumption of Hard Coal&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Particulates ===
Particulate, the size of which is from a few nanometers to visible dust particles, are considered the most important environmental factor affecting human life. About half of particulates are of anthropogenic origin: traffic, industry and energy production. In Finland, the most important source is burning wood as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savonsanomat.fi/kotimaa/Arvio-Pienhiukkaset-aiheuttavat-vuosittain-1300-ennenaikaista-kuolemaa-Suomessa/547488 Pienhiukkaset tunkeutuvat hengitysteihin - vuosittain jopa 1300 ennenaikaista kuolemaa Suomessa] Savon Sanomat&lt;/ref&gt; Also the NO2 and SO2 gases become particulates in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmanlaatu.fi/ilmansaasteet/komponentit/pm25.html|title=ilmanlaatu.fi - Pienhiukkaset PM2.5|website=Ilmanlaatu.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/fi-FI/Kartat_ja_tilastot/Ilman_epapuhtauksien_paastot/Ilman_epapuhtauksien_paastot_Suomessa(9416)|title=Ilman epäpuhtauksien päästöt Suomessa - ymparisto.fi|website=Ymparisto.fi|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy policy==
{{main|Energy policy of the European Union}}
The objective of RE (2005) of electricity was 35% (1997–2010). However, (2006) the Finnish objective was dropped to 31.5% (1997–2010). According to 'Renewables Global Status Report' Finland aims to increase RE only 2% in 13 years. This objective to add the RE use with 2% in 13 years is among the modest of all the EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf 2005: Record year for investments in renewable energy REN21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318230432/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=18 March 2009 }}“Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update”, REN21. 2006.

'''''Expedition''''' is a [[science fiction]] and [[speculative fiction]] book by artist-author [[Wayne Douglas Barlowe]]. Subtitled "Being an Account in Words and Artwork of the 2358 A.D. Voyage to Darwin IV", it is written as though published in the year 2366, five years after Barlowe's participation in a voyage to an alien planet, dubbed [[Darwin IV]] in honor of [[Charles Darwin]].

In the [[24th century]] the exploitation of the Earth's ecosystem has created an environment so toxic that mass extinctions have wiped out nearly half of its animal population. Most of the remaining fauna, save humans, have suffered horrible mutation. Aided by the benevolent and technologically superior alien race, the Yma, humanity begins to repair their ravaged world while simultaneously learning more about the universe around them. When an unmanned Yma probe discovers evidence of alien life on another planet, the titular "expedition" is sent to investigate.

Barlowe writes as a sort of 24th century [[John James Audubon|Audubon]], presenting his findings in a collection of paintings, sketches, field notes, and diary entries from his explorations of Darwin IV. He details a bewildering variety of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien lifeforms]] such as Gyrosprinters, Arrowtongues, Grovebacks, Daggerwrists, Skewers, Emperor Sea Striders, and Eosapians. Unlike the aliens presented in much of popular science fiction, which often seem to be variations of terrestrial lifeforms, Barlowe's creatures are truly alien: none of them possess eyes or true jaws; their body structures are often unlike any found on Earth; and they have unique modes of locomotion, sensing, and eating. Very late in the expedition, the explorer encounters lifeforms which use tools (the Eosapiens), giving a very strong indication they are intelligent.

A conservationist theme is present throughout the book. The expedition is designed to have as minimal an impact as possible on Darwin IV's environment. When two of the expedition's members suffer a fatal accident, Yma technology is used to remove all traces of the accident from Darwin IV's environment. At the conclusion of the expedition, Darwin IV is left in the same pristine state it was in prior to the expedition, with the exception of a metal obelisk placed in a remote area by the expedition.

A portion of the book, "Sea Strider Skull and Littoralope" was reprinted by the American Littoral Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barlowe|first=Wayne David|date=November 1996|title=Sea Strider Skull and Littoralope|url=https://www.littoralsociety.org/uploads/2/8/2/8/28281631/un_v23_no3.pdf|journal=Underwater Naturalist (Bulletin of the American Littoral Society)|volume=23|issue=3|pages=12—16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
The [[Discovery Channel]] produced a television special adapted from Barlowe's ''Expedition'', entitled ''[[Alien Planet]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453446/&lt;/ref&gt; which first aired on May 14, 2005. This program was faithful to the book in its presentation of the lifeforms found on Darwin IV. However, instead of being presented as the artist's own experiences, the program is presented as the findings of two autonomous robotic probes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5626">The '''Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun''' (FUPRE) in [[Delta State]], [[Nigeria]] was established and approved by the Federal Executive Council meeting of 14 March 2007 and admitted its first set of undergraduates in 2008.

The university was established under the Federal Government of Nigeria initiative to build a specialized university in the Niger Delta to produce manpower and expertise for the oil and gas sector.

The National Universities Commission(NUC) approved sharing of facilities between the Petroleum Training Institute Effurun and FUPRE until it moved to its permanent site on development of its main campus at Ugbomro, [[Uvwie]] Local Government Area in 2010.

* A = large divalent cations (barium, lead, strontium) and vacancy ([]), eventually monovalent cations (potassium, sodium)
* B = small divalent cations (iron, manganese, magnesium) and vacancy ([]), eventually sodium
* M = Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (this gives the root name ''arrojadite'') or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (root name ''dickinsonite''), or eventually Mg
* W = [[hydroxyl]] group or fluorine
The two suffixes in the name correspond to A1 and B1 sites. Third suffix may be present in special cases.&lt;ref&gt;Chopin, C., Oberti, R., and Cámara, F. 2006. The arrojadite enigma: II.

The '''fourth-generation Ford Taurus''' is an [[automobile]] that was produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for the 2000 to 2007 model years.  While mechanically similar to its 1996-1999 predecessor, major revisions to the bodyshell of the sedan were done to alter its controversial styling as well as add interior room; it was available in four-door sedan and five-door station wagon models.

The fourth-generation Taurus would be the final derived from the original 1986 model line. Slotting between the [[mid-size]] and [[full-size]] sedan classes, the Taurus was closer in exterior and interior dimensions, as well as engine options, to the [[Chevrolet Impala]] and [[Dodge Intrepid]] (than the Malibu and Stratus).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/automobiles/behind-the-wheel-ford-taurus-it-s-over-for-the-ovals-now-ford-plays-it-safe.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 and 2005, as part of its effort to increase the use of globally sourced platforms, Ford introduced the Volvo-developed [[Ford Five Hundred|Five Hundred]] and Mazda-developed [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Fusion]] to fill the slot of the Taurus in the Ford line (for non-fleet buyers, the Five Hundred also served as a replacement for the Crown Victoria).

The Taurus nameplate returned in 2008, as Ford renamed the Five Hundred to increase its sales.

==Overview==

===Exterior===
[[File:2000-2003 Ford Taurus SES.jpg|thumb|left|2000–2003 Ford Taurus SES sedan]]
When the third generation Taurus debuted, it was hurt by criticism of its design, which was formed from oval derived design elements. The design was very controversial, and it strongly limited the appeal of the car. As a result, for the fourth generation Taurus, Ford designed it with a more subdued, angular design, as part of Ford's [[New Edge]] styling, in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, this car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, which greatly increased trunk space.&lt;ref name="Consumerguide00"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000-2006 Ford Taurus overview |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206022040/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |archivedate=2007-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G4/index.html |title=Taurus/Sable spotter's guide (Generation 4 2000-2005) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=2008-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119023645/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/G4/index.html |archivedate=November 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof was also raised into a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be seen by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.

The front and rear clips were also redesigned on the Taurus and Sable sedans; all body panels were brand-new except the doors. [[Station wagon]]s received the new front clips but from the firewall back they were essentially the same as the 1996-1999 wagons. The Taurus now had the turn signals integrated into the headlamps, similar to that of the previous generation Sable. The front bumper was also redesigned to include a larger front grille which, like the previous generation, contained a chrome bar running through the middle containing the Ford logo. The rear clip was redesigned with a larger trunk and trunklid, as mentioned above, as well as giving the Taurus two large taillights as opposed to the rear lightbar used in the previous generation cars. Mounted on the trunklid was a large chrome bar containing the Ford logo, like in the front. In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the front clip was slightly redesigned, and the Taurus got a new front bumper and grille. The grille was made smaller, with the chrome bar removed, replaced by just a large Ford logo in the center. The taillights were slightly redesigned, originally to include amber turn signals, but this was cancelled at the eleventh hour. Instead the rear was given larger reverse lights, and the chrome bar above the license plate bracket was deleted.

===Interior===
As with the exterior, the interior was completely redesigned with a more conservative style, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard had a more linear appearance, instead of curving around the driver. The "Integrated Control Panel" was carried over but enlarged, reshaped, and placed in the center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over but it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had different cupholders and storage areas.&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt; Unlike previous Tauruses, this one offered rear cupholders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt;

This Taurus' interior was available in two configurations; a front bench seat with a column mounted shifter and the Flip-Fold center console, or bucket seats with a traditional console and a floor mounted shifter. The configuration for a steering column mounted shifter and a center console, which made a brief return for 1999, had been dropped. The interior also contained many new safety features; side airbags, tether straps, and a glow in the dark trunk release mounted inside of the trunk.&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt; This interior also contained a new system which Ford called the " Advanced Personal Safety System". This system, at the time of a collision, would detect the driver and passenger's positions as well as seatbelt usage, and would inflate the airbags to match, possibly preventing airbag-related injuries.&lt;ref name = "bestselling" /&gt; For 2004, the interior got a minor revision. This included a new steering wheel with a center airbag pad that was shaped like an upside-down taco and new gauges with a  diagnostic center that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a "system check" at the driver's request to make sure that the engine was functioning properly.

The two 1999 models were carried over, and two more were added. The most basic model was the LX, with the SE as the mid priced model. Two new trim levels were offered for 2000:  the SE Special Value Group and the top-end model SE Comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 Taurus Order Guide|url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/OrderGuides/2000_Taurus_guide.pdf|website=ford-taurus.org|publisher=Ford Division|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These new trim levels were renamed the following year to SES and SEL respectively. The SES and LX models were dropped in 2005, leaving the SE and SEL.

The SEL line received a few upgrades for 2003, to give it a more upscale image. Among the changes were a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as a slight redesign of the dash, with [[woodgrain]] replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the [[steering wheel]] rim and around the [[power window]] switches on the front doors.&lt;ref name="bestselling"&gt;{{Cite web |last=DiPetro |first=John |date=2003-04-18 |publisher=Edmunds |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46007 |title=Inside Line: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable |accessdate=2006-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615011127/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46007 |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Edition Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, [[headlight]]s with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said "Ford: 100 Years", a similar [[watch]], and a letter from [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] Production was limited to 4,000 units.&lt;ref name="Cent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/Cent.html |title=Centennial Taurus |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233928/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Specials/Cent.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2002, 2003 and 2004, the SES model received a "Sport" package, which consisted of five-spoked rims known as "slicers",  and the Duratec engine standard.  In addition, the exterior of the vehicle received Sport badging on the front quarter-panels, the chrome bar on the grille was changed to body color,  the interior received two-toned cloth seats, a two-toned dash applique, special "Sport" floor mats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. This model was only offered in four colors.

The engines were carried over from the previous generation, with the [[Ford Vulcan engine|Vulcan]] being the only available engine on the LX and SE, producing {{convert|155|hp}} and {{convert|185|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, and as the base engine on the SES. The [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec]] engine was optional on the SES and standard on the SEL, producing {{convert|200|hp}}. For 2005, with the LX and SES models being dropped, the Duratec was only available on the SEL, and in 2006 the Duratec was dropped altogether, with the Vulcan becoming the standard and only engine available on the SEL.  Some pre-2004 Vulcans were mated to the four speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4S|AX4S]] [[automatic transmission]]; all other Tauruses of this generation received the [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4N/4F50N|AX4N]] transmission.&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/Trans.html#ax4n |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia: Transaxles (AX4N) |work= |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2 |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119014953/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Engine/Trans.html |archivedate=November 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===Mercury Sable===
[[File:00-03 Mercury Sable GS sedan.jpg|thumb|2000–2003 Mercury Sable]]
The Mercury Sable, the sister model of the Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also redesigned for 2000. Like with previous generations, the Sable shared all mechanical components with the Taurus with a unique body. The new Sable was also largely carried over from the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)#Mercury Sable|previous model]], with changes limited a new front fascia, rear fascia, wheels, a taller roof and trunk, and a new interior, though the interior was the same design of the Taurus with added woodgrain trim. Like with previous generations, the Sable offered the same powertrains and equipment as the Taurus. The Sable was again offered in GS and LS models in wagon and sedan body styles, with a new top-of-the-line LS Premium trim. An LS Platinum edition was also briefly offered. The Sable was updated in 2004 with a new grille, front bumper, steering wheel, instrument cluster, wheels and taillamps. The Sable was discontinued in 2005 and replaced by the [[Mercury Montego]] (which would be renamed as the Sable in 2008) and [[Mercury Milan]]. This generation of Sable was not sold in [[Canada]], as the Mercury nameplate had been discontinued there by the 2000 model year.

Taurus sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its demise, losing significant market share to [[Automotive industry in Japan|counterparts from Japan]].&lt;ref name = "det"&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120730140903/http://www.detnews.com/2005/autosinsider/0504/19/C01-154989.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-30 | last = Mayne | first = Eric | date = 2005-04-19 | publisher = [[Detroit News]] | title = End of Ford Taurus closes era | accessdate = 2006-05-16}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Taurus, which had at one time been the best-selling midsize sedan, had already lost its position when it was surpassed in sales by the [[Honda Accord]] and [[Toyota Camry]], and in 2005 fell to #4 behind the [[Nissan Altima]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/top-10/top-10-best-selling-vehicles-for-2005.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to waning popularity and customer demand, Ford decided to slowly discontinue the Taurus. Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued on December 8, 2004;&lt;ref name = "G4" /&gt; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to [[Fleet vehicles|fleets]] in the [[United States]], while still being sold to retail customers in [[Canada]]. Production ended on October 27, 2006, as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of its "[[The Way Forward]]" [[Corporate restructuring|restructuring plan]].

[[File:2004-2006 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|The last Taurus sedan was an SEL model like this one.]]
The discontinuation of the Taurus was controversial, especially in the context of Ford's well-publicized financial problems at the time.  While many believed that the Taurus was discontinued because it could no longer compete in the growing sedan market,&lt;ref name="DetNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061023/AUTO01/610230304/1148 |title=Storied Ford Taurus reaches end of line |publisher=[[Detroit News]] |date=2006-10-23 |accessdate=2007-08-14 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; others believed that if Ford wanted to save the car, they could have easily done so.&lt;ref name = "Dateline"&gt;{{Cite video | title = Final Ford Taurus interview | publisher = ABC News | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwuCm8hNXgI | date = 2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autoblog went as far as calling the Taurus the biggest fall from grace in history, and even blamed Ford's current financial problems on their failure to keep the Taurus competitive, as well as how they focused nearly all of their development resources and marketing on trucks and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]].&lt;ref name = "Autoblog"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2006/10/19/so-long-friend-ford-producing-the-last-taurus-next-week/ | title = So long, friend.

[[MSNBC]] interviewed many Ford workers who felt that Ford unjustly abandoned the car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. In an October 25, 2006 USA Today editorial, "How Ford starved its Taurus" it was noted that the Japanese stick with their winners and make them better (such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], which has been in continuous production since the 1960s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/history.html | title = Toyota Corolla history | publisher = Edmunds.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Detroit automakers retires cars or entire division nameplates in search of "the next big thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = How Ford starved its Taurus | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-10-24-ford-taurus_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = 2006-10-25 | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Auto Show 032.jpg|thumb|The 2008 Ford Five Hundred prototype, which was renamed "Taurus" upon Alan Mulally's request]]

However, after [[Alan Mulally]] took position as Ford's CEO, rumors were rampant that he was interested in reviving the Taurus. These were fueled by the fact that he said in an interview with the [[Associated Press]] that he was baffled to find out that the Taurus had been discontinued when taking position as CEO at Ford, as well as stating that he believed that discontinuing the Taurus was a mistake, and that the Five Hundred should have been named "Taurus" from the beginning.&lt;ref name = "Alan"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17033668/ | title = CEO insisted in bringing "Taurus" back | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | date = 2007-02-07 | accessdate = 2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rumors of a possible Taurus revival were confirmed in mid-2007, when the revamped versions of the Five Hundred and Freestyle were unveiled as "Taurus" and "Taurus X" at the 2007 [[Chicago Auto Show]], a decision that was influenced strongly by Mulally.&lt;ref name = "Alan" /&gt; In a later interview, Mulally explained that the fact that the Taurus was well known and had a positive brand equity associated with it strongly influenced his decision to revive the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = Ford CEO Alan Mulally on the new Ford Taurus | publisher = Autoinsider news | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlNOtqI8tc | date = 2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freeman Tilden''' (August 22, 1883 – May 13, 1980) was one of the first people to set down the principles and theories of [[Heritage Interpretation]] in his 1957 book, ''Interpreting Our Heritage''.

His work with the United States [[National Park Service]] inspired generations of interpreters across the world and continues to be a definitive text for the discipline. According to [[thematic interpretation]] expert, Sam H. Ham, Tilden's quotation on page 38 of ''Interpreting Our Heritage'' (which was taken from a US National Park Service administrative manual) has become one of the most cited phrases in the interpretation literature worldwide:

{{quote|Through interpretation, understanding; through understanding, appreciation; through appreciation, protection.}}

'''Galaxite''', also known as 'mangan-spinel' is an [[Cubic crystal system|isometric]] [[mineral]] belonging to the [[spinel group]] of [[oxide minerals|oxides]] with the ideal [[chemical formula]] Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://rruff.info/ima/&lt;/ref&gt;

Galaxite is the [[manganese]] (Mn) rich endmember of the [[aluminium]] (Al) series of the [[spinel group]]. [[Divalent]] [[iron]] (Fe) and [[magnesium]] (Mg) readily substitute for the manganese in the crystal structure. [[Trivalent]] iron may also substitute for the aluminium. Thus, reflecting most natural samples, the formula may be better represented as (Mn,Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mg)(Al,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

Galaxite generally occurs as small granular aggregates with a red-brownish tone. It has a vitreous [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and leaves a brownish-red streak. It is rated 7.5 on the [[Mohs Scale]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

It was first described in 1932 for an occurrence at Bald Knob, [[Alleghany County, North Carolina]] near its namesakes, the town of [[Galax, Virginia]], named after the [[plant]] [[galax]] or wandflower which grows in the area.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;

It occurs in carbonate-rich [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] [[manganese]] ore deposits. It occurs associated with [[alleghanyite]], [[rhodonite]], [[sonolite]], [[spessartine]], [[tephroite]], [[kutnohorite]], [[manganhumite]], [[jacobsite]], [[kellyite]] and [[alabandite]] in the Bald Knob area. Associated minerals include [[katoptrite]], [[magnetite]], [[manganostibite]], [[magnussonite]], [[tephroite]], manganhumite and [[manganosite]] in the  Brattfors mine area of [[Nordmark]], [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

It is sometimes used as a gemstone.&lt;ref&gt;Tables of Gemstone Identification By Roger Dedeyne, Ivo Quintens, p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3908">In [[zoology]], a '''graminivore''' (not to be confused with a [[granivore]]) is an [[herbivorous]] animal that feeds primarily on grass&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graminivorous Graminivorous - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (specifically "true" grasses, plants of the family [[Poaceae]]). The word is derived from Latin ''graminis'', meaning "grass", and ''vorare'', meaning "to eat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/graminivorous Graminivorous | Define Graminivorous at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Graminivory is a form of [[grazing]].  These herbivorous animals have digestive systems that are adapted to digest large amounts of [[cellulose]], which is abundant in fibrous plant matter and more difficult to break down for many other animals.  As such, they have specialized [[enzyme]]s to aid in digestion and in some cases [[symbiotic bacteria]] that live in their digestive track and "assist" with the digestive process through fermentation as the matter travels through the intestines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/896421272|title=Biology.|last=Connie,|first=Rye,|others=Avissar, Yael,, Choi, Jung Ho, 1956-, DeSaix, Jean,, Jurukovski, Vladimir,, Wise, Robert R.,|isbn=9781938168093|location=Houston, Texas|oclc=896421272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horse]]s, [[cattle]], [[capybara]], [[hippopotamus]]es, [[goose|geese]], and [[giant panda]]s are examples of [[vertebrate]] graminivores. Some carnivorous vertebrates, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, are known to eat grass occasionally. Grass consumption in dogs can be a way to rid their intestinal tract of parasites that may be threatening to the carnivore's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201412/why-dogs-eat-grass-myth-debunked|title=Why Dogs Eat Grass—a Myth Debunked|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[invertebrate]]s also have graminivorous diets. Many [[grasshopper]]s, such as individuals from the [[Acrididae]] family, have diets consisting primarily of plants from the Poaceae family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picaud|first=F.|last2=Bonnet|first2=E.|last3=Gloaguen|first3=V.|last4=Petit|first4=D.|title=Decision Making for Food Choice by Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae): Comparison Between a Specialist Species on a Shrubby Legume and Three Graminivorous Species|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.uregina.ca:8443/10.1603/0046-225X-32.3.680|journal=Environmental Entomology|volume=32|issue=3|pages=680–688|doi=10.1603/0046-225x-32.3.680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graminivores generally exhibit a preference on which species of grass they choose to consume. For example, according to a study done on North American [[bison]] (''Bison bison L.)'' feeding on shortgrass plains in north-eastern [[Colorado]], the cattle consumed a total of thirty-six different species of plant. Of that thirty-six, five grass species were favoured and consumed the most pervasively. The average consumption of these five species comprised about 80% of their diet. A few of these species include ''Aristida longiseta Steud.,'' ''Muhlenbergia sp''., and ''Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peden|first=D. G.|last2=Van Dyne|first2=G.

[[Image:Onduleur pour photovoltaïque.jpg|thumb|Inverter for grid-tied solar panel]]
[[Image:Stainless steel 95kw grid-tied inverter.jpg|thumb|Three-phase grid-tie inverter for large solar panel systems]]

A '''grid-tie inverter''' converts [[direct current]] (DC) into an [[alternating current]] (AC) suitable for injecting into an electrical power grid, normally 120 V [[Root mean square|RMS]] at 60 [[Hz]] or 240 V RMS at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Grid-tie inverters are used between local electrical power generators: [[solar panel]], [[wind turbine]], [[hydro-electric]], and the grid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/463622-TtEMSp/webviewable/463622.pdf OSTI&lt;/ref&gt;

To inject electrical power efficiently and safely into the grid, grid-tie inverters must accurately match the voltage and [[Polyphase system|phase]] of the grid [[sine wave]] AC [[waveform]].

Some electricity companies pay for electrical power that is injected into the grid.

==Payment for injected power==
Electricity companies, in some countries, pay for electrical power that is injected into the electricity utility grid. Payment is arranged in several ways.

With [[net metering]] the electricity company pays for the net power injected into the grid, as recorded by a meter in the customer's premises. For example, a customer may consume 400 kilowatt-hours over a month and may return 500 kilowatt-hours to the grid in the same month. In this case the electricity company would pay for the 100 kilowatt hours balance of power fed back into the grid. In the US, net metering policies vary by jurisdiction.

[[Feed-in tariff]], based on a contract with a distribution company or other power authority, is where the customer is paid for electrical power injected into the grid.

In the United States, grid-interactive power systems are specified in the [[National Electric Code]], which also mandates requirements for grid-interactive inverters.

==Operation==
Grid-tie inverters convert DC electrical power into AC power suitable for injecting into the electric utility company grid. The grid tie inverter (GTI) must match the phase of the grid and maintain the output  voltage slightly higher than the grid voltage at any instant. A high-quality modern grid-tie inverter has a fixed unity power factor, which means its output voltage and current are perfectly lined up, and its phase angle is within 1 degree of the AC power grid. The inverter has an on-board computer that senses the current AC grid waveform, and outputs a voltage to correspond with the grid. However, supplying reactive power to the grid might be necessary to keep the voltage in the local grid inside allowed limitations. Otherwise, in a grid segment with considerable power from renewable sources, voltage levels might rise too much at times of high production, i.e. around noon with solar panels.

Grid-tie inverters are also designed to quickly disconnect from the grid if the utility grid goes down. This is an [[National Electrical Code|NEC]] requirement&lt;ref&gt;NEC Handbook 2005, Section 705, "Interconnected Electric Power Production Sources," Article 705.40 "Loss of Primary Source"&lt;/ref&gt; that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter shuts down to prevent the energy it transfers from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the power grid.

Properly configured, a grid tie inverter enables a home owner to use an alternative power generation system like solar or wind power without extensive rewiring and without batteries. If the alternative power being produced is insufficient, the deficit is sourced from the electricity grid.

==Types==
[[File:Grid Tie-SWEA-250W.jpg|thumb|Inside an SWEA 250 W transformer-coupled grid-tie inverter]]
Grid-tie inverters include conventional low-frequency types with transformer coupling, newer high-frequency types, also with transformer coupling, and transformerless types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Ruoyang|last2=Robertson|first2=Paul|date=2017|title=Cost Effective Grid-Connected Inverter for a Micro Combined Heat and Power System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7869301/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1109/TIE.2017.2677340|issn=0278-0046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of converting direct current directly into AC suitable for the grid, high-frequency transformers types use a computer process to convert the power to a high-frequency and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage suitable for the grid.&lt;ref name="sei2006"&gt;Solar Energy International (2006). ''Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual'', Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformerless inverters, which are popular in Europe, are lighter, smaller, and more efficient than inverters with transformers.  But transformerless inverters have been slow to enter the US market because of concerns that transformerless inverters, which do not have [[galvanic isolation]] between the DC side and grid, could inject dangerous DC voltages and currents into the grid under fault conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf| title=Summary Report on the DOE High-tech Inverter Workshop| publisher=eere.energy.gov| accessdate=2011-06-10| work=Sponsored by the US Department of Energy, prepared by McNeil Technologies| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227145827/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf| archivedate=2012-02-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 2005, the NFPA's NEC allows transformerless, or non-galvanically isolated, inverters by removing the requirement that all solar electric systems be negative [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] and specifying new safety requirements. Amendments to VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 define the design and procedures needed for such systems: primarily, ground current measurement and DC to grid isolation tests.

==Datasheets==
Manufacturers [[datasheet]]s for their inverters usually include the following data:
* ''Rated output power'': This value is provided in watts or kilowatts. For some inverters, they may provide an output rating for different output voltages. For instance, if the inverter can be configured for either 240&amp;nbsp;VAC or 208&amp;nbsp;VAC output, the rated power output may be different for each of those configurations.
* ''Output voltage(s)'': This value indicates the utility voltages the inverter can connect to. For smaller inverters for residential use, the output voltage is usually 240&amp;nbsp;VAC. Inverters that target commercial applications are available for 208, 240, 277, 400, 480 or 600&amp;nbsp;VAC and may also produce [[three phase]] power.
* ''Peak efficiency'': The peak efficiency represents the highest efficiency that the inverter can achieve. Most grid-tie inverters on the market as of July 2009 have peak efficiencies of over 94%, some as high as 96%. The energy lost during inversion is for the most part converted into heat. Consequently, for an inverter to output its rated power it must have a power input that exceeds its output. For example, a 5000&amp;nbsp;W inverter operating at full power at 95% efficiency requires an input of 5,263&amp;nbsp;W (rated power divided by efficiency). Inverters that are capable of producing power at different AC voltages may have different efficiencies associated with each voltage.
* ''CEC weighted efficiency'': This efficiency is published by the California Energy Commission on its GoSolar website. In contrast to peak efficiency, this value is an average efficiency and is a better representation of the inverter's operating profile. Inverters that are capable of producing power at different AC voltages may have different efficiencies associated with each voltage.&lt;ref name="cecList"&gt;gosolarcalifornia.org, [http://www.gosolarcalifornia.org/equipment/inverter.php "List of Eligible Inverters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210142931/http://gosolarcalifornia.org/equipment/inverter.php |date=2009-02-10 }}, accessed July 30, 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Maximum input current'': This is the maximum amount of direct current that the inverter can use. If a system, solar cells for example, produces a current in excess of the maximum input current, that current is not used by the inverter.
* ''Maximum output current'': The maximum output current is the maximum continuous alternating current that the inverter can supply. This value is typically used to determine the minimum current rating of the over-current protection devices (e.g., breakers and fuses) and disconnects required for the output circuit. Inverters that can produce power at different AC voltages have different maximum outputs for each voltage.
* ''Peak power tracking voltage'': This represents the DC voltage range in which the inverter's maximum point power tracker operates. The system designer must configure the strings optimally so that during the majority of the year, the voltage of the strings are within this range. This can be a difficult task since voltage fluctuates with temperature changes.
* ''Start voltage'': This value is not listed on all inverter datasheets. The value indicates the minimum DC voltage required for the inverter to turn on and operate. This is especially important for solar applications, because the system designer must be sure that there is a sufficient number of solar modules wired in series in each string to produce this voltage. If this value is not provided by the manufacturer, system designers typically use the lower band of the peak power tracking voltage range as the inverter's minimum voltage.
* ''[[IP Code|IPxx rating]]'': The Ingress Protection rating or IP Code classifies and rates the level of protection provided against the ingress of solid foreign objects (first digit) or water (second digit), a higher digit means greater protection. In the US the ''[[NEMA enclosure type]]'' is used similarly to the international rating. Most inverters are rated for outdoors installation with IP45 (no dust protection) or IP65 (dust tight), or in the US, NEMA 3R (no windblown dust protection) or NEMA 4X (windblown dust, direct water splash and additional corrosion protection).
* ''Certifications/Compliance'': Certifications required by electric utilities and local electric codes for grid tie approval such as UL 1741&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard for Inverters, Converters, Controllers and Interconnection System Equipment for Use With Distributed Energy Resources|url=http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=1741_2|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emerging standard UL 1741SA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UL Launches Advanced Inverter Testing and Certification Program|url=http://www.ul.com/newsroom/pressreleases/ul-launches-advanced-inverter-testing-and-certification-program/|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haggertyite''' is a rare [[barium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[titanate]] mineral: Ba(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Mg)O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; first described in 1996 from the [[Crater of Diamonds State Park]] near [[Murfreesboro, Arkansas|Murfreesboro]] in [[Pike County, Arkansas]]. The microscopic metallic mineral crystallizes in the [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] system and forms tiny hexagonal plates associated with [[richterite]] and [[serpentinite|serpentinitized]] [[olivine]] of [[mafic]] [[xenolith]]s in the [[lamproite]] host rock. It is an iron(II) rich member of the [[magnetoplumbite group]]. It is a light grey opaque mineral with calculated [[Mohs hardness]] of 5. 

It was named for [[geophysicist]] [[Stephen E. Haggerty]] (born 1938) of the [[Florida International University]].

'''High-temperature electrolysis''' (also '''HTE''' or '''steam electrolysis''') is a technology for producing [[hydrogen]] from water at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauch, A.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Mogensen, M.|title=Highly Efficient high temperature electrolysis|journal=J. Mater. Chem.|year=2008|volume=18|pages=2331–2340|doi=10.1039/b718822f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
High temperature electrolysis is more efficient economically than traditional room-temperature [[electrolysis of water|electrolysis]] because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and also because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures.  In fact, at 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, electrical input is unnecessary because water breaks down to hydrogen and oxygen through [[thermolysis]].  Such temperatures are impractical; proposed HTE systems operate between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 850&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Badwal 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Badwal|first=SPS|author2=Giddey S |author3=Munnings C |journal=WIREs Energy and Environment|year=2012|doi=10.1002/wene.50|url=http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WiresArticle/wisId-WENE50.html|title=Hydrogen production via solid electrolytic routes|volume=2|issue=5|pages=473–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi2h2.com/ Hi2h2 - High temperature electrolysis using SOEC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltemp.eu/ WELTEMP-Water electrolysis at elevated temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency improvement of high-temperature electrolysis is best appreciated by assuming that the electricity used comes from a [[heat engine]], and then considering the amount of heat energy necessary to produce one kg hydrogen (141.86 megajoules), both in the HTE process itself and also in producing the electricity used.  At 100&amp;nbsp;°C, 350 megajoules of thermal energy are required (41% efficient).  At 850&amp;nbsp;°C, 225 megajoules are required (64% efficient).

==Materials==
The selection of the materials for the electrodes and electrolyte in a [[solid oxide electrolyser cell]] is essential. One option being investigated for the process&lt;ref&gt;Kazuya Yamada, Shinichi Makino, Kiyoshi Ono, Kentaro Matsunaga, Masato Yoshino, Takashi Ogawa, Shigeo Kasai, Seiji Fujiwara, and Hiroyuki Yamauchi "High Temperature Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production Using Solid Oxide Electrolyte Tubular Cells Assembly Unit", presented at AICHE Annual Meeting, San Francisco, California, November 2006. 
[http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2006/techprogram/S3253.HTM abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; used [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ) electrolytes, nickel-[[cermet]] steam/hydrogen electrodes, and mixed oxide of lanthanum, strontium and cobalt oxygen electrodes.

==Economic potential==

Even with HTE, electrolysis is a fairly inefficient way to store energy.  Significant conversion losses of energy occur both in the electrolysis process, and in the conversion of the resulting hydrogen back into power.

At current hydrocarbon prices, HTE can not compete with [[pyrolysis]] of hydrocarbons as an economical source of hydrogen.

HTE is of interest as a more efficient route to the production of hydrogen, to be used as a [[carbon neutral]] fuel and general energy storage. It may become economical if cheap non-fossil fuel sources of heat (concentrating solar, nuclear, geothermal) can be used in conjunction with non-fossil fuel sources of electricity (such as solar, wind, ocean, nuclear).

Possible supplies of cheap high-temperature heat for HTE are all nonchemical, including [[nuclear reactor]]s, [[solar power|concentrating solar thermal collectors]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources. HTE has been demonstrated in a laboratory at 108&amp;nbsp;kilojoules (thermal) per gram of hydrogen produced,&lt;ref name="INL"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial [[generation IV reactor]]s are expected around 2030.

===The market for hydrogen production===

Given a cheap, high-temperature heat source, other hydrogen production methods are possible. In particular, see the thermochemical [[sulfur-iodine cycle]]. Thermochemical production might reach higher efficiencies than HTE because no heat engine is required. However, large-scale thermochemical production will require significant advances in materials that can withstand high-temperature, high-pressure, highly corrosive environments.

The market for hydrogen is large (50 million metric tons/year in 2004, worth about $135 billion/year) and growing at about 10% per year (see [[hydrogen economy]]). This market is met by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons to produce the hydrogen, which results in CO2 emissions. The two major consumers are oil refineries and fertilizer plants (each consumes about half of all production). Should hydrogen-powered cars become widespread, their consumption would greatly increase the demand for hydrogen in a hydrogen economy.

==Electrolysis and thermodynamics==

During electrolysis, the amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (theoretically) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] efficiency of any electrochemical process equals 100%.  In practice, the efficiency is given by electrical work achieved divided by the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction.

In most cases, such as room temperature water electrolysis, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released as [[waste heat]]. In the case of electrolysis of [[steam]] into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true. Heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the [[heating value]] of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input. In this case the efficiency relative to electric energy input can be said to be greater than 100%. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a [[fuel cell]] is the inverse of that of electrolysis at the same temperature. It is thus impossible to create a [[perpetual motion]] machine by combining the two processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14767">{{For|the meteorological dew point|Dew point}}

The '''hydrocarbon dew point''' is the [[temperature]] (at a given  [[pressure]]) at which the [[hydrocarbon]] components of any hydrocarbon-rich gas mixture, such as [[natural gas]], will start to [[Condensation|condense]] out of the gaseous phase. It is often also referred to as the '''HDP''' or the '''HCDP'''. The maximum temperature at which such [[condensation]] takes place is called the ''cricondentherm''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.effectech.co.uk/downloads/applicationnotes.php Hydrocarbon Dew Point]&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrocarbon dew point is a function of the gas composition as well as the pressure.

The hydrocarbon dew point is universally used in the natural gas industry as an important quality parameter, stipulated in contractual specifications and enforced throughout the natural gas supply chain, from producers through [[natural gas processing|processing]], transmission and distribution companies to final end users.

The hydrocarbon dew point of  a gas is a different concept from the water dew point, the latter being the temperature (at a given pressure) at which water vapor present in a gas mixture will condense out of the gas.

==Relation of the term GPM to the hydrocarbon dew point==

In the United States, the hydrocarbon dew point of processed, pipelined natural gas is related to and characterized by the term GPM which is the gallons of liquifiable hydrocarbons contained in {{convert|1000|cuft|m3}} of natural gas at a stated temperature and pressure. When the liquifiable hydrocarbons are characterized as being [[hexane]] or higher [[molecular weight]] components, they are reported as GPM (C6+).&lt;ref name=NGC&gt;[http://www.naesb.org/pdf/update011905w9.pdf White Paper on Liquid Hydrocarbon Drop Out in Natural Gas Infrastructure] (NGC+ Liquid Hydrocarbon Dropout Task Group, October 15, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NGC2&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/NGC_HDP_Paper.pdf White Paper on Liquid Hydrocarbon Drop Out in Natural Gas Infrastructure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010053441/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/NGC_HDP_Paper.pdf |date=2008-10-10 }} (NGC+ Liquid Hydrocarbon Dropout Task Group, September 28, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the quality of raw produced natural gas is also often characterized by the term GPM meaning the gallons of liquifiable hydrocarbons contained in {{convert|1000|cuft|m3}} of the raw natural gas. In such cases, when the liquifiable hydrocarbons in the raw natural gas are characterized as being [[ethane]] or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C2+). Similarly, when characterized as being [[propane]] or higher molecular weight components, they are reported as GPM (C3+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. J. Kidnay and William Parish|title=Fundamentals of Natural Gas Processing|edition=1st|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8493-3406-3}} (See page 110)&lt;/ref&gt;

Care must be taken not to confuse the two different definitions of the term GPM.

Although GPM is an additional parameter of some value, most pipeline operators and others who process, transport, distribute or use natural gas are primarily interested in the actual HCDP, rather than GPM.  Furthermore, GPM and HCDP are not interchangeable and one should be careful not to confuse what each one exactly means.

==Methods of HCDP determination==

There are primarily two categories of HCDP determination.  One category involves "theoretical" methods, and the other involves "experimental" methods.

===Theoretical methods of HCDP determination===

The theoretical methods use the component analysis of the gas mixture (usually via gas chromatography, GC) and then use an equation of state (EOS) to calculate what the dew point of the mixture should be at a given pressure.  The Peng–Robinson and Kwong–Redlich–Soave equations of state are the most commonly used for determining the HCDP in the natural gas industry.

The theoretical methods using GC analysis suffer from four sources of error:

* The first source of error is the sampling error.  Pipelines operate at high pressure.  To do an analysis using a field GC, the pressure has to be regulated down to close to atmospheric pressure.  In the process of reducing pressure, some of the heavier components may drop out, particularly if the pressure reduction is done in the retrograde region.  Therefore, the gas reaching the GC is fundamentally different (usually leaner in the heavy components) than the actual gas in the pipeline.  Alternatively, if a sample bottle is collected for delivery to a laboratory for analysis, significant care must be taken not to introduce any contaminants to the sample, to make sure that the sample bottle represents the actual gas in the pipeline, and to extract the complete sample correctly in to the laboratory GC.
* The second source is the error on the analysis of the gas mix components.  A typical field GC will have at best (under ideal conditions and frequent calibration) ~2% (of range) error in the quantity of each gas analyzed.  Since the range for most field-GCs for C6 components is 0-1&amp;nbsp;mol%, there will be about 0.02&amp;nbsp;mol% uncertainty in the quantity of C6+ components.   While this error does not change the heating value by much, it will introduce a significant error in the HCDP determination.  Furthermore, since the exact distribution of C6+ components is an unknown (the amount of C6, C7, C8, ...), this further introduces additional errors in any HCDP calculations.  When using a C6+ GC these errors can be as high as 100&amp;nbsp;°F or more, depending on the gas mixture and the assumptions made regarding the composition of the C6+ fraction. For "pipeline quality" natural gas, a C9+ GC analysis may reduce the uncertainty, because it eliminates the C6-C8 distribution error.  However, independent studies have shown that the cumulative error can still be very significant, in some cases in excess of 30 C. A laboratory C12+ GC analysis using an Flame Ionization Detector (FID) can reduce the error further. However, using a C12 laboratory system can introduce additional errors, namely sampling error. If the gas has to be collected in a sample bottle and shipped to a laboratory for C12 analysis, sampling errors can be significant. Obviously there is also a lag time error between the time the sample was collected and the time it was analyzed.&lt;ref name=NPL2007&gt;Andrew Brown et al (May 2007). "Comparison of Methods for the Measurement of Hydrocarbon Dew Point of natural gas", ''UK National Physical Laboratory Report AS 3'', ISSN 1754-2928.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third source of errors is calibration errors. All GCs have to be calibrated routinely with a calibration gas representative of the gas under analysis.  If the calibration gas is not representative, or calibrations are not routinely performed, there will be errors introduced.
* The fourth source of error relates to the errors embedded in the equation of state model used to calculate the dew point. Different models are prone to varying amounts error at different pressure regimes and gas mixes.  There is sometimes a significant divergence of calculated dew point based solely on the choice of equation of state used.

The significant advantage of using the theoretical models is that the HCDP at several pressures (as well as the cricondentherm) can be determined from a single analysis.  This provides for operational uses such as determining the phase of the stream flowing through the flow-meter, determining if the sample has been affected by ambient temperature in the sample system, and avoiding [[Amine gas treating|amine]] foaming from liquid hydrocarbons in the amine contactor.  However, recent developments in combining experimental methods and software enhancements have eliminated this shortcoming (see '''Combined Experimental and Theoretical Approach''' below)

GC vendors with a product targeting the HCDP analysis include Emerson,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.emersonprocess.com/en-US/brands/Danalyzer/GC/Model-700XA/Pages/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; ABB, Thermo-fisher, as well as other companies.

===Experimental methods of HCDP determination===

In the "experimental" methods, one actually cools a surface on which gas condenses and then measures the temperature at which the condensation takes place.  The experimental methods can be divided into manual and automated systems.  '''Manual''' systems, such as the Bureau of Mines dewpoint tester, depend on an operator to manually cool the chilled mirror slowly and to visually detect the onset of condensation.  The '''automated''' methods use automatic mirror chilling controls and sensors to detect the amount of light reflected by the mirror and detect when condensation occurs through changes in the reflected light.  The chilled mirror technique is a first principle measurement. Depending on the specific method used to establish the dew point temperature, some correction calculations may be necessary. As condensation must necessarily have already occurred for it to be detected, the reported temperature is lower than when using theoretical methods.&lt;ref name=NPL2007/&gt;
 
Similar to GC analysis, the experimental method is subject to potential sources of error.  The first error is in the detection of condensation.  A key component in chilled mirror dew point measurements is the subtlety with which condensate can be detected — in other words, the thinner the film is when detected, the better. A manual chilled mirror device relies on the operator to determine when a mist has formed on the mirror, and, depending on the device, can be highly subjective.  It is also not always clear what is condensing: water or hydrocarbons. Because of the low resolution that has traditionally been available, the operator has been prone to under report the dew point, in other words, to report the dew point temperature as being below what it actually is. This is due to the fact that by the time condensation had accumulated enough to be visible, the dew point had already been reached and passed.  The most modern manual devices make possible greatly improved reporting accuracy. There are two manufacturers of manual devices, and each of their devices meet the requirements for dew point measurement apparatus as defined in the ASTM Manual for Hydrocarbon Analysis. However, there are significant differences between the devices – including the optical resolution of the mirror and the method of mirror cooling – depending on the manufacturer. 

Automated chilled mirror devices provide significantly more repeatable results, but these measurements can be affected by contaminants that may compromise the mirror's surface.  In many instances it is important to incorporate an effective filtration system that prepares the gas for analysis. On the other hand, filtration may alter the gas composition slightly and filter elements are subject to clogging and saturation. Advances in technology have led to analyzers that are less affected by contaminants and certain devices can also measure the dew point of water that may be present in the gas. One recent innovation is the use of spectroscopy to determine the nature of the condensate at dewpoint. Another device user laser interferometry to register extremely tenuous amounts of condensation. It is asserted that these technologies are less affected by interference from contaminants. Another  source of error is the speed of the cooling of the mirror and the measurement of the temperature of the mirror when the condensation is detected.  This error can be minimized by controlling the cooling speed, or having a fast condensation detection system.

Experimental methods only provide a HCDP at the pressure at which the measurement is taken, and cannot provide the cricondentherm or the HCDP at other pressures.  As the cricondentherm of natural gas is typically around 27 bar, there are gas preparation systems currently available which adjust input pressure to this value.  Although, as pipeline operators often wish to know the HCDP at their current line pressure, the input pressure of many experimental systems can be adjusted by a regulator.

There are instruments that can be operated in either manual or automatic mode from the Vympel &lt;ref name="Hygrovision BL(TM)"&gt;[http://www.vympel.de/en/products/Hygrovision_BL-Mirror_illuminating.html Vympel Instruments] (Hygrovision BL Hydrocarbon Dew Point Analyzer)&lt;/ref&gt; company.

Companies who offer an automated chilled mirror system include: Vympel,&lt;ref name="Hygrovision BL(TM)"&gt;[http://www.vympel.de/en/products/Hygrovision_BL-Mirror_illuminating.html Vympel Instruments] (Hygrovision BL Hydrocarbon Dew Point Analyzer)&lt;/ref&gt; Ametek, Michell Instruments, and ZEGAZ Instruments&lt;ref name=HCD4000(TM)&gt;[http://www.zegaz.com  ZEGAZ Instruments] (HCD5000(TM) Hydrocarbon Dewpoint Analyzer)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined Experimental and Theoretical Approach===

A recent innovation is to combine the experimental method with theoretical.  If the composition of the gas is analyzed by a C6+ GC, '''AND''' a dewpoint is experimentally measured at any pressure, then the experimental dewpoint can be used in combination with the GC analysis to provide a more exact phase diagram.  This approach overcome the main shortcoming of the experimental method which is not knowing the whole phase diagram.  An example of this software is provided by Starling Associates.

A '''Jacob's ladder''' (also '''magic tablets''', '''Chinese blocks''', and '''klick-klack toy'''&lt;ref name="Make"&gt;Frauenfelder, Mark (2011). ''Make: Technology On Your Time, Vol. 26: Roll Your Own'', p.148. O'Reilly Media. {{ISBN|9781449397593}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Folk culture|folk]] [[toy]] consisting of [[toy block|blocks]] of wood held together by strings or [[ribbon]]s. It is "a toy that does some very weird things."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Pat; Lambertson, Lori; and Tesler, Pearl (2004). ''The Math Explorer: Games and Activities for Middle School Youth Groups'', p.109 &amp; 116. Exploratorium. {{ISBN|9781559535403}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ladder is held at one end, blocks appear to cascade down the strings. This effect is a [[optical illusion|visual illusion]] which is the result of one block after another flipping over. It may be considered a [[kinetic illusion]], where the blocks appear to change position when they do not.&lt;ref name="Make"/&gt; Its name ''Jacob's Ladder'' comes from the biblical [[Jacob's Ladder (Bible)|ladder to heaven]], mentioned in Genesis 28:12.&lt;ref name="Make"/&gt;

Of unknown origin, the earliest known review of the Jacob's Ladder is an 1889 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article which tells how it is built and works:&lt;ref name="Make"/&gt;
{{quote|The simple toy ...&lt;!--"illustrated in the annexed engraving"--&gt; is very illusive in action. When the upper block is grasped by the edges ...&lt;!--", as shown in Fig. 1,"--&gt; and turned so as to lift the second block in the series to the same height, the upper end of the second block falls into an inverted position, and appears to pass downward on the other members of the series, first upon one side of the ladder and then upon the other until it reaches the bottom. But this effect is only apparent, as the second block in reality only falls back into its original position in the series; but in the operation it becomes reversed, what was before the lower end becoming the upper end, the front having exchanged places with the back. This change of position of the second member brings it parallel with the third block, which is then released, and the third member drops over onto the fourth, when the fifth block is released, and so on throughout the entire series.|"Jacob's Ladder", ''Scientific American'', Vol. 61, No. 15 (October 1889)&lt;ref name="Scientific"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/scientific-american-1889-10-12/scientific-american-v61-n15-1889-10-12#page/n3/mode/2up Scientific American, October 12, 1889, page 227.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Construction==
[[File:Jacob's Ladder 2.jpg|thumb|The mechanism of a Jacob's Ladder, "Fig. 2"]]

An arrangement of interlaced ribbons allows each block to act as if hinged to the next one at either of its two ends. The same mechanism is used in the 1980s toy [[Rubik's Magic]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/magics.htm Rubik's Magic]", ''Mathematische-Basteleien.de''. "The first impression is that every piece has two hinges like the Jacob's ladder toy. This is partly right. The mechanism is more complicated however." Accessed May, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but with plastic filaments run diagonally across squares, with the result that the squares can hinge along either of two ''adjacent'' sides.

{{quote|In Fig. 2 are shown the three upper blocks of the series, 1, 2, and 3, and their connecting tapes, the blocks being represented as transparent and separated from each other a short distance to show the arrangement of the connections. Block 1 has attached to it three tapes, ''a'', ''b'', ''b''. The tape, ''a'', is attached to the face of the block at the center, at the upper end, and extends over the rounded end of this block and under the rounded end of block 2. The tapes, ''b'', ''b'', are attached to the face of block 1, extending downwardly under the lower end of this block and upwardly over the upper end of block 2. The tape, ''a'', which is attached to the center of the upper face of block 2, extends over the end of this block, downward underneath, the block, and over the upper end of block 3, where it is secured. This arrangement of tapes is observed throughout the entire series.|''Scientific American''&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;}}

In [[woodworking]], a '''knee''' is a natural or cut, curved piece of wood.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0)
Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Knees, sometimes called ships knees, are a common form of bracing in [[boat building]] and occasionally in [[timber framing]]. A [[rafter|knee rafter]] in carpentry is a bent rafter used to gain head room in an attic.

==Strength characteristics==
Wood is a highly [[anisotropic]] material (its strength varies considerably with the direction of applied force, i.e. parallel, radial, or tangential to the grain).  Because wood is strongest when loaded in tension or compression along the grain, the best knees are those in which the wood grain follows the bend. For a knee with relatively little bend, it may be possible to cut the knee out of a single straight-grained board and still achieve sufficient strength.  However, with increasing bend this method becomes problematic since more and more of the knee is aligned across the grain and is therefore considerably weaker.  A knee laid out this way might easily snap in two under hand pressure alone, even if it is generously sized.  In boat joinery constantly subject to shock and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] loading this method is unsuitable.

To avoid this issue knees requiring sharper curves are made using methods which ensure that the wood grain and direction of load are closely aligned.  This can be achieved by [[steam bending]], [[laminating]], or selecting a natural crook with matching grain - a "grown knee".  Grown knees are generally considered as the "best" method among boat builders and have a strong traditions associated with their use, but they may not achieve the same strength as a good laminated knee.

==Types==
'''Bent''' - Bent knees&lt;ref&gt;John Griffiths, mfg.. Bent timber ships and universal wood bending machinery. Philadelphia 1876. https://books.google.com/books?id=d-0OAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; are formed by plasticizing the wood to make it flexible via boiling, steaming, or microwaving (for small components).  While still hot, the wood can be bent into a shape suitable for the location - either on a form or by forcing and securing it directly into the final service location.  Steam-bending is a time-honored method for shaping boat frames, but it does weaken the wood slightly, it can leave residual stresses which may cause breakage or spring-back over time, and it is limited in the degree of bend which it can achieve, particularly for thick members.  Also, not all species of wood steam bend well.

'''Laminated''' - Laminated knees are formed by coating thin, flexible strips of wood with adhesive, layering them to achieve the required thickness, then forcing the desired bend into the layup and securing it until the adhesive sets.  Laminated knees are very strong and can be made in shapes which would be difficult to achieve using other methods, but they require time for the adhesive to cure, they are messier to construct, and they must use a jig or fixture to secure them until the adhesive cures. 
 
'''Grown''' - The term "grown knees" refers to any knee which is made from a natural crook or bend in a tree.  Grown knees can be taken from several locations within a tree, with the most common being the intersection of the trunk and a large branch{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, crotches, and the roots.  The roots are a particularly useful source as the root structure of many species of trees naturally spreads out laterally just beneath the ground in order to help anchor the tree.  This provides a fairly reliable source of approximately 90 degree crooks which may be impossible to find in other portions of the tree.  In order to obtain this raw material for knees builders may dig up a stump in its entirety, as unlike other portions of the tree, it is impossible to judge the quality and quantity of available material in the roots as they are underground.  Once the stump has been dug up the knees can be sawn or split from suitable natural crooks.  However, knees sawn from a stump can quickly dull tools used to shape and finish them - as the roots grow they envelop small particles of soil and rock, which acts as an embedded abrasive and accelerates the wear of edged tools.  For species of wood with appropriate splitting characteristics, such as oak, the stump can be split into wedges, with one large root on each wedge; each wedge is then carved into a [[rib]] for a small boat.
In principle [[tree shaping]] could be used to grow a tree into the desired shape.

==Terminology==
A sharp bend in a piece of wood is also called "cranked". Commonly used in shipbuilding known as ship’s knee for their advantage of reducing the encroachment into the usable space of the structure since there is no [[spandrel]]. Also knee rafter increases the usable space in an attic by creating a kneewall-like space.

A ship’s knee has two parts called the arm (shorter) and a body (longer). The outside surfaces come to a corner, (typically 90 degrees in buildings) called the heel. The inside surface retains its natural shape and the curve is called the bosom. The thickness between the heel and bosom is the throat. The ends of the arm and body are the toes.

The names of ship’s knees are based on their position:&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Delavan Wilson. ''An Outline of Ship Building, Theoretical and Practical''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Son, 15 Astor Place, 1873. https://books.google.com/books?id=q8BGvRlCZ8cC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman Gee, ''Joiner’s Quarterly'' #36, 17, 19&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hanging knee, the arm is down;
* Standing~, the arm is up;
* Lodging~, the arm is sideways;
* Boson~ or lap~, (unclear); 
* Quarter~, quarter sawn thus smaller but without the pith (center of the tree rings) so less prone to checking;
* Dagger~  In shipbuilding, typically a hanging knee set slightly off diagonally to clear an obstruction such as a gunport in a fighting ship. From "Building the Wooden Fighting Ship" Dodds and Moore 1984

Knees can be blind pegged with foxtail wedges on both ends or bolted in place.

==Favored species of wood==
Due to tradition, ease of workability, strength and durability characteristics, some species of wood are particularly prized for making knees. [[Tamarack]] (also known as [[hackmatack]]) stumps are among the preferred [[softwood]] species for grown knees, while [[white oak]], [[live oak]], and [[elm]] are preferred for [[hardwoods]] for bent knees due to their ease of steam bending.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75322">'''Langbeinites''' are a family of crystalline substances based on the structure of [[langbeinite]] with general formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is a large univalent cation such as [[potassium]], [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], or ammonium), and M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; is a small divalent cation for example ([[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]] or [[cadmium]]). The sulfate group, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, can be substituted by other tetrahedral anions with a double negative charge such as [[tetrafluoroberyllate]] BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[selenate]] (SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[chromate]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[molybdate]] (MO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), or [[tungstate]]s. Although [[monofluorophosphate]]s are predicted, they have not been described. By redistributing charges other anions with the same shape such as [[phosphate]] also form langbeinite structures. In these the M&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; atom must have a greater charge to balance the extra three negative charges.

At higher temperatures the crystal structure is cubic P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;3.&lt;ref name="Norberg"/&gt; However, the crystal structure may change to lower symmetries at lower temperatures, for example, P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, P1, or P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Norberg"/&gt; Usually this temperature is well below room temperature, but in a few cases the substance must be heated to acquire the cubic structure.

==Crystal structure==
The crystal structures of langbeinites consist of a network of oxygen vertex-connected tetrahedral polyanions (such as sulfate) and distorted metal ion-oxygen octahedra.&lt;ref name=Kum15/&gt; The unit cell contains four formula units. In the cubic form the tetrahedral anions are slightly rotated from the main crystal axes. When cooled, this rotation disappears and the tetrahedra align, resulting in lower energy as well as lower crystal symmetry.

At higher temperatures the crystals take on [[Cubic crystal system|cubic form]], whereas at the lowest temperatures they can transform to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic crystal group]].  For some types there are two more phases, and as the crystal is cooled it goes from cubic, to [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]], to [[Triclinic crystal system|triclinic]]  to orthorhombic.  This change to higher symmetry on cooling is very unusual in solids.&lt;ref name="Franke1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franke|first=V.|author2=E. Hegenbarth |author3=B.

==Selenates==
Langbeinite structured double selenates are difficult to make, perhaps because selenate ions arranged around the dication leave space for water, so hydrates crystallise from double selenate solutions.  For example, when ammonia selenate and cadmium selenate solution is crystallized it forms diammonium dicadmium selenate trihydrate: (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;•3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and when heated it loses both water and ammonia to form a [[pyroselenate]] rather than a langeinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martínez|first1=M.L.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=A.|last3=Mestres|first3=L.|last4=Solans|first4=X.|last5=Bocanegra|first5=E.H.|title=Synthesis, crystal structure, and thermal studies of (NH4)2Cd2(SeO4)3·3H2O|journal=Journal of Solid State Chemistry|date=November 1990|volume=89|issue=1|pages=88–93|doi=10.1016/0022-4596(90)90297-B|bibcode=1990JSSCh..89...88M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Few uses have been made of these substances.  Lanbeinite itself can be used as an "organic" fertiliser with potassium, magnesium and sulfur, all needed for plant growth.  Electrooptic devices could be made from some of these crystals, particularly those that have cubic transition temperatures as temperatures above room temperature.  Research continues into this.  Ferroelectric crystals could store information in the location of domain walls.

The phosphate langbeinites are insoluble, stable against heat, and can accommodate a large number of different ions, and have been considered for immobilizing unwanted [[radioactive waste]].&lt;ref name="Orlova2006b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orlova|first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3921">The '''Larson–Miller relation''', also widely known as the '''Larson–Miller parameter''' and often abbreviated '''LMP''', is a parametric relation used to extrapolate experimental data on [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and rupture life of engineering materials.

==Background and usage==

F.R. Larson and J. Miller proposed that creep rate could adequately be described by the [[Arrhenius_equation|Arrhenius type equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;r = A \cdot e^{-\Delta H/(R \cdot T)}&lt;/math&gt;

Where r is the creep process rate, A is a constant, R is the [[universal gas constant]], T is the [[absolute temperature]], and &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]] for the creep process.  Taking the natural log of both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(r) = \ln(A) - \Delta H/(R \cdot T)&lt;/math&gt;

With some rearrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H/R = T \cdot (\ln(A) - \ln(r))&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that creep rate is inversely proportional to time, the equation can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta l/\Delta t = A' \cdot e^{-\Delta H/ ( R \cdot T )}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the natural log:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(\Delta l/\Delta t) = \ln(A') - \Delta H/(R \cdot T)&lt;/math&gt;

After some rearrangement the relation finally becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H/R = T \cdot (B + \ln(\Delta t))&lt;/math&gt;,  where B =  &lt;math&gt;\ln(A'/\Delta l)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is of the same form as the Larson–Miller relation.

:&lt;math&gt;LMP = T \cdot (C + \log(t))&lt;/math&gt;

where the quantity LMP is known as the Larson–Miller parameter.  Using the assumption that activation energy is independent of applied stress, the equation can be used to relate the difference in rupture life to differences in temperature for a given stress.  The material constant C is typically found to be in the range of 20 to 22 for metals when time is expressed in hours and temperature in degrees Rankine.

The Larson–Miller model is used for experimental tests so that results at certain temperatures and stresses can predict rupture lives of time spans that would  be impractical to reproduce in the laboratory.

Expanding the equation as a Taylor series makes the relationship easier to understand.  Only the first terms are kept.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta LMP = \frac{\partial LMP}{\partial T} \cdot \Delta T + \frac{\partial LMP}{\partial \log(t)} \cdot \Delta log(t) +\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial LMP}{\partial T} = 20 + \log(t) \qquad \qquad \frac{\partial LMP}{\partial \log(t)} = T&lt;/math&gt;
Changing the time, by a factor of 10, changes the logarithm by 1 and the LMP changes by an amount equal to the temperature. 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta LMP = \frac{\partial LMP}{\partial \log(t)} \cdot \Delta \log(t) = T \cdot \Delta \log(t) = T \cdot 1 = T &lt;/math&gt;
To get an equal change in LMP by changing the temperature, the temperature needs to be raised or lowered by about 5% of its absolute value.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta LMP = T = \frac{\partial LMP}{\partial T} \cdot \Delta T \qquad \Delta T = \frac{\Delta LMP}{\frac{\partial LMP}{\partial T}} = \frac{T}{(20+\log(t))} \approx \frac{T}{20} =5\% T&lt;/math&gt;
Typically a 5% increase in absolute temperature will increase the rate of creep by a factor of ten.

The equation was developed during the 1950s while Miller and Larson were employed by GE performing research on turbine blade life.

'''MKM steel''', an [[alloy]] containing [[nickel]] and [[aluminum]], was developed in 1931 by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[metallurgist]] [[Tokuhichi Mishima]]. While conducting research into the properties of nickel, Mishima discovered that a strongly [[magnetic]] [[steel]] could be created by adding aluminum to non-magnetic nickel steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokushichi Mishima MK Magnetic Steel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190607/http://www.jpo.go.jp/seido_e/rekishi_e/tokushi_mishima.htm|url=https://www.jpo.go.jp/seido_e/rekishi_e/tokushi_mishima.htm|website=japan Patent Office|archive-date=3 March 2016|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Characteristics==
The developers claim MKM steel is tough and durable, inexpensive to produce, maintains strong [[magnetism]] when [[miniaturized]] and can produce a stable [[magnetic force]] in spite of temperature changes or vibration.  MKM steel is similar to [[Alnico]].{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==Acronym==
MKM is an [[acronym]] for Mitsujima ka magnetic, 'Mitsujima ka' being the name of the inventor's childhood home.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

'''Magnetic semiconductors''' are [[semiconductor material]]s that exhibit both [[ferromagnetism]] (or a similar response) and useful [[semiconductor]] properties.  If implemented in devices, these materials could provide a new type of control of conduction.  Whereas traditional electronics are based on control of [[charge carrier]]s ([[n-type semiconductor|n-]] or [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]), practical magnetic semiconductors would also allow control of quantum [[spin (physics)|spin state]] (up or down).  This would theoretically provide near-total [[spin polarization]] (as opposed to [[iron]] and other metals, which provide only ~50% polarization), which is an important property for [[spintronics]] applications, e.g. [[spin transistor]]s. 

While many traditional magnetic materials, such as [[magnetite]], are also semiconductors (magnetite is a [[semimetal]] semiconductor with [[bandgap]] 0.14 eV), materials scientists generally predict that magnetic semiconductors will only find widespread use if they are similar to well-developed semiconductor materials.  To that end, '''dilute magnetic semiconductors''' ('''DMS''') have recently been a major focus of magnetic semiconductor research.  These are based on traditional semiconductors, but are [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with [[transition metal]]s instead of, or in addition to, electronically active elements. They are of interest because of their unique [[spintronics]] properties with possible technological applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furdyna | first1 = J.K. | year = 1988 | title =  Diluted magnetic semiconductors| url = | journal = J.

[[Hideo Ohno]] and his group at the [[Tohoku University]] were the first to measure [[ferromagnetism]] in transition metal [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] [[compound semiconductors]] such as [[indium arsenide]] and [[gallium arsenide]] doped with [[manganese]] referred to as [[GaMnAs]]. These materials exhibited reasonably high [[Curie temperature]]s (yet below [[room temperature]]) that scales with the concentration of [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] charge carriers. Ever since, ferromagnetic signals have been measured from various semiconductor hosts doped with different transition atoms.

==Theory==
The pioneering work of Dietl ''et al.'' showed that a modified Zener model for magnetism&lt;ref name=dietl&gt;{{cite journal

well describes the carrier dependence, as well as anisotropic properties of [[GaMnAs]].
The same theory also
predicted that room-temperature [[ferromagnetism]] should exist in heavily [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] ZnO and GaN doped by Co and Mn, respectively.
These predictions were followed of a flurry of theoretical and experimental studies of various oxide and nitride semiconductors, 
which apparently seemed to confirm room temperature ferromagnetism in nearly any semiconductor or insulator material 
heavily doped by [[transition metal]] impurities.
However, early [[Density functional theory]] (DFT) studies were clouded by band gap errors and overly delocalized defect levels,
and more advanced DFT studies refute most of the previous predictions of ferromagnetism.&lt;ref name=zunger&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, it has been shown that for most of the oxide based materials studies for magnetic semiconductors
do not exhibit an intrinsic ''carrier-mediated'' ferromagnetism as postulated by Dietl ''et al.''&lt;ref name=coey&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
To date, [[GaMnAs]] remains the only semiconductor material with robust coexistence of ferromagnetism persisting up to rather high Curie temperatures around 100–200 K.

==Materials==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

The manufacturability of the materials depend on the thermal equilibrium [[solubility]] of the [[dopant]] in the base material. E.g., solubility of many dopants in [[zinc oxide]] is high enough to prepare the materials in bulk, while some other materials have so low solubility of dopants that to prepare them with high enough dopant concentration thermal nonequilibrium preparation mechanisms have to be employed, e.g. growth of [[thin film]]s.

Permanent magnetization has been observed in a wide range of semiconductor based materials.
Some of them exhibit a clear correlation between [[carrier density|carrier concentration]] and magnetization,
including the work of
T. Story and co-workers where they demonstrated that the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of [[manganese|Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-doped [[lead tin telluride|Pb&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Te]] can be controlled by the [[carrier density|carrier concentration]].&lt;ref name=story&gt;

The theory proposed by Dietl required [[charge carriers in semiconductors|charge carriers]] in the case of [[electron hole|holes]] to mediate the [[magnetic coupling]] of manganese [[dopant]]s in the prototypical magnetic semiconductor, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped [[GaAs]]. If there is an insufficient hole concentration in the magnetic semiconductor, then the [[Curie temperature]] would be very low or would exhibit only [[paramagnetism]]. However, if the hole concentration is high (&lt;nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), then the [[Curie temperature]] would be higher, between 100–200 K.
&lt;ref name=dietl&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, many of the semiconductor materials studied exhibit a permanent magnetization ''extrinsic'' 
to the semiconductor host material.&lt;ref name=coey&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A lot of the elusive extrinsic ferromagnetism (or ''phantom ferromagnetism'') 
is observed in thin films or nanostructured materials.&lt;ref name=pereira&gt;

The '''Marshall Super Lead''' Model 1959 is a [[guitar amplifier]] head made by [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]]. One of the famous Marshall Plexis, it was introduced in 1965 and with its associated 4×12" cabinets gave rise to the "Marshall stack".

==History==
The 1959 (Marshall's identifying numbers are not years of manufacture) was produced from 1965 to 1981 (when it was replaced by the [[Marshall JCM800|JCM800]]),&lt;ref name="blue"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blue Book of Guitar Amplifiers|first=Zachary R.|title=Blue Book of Guitar Amplifiers|publisher=Alfred Music|year=2008|volume=3|pages=335–36|isbn=978-1-886768-59-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKCYz1WfZCQC&amp;pg=PA335}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an amplifier in Marshall's "Standard" series.&lt;ref name="boehnlein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehnlein|first=John|title=The High Performance Marshall Handbook: A Guide to Great Marshall Amplifier Sounds|publisher=Bold Strummer|year=1998|pages=3–5|isbn=978-0-933224-80-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm00dXNS30IC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Ken Bran and Dudley Craven after [[The Who]]'s guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] asked Marshall for a 100 watt amplifier.&lt;ref name="pittman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pittmann|first=Aspen|title=The Tube Amp Book|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=2003|pages=72–74|isbn=978-0-87930-767-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT1I7Ld76YsC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its output was first channeled into an 8×12" cabinet, but that single, unwieldy cabinet was quickly changed to a pair of 4x12" cabinets, 1960a "angled" on top and 1960b "box" on bottom. creating the famous "Marshall full stack".&lt;ref name="millard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Millard|first=A.J.|title=The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon|publisher=JHU Press|year=2004|pages=155|isbn=978-0-8018-7862-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUlt7Q71_ssC&amp;pg=PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Michael|title=The History of Marshall: The Illustrated Story of "The Sound of Rock"|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=1993|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E90tMBs9_FEC&amp;pg=PA37|isbn=9780793525096}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amplifier also came as a [[Public address|PA]] and a [[Bass guitar|bass]] version.&lt;ref name="blue"/&gt;

The [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Plexiglas]] panel led to the name "Plexi", and while 50-watt models of the time are also called Plexis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molenda|first=Michael|date=June 2008|title=The Homogenization of Rock Guitar Tone|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=42|issue=6|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1959 100 watt model is generally thought of as the "definitive" Plexi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/gear/all/amplification/instrument-amps/guitar-amp-heads/bc-50-head-179578/review|title=Bad Cat BC 50|last=Guppy|first=Nick|date=3 November 2008|publisher=[[MusicRadar]]|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Marshall replaced the Plexiglas panel with one of gold aluminum.&lt;ref name="blue"/&gt; There were other modifications: In 1966, the [[KT66]] tubes of the JTM-models were replaced with [[EL34]]. After 1976, the plate voltages were lowered slightly for improved reliability. But during the 1970s, Marshall's increasing exports overseas led to a problem: Often the EL34 tubes would break during transportation, to the point where amps began being shipped from the factory with more rugged [[Tung-Sol]] [[6550]] tubes, which are "stiffer and not as harmonically rich" as the EL34 tubes.&lt;ref name="pittman"/&gt;

===Reissues===
The amplifier was reissued for the first time in 1988 (the 1959S), and again from 1991 to 1993 (the 1959X) and from 1993 to 1995 (the 1959 SLP).&lt;ref name="blue" /&gt; In 2005, Marshall introduced the 1959 HW (for "hand-wired"), based on the 1967–1969 models, with negative feedback added corresponding to the 1969 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallamps.com/downloads/files/1959HW%20hbk.pdf|title=Marshall 1959HW Owner's Manual|publisher=[[Marshall Amplification]]|pages=1, 3|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amplifier was called "expensive but good".&lt;ref name="balmer" /&gt; ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine called the 1959 "monumentally huge, frightfully loud, and painfully expensive", and its review of the 1959HW said it was "quick, percussive, articulate", and required a "total commitment to volume".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buddingh|first=Terry|date=December 2005|title=Marshall 1959HW Super Lead 100|journal=[[Guitar Player]]|volume=39|issue=12|pages=176–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical specifications==
The 1959 had 100 watts of power, two channels, and four inputs. They were equipped with 4x KT66 tubes, but models made after 1967 had four EL34 tubes instead; it had three [[12AX7|ECC83]] tubes in the [[pre-amplifier|pre-amplification]] stage. A model with [[tremolo]], the 1959T, was available until 1973.&lt;ref name="blue"/&gt;

The amplifier had four inputs into two channels. The lead channel has a boosted bright tone, and the rhythm channel has a flat response. Each channel has a high and a low gain input; the low gain input is attenuated by 6&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="boehnlein"/&gt; The channels can be linked with a jumper cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallamps.com/downloads/files/1959HW%20hbk.pdf|title=Marshall 1959HW Owner's Manual|publisher=[[Marshall Amplification]]|pages=6|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* External links */One of the main arguments of oil analysis is it saves you money as outlined in this page and the other external links. However, the amount of savings is usually quite vague. I came across this cost calculator and so thought I would share and people might find useful.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5773">'''Oil analysis''' (OA) is the laboratory analysis of a [[lubricant]]'s properties, suspended contaminants, and wear debris. ''OA'' is performed during routine [[predictive maintenance]] to provide meaningful and accurate information on lubricant and machine condition. By tracking oil analysis sample results over the life of a particular machine, trends can be established which can help eliminate costly repairs. The study of wear in machinery is called [[tribology]]. Tribologists often perform or interpret oil analysis data.

OA can be divided into three categories:
# analysis of oil properties including those of the base oil and its additives,
# analysis of contaminants,
# analysis of wear debris from machinery,

==Oil sampling==
'''Oil sampling''' is a procedure for collecting a volume of fluid from lubricated or hydraulic machinery for the purpose of oil analysis. Much like collecting forensic evidence at a crime scene, when collecting an oil sample, it is important to ensure that procedures are used to minimize disturbance of the sample during and after the sampling process. Oil samples are typically drawn into a small, clean bottle which is sealed and sent to a laboratory for analysis.

==History==
OA was first used after [[World War II]] by the US [[Rail transport|railroad industry]] to monitor the health of locomotives. In 1946 the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]]'s research laboratory successfully detected [[diesel engine]] problems through [[wear]] metal analysis of used oils. A key factor in their success was the development of the [[spectrograph]], an instrument which replaced several [[wet chemical]] methods for detecting and measuring individual [[chemical element]] such as [[iron]] or [[copper]]. This practice was soon accepted and used extensively throughout the railroad industry.

By 1955 OA had matured to the point that the United States [[Bureau of Naval Weapons]] began a major research program to adopt wear metal analysis for use in aircraft component failure prediction. These studies formed the basis for a [[Joint Oil Analysis Program]] (JOAP) involving all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The JOAP results proved conclusively that increases in component wear could be confirmed by detecting corresponding increases in the wear metal content of the lubricating oil. In 1958 [[Pacific Intermountain Express]] (P.I.E.) was the first trucking company to set up an in-house used oil analysis laboratory to control vehicle maintenance costs which was managed by Bob Herguth. In 1960 the first independent commercial oil analysis laboratory was started by Edward Forgeron in [[Oakland, CA]].

==Standard practices==
In addition to monitoring oil contamination and wear metals, modern usage of OA includes the analysis of the additives in oils to determine if an extended drain interval may be used. Maintenance costs can be reduced using OA to determine the remaining useful life of additives in the oil. By comparing the OA results of new and used oil, a tribologist can determine when an oil must be replaced. Careful analysis might even allow the oil to be "sweetened" to its original additive levels by either adding fresh oil or replenishing additives that were depleted.

Oil analysis professionals and analysts can get certified in compliance with ISO standards by passing exams administered by the International Council for Machinery Lubrication (ICML).

For purposes of Oil Analysis Program (OAP) trend analysis, replacement, replenishment or drain and flush of lubricating fluids in excess of half an engine’s oil capacity (2.5 gallons or more) will be considered an Oil Change and the engine will be placed in code Charlie (C) for three flights to establish a new working trend. Oil-Wetted Maintenance (OWM) is any replacement of engine components within an oil-lubricated system (bearings, gearbox, pumps, etc.). OWM actions shall be documented on DD Form 2026 and submitted to OAP lab for update of Oil Analysis database.
(a)	Special Samples can be requested by the laboratory whenever they feel its necessary.
(b)	Whenever directed by the unit maintenance activity to investigate suspected deficiencies.

The NDI/JOAP laboratory will set the standards and intervals of oil analysis. The AMU will have to deal with it.

A typical [[predictive maintenance]] technique is [[ferrography]], which analyses iron in oil.

Cylance's report was later tacitly acknowledged in a confidential report by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), though Iranian officials denied involvement in the operation.&lt;ref name="Reuters2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/13/us-cybersecurity-iran-fbi-idUSKBN0JQ28Z20141213|editor=Christian Plumb|first=Jim |last=Finkle|title=Exclusive: Iran hackers may target U.S. energy, defense firms, FBI warns|date=December 13, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Cylance report ==
[[File:Operation Cleaver.png|200px|thumbnail|Logo designed by Cylance]]
In December 2014, [[California]]-based cyber security firm [[Cylance Inc.]] published results of a 2-year investigation,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt; an 86-page technical report, indicating that an operation, called "Operation Cleaver", has targeted the military, oil and gas, energy and utilities, transportation, airlines, airports, hospitals and aerospace industries organizations worldwide.&lt;ref name="Tech Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/22160/20141215/operation-cleaver-is-bigger-threat-than-previously-thought-fbi-warns-us-businesses.htm|first= Quinten |last=Plummer|title=Operation Cleaver is Bigger Threat than Previously Thought, FBI Warns US Businesses|date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=Tech Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The title "Operation Cleaver" alludes to frequent uses of the word "cleaver" in the malware's coding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-is-officially-a-real-player-in-the-cyber-war-2014-12|first= Natasha |last=Bertrand|title=Iran Is Officially A Real Player In The Global Cyber War|date=December 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, over 50 entities in 16 countries have been hit by the campaign, based in the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[India]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[England]] among others.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;
Cylance's research does not name individual companies, but ''[[Reuters]]'' reports citing "a person familiar with the research" [[Navy Marine Corps Intranet]], [[Calpine]], [[Saudi Aramco]], [[Pemex]], [[Qatar Airlines]] and [[Korean Air]] were among the specific targets.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Stuart McClure, Cylance founder and CEO believes that the hackers are sponsored by Iran and have ties to [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-02/iran-backed-hackers-target-airports-carriers-report|first= Michael A |last=Riley |first2= Jordan |last2=Robertson |title= Iran-Backed Hackers Target Airports, Carriers: Report |date=December 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== FBI report ==
According to ''[[Reuters]]'', the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] has filed a confidential "Flash" report, providing technical details about malicious software and techniques used in the attacks. The technical document said the hackers typically launch their attacks from two [[IP address]]es that are in Iran, but does not attribute the attacks to the [[Iranian government]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; FBI warned businesses to stay vigilant and to report any suspicious activity spotted on the companies' computer systems.&lt;ref name="Tech Times"/&gt;

== Alleged victims' reaction ==
* A [[Pemex]] spokesman said the company had not detected any attacks from the Iranian groups but was constantly monitoring.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;
* Muhammad Haneef Rana, a spokesman for [[Pakistan International Airline]]s, said he wasn’t aware of any threat from hackers and “We are well secured and our firewall is in place”.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt;
* [[Korean Air]] declined to comment.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"/&gt;
== Iran's reaction ==
Iran has officially denied involvement in the hacking campaign. "This is a baseless and unfounded allegation fabricated to tarnish the [[Iranian government]] image, particularly aimed at hampering [[Comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program|current nuclear talks]]", said Hamid Babaei, spokesman for [[Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations|Permanent mission of Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/02/us-cybersecurity-iran-idUSKCN0JG18I20141202|editor=Richard Valdmanis, Christian Plumb and W Simon|first=Jim |last=Finkle|title=Iran hackers targeted airlines, energy firms: report|date=December 2, 2014 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">'''Oxygenated''' chemical compounds contain [[oxygen]] as a part of their chemical structure. The term usually refers to oxygenated [[fuel]]s. Oxygenates are usually employed as [[gasoline additive]]s to reduce [[carbon monoxide]] and [[soot]] that is created during the burning of the fuel. Compounds related to soot, like polyaromatic hydrocarbons ([[PAHs]]) and [[3-Nitrobenzanthrone|nitrated PAHs]], are reduced also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00102200290021353 | volume=174 | title=Effects of oxygenate additives on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(pahs) and soot formation | journal=Combustion Science and Technology | pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oxygenates commonly used are either [[alcohol]]s or [[ether]]s:
* Alcohols:
** [[Methanol]] (MeOH)
** [[Ethanol]] (EtOH)
** [[Isopropyl alcohol]] (IPA)
** [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]] (BuOH)
** Gasoline grade [[tert-Butanol|''t''-butanol]] (GTBA)
* Ethers:
** [[Methyl tert-butyl ether]] (MTBE)
** [[Tertiary amyl methyl ether|Tert-amyl methyl ether]] (TAME)
** [[Tertiary hexyl methyl ether|Tert-hexyl methyl ether]] (THEME)
** [[ETBE|Ethyl tert-butyl ether]] (ETBE)
** [[Tertiary amyl ethyl ether|Tert-amyl ethyl ether]] (TAEE)
** [[Diisopropyl ether]] (DIPE)

==In the United States==
{{outdated|section|reason=Information seems to stop around 2006/7|date=November 2018}}
In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] had authority to mandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates be added to automotive gasoline on regional and seasonal basis from 1992 until 2006 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, in particular [[ground-level ozone]] and [[smog]]. In addition to this North American automakers have in 2006 and 2007 promoted a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as [[E85]], and their flex-fuel vehicles, ''e.g.'' [[General Motors|GM]]'s "[http://www.livegreengoyellow.com/  Live Green, Go Yellow]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" campaign. U.S. [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards give an artificial 54% fuel efficiency bonus to vehicles capable of running on 85% alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to run on 85% alcohol blends.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also alcohols' intrinsically cleaner combustion, however due to its lower [[energy density]] it is not capable of producing as much energy per gallon as gasoline. Much gasoline{{fact|date=November 2018}} sold in the United States is blended with up to 10% of an oxygenating agent. This is known as oxygenated fuel and often (but not entirely correctly, as there are reformulated gasolines without oxygenate) as reformulated gasoline. Methyl tert(iary)-butyl ether ([[MTBE]]) was the most popular fuel additive in the US, prior to government mandated use of [[ethanol]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">[[File:Pachner Move.png|thumb|2-3 Pachner move: a union of 2 tetrahedra gets decomposed into 3 tetrahedra.]]
In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, '''Pachner moves''', named after Udo Pachner, are ways of replacing a [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of a [[piecewise linear manifold]] by a different triangulation of a [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] manifold. Pachner moves are also called '''bistellar flips'''. Any two triangulations of a piecewise linear manifold are related by a finite sequence of Pachner moves.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[simplex]].   &lt;math&gt;\partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a combinatorial ''n''-sphere with its triangulation as the boundary of the ''n+1''-simplex. 

Given a triangulated piecewise linear ''n''-manifold &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and a co-dimension ''0'' subcomplex &lt;math&gt;C \subset N&lt;/math&gt; together with a simplicial isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : C \to C' \subset \partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the Pachner move on ''N'' associated to ''C'' is the triangulated manifold &lt;math&gt;(N \setminus C) \cup_\phi (\partial \Delta_{n+1} \setminus C')&lt;/math&gt;. By design, this manifold is PL-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; but the isomorphism does not preserve the triangulation.

'''Pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite''' is an oxyfluoride of sulfur in the +6 oxidation state, with a fluorine atom attached to oxygen. The formula is SOF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In standard conditions it is a gas.&lt;ref name=dud&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudley|first1=F. B.|last2=Cady|first2=G. H.|last3=Eggers|first3=D.

==Synthesis==
SOF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can be made by reacting [[thionyl fluoride]] with [[fluorine]] at 200&amp;nbsp;°C with a [[silver difluoride]] catalyst.&lt;ref name="craw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Roger A.|last2=Dudley|first2=Frank B.|last3=Hedberg|first3=Kenneth|title=A Verification of the Molecular Structure of Pentafluorosulfur Hypofluorite (SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OF) by Electron Diffraction|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=October 1959|volume=81|issue=20|pages=5287–5288|doi=10.1021/ja01529a009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SOF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SOF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (+ some SOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

==Properties==
The molecular shape has five fluorine and one oxygen atom arranged around a sulfur atom in an octahedral arrangement. Another fluorine atom is attached to the oxygen in almost a straight line with the S-O connection. So the molecular formula can also be written as SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OF. The average S-F distance is 1.53&amp;nbsp;Å. The angles ∠FSF and ∠FSO are 90°.&lt;ref name="craw"/&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectrum of SOF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compared to SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has a -131.5&amp;nbsp;ppm shift for the hypofluorite fluorine, and 1.75&amp;nbsp;ppm for the opposite F. The other four fluorine atoms have a shift of 3.64&amp;nbsp;ppm. Spin coupling of o-F to SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 17.4&amp;nbsp;Hz, between SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and opposite (apex) SF 155&amp;nbsp;Hz, and between apex and hypofluorite it is 0.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emsley|first1=J.

'''Photophoresis''' denotes the phenomenon that small particles suspended in [[gas]] (aerosols) or [[liquids]] (hydrocolloids) start to migrate when illuminated  by a sufficiently intense beam of [[light]]. The existence of this phenomenon is owed to a non-uniform distribution of temperature of an illuminated particle in a [[fluid]] medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shahram Tehranian et al. 2001. Photophoresis of micrometer-sized particles in the free-molecular regime. International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 44, 1649.&lt;/ref&gt; Separately from photophoresis, in a fluid mixture of different kinds of particles, the migration of some kinds of particles may be due to differences in their absorptions of thermal radiation and other thermal effects collectively known as [[thermophoresis]]. In laser photophoresis, particles migrate once they have a refractive index different from their surrounding  medium. The migration of particles is usually possible when the laser is slightly or not focused. A particle with a higher refractive index compared to its surrounding  molecule moves away from the light source due to momentum transfer from absorbed and scattered light photons. This is referred to as a [[radiation pressure]] force. This force depends on light intensity and particle size but has nothing to do with the surrounding medium. Just like in [[Crookes radiometer]], light can heat up one side and gas molecules bounce from that surface with greater velocity, hence push the particle to the other side. Under certain conditions, with particles of diameter comparable to the wavelength of light, the phenomenon of a negative indirect photophoresis occurs, due to the unequal heat generation on the laser irradiation between the back and front sides of particles, this produces a temperature gradient in the medium around the particle such that molecules at the far side of the particle from the light source may get to heat up more, causing the particle to move towards the light source.&lt;ref&gt;Hitoshi WATARAI et al. 2004.Migration Analysis of Micro-Particles in Liquids Using Microscopically Designed External Fields. Analytical Sciences, Vol 20, p 423.re&lt;/ref&gt;

If the suspended particle is rotating, it will also experience the [[Yarkovsky effect]].

Discovery of photophoresis is usually attributed to [[Felix Ehrenhaft]] in the 1920s, though earlier observations were made by others including [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]].

==Applications of photophoresis==

The applications of photophoresis expand into the various divisions of science, thus physics, chemistry as well as in biology. Photophoresis is applied in particle trapping  and levitation,&lt;ref&gt;M. Rosenberg, D.A. Mendis, D.P. Sheehan.1999. Positively charged dust crystals induced by radiative heating, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci.27, 239-242&lt;/ref&gt; in the field flow fractionation of particles,&lt;ref&gt;V.L. Kononenko, J.K. Shimkus, J.C. Giddings, M.N. Myers. (1997). Feasibility studies on photophoretic effect in field flow fractionation of particles, J. Liquid Chromatogr.  Related Technol. 20, 2907-2929&lt;/ref&gt; in the determination of thermal conductivity and temperature of microscopic grains&lt;ref&gt;X.F. Zhang, E. Bar-Ziv. (1997). A novel approach to determine thermal conductivity of micrometre-sized fuel particles, Combust. Sci.Technol.130, 79-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the  transport of soot  particles in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rohatschek. (1997). Levitation of stratospheric and mesospheric aerosols by gravito-photophoresis, J. Aerosol Sci. 27,467-475.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of light in the separation of particles [[aerosols]] based on their optical properties, makes possible the separation of  organic and inorganic particles of the same [[aerodynamic size]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, photophoresis has been suggested as a chiral sorting mechanism for single walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Smith. (2014). Photophoretic separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes: a novel approach to selective chiral sorting, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2014,16, 5221-5228.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed method would utilise differences in the absorption spectra of semiconducting carbon nanotubes arising from optically excited transitions in electronic structure. If developed the technique would be orders of magnitudes faster than currently established ultracentrifugation techniques.

==Theory of photophoresis==

Direct photophoresis is caused by the transfer of photon momentum to a particle by refraction and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkin, A. 2000 [[IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics]], 6,841-856.&lt;/ref&gt; Movement of particles in the forward direction occurs when the particle is transparent and has an [[index of refraction]] larger compared to its surrounding medium.&lt;ref&gt;C. Helmbrecht, C. Kykal, C. Haisch. Photophoretic Particle Separation in `Institute of Hydrochemistry, Annual report, 2006. p11.&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect photophoresis occurs as a result of an increase in the kinetic energy of molecules when particles absorb incident light only on the irradiated side, thus creating a temperature gradient within the particle. In this situation the surrounding gas layer reaches temperature equilibrium with the surface of the particle. Molecules with higher kinetic energy in the region of higher gas temperature impinge on the particle with greater momenta than molecules in the cold region; this causes a migration of particles in a direction opposite to the surface temperature gradient. The component of the photophoretic force responsible for this phenomenon is called the radiometric force.&lt;ref&gt;YU. I. Yalamov, V. B. Kutukov, and E. R. Shchukin, "Theory of the Photophoretic Motion of the Large-Size Volatile Aerosol Particle," Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, vol. 57, pp. 564-571, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This comes as a result of uneven distribution of radiant energy (source function within a particle).
Indirect photophoretic force depends on the physical properties of the particle and the surrounding medium.

For pressures &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, where the free mean path of the gas is much larger than the characteristic size &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; of the suspended particle (direct photophoresis), the longitudinal force is &lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C. and Husmann, T. (2016). Photophoresis on particles hotter/colder than the ambient gas for the entire range of pressures, Journal of Aerosol Science, 102:55, 10.1016/j.jaerosci.2016.08.013&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{phot} = -\frac{\pi}{3} \, \alpha \, \alpha_\text{m} \frac{p}{\sqrt{\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^\text{out}}\,T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}}} \, r_0^2 \, 	\frac{I\,J_1}{\frac{k}{r_0}+4\sigma_\text{SB}\varepsilon\,T_{\text{black body}}^3} \, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;
where the mean temperature of the scattered gas is (thermal accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, momentum accommodation coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\text{m}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{T_{\text{gas}}^{\text{out}}} = T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}+\alpha\left(T_{\text{black body}}-T_{\text{gas}}^\text{in}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the black body temperature of the particle (net light flux &lt;math&gt;I=\varepsilon\,I_0&lt;/math&gt;, Stefan Boltzmann constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{SB}}&lt;/math&gt;, temperature of the radiation field &lt;math&gt;T_{\text{opt}}&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\text{black body}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{I_0}{4\sigma_{\text{SB}}}+T_{\text{opt}}^4}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal conductivity of the particle.
The asymmetry factor for spheres &lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt; is usually &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; (positive longitudinal photophoresis).
For non-spherical particles, the average force exerted on the particle is given by the same equation where the radius &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is now the radius of the respective volume-equivalent sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Loesche, C., Wurm, G., Teiser, J., Friedrich, J. M., and Bischoff,
A. (2013). Photophoretic Strength on Chondrules. 1. Modeling. Astrophysical Journal, 778(2):101, 10.1088/0004-637X/778/2/101&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronan Point''' was a 22-storey [[tower block]] in Canning Town in [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], East London, which partly collapsed on 16 May 1968, only two months after it had opened. A gas explosion blew out some load-bearing walls, causing the collapse of one entire corner of the building, which killed four people and injured 17. Although there were few casualties the spectacular nature of the failure, caused by both poor design and poor construction, led to a loss of public confidence in high-rise residential buildings, and major changes in UK building regulations resulted.

==Construction==
Ronan Point, named after Deputy Mayor Harry Ronan (a former Chairman of the Housing Committee of the London Borough of Newham), was part of the wave of tower blocks built in the 1960s as cheap, affordable prefabricated housing for inhabitants of [[West Ham]] and other areas of London. The tower was built by [[Taylor Woodrow|Taylor Woodrow Anglian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2514000/2514277.stm|title=	
1968: Three die as tower block collapses|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a technique known as [[Plattenbau|Large Panel System building]] (LPS), which involves casting large concrete prefabricated sections off-site and bolting them together to construct the building. The precast system used was the Danish Larsen &amp; Nielsen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Practical Building Conservation: Concrete |publisher= English Heritage |year= 2013 |pages= 320 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cWBAR0rR_HoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=sv&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= 978-0-7546-4565-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-articles/failure-of-a-high-rise-system.aspx |title= Failure of a High-Rise System |accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction started in 1966 and was completed on 11 March 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/from-the-archive-blog/gallery/2018/may/16/ronan-point-tower-collapse-may-1968 |title=The collapse of Ronan Point, 1968 - in pictures|work=The Guardian|date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collapse==
[[File:Ronan Point collapse closeup.jpg|thumb|The explosion on the 18th floor brought down four flats above it, leading to a progressive collapse of one corner of the block]]
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
At approximately 5:45 am on 16 May 1968, resident Ivy Hodge went into her kitchen in flat 90, a corner flat on the 18th floor of the building, and lit a match to light the gas [[stove]] for a cup of tea. The match sparked a [[gas explosion]] that blew out the [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] flank walls, which had been supporting the four flats above. It is believed that the weaknesses were in the joints connecting the vertical walls to the floor slabs. The flank walls fell away, leaving the floors above unsupported and causing the [[progressive collapse]] of the south-east corner of the building.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.logic4training.co.uk/blog/safety/on-this-day-in-1968/&lt;/ref&gt;

The building had just opened, and three of the four flats immediately above Hodge's were unoccupied. Four of the 260 residents were killed immediately and seventeen were injured, including a young mother who was stranded on a narrow ledge when the rest of her living room disappeared. Hodge survived, despite being blown across the room by the explosion—as did her gas stove, which she took to her new address.

==Griffiths inquiry==
{{anchor|Other defects}}&lt;!-- left in case anything #links here -- but Griffiths inquiry now is the target of one link--&gt;
In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the government commissioned an inquiry, led by [[Hugh Griffiths, Baron Griffiths|Hugh Griffiths]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. It reported on dangers caused by pressure on the walls from explosion, wind, or fire, finding that although the design had complied with the current regulations,
*it was not adequate for even small explosions, as proved by the actual collapse, where lack of injury to the person who lit the match demonstrated the pressure had been low
*it was not adequate for expected wind loading, since the wind speeds which the regulations required to be considered were much too low for a tall building—in a high wind, an upper wall panel could be sucked out, leading to collapse similar to the actual collapse
*it was not adequate in a fire, a significant fire could lead to bowing of the structure, followed by collapse as above.&lt;ref name=forensic&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= Norbert J. Delatte Jr |title= Beyond Failure: Forensic Case Studies for Civil Engineers |publisher= American Society of Civil Engineers Publications |year= 2009 |location= Reston, Virginia, USA |pages= 418 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NxyYVuv1jzUC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=ronan+point&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KxstcUvmmR&amp;sig=0DqBjC8RH4AhNzHZoYcEL-PscZw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3b4UU5v8EISShQeFxoGQDQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ronan%20point&amp;f=false |isbn= 978-0-7844-0973-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronan Point was partly rebuilt after the explosion, using strengthened joints designed to deal with those issues, and the [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] were altered to ensure that similar designs would not be permitted in the future. However, public confidence in the safety of residential tower blocks was irreparably shaken,&lt;ref name=modernity&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/heritage/ronan-point |title= Ronan Point |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the public scepticism was later found to be appropriate.&lt;ref name=forensic/&gt;

Some people, including [[Sam Webb (architect)|Sam Webb]], an architect who had given evidence to the Griffiths inquiry, were not satisfied that every issue had been properly investigated. It was later shown that:
*the assumptions made in determining the revised wind loading were inadequate, in that they assumed all windows were closed. However, if the glass in a window had broken, or somebody had gone out leaving a window open, a wall panel could suffer pressure on one side and suction on the other, to an extent that the panels on the upper levels of the building might still be sucked out
*construction defects (failure to build as designed) had left unfilled gaps between floors and walls throughout, hidden only by skirting boards and ceiling paper, which left the building without fire separation (or acoustic separation) between flats. Tall blocks of flats in the UK are permitted relatively narrow staircases because the requirement for full fire separation between floors means that in theory, it is safer for people above the fire to stay in their flats rather than walk down the stairs. (This theory does not hold where the fire separation fails, as happened in the [[Grenfell Tower fire]]). Without fire separation it would be necessary for all people above a fire to escape, which would not be possible using the existing narrow staircases.
*further construction defects had led to the whole weight supported by each wall panel being supported by the panel beneath by two steel rods, instead of being spread evenly along the panel, leading to extremely high stresses that the concrete was not designed to withstand
*the strengthening brackets which had been fitted during the rebuilding were in many cases not properly attached, since they were fastened to hollow-core slabs, and in many cases they had been bolted only to the thin concrete surrounding the cores, which was inadequate to take the stress.&lt;ref name=forensic/&gt;

The concern, most particularly about the fire separation issue, eventually led the council to evacuate the building, and then to [[demolition|demolish]] it in 1986 in a forensic manner (rather than, for example, using explosives). When this was done, the extent of the defects found shocked even some of the activists, such as the architect Sam Webb, who had been lobbying for years that the building was unsafe. On the lower floors, cracks were found in the concrete where it had been point loaded, and it was alleged that the extra pressure on those points during a high wind (such as during the [[Great Storm of 1987]], barely a year after the demolition) would soon have led to building collapse.&lt;ref name=forensic/&gt;

==Effect on legislation==
The partial collapse of Ronan Point led to major changes in building regulations. The first of these came with the 5th Amendment to the [[building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] in 1970. These are now embodied in Part A of the Building Regulations and cover “Disproportionate Collapse”. They require that “the building shall be constructed so that in the event of an accident the building will not suffer collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause”. They specifically cover pressures which may be caused for example by wind forces, explosions (either internal or external), or vehicle incursions, and note that seismic design may occasionally be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Approved Document A - Structure (2004 Edition incorporating 2010 and 2013 amendments) |work= The Building Regulations 2010 |publisher= HM Government |date= September 2013|edition=reprint |url= http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_AD_A_2013.pdf |accessdate= 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the publication of the report the Government brought out interim measures to ensure the safety and integrity of buildings in the event of an explosion. All new buildings of over five storeys constructed after November 1968 were required to be able to resist an explosive force of {{convert|34|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}—the value still used as of 2014. Existing buildings were allowed to resist an explosive force of {{convert|17|kPa|abbr=on}}, provided that the gas supply was removed and flats were refitted for electric cooking and heating. The gas supply was removed from Ronan Point and the other eight blocks on the estate.

It has been said that the location of the explosion, on the fifth floor from the top of the building, was critical to the collapse. If it had been much higher, the lesser momentum of the debris falling onto the floor of the explosion flat would not have caused its collapse, even though it might have sustained some damage, and the progressive collapse of the floors beneath would therefore not have occurred. If it had been much lower, the friction of the joints, under the great weight of the building above, would have prevented the wall panels from blowing out, and there would have been no structural damage at all.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} &lt;!-- The open.edu article seems to say the opposite, but I am not sure. --Mopskatze --&gt;

This may be why no other such collapse had occurred worldwide at the time. Nonetheless, it demonstrated an area of design which had not previously been considered. Many other jurisdictions, including for example the US, have since amended their building codes to require that buildings subject to explosions or other accidents will not collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause.&lt;ref name=forensic/&gt;

Two days after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, John Knapton, emeritus professor of structural engineering at [[Newcastle University]], claimed that regulations which came into force in 1971, following lessons learned from Ronan Point, had improved building structural strength in such a way as to prevent the collapse of the Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/14/grenfell-tower-would-have-collapsed-built-four-years-earlier/|title=Grenfell Tower would have collapsed if built four years earlier, says expert|work=Daily Telegraph|date=14 June 2017|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on housing==
Newham Council voted in 1984 to demolish Ronan Point. All nine blocks on the Freemason Estate, comprising 990 flats, were demolished in 1986 and the area was redeveloped with two-storey houses with gardens.&lt;ref name=modernity/&gt; Many other similar LPS buildings have since been demolished.

The [[Building Research Establishment]] published a series of reports in the 1980s to advise local councils and building owners on checking the structural stability of their LPS blocks. The contents of two of the reports relied on local authorities sending returns in to the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] during 1968 and 1969. This was not exhaustive, with many authorities failing to do so and thus not having their blocks assessed after the issue of interim structural methods by the Ministry in 1968–69. Among these authorities were [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] in London, and [[Birmingham City Council|Birmingham]]. Birmingham owned over 300 LPS blocks, and when these were assessed in 1998 it was found that a number which did not meet 5 psi (34&amp;nbsp;kN/m²) still had a piped gas supply. A number of those blocks were demolished. The London Borough of Southwark owns the largest LPS estate in the UK, the [[Aylesbury Estate]], which has a piped gas supply; it has been questioned{{by whom?|date=November 2016}} whether the structure is strong enough to resist a 5 psi explosion. Southwark Council admitted in 2017 that strengthening work ordered after Ronan Point may not have been carried out on the [[Ledbury Estate]], after structural weaknesses were found that led to the evacuation of four tower blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40891474|title=South London estate to be evacuated over safety fears - BBC News|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a couple of decades of the collapse of Ronan Point, the public's lack of confidence in the LPS construction technique, together with the social problems within such developments, led to the demolition of many [[tower block]]s.&lt;ref name=modernity/&gt;  Despite this many buildings like Ronan Point are still standing, there are at least 1,585 of them and 200 towers with 20 storeys or higher.  There are concerns that problems might emerge as the buildings weaken with age.  Wind, heat and rain affect buildings. Metal bolts expand when they rust and crack the concrete round them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44498608 Ronan Point: a fifty-year building safety problem] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tottenham on the [[Broadwater Farm]] estate two tower blocks, Tangmere House and Northholt House are structurally unsound and could collapse catastrophically if there is a gas explosion or if a vehicle collides with the base.  Both are to be evacuated urgently.  Other buildings in Broadwater Farm also have less serious problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/20/two-tottenham-tower-blocks-at-risk-of-catastrophic-collapse Two Tottenham housing blocks at risk of catastrophic collapse] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In May 2018, 50 years after the partial collapse, Ronan Point was the subject of an experimental documentary film, ‘And then we heard shouts and cries’ by artist Ricky Chambers. Chambers' grandparents and mother had lived in flat 87 on the 18th floor of the tower block at the time of the gas explosion.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/deadly-tower-explosion-fifty-years-12562388#comments-section &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1745">The '''Society for Organizational Learning''' ('''SoL''') is an American organization founded in 1997 by [[Peter Senge]]. It replaced the Center for [[Organizational learning|Organizational Learning]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Since 1999, SoL publishes its own journal, "Reflections". Its European Counterpart is the '''European Consortium for the Learning Organisation''' ('''ECLO'''), established in Brussels in 1990. It was founded by several European multinationals as a response to the US orientated approach of Peter Senge with a special emphasis to the European complexity of regions, nations, history, tradition, etc. Its Journal "The Learner" and its electronic version "eLearner" are among the oldest publications in this field.

==Sustainability Consortium==

SoL has a "Sustainability Consortium" which helps large corporations including [[Unilever]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Seventh Generation Inc.|Seventh Generation]], and [[Schlumberger]] share ideas and tackle common issues related to [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nadya Zhexembayeva]] (May 2007).

'''Stephen Gray''' (December 1666 – 7 February 1736) was an English [[dyeing|dyer]] and [[astronomer]] who was the first to systematically experiment with [[electrical conduction]]. Until his work in 1729 the emphasis had been on the simple generation of [[static electricity|static]] charges and investigations of the static phenomena (electric shocks, plasma glows, etc.).  He also first made the distinction between conduction and insulation, and discovered the action-at-a-distance phenomenon of electrostatic induction.

==Early life==

Gray was born in Canterbury, Kent and after some basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father (and later his elder brother) in the cloth-dyeing trade.  His interests lay with natural science and particularly with astronomy, and he managed to educate himself in these developing disciplines, mainly through wealthy friends in the district who gave him access to their libraries and scientific instruments. Science was very much a rich-man's hobby at this time.

He ground his own lenses and constructed his own telescope, and with this instrument he made a number of minor discoveries (mainly in the area of sunspots), gaining a reputation for accuracy in his observations.  Some of his reports were published by the [[Royal Society]] through the agency of a friend Henry Hunt who was a member of the Society's secretarial staff.

==Introduction to Flamsteed==
Some of this material came to the notice of [[John Flamsteed]] (who was related to some Kent friends of Gray) the first English [[Astronomer Royal]], who was building the new [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. Flamsteed was attempting to construct a detailed and accurate star-map of the heavens, in the hope that this would eventually solve the problem of longitude determination for ocean navigators.  Gray helped him with many of the observations and calculations (possibly without being paid).

Gray and Flamsteed became constant correspondents and friends, and this seems to have created problems for Gray in being accepted formally into the world of science.  Flamsteed was involved in a prolonged dispute (more like a 'heated battle') with Sir [[Isaac Newton]] over access to preliminary star-chart data.  This boiled over and became a factional war in the [[Royal Society]], which Newton dominated (virtually excluding Flamsteed and his associates) for decades.

Gray worked for a while on the second English observatory being built at [[Cambridge]], but it was badly managed by Newton's friend and associate [[Roger Cotes]], and finally the project collapsed leaving Gray with little option but to return to his dyeing trade in Canterbury.  His health was a problem, and before long he was in London assisting Dr [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], an acolyte of Isaac Newton and occasionally one of the Royal Society's demonstrators. Desaguliers acted as a scientific consultant and gave lectures around the country (and on the Continent) about new scientific discoveries: he also ran a boarding house for visiting gentlemen with scientific interests. Gray was not paid by Desaguliers, but provided with accommodation in exchange for his ability to discuss scientific subjects with the boarders.

Desaguliers' boarding house was demolished to make way for [[Westminster Bridge]], and poverty intervened for Gray. In 1720, through the efforts of John Flamsteed and [[Sir Hans Sloane]] (later President of the Royal Society) he managed to obtain a pensioned position at the [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]] in London&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ben-Chaim, 'Gray, Stephen', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; (a home for destitute gentlemen who had served their country), also linked to a boys' school.  During this time he began experimenting again with static electricity, using a glass tube as a friction generator.

==Conduction discoveries==

One night, in his Charterhouse rooms, he noticed that the cork at the end of his tube (needed to keep moisture and dust out) generated an attractive force on small pieces of paper and chaff when the tube was rubbed. Normally the cork would not have carried an electrical charge, but climatic conditions and variations in the materials meant that the cork was accumulating charge. When he extended the cork with a small fir stick plugged into the middle, the charge manifested itself at the end of the stick, and then on an ivory ball (perforated with a hole) he had stuck on the end.  So he tried longer sticks, and finally he added a length of an oily hemp pack-thread connected to the ivory ball. In the process he had discovered that the "electric virtue" was not just a 'static' phenomenon (like a local pin-prick), but rather a fluid-like substance that would carry over distance. The terminating ivory ball would still act to attract light objects in the same way as the electrified glass tube.

Over the next few days he extended the reach of his thread-wire (he only had a short piece of wire, and did not understand the significance of metal as a conductor) and found that it would carry from his balcony down into the courtyard below.  He discovered that electricity would travel around bends in the thread and that it appeared unaffected by gravity. He was also able to transmit charges to metal objects (poker, tongs, kettle, etc.) which were generally regarded in those days as 'non-electrics' because they couldn't generate or hold static charge.  He also discovered that silk would not carry the 'virtue', while the thicker pack-thread and wire could.

Then between 30 June and 2 July 1729 while in Kent he extended this first electrical network and made many new discoveries. On a visit to the Reverend [[Granville Wheler]], (a wealthy friend, member of the Royal Society and Famsteed's relative), the two men extended the conduction experiments through pack-thread laced up and down the length of a large gallery in Wheler's manor house, [[Otterden|Otterden Place]] in [[Kent]]. In the process, Gray and Wheler discovered the importance of insulating their thread 'conductor' from earth contact (the wall of the house) by using silk for suspension.  They noticed that if wire was used to support the pack-thread, all the 'electrical virtue' leaked away.  Initially they thought the difference was due to the relative thicknesses of the silk, thread and wire, but later they realised that silk itself was much less conducting than the wire—so they used only silk to support (and thereby insulate) the hemp pack-thread used as their main conductor.

The next day they dropped the thread from the house tower to the garden and then extended it out across a paddock to a distance of 800 feet using paired garden-stakes with short spans of silk to keep the pack-thread from touching the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. D. Bernal|Bernal, John Desmond]] (1997). ''A History of Classical Physics: From Antiquity to the Quantum'', p. 284. Barnes &amp; Noble Books. {{ISBN|0-7607-0601-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UlTLRUn1sy8C&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;ots=GE3BLzwCgE&amp;dq=hauksbee+electricity&amp;pg=PP1&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=hauksbee%20electricity&amp;f=false |title=Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics |author=Heilbron }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|242–247}}  Wheler reported this to many of his Royal Society friends, and Gray wrote the full details in a letter to [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]].

From these experiments came an understanding of the role played by conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]]).  The French scientists, the [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Abbe Nollet]] and [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay|C.F. du Fay]], visited Gray and Wheler in 1732, saw the experiment, and returned to France where du Fay formulated the first comprehensive theory of electricity called the "two-fluid" theory. This theory was championed by the [[Abbé Nollet]] and accepted by most experimenters in Europe for a time, but later it was refined and then superseded by the ideas of the English experimenters [[John Bevis]] and [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] who were in correspondence with [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s group in [[Philadelphia]].  They jointly devised a theory of a single-fluid/two-states—virtually the super-abundance or absence of one fluid—which Watson later termed positive and negative.  These ideas fitted the facts slightly better than the two-fluid concept, especially after the invention of the [[Leyden Jar]], and so this single-fluid theory eventually prevailed.  We now know that both were almost equally incorrect.

Gray went on to make more electrical discoveries, the most noticeable being electrical induction (creating an electrical charge in a suspended object without contact). This experiment was widely celebrated around Europe as the famous "Flying Boy" demonstration: a boy was suspended on silk cords, and then charged by Gray bringing his rubbed tube (static electric generator) close to the boy's feet, but without touching.  Gray showed that the boy's face and hands still attracted chaff, paper, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Park (1898). ''A History of Electricity (the Intellectual Rise in Electricity) from Antiquity to the Days of Benjamin Franklin'', pp. 470–71. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gray certainly realised that the phenomenon of 'electric virtue' was the same as lightning (as did most experimenters), many years before Franklin (supposedly) flew his kite and the French experimenters Dilibard and Delor captured a charge from lightning in a Leyden Jar.

When Sloane took over the Royal Society on Newton's death, Gray belatedly received the recognition denied him previously.  Gray was too poor to pay the dues so he was not a member of the Royal Society, and many of his experiments had been taken up and became part of the demonstration repertoire of [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]].  There is also a story that he was denied recognition by the Newton faction within the Royal Society because of his links to Flamsteed (who was constantly in dispute with Isaac Newton), but this can be dismissed as highly unlikely: Newton died in March 1727 nearly two years before Gray began his conduction experiments, and Hans Sloan, who ran the Royal Society after Newton's death was a friend and financial supporter of Gray.  The fact is that electricity was not considered that important at the time, and the Society's magazine was not published for a couple of years due to financial constraints.

Sloan took an active part in promoting Gray who received the Royal Society's first [[Copley Medal]] in 1731 for his work on conduction and insulation, and also its second in 1732 for the induction experiments.  In 1732 the Royal Society also admitted him as an honorary member, and he died destitute a few years later in 1736.

==After his death==

Despite the importance of his discoveries (it can be argued that he was the inventor of electrical communications) he received little credit, supposedly because of the factional dispute in the [[Royal Society]], and the dominance of [[Newtonianism]] (which became the Free Masonic 'ideology'). John Desaguliers was far more famous than Gray, and many of the discoveries became attached to the name Desaguliers by virtue of his flamboyant demonstrations.  By the time Gray's priority was publicly recognised, experiments in electricity had moved on and people were interested more in the spectacular feats by Franklin and others in capturing lightning in their Leyden Jars.  So Gray's discoveries tended to look trivial, and for this reason, some historians tend to overlook his work.

There is no monument to Gray, and little recognition of what he achieved in his scientific discoveries.  He is believed to be buried in a common grave in an old London cemetery, in an area reserved for pauper pensioners from the [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]]. In 2017 the School of Physical Sciences at the [[University of Kent]], in Canterbury, initiated the Stephen Gray Lectures in his memory. The first two Lecturers were Dr David H. Clark (2017) and Prof [[Sir Michael Berry]] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Gray Lectures ", School of Physical Sciences at Kent blog, https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/spskent/stephen-gray-lectures/ (accessed 4 July 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''time crystal''' or '''space-time crystal''' is a structure that repeats in [[time]], as well as in [[space]]. Normal three-dimensional  [[crystal]]s have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. A time crystal never reaches [[thermal equilibrium]], as it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017. This state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—it is an open system in [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]].

The idea of a time crystal was first described by [[Nobel laureate]] and [[MIT]] professor [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2012. Later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals. It was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2014 Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically-driven many-body system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Norman Yao et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems. From there, [[Christopher Monroe]] and [[Mikhail Lukin]] independently confirmed this in their labs. Both experiments were published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2017.

==History==
[[File:Frank Wilczek.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel laureate]] [[Frank Wilczek]] at [[University of Paris-Saclay]]]]
The idea of a space-time crystal was first put forward by [[Frank Wilczek]], a professor at [[MIT]] and [[Nobel laureate]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2012}} and {{harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Xiang Zhang, a nanoengineer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his team proposed creating a time crystal in the form of a constantly rotating ring of charged ions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Li et al.|year1=2012a|year2=2012b}}, Wolchover 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Wilczek and Zhang, Patrick Bruno, a theorist at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in [[Grenoble]], France, published several papers in 2013 claiming to show that space-time crystals were impossible. Also later Masaki Oshikawa from the University of Tokyo showed that time crystals would be impossible at their ground state; moreover, he implied that any matter cannot exist in non-equilibrium in its ground state.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Bruno|2013a}} and {{harvp|Bruno|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Thomas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work developed more precise definitions of [[time translation symmetry]]-breaking which ultimately led to a [[No-go theorem|'no-go' proof]] that quantum time crystals in equilibrium are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Nozières|2013}}, {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017|p=1}} and {{harvp|Volovik|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several realizations of time crystals, which avoid the equilibrium no-go arguments, were later proposed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2013b}} and {{harvp|Yoshii et al.|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven system of ultracold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Khemani et al.|2016}} and {{harvp|Else et al.|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour.

Norman Yao at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] studied a different model of time crystals.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017}}, {{Harvp|Richerme|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blueprint was successfully used by two teams: a group led by [[Harvard university|Harvard]]'s [[Mikhail Lukin]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See {{harvp|Choi et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group led by [[Christopher Monroe]] at [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See {{harvp|Zhang et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time translation symmetry==
{{main article|Time translation symmetry}}
Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the [[Noether theorem]].{{sfn|Cao|2004|p=151}}

The basic idea of ''time-translation symmetry'' is that a translation in time has no effect on physical laws, i.e. that the laws of nature that apply today were the same in the past and will be the same in the future.{{sfn|Wilczek|2015|loc=chpt. 3}} This symmetry implies the [[conservation of energy]].{{sfn|Feng|Jin|2005|p=18}}

===Broken symmetry in normal crystals===
{{main article|Crystal symmetry|spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
[[Image:Phonon nu process.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2. Normal process (N-process) and Umklapp process (U-process). While the N-process conserves total [[phonon]] momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum.]] Normal crystals exhibit ''broken translation symmetry'':  they have repeated patterns in space, and are not invariant under arbitrary translations or rotations. The laws of physics are unchanged by arbitrary translations and rotations. However, if we hold fixed the atoms of a crystal, the dynamics of electrons or other particles in the crystal depends on how it moves relative to the crystal, and particles' momentum can change by interacting with the atoms of a crystal — for example in [[Umklapp process]]es.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=193}} [[Quasimomentum]], however, is conserved in a perfect crystal.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=191}}

===Broken symmetry in time crystals===
Time crystals seem to break ''time-translation symmetry,'' and have repeated patterns in time. Fields or particles may change their energy by interacting with a time crystal, just as they can change their momentum by interacting with a spatial crystal.

==Thermodynamics==
Time crystals do not violate the laws of thermodynamics: energy in the overall system is conserved, such a crystal does not spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work, and it cannot serve as a perpetual store of work.  But it may change perpetually in a fixed pattern in time for as long as the system can be maintained.

It has been proven that a time crystal cannot exist in thermal equilibrium.  Recent years have seen more studies of non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
In October 2016, Christopher Monroe at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] claimed to have created the world's first discrete time crystal. Using the idea from Yao's proposal, his team trapped a chain of [[Ytterbium-171|&lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ([[ytterbium]]) ions in a [[Paul trap]], confined by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. One of the two [[Spin quantum number|spin states]] was selected by a pair of laser beams. The lasers were pulsed, with the shape of the pulse controlled by an [[acousto-optic modulator]], using the [[Tukey window]] to avoid too much energy at the wrong optical frequency. The [[hyperfine]] electron states in that setup, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; |F=0, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩ and |F = 1, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩, have very close energy levels, separated by 12.642831&amp;nbsp;GHz. Ten [[Doppler cooling|Doppler-cooled]] ions were placed in a line 0.025&amp;nbsp;mm long and coupled together.

The researchers observed a subharmonic oscillation of the drive. The experiment showed "rigidity" of the time crystal, where the oscillation frequency remained unchanged even when the time crystal was perturbed, and that it gained a frequency of its own and vibrated according to it (rather than only the frequency of the drive). However, once the perturbation or frequency of vibration grew too strong, the time crystal "melted" and lost this subharmonic oscillation, and it returned to the same state as before where it moved only with the induced frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later in 2016, [[Mikhail Lukin]] at Harvard also reported the creation of a driven time crystal. His group used a [[diamond]] crystal doped with a high concentration of [[nitrogen-vacancy center]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|coherence]]. This strongly-interacting dipolar spin system was driven with microwave fields, and the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field was determine. It was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] response to the drive frequency is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
