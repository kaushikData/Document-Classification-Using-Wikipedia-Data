'''Aggressive driving''' is defined by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] as the behaviour of an individual who "commits a combination of moving traffic offences so as to endanger other persons or property."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/Aggressive|title=Aggressive Driving {{!}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|website=www.nhtsa.gov|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behaviours associated  ==
By definition, aggressive driving is 'committing unprovoked attacks on other drivers', attacks such as not yielding to  vehicles wishing to pass. 
The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) has implemented the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]], &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS|title=Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) {{!}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|website=www.nhtsa.gov|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identifies actions that would fall under the category of aggressive driving, including:  
* Following improperly / [[tailgating]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Improper or erratic lane changing &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Illegal driving on a road shoulder, in a ditch, or on a [[sidewalk]] or median.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Passing where prohibited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Operating the vehicle in an erratic, [[Reckless driving|reckless]], careless, or negligent manner or suddenly changing speeds without changing lanes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Failure to yield [[right of way]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Failure to obey [[traffic sign]]s, [[Traffic signal|traffic control device]]s, or traffic officers, failure to observe safety zone traffic laws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Failure to observe warnings or instructions on vehicle displaying them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Failure to signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Speeding|Driving too fast]] for conditions. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Street racing|Racing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Making an improper turn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects ==
According to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, aggressive driving played a role in 56% of fatal crashes between 2003 and 2007, most of which were attributed to excessive speed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Aggressive driving also negatively impacts the environment as it burns 37% more fuel and produces more toxic fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=David Suzuki's Green Guide|last=Suzuki|first=David|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1-55365-293-9|location=|pages=87|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is Professor of Major Programme Management at [[Oxford University]]'s [[Saïd Business School]] and the first Director of the University's [[BT Group|BT]] Centre for Major Programme Management. He was previously Professor of Planning at [[Aalborg University]], [[Denmark]] and Chair of Infrastructure Policy and Planning at [[Delft University of Technology]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Krak's Who's Who, Copenhagen, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/people/bent-flyvbjerg|title=Bent Flyvbjerg|last=|first=|date=|website=Said Business School, University of Oxford|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412151811/https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/community/people/bent-flyvbjerg|archive-date=2018-04-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a fellow of [[St Anne's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/professor-bent-flyvbjerg&lt;/ref&gt;

Flyvbjerg is the author or editor of 10 books and more than 200 papers in professional journals and edited volumes. His publications have been translated into 19 languages. His research has been covered by Science, The Economist, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The BBC, CNN, Charlie Rose, and many other media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Flyvbjerg received his Ph.D. in [[urban geography]] and planning from [[Aarhus University]], Denmark. He has written extensively about [[megaprojects]], [[decision making]], [[city management]], and [[philosophy of social science]]. He was a member of the Danish Infrastructure Commission and a director of the Danish Court Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Infrastrukturkommissionens betænkning - Transportministeriet|url = http://www.trm.dk/da/publikationer/2008/infrastrukturkommissionens-betaenkning|website = www.trm.dk|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2003|title=Med en "bestyrers" øjne|url=https://www.domstol.dk/om/publikationer/HtmlPublikationer/Danmarks%20Domstole/Danmarks%20Domstole%20nr.%2020/kap06.htm|journal=Danmarks Domstole, No. 20|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091021/https://www.domstol.dk/om/publikationer/HtmlPublikationer/Danmarks%20Domstole/Danmarks%20Domstole%20nr.%2020/kap06.htm|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has twice held the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Scholarship. Bent Flyvbjerg was [[knight]]ed in the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] in 2002.

His research has shown that competition between megaprojects and their sponsors creates political and organizational pressures that leads to the consistent overestimating of project benefits and the underestimating of project costs.  The best megaprojects do not get implemented, but rather the ones that look best on paper. He argues that the ones that look best on paper are the ones for which costs and benefits have been misrepresented the most.

{{Elections}}
'''Boundary delimitation''' (or simply '''delimitation''') is the drawing of boundaries, particularly of electoral [[precincts]], [[Federated state|states]], counties or other municipalities.&lt;ref name = "ACE"&gt;[http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/bd/bd10 Overview of Boundary Delimitation] ACE: The Electoral Knowledge Center. Accessed July 09, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of elections, it can be called [[Redistribution (election)|redistribution]] and is used to prevent unbalance of population across districts.&lt;ref name = "ACE"/&gt; In the [[United States]], it is called [[redistricting]]. Unbalanced or discriminatory delimitation is called "[[gerrymandering]]."&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt; Though there are no internationally agreed processes that guarantee fair delimitation, several organizations, such as the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the [[European Union]] and the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]] have proposed guidelines for effective delimitation.

In international law, the related '''national delimitation''' is the process of legally establishing the outer limits ("borders") of a state within which full territorial or functional sovereignty is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Tanja, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Netherlands, comment in I.F. Dekker, H.H.G. Post, and T.M.C. Asser, ''The Gulf War of 1980-1988: The Iran-Iraq War in International Legal Perspective'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers (1992), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally this is used when referring to the [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]], in which case it is called '''maritime delimitation'''.

==Democratic delimitation==

===Methods===
Countries delimit electoral districts in different ways.&lt;ref name = "ACE"/&gt; Sometimes these are drawn based on traditional boundaries, sometimes based on the physical characteristics of the region and, often, the lines are drawn based on the social, political and cultural contexts of the area.&lt;ref name = "ACE"/&gt; This may need to be done in any form of electoral system even though it is primarily done for [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] or [[majority rule|majority]] electoral system.&lt;ref name ="ACE"/&gt;

These processes of boundary delimitation can have a variety of legal justifications. Often, because of the powerful effects this process can have on [[constituencies]], the legal framework for delimitation is specified in the constitution of a country.&lt;ref name ="IDEA"&gt;[http://www.idea.int/publications/ies/upload/4.%20Boundary%20delimitation,%20districting%20or%20defining%20boundaries%20of%20electoral%20units.pdf Boundary delimitation, districting or defining boundaries of electoral units] a chapter from ''International Electoral Standards: Guidelines for reviewing the legal framework of elections.'' Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Accessed July 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance]] (IDEA) recommends the following pieces of information be included in this legal framework:&lt;ref name = "IDEA"/&gt;
* The frequency of such determination;
* The criteria for such determination;
* The degree of public participation in the process;
* The respective roles of the legislature, judiciary and executive in the process;and
* The ultimate authority for the final determination of the electoral units.

===Established democracies===
{{Main article|Redistribution (election)|Redistricting}}

Delimitation is regularly used in the United States and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries. This is called redistricting or redistribution respectively. In these countries non-partisan commissions may draw new district boundaries based on the distribution of population according to a [[census]].

===International standards===
A number of international organizations including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the European Commission for Democracy Through Law (the [[Venice Commission]]), the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the [[Electoral Institute of Southern Africa]] (EISA) have established standards which their members are encouraged to prescribe to.&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;[http://www.ifes.org/publication/505d087c7a033c8563e67b9fdd45cd78/4%20IFES%20Challenging%20Election%20Norms%20and%20Standards%20WP%20BNDEL.pdf Challenging the Norms and Standards of Election Administration Boundary Delimitation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128013155/http://www.ifes.org/publication/505d087c7a033c8563e67b9fdd45cd78/4%20IFES%20Challenging%20Election%20Norms%20and%20Standards%20WP%20BNDEL.pdf# |date=2008-11-28 }}. IFES, 2007. Accessed July 09, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these standards the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]] (IFES) lists the most common as being Impartiality, Equality, Representativeness, Non-Discrimination and Transparency.&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt;

====Venice Commission====
As part of its report, ''European Commission for Democracy Through Law: Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters, Guidelines and Explanatory Reports adopted October 2002'', the [[Venice Commission]] proposed the following guidelines:&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt;

:2.2 Equal voting power: seats must be evenly distributed between the constituencies.
::i. This must at least apply to elections to lower houses of parliament and regional and [[local elections]]:
::ii. It entails a clear and balanced distribution of seats among constituencies on the basis of one of the following allocation criteria: population, number of resident nationals (including minors), number of registered voters, and possibly the number of people actually voting. An appropriate combination of these criteria may be envisaged.
::iii. The geographical criterion and administrative, or possibly even historical,boundaries may be taken into consideration.
::iv. The permissible departure from the norm should not be more than 10%, and should certainly not exceed 15% except in special circumstances (protection of a concentrated minority, sparsely populated administrative entity).
::v. In order to guarantee equal voting power, the distribution of seats must be reviewed at least every ten years, preferably outside election periods.
::vi. With multimember constituencies, seats should preferably be redistributed without redefining constituency boundaries, which should, where possible, coincide with administrative boundaries.
::vii. When constituency boundaries are redefined—which they must be in a single-member system—it must be done:
:::- impartially;
:::- without detriment to national minorities;
:::- taking account of the opinion of a committee, the majority of whose members are independent; this committee should preferably include a geographer, a sociologist, and a balanced representation of the parties and, if necessary, representatives of national minorities.

====Commonwealth Secretariat====
In the publication ''Good Commonwealth Electoral Practices: A Working Document, June 1997,'' the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] identifies the following practices as necessary for proper delimitation:&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt;

:20. The delimitation of constituency boundaries is a function occasionally performed by an election commission or otherwise by an independent boundaries commission, and in some cases after a population census.

:21. General principles guiding the drawing of constituency boundaries include community of interest, convenience, natural boundaries, existing administrative boundaries and population distribution, including minority groups. There should be no scope for any “gerrymandering”, and each vote should, to the extent possible, be afforded equal value or weight, in recognition of the democratic principle that all those of voting age participate equally in the ballot.

:22. It is important that the general public play a part in the whole process and that the political parties also have an opportunity to respond to proposals before they are finalized. Where the size of a particular constituency is markedly out of line with the target “quota” of voters per seat, the reasons should be capable of being readily understood by both the parties and the general public.

====IFES====
In her study sponsored by the [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]], Dr. [[Lisa Handley]] recommends the following considerations:&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt;
#population density
# ease of transportation and communication
# geographic features
# existing patterns of human settlement
# financial viability and administrative capacity of electoral area
# financial and administrative consequences of boundary determination
# existing boundaries
# community of interest

Also, she suggests that the process should:&lt;ref name = "Challenge"/&gt;
*be managed by an independent and impartial body that is representative of society, comprising persons with the appropriate skills;
*be conducted on the basis of clearly identified criteria such as population, distribution, community of interest, convenience, geographical features and other natural or administrative boundaries;
* be made accessible to the public through a consultation process;
* be devoid of manipulation of electoral boundaries to favour political groups or political interests;
* be conducted by one body;
* include all spheres of government, both national and local.

==National delimitation==
The negotiations surrounding the modification of a state's borders is called National delimitation. This event often takes place as part of the negotiations seeking to end a conflict over resource control, popular loyalties, or political interests.

===Maritime delimitation===
{{main article|Territorial waters}}
The term Maritime delimitation is a form of national delimitation that can be applied to the disputes between nations over maritime claims. An example is found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100215082003/http://www.southchinasea.org/docs/Keyuan%2C%20Zou%2C%20Tonkin%20Gulf%20Maritime%20Boundary%20Delimitation.pdf Maritime Boundary Delimitation in the Gulf of Tonkin]. In international politics, the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs|Office of Legal Affairs]], [[United Nations Secretariat]] is responsible for the collection of all claims to territorial waters.&lt;ref name = DOALSOL&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/ |title = Maritime Space: Maritime Zones and Maritime Delimitation| publisher = UN| accessdate = Nov 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher''' (1786–1855) and '''John Greenwood''' (fl.1821–1840) were brother cartographers who produced large-scale maps of England and Wales in the 1820s. 
Their partnership began in 1821, using  the imprint "C.&amp;J.Greenwood".

Christopher was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, He moved to London in 1818. His first map publication (of Yorkshire) was based on his own surveying. 

In 1759 the [[Royal Society of Arts|Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce]] announced a prize of £1000 for an original survey of England at a scale of one-inch-to-the-mile (approx. 1:63,000). The first recipient of the award was [[Benjamin Donn]] whose map of Devon, completed in 1765, had taken five and a half years to produce. Maps of many counties followed.

The Greenwoods' intention was for a series of maps of the whole country at a one-inch scale. They did not achieve this, largely because of competition from the newly founded [[Ordnance Survey]], but their output includes superb maps that were finely drafted and elegantly engraved. Between 1817 and 1830 they produced a series of splendid large-scale folding maps of most of the counties based on their own surveys.

Their ''Atlas of the Counties of England'' (c.1834) was beautifully engraved and decorated with large vignettes of prominent buildings of the county. The maps were engraved on steel, a more durable medium than copper. Some of them were issued uncoloured, but most are now found with full-wash colour across the body of the map.

Wm Mudge, Royal Artillery, F.R.S. and Captain Thomas Colby, Royal Engineers, in the Trigonometrical Survey of England, by order of the Honourable Board of Ordnance, and surveyed in the years 1815, 1816, &amp; 1817, by C. Greenwood, Wakefield. Leeds, Robinson, Son &amp; Holdsworth, Wakefield, John Hurst &amp; C. Greenwood, 4 June 1817.''

A '''cliff-former''' is a geological unit of [[bedrock]] that is more resistant to [[erosion]] than overlying or underlying [[strata]] and consequently produces [[outcrop]]s with high slope angles.  It is more or less equivalent to ''ridge-former'', and may be contrasted with [[slope-former]].  In humid environments, [[sandstone]]s are typically cliff-formers.  In arid environments, [[limestone]]s are often cliff-formers also.  Recent [[lava]]s may be cliff-formers as well.

In the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] of the eastern [[United States]] the major ridge-formers are the [[Tuscarora Formation|Tuscarora]], [[Pocono Formation|Pocono]], and [[Pottsville Formation|Pottsville]] Formations.&lt;ref name=GSFC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_2/GEO_PLATE_T-12.shtml |title=Geomorphology : Chapter 2 Plate T-12 : Folded Appalachians | date = 2007-01-19 |accessdate=2008-03-16 |publisher= [[NASA]], [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard Earth Sciences]] (GES), Data and Information Services Center (DISC) |first=Steve | last = Kempler|work=|quote=The major ridge makers are the Tuscarora (T), Pocono (Po), and Pottsville (Pt) Formations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreshore''' is an area in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, situated between the historic city centre and the modern [[Port of Cape Town]]. It is built on land [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] from Table Bay in the 1930s and 1940s in connection with the construction of the Duncan Dock to replace the old harbour. Much of the Foreshore area is occupied by transport infrastructure for the port and [[Cape Town Railway Station]]. Other notable buildings in the area are the [[Cape Town Civic Centre]], the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] and the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]]. When the area was reclaimed, the Government undertook a detailed study (the Szlumper Commission) to decide how to utilize the land not needed by South African Railways. This resulted in the issuance of a detailed proposal, The Cape Town Foreshore Plan.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Cape Town Foreshore Plan: Final Report of the Cape Town Foreshore Technical Committee, 1947" (1948, Government Printer of the Union of South Africa).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gereja Ayam''' is a [[place of worship|"prayer house"]] often referred to as a [[church (building)|church]] in the area of [[Magelang]] on the island of [[Java]], [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The structure is constructed in the shape of a [[dove]], but instead reminds many onlookers of a [[chicken|hen]]; hence, the locals have taken to calling it the '''chicken church''', a name by which the building is often known across the internet. 

The building was erected during the 1990s by Daniel Alamsjah, who claimed to have been inspired by God to build a prayer house through a dream he had in 1989.&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akbar|first1=Jay|title=Incredible images of the mysterious abandoned 'Chicken Church' built in the Indonesian jungle by man who had 'a vision from God'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3156330/Incredible-images-mysterious-abandoned-Chicken-Church-built-Indonesian-jungle-man-vision-God.html|website=Dailymail.com|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|accessdate=12 April 2017|ref=mail|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alamsjah is [[Christian]], but envisioned Gereja Ayam as a place to welcome followers of any religion for prayer or meditation.&lt;ref name=dailymail/&gt;

Due to financial difficulties and local resistance, the construction was never finished. The construction was halted in 2000 and the building has since largely been left to deteriorate. In spite of this, in recent years the place has become reasonably frequented by tourists, as well as by couples seeking either to take wedding photographs or to be wed in the building. Besides serving in a religious capacity, the building has also been used to rehabilitate handicapped children or drug addicts, or as an insane asylum.&lt;ref name=dailymail/&gt; Following depictions of the site in several films over the past decade, the church has achieved a level of fame and is now a [[tourist attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pegipegi.com/travel/5-fakta-gereja-ayam-tempat-cinta-dan-rangga-melepas-rindu-di-aadc-2/|title=5 Fakta Gereja Ayam, Tempat Cinta dan Rangga Melepas Rindu di AADC 2|date=2016-05-06|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wartakota.tribunnews.com/2016/06/17/gereja-ayam-tersembunyi-di-balik-hutan-memiliki-misteri-dan-hebohkan-dunia|title=Gereja Ayam Tersembunyi di Balik Hutan Memiliki Misteri dan Hebohkan Dunia|website=Wartakota|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The documentary ''[[Into the Inferno (film)|Into the Inferno]]'' from 2016 devotes a segment to the church. It argues that the church was intended to have a connection with a local volcano, as the head of the dove points in the direction of the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|tt4846318|Into the Inferno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Une(Japanese)(ridge)- between plowed furrows.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Hilling ([[:ja:畝|Japanese Une 畝]]) [[plough]]ed by a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] for [[scallion]]s to increase [[crop yield]]s.]]
'''Hilling''', '''earthing up''' or '''ridging''' is the technique in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] of piling [[soil]] up around the base of a plant. It can be done by hand (usually using a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]]), or with powered machinery, typically a [[tractor]] attachment.

Hilling buries the normally above-ground part of the plant, promoting desired growth.  This may encourage the development of additional [[tuber]]s (as with [[potato]]es), force the plant to grow longer stems ([[leek]]s), or for some crops ([[chicory]], leeks, asparagus etc.) this [[Blanching (horticulture)|blanching]] technique keeps the stems or shoots pale and tender, or influences their taste.

Hilling may also be used to stabilize the stems of crops which are easily disturbed by wind.

==Example==

A common application of hilling is for potatoes. The tubers grow just below the surface, and can produce [[chlorophyll]] and [[solanine]] if exposed to light (green potatoes). Solanine is [[toxic]] in large doses, and can result in [[nausea]], [[headache]], and in rare cases, [[death]]. By hilling one or more times during the [[growing season]] &amp;ndash; effectively, burying the potatoes in an additional few inches of soil &amp;ndash; [[Crop yield|yield]] is improved, and the [[harvest]] remains edible.

'''Integrated Land and Water Information System''' ('''ILWIS''') is a [[geographic information system]] (GIS) and [[remote sensing]] software for both vector and raster processing. Its features include [[digitizing]], editing, analysis and display of data, and production of quality [[map]]s. ILWIS was initially developed and distributed by [[ITC Enschede]] (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation) in the [[Netherlands]] for use by its researchers and students. Since 1 July 2007, it has been released as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Having been used by many students, teachers and researchers for more than two decades, ILWIS is one of the most user-friendly integrated vector and raster software programmes currently available. ILWIS has some very powerful raster analysis modules, a high-precision and flexible vector and point digitizing module, a variety of very practical tools, as well as a great variety of user guides and training modules all available for downloading. The current version is ILWIS 3.8.1.
Similar to the [[GRASS GIS]] in many respects, ILWIS is currently available natively only on [[Microsoft Windows]]. However, a [[Linux]] [[Wine (software)|Wine]] manual has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==History==

In late 1984, ITC was awarded a grant from the [[Foreign relations of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], which led to developing a geographic information system (GIS) which could be used as a tool for [[land use]] planning and [[Drainage basin|watershed management]] studies. By the end of 1988, a [[DOS]] version 1.0 of the Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) was released. Two years later, ILWIS was made commercial with ITC establishing a worldwide distributors network. ILWIS 2.0 for Windows was released at the end of 1996, and ILWIS 3.0 by mid-2001. On 1 January 2004, ILWIS 3.2 was released as a shareware (one-month trial offer). Since July 1, 2007, ILWIS has been distributed as an open source software under GPL license.&lt;ref name=rm1&gt;{{Cite web

==Roadmap==
The next major version of Ilwis will be based on the Ilwis NG framework (in development). This framework aims at being a connection hub between various heterogeneous data and processing sources (local-remote). Integrating them in a consistent way and presenting them in a unified to the end users (at both programming and user interface level). The framework will be cross platform (ILWIS is now limited to Windows only) and will be deployable on mobile devices.

'''ISO 3166-2:AR''' is the entry for [[Argentina]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Argentina, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Argentina|1 city and 23 provinces]]. The city [[Buenos Aires]] is the capital of the country and has special status similar to the provinces.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|AR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Argentina. The second part is a letter, originally used in [[vehicle registration plates of Argentina|vehicle registration plates]] (the letters I and O are not used since they could be mistaken as 1 and 0 respectively and were left out of license plates), and currently used in [[postal codes in Argentina|postal codes]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Jackson Hole National Monument''' was a wildlife reserve in [[Jackson Hole]], most of which is now a part of [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]], United States. It was created by executive order by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1943, and met with considerable opposition from Wyoming legislators. Roosevelt later vetoed a bill that would have disestablished it.  Jackson Hole is named after a fur trapper named [[David Edward Jackson|Davey Jackson]].

A bill merging most of Jackson Hole National Monument (except for its southern extent, which was added to the [[National Elk Refuge]]) into Grand Teton National Park was signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on September 14, 1950. Jackson Hole National Monument then ceased to exist. As a concession to local opposition, the law adding Jackson Hole to Grand Teton also modified the [[Antiquities Act]], limiting the future power of a president to proclaim National Monuments in Wyoming.

[[File:OpenTripPlanner screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of [http://www.opentripplanner.org/ OpenTripPlanner] journey planning application with highlighted route by transit]]
A '''journey planner''', '''trip planner''', or '''route planner''' is a specialised [[search engine]] used to find an optimal means of travelling between two or more given locations, sometimes using more than one [[Mode of transport|transport mode]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zografos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Spitadakis|first2=Vassilis|last3=Androutsopoulos|first3=Konstantinos|date=2008-12-01|title=Integrated Passenger Information System for Multimodal Trip Planning|url=http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/abs/10.3141/2072-03|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board|volume=2072|pages=20–29|doi=10.3141/2072-03|issn=0361-1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches may be optimised on different criteria, for example ''fastest'', ''shortest'', ''fewest changes'', ''cheapest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/Bike-Triangle|title=Bike Triangle {{!}} OpenTripPlanner|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be constrained for example to leave or arrive at a certain time, to avoid certain waypoints, etc. A single journey may use a sequence of several [[modes of transport]], meaning that the system may know about [[public transport]] services as well as [[transport network]]s for private transportation. '''Trip planning''' or '''Journey planning''' is sometimes distinguished from '''route planning''',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49487-6_2|title=Algorithm Engineering|last=Bast|first=Hannah|author1-link=Hannah Bast|last2=Delling|first2=Daniel|last3=Goldberg|first3=Andrew|last4=Müller-Hannemann|first4=Matthias|last5=Pajor|first5=Thomas|last6=Sanders|first6=Peter|last7=Wagner|first7=Dorothea|last8=Werneck|first8=Renato F.|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319494869|editor-last=Kliemann|editor-first=Lasse|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=19–80|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-49487-6_2|editor-last2=Sanders|editor-first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; where route planning is typically thought of as using private modes of transportation such as [[Car|driving]], [[walking]], or [[bicycle|cycling]], normally using a single mode at a time. Trip or Journey planning by contrast would make use of at least one [[public transport]] mode which operates according to [[Public transport timetable|published schedules]]; given that public transport services only depart at specific times (unlike private transport which may leave at any time), an algorithm   must therefore not only find a path to a destination, but seek to optimise it so as to minimise the  waiting time incurred for each leg.

In European Standards such as [[Transmodel]] '''trip planning''' is used specifically to describe the planning of a route for a passenger, to avoid confusion with the completely separate process of planning the operational journeys to be made by public transport vehicles on which such trips are made.

Trip planners have been widely used in the [[travel industry]] since the 1970s by booking agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltecnik.com/2007/12/history-of-global-distribution-systems.html |title=TravelTecnik Consultants - Travel &amp; Hospitality Technology: History of Global Distribution Systems (GDS) |publisher=Traveltecnik.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the [[Internet]], the proliferation of [[Geographic data and information|geospatial data]], and the development of [[Information technology|information technologies]] generally has led to the rapid development of many self-service [[Web browser|browser-based]] on-line [[Intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] trip planners such as [[Rome2rio]], [[Google Transit]], [[FromAtoB.com]]  and [[Door2Door]].

A trip planner may be used in conjunction with ticketing and reservation systems.

== Basic features ==
Journey planners, also known as trip planners,  comprise a front end '''user interface ''' to gather travel requirements from the user and  present the proposed travel itineraries back to them, and a back end '''journey planning engine ''' which performs the actual computation of the  possible trip plans, prioritising these according to the user's optimisation criteria (''fastest, fewest changes, cheapest'', etc.) and returning a subset that best satisfy them.  The user interface may run on a terminal, PC, tablet,  mobile device or even be speech based and may integrate maps and location data to give a visualisation of the trip or to simplify the interaction with the user.  The journey planning engine may be either local or remote and may have either a '''monolithic ''' (all the data in a single search space)  or a '''distributed ''' architecture (the data for different regions split among different engines, each with their own search space).

Simple engines cover only public transport data for a '''single mode ''', others are '''multimodal ''', covering public transport data for several modes; advanced '''intermodal ''' engines may also   include road and footpath routing to cover the access legs to reach the public transport stops and also simultaneously compute routes for travel by private car so that the user may make a comparison between public and private modes.  Advanced trip planners may also make use of real-time data to improve their results; this use may be '''decorative''', annotating the results with information about known incidents that might affect the trip, or '''computational''', dynamically using the predicted departure and arrival times from a real-time feed such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to give more accurate trip plans for trips taking place in the near future.   The capabilities of the back-end engine limit what may be offered in the user interface. The available data limits the capabilities of the back-end engine.

=== Inputs ===
The minimum inputs to a trip planner are an origin and destination place and a  date and time of travel (which can be defaulted to the current moment).  The interface may provide various methods to discover and specify an origin or destination, including specifying  the name of a  [[Geocoding|geocoded place]], a stop or station code, a [[Address (geography)|street address]],  a ''' point of interest ''' (that is, a tourist attraction or other  named common destination) or  a [[Spatial reference system|spatial coordinate]]  (usually specified by using an interactive  [[Web Map Service|web map]] - current locations can also be obtained from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location service or from an IP address lookup).   A location finding function of the trip planner will typically first resolve the origin and destination into the nearest known nodes on the transport network in order to compute a trip plan over its data set of known public transport journeys.

Depending on the journey planning engine and the data sets which are available to it, many other additional inputs may be supported, for example:
* Which [[Mode of transport|transport modes]] to include or exclude.
* Whether to constrain the time of travel by arrival time, departure time - or to allow a  flexible window within which travel may be undertaken.
* Any preferred routing for the trip via intermediate stop points.
* Trip optimisation preferences:  for example ''the shortest trip''  versus ''the fewest changes''.
* Trip cost optimisation preferences: for example, ''the cheapest''  versus ''the most convenient''.
* Accessibility preferences: ''step free, wheelchair accessible'', etc., and whether to allow extra time for connections.
* Access preferences: how long the user is prepared to walk to a stop, etc.
* Class of travel and desired on-board facilities.
* Congestion preferences : ''least crowded '' versus ''shortest trip '', etc.
* Information relevant for selecting fares and the cheapest option: the type of user (''adult, child, senior, student,'' etc.),  ownership of travel cards, etc.
* etc.

=== Outputs ===
After the trip planner has computed and prioritised a trip or set of possible trips, these are presented to the user as a list for the user to choose from, they may also or instead be displayed on a map. Again, depending on the capabilities of the planner and the available data, the results may include;
* The times and departure points of trips from stops or stations, possibly with the exact platform to use and even the boarding point on the platform.
* Trip maps showing the path of the trip legs on a map.
* Route maps showing the network topology.
* Stop area maps and other directions to identify the location of the stops at the boarding and alighting points.
* Information about the heading signs shown on the vehicle in order to identify the correct transport vehicle to take.
* Information on the transfer times needed to make the access and connection legs.
* Step by step directions in order to follow an access leg to a stop, enter a station or large interchange such as an airport, or make a transfer on a connection leg, including the accessibility characteristics of each step.
* Information on the accessibility characteristics of the vehicles on specific legs (''wheelchair hoist, wheelchair spaces'', etc.).
* Information on the at-stop and on-board facilities (''parking, buffet car, wifi,'' etc.).
* Information on disruption or delays expected on specific trip legs or modes.
* Information on available fares for the trip.

=== Additional features ===
Some trip planners integrate information services other than point-to-point trip planning into their user interface, for example to provide timetables for routes,  real-time arrivals and departures at stops, or real-time disruption notices.   Additional visualisations may be offered;  Google, for example, has a [[Gantt chart]] like 'Schedule explorer' that can be used to visualise the relative timings of different trip plans.  Another powerful visualisation is the [[Isochrone map]] which shows relative travel times as relative distances.

A trip  planner may also have more than one [[user interfaces|user interface]], with each optimised for different purposes. For example, online self-service done with a [[Web browser]], an interface for [[call centre]] agents, one for use on mobile devices, or special interfaces for visually impaired users.

Some commercial trip planners include aspects of [[discovery shopping]] for accommodation and activities and [[price comparison]] for some aspects of a trip.

== History ==
=== Antecedents ===
Paper based timetables designed for manual trip  planning on public transport were developed in the 19th century, most notably by [[George Bradshaw]]  who published the [[Bradshaw's Guide]], the world's first compilation of railway timetables] in  1839. This became the definitive guide to UK railway routes and timetables, aggregating the data from the different railway companies into a common format. This served to establish both a standardised data set of stops and services,  a workflow for regularly gathering data from many different providers and updating the data set, and a market for travel information products.  Equivalent publications were developed for other countries.

A theoretical basis for computer-based trip planning was provided in 1956 by Edsger W. [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for finding the [[shortest path problem|shortest paths]] between [[vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] in a [[Graph (abstract data type)|graph]]. [[Graph theory]] itself originates from [[Euler]]'s consideration of a  route planning problem - the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]].

=== Precursor systems ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, national railway operators such as [[British Rail]], [[Deutsche Bahn]]  and major metropolitan transit authorities  [[Transport for London|London Transport]] developed internal systems to manage data for printed timetables and to support operations. National rail operators also developed reservation systems which typically have the ability for ticket offices and retailers to find the trip available between an origin and a destination in order to book a ticket.

A separate development of electronic trip planning capabilities occurred in aviation, starting somewhat earlier as part of the evolution of airline [[Computer reservation system|reservation systems]] concerned with managing airline seating inventory in real-time. The earliest of these systems [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] was launched in 1960 by [[American Airlines]], others included Apollo ([[United Airlines]] (1972) and the rival [[Galileo CRS]]  and [[Amadeus IT Group|Amadeus]]  systems created by different European airline consortia in 1987. All were mainframe-based with remote [[OLTP]] terminals and became widely used by travel agents to find air, rail and boat journeys.

=== First generation systems ===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, some national railway operators and major metropolitan transit authorities developed  their own specialised trip planners to support their customer enquiry services. These typically ran on [[mainframes]]  and were accessed internally with terminals by their own staff in customer information centres, call centres, and at ticket counters in order to answer customer queries.  The data came from the timetable databases used  to publish printed timetables and to manage operations and  some included simple route  planning capabilities. The HAFAs timetable information system developed in 1989 by the German company  &lt;ref name="hacon.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hacon.de/company/geschichte |title=History — HaCon, Fahrplanauskunft HAFAS, Fahrplankonstruktion TPS |publisher=Hacon.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hacon, (now part of Siemens AG) is an example of such a system and was adopted by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB) and [[Deutsche Bahn]] in 1989. The ""Routes"" system of [[London Regional Transport|London Transport, now TfL]], in use before the development of the on-line planner and covering all public transport services in London,  was another example of a mainframe OLTP journey planner and included a large database of tourist attractions and popular destinations in London.

=== Second generation systems ===
In the 1990s with the advent of [personal computers] with sufficient memory and processor power to undertake trip planning (which is relatively expensive computationally in terms of memory and processor requirements), systems were developed that could be installed and run on minicomputers and personal computers. The first digital public transport trip planner systems for a microcomputer was developed by Eduard Tulp, an informatica student at the Amsterdam University on an [[Atari]] PC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2645851/1998/06/05/Succes-voor-het-eerste-06-nummer-zonder-hijgende-dames.dhtml Trouw, 05/06/1998]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was hired by the [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|Dutch Railways]] to built a digital trip  planner for the train services. In 1990 the first digital trip planner for the Dutch Railways (on diskette) was sold to be installed on PC´s and computers for off-line consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9292.nl/extra/175-jaar-reisinformatie# |title=175 years of travel information, chapter:Wel of geen vervoer? |language={{nl icon}} |publisher=9292.nl |date=1992-09-02 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of his software program was published in a Dutch university paper in 1991&lt;ref&gt;http://kinkrsoftware.nl/contrib/Artikel16b.2a/tulp.pdf, Tulp, Eduard, ''Searching time-table networks'', proefschrift [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon expanded to include all public transport in the Netherlands.

Another pioneer was Hans-Jakob Tobler in Switzerland. His product ''Finajour'', which ran for [[PC DOS]] and [[MS-DOS]] was the first electronic timetable for Switzerland. The first published version was sold for the timetable period 1989/1990.&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;Tages-Anzeiger, 14 February 2009, p. 14, ''Hans-Jakob Tobler gestorben''. Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20141231071856/http://www.impulsmittelschule.ch/deu/pressearchiv/37387068.pdf Argus Medienbeobachtung (through archive.org)] (PDF file; 70&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alexandria"&gt;Alexandria. [http://ead.nb.admin.ch/swissbase/f030/n150000/vbs141003.html Entry ''Finajour 1.02'' Sommer 1989].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computerwoche: [https://www.computerwoche.de/a/geschaeft-mit-fahrplandaten,1152144 Schweiz: Fahrpläne im Videotex], 22 September 1989 («''Schon auf den Fahrplanwechsel in diesem Frühjahr war die PC-Version des schweizerischen Zugfahrplans von der Firma Finajour veröffentlicht worden. Inzwischen wurden gut tausend Exemplare zu einem Stückpreis von hundert Franken verkauft.''»)&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries soon followed with their own journey planners.

A further development of this trend was  to deploy trip planners onto even smaller platforms such as mobile devices (for example, HAFAS Pocket&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hacon.de/company/geschichte |title=History — HaCon, Fahrplanauskunft HAFAS, Fahrplankonstruktion TPS |publisher=Hacon.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;),  a [[Windows CE]] version of Hafas was launched in  1998   compressing the application and  the entire railway timetable of Deutsche Bahn into six megabytes and running as a stand-alone application.

=== Early Internet-based systems ===
The development of the internet allowed HTML based user interfaces to be added to allow direct querying of trip planning systems by the general public. A test web interface for HaFAs, was launched as [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s official rail trip planner in 1995 and evolved over time into the main Deutsche Bahn website. In 2001 [[Transport for London]] launched  the  world's first large-scale multimodal trip planner  for a world city  covering all of London's transport modes as well as rail routes to London; this used a trip planning engine supplied by  [https://www.mentz.net] Mentz Gmbh]  of Munich after earlier attempts in the late 1990s  to add a web interface to TfL's  own mainframe internal trip planner failed to scale.  Internet trip planners for major transport networks such as national railways and major cities must sustain very high query rates and so require software architectures optimised to sustain such traffic.  The world's first mobile trip  planner for a large metropolitan area, a WAP based interface to the London using the Mentz engine,  was launched in  2001  by London startup company [[Kizoom Ltd]] , who also launched the UK's first    rail trip planner for the mobile internet in 2000, also as a WAP service, followed by an SMS service.   Starting in 2000 the Traveline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.info |title=Traveline |publisher=Traveline.info |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; service provided all parts of the UK with regional multi-modal trip planning on bus, coach, and rail.  A web-based trip planner for UK rail was  launched by UK [[National Rail Enquiries]] in 2003.

Early public transport trip planners typically required a stop or station to be specified for the endpoints. Some also supported inputting the name of a tourist attraction or other popular destination places by keeping a table of the nearest stop to the destination. This was later extended with  ability to add addresses or  coordinates to offer true point to point planning.

Critical to the development of large-scale multi-modal trip planning in the late 1990s and early 2000s was the development in parallel of standards for encoding stop and schedule data from many different operators and the setting up of workflows to aggregate and distribute data on a regular basis. This is more challenging for modes such as bus and coach, where there tend to a large number of small operators than for rail, which typically involves only a few large operators who have exchange formats and processes already in place in order to operate their networks. In Europe, which has a dense and sophisticated public transport network, the  CEN [[Transmodel] Transmodel reference model for Public Transport] was developed to support the process of creating and harmonising standard formats at both a national and international level.

=== Distributed journey planners ===
In the 2000s, Several major projects developed distributed trip planning architectures to allow the federation of separate trip planners each covering a specific area to create a composite engine covering a very large area.
* The UK [[Transport Direct Portal]] launched in 2004 by the UK Department of Transport,  used the [[JourneyWeb]] protocol to link eight separate regional engines covering data from 140 local transport authorities in  England, Scotland and Wales as a unified engine. The portal integrated both road and public transport planners allowing a comparison between modes of travel times, C02 footprint etc..
* The German Delfi    &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.de/ |title=Was ist DELFI? &amp;#124; DELFI |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Delfi.de |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  project developed a distributed trip planning architecture used to federate the German regional planners, launched as a prototype in 2004. The Interface was further developed by the German TRIAS project and   led to the development  of a CEN Standard  [[&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normes-donnees-tc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/TC 278 WI 00278420 E-RS-170118-final3.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Open API for distributed journey planning']] (CEN/TS 17118:2017) published in 2017 to provide a standard interface to trip planners, incorporating features from JourneyWeb and EU-Spirit and making use of the  [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI Protocol Framework]]  and the  [[Transmodel|Transmodel reference model]].
* The European&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu-spirit.eu/ |title=EU-Spirit &amp;#124; European travel information network |publisher=Eu-spirit.eu |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU Spirit  project developed a long distance trip planner between a number of different European regions

=== Second generation Internet systems ===
Public Transport trip planners proved to be immensely popular (for example by 2005 [[Deutsche Bahn]] was already sustaining &lt;ref name="hacon.de"/&gt; 2.8 million requests per day and journey planning sites constitute some of the highest trafficked information sites in every country that has them.  The ability to purchase tickets for travel for the journeys found has further increased the utility and popularity of the sites; early implementations such as the UK's Trainline offered delivery of tickets by mail; this has been complemented in most European countries by self-service print and mobile fulfillment methods. Internet trip planners now constitute a primary sales channel for most rail and air transport operators.

[[Google]] started to add trip planning capabilities to its product set with a version of Google Transit in 2005,  covering trips in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] region, as described by the [[TriMet]]  agency manager &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bibiana McHugh |url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/ |title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story |publisher=Beyondtransparency.org |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bibiana McHugh. This led to the development of the [[General Transit Feed Specification]] (GTFS), a format for collecting transit data for use in trip planners that has been highly influential in developing an ecosystem of PT data feeds covering many different countries.  The successful uptake of GTFS as an available output format by large operators in many countries has allowed Google to extend its trip planner coverage to many more regions around the world. The Google Transit trip planning capabilities were integrated into the Google Map product in 2012.

Further evolution of trip planning engines has seen the integration of real time data so that trip plans for the immediate future take into account real time delays and disruptions.  The UK  [[National Rail|National Rail Enquiries]] added real time to its rail trip planner in 2007. Also significant has been the integration of other types of data into the trip planning results such as disruption notices, crowding levels, Co2 costs, etc. The trip planners of some major metropolitan cities such as the [[Transport for London]] trip planner have the ability to dynamically suspend individual stations and whole lines so that modified trip plans are produced during major disruptions that omit the unavailable parts of the network.    Another development has been the addition of accessibility data and the ability for algorithms to optimise plans to take into account the requirements of specific disabilities such as wheelchair access.

For the London 2012 Olympics, an enhanced London trip planner was created that allowed the proposed trip results to be biased to manage available capacity across different routes, spreading traffic to less congested routes. Another innovation was the detailed modelling of all the access paths into and out of every Olympic venue, (from PT stop to individual arena entrance)  with predicted and actual queueing times to allow for security checks and other delays being factored into the recommended travel times.

An initiative to develop an open source trip planner, the   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/History/ |title=OpenTripPlanner |publisher=Docs.opentripplanner.org |date=2016-09-09 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open Trip Planner]]  was seeded by Portland, Oregon's transit agency [[TriMet]] in 2009 and developed with the participation of agencies and operators in the USA and Europe; a full version 1.0 released in September 2016, is making it possible for smaller transit agencies and operators to provide trip planning without paying proprietary licence fees.

=== Mobile applications ===
The usability of mobile internet trip planners was transformed by the launch of the [[Apple iPhone]]  in 2007. The iPhone and similar smartphone such as Android allowed more intelligence to be placed in the client as well offering a larger format and maps and so much more usable interfaces could be created. The incorporation of the current spatial location from the mobile device's GPS also simplified some interactions. The first iPhone App for UK rail trip planning was launched by UK Startup [[Kizoom Ltd]]  in 2008 and a large market for trip planning and travel information applications has subsequently developed around the world, with applications being provided both by transport operators and third parties. In the UK this was greatly facilitated by the open data policy of [[Transport for London]] which made its trip planning engine and other data feeds available to third party developers.

Advanced mobile applications such as [[Citymapper]] now integrate multiple types of data feed including trip planning for cities in every continent and give the user a uniform interface regardless of the country or city they are in.

=== Mobility-as-a-Service ===
When bookings and payments are added to a mobile trip planner app, then the result is considered [[Mobility as a Service]] .

==Mode-specific considerations==
=== Public transport routing ===
A '''public transport route planner''' is an [[intermodal journey planner|intermodal]] journey planner, typically accessed via the [[web application|web]] that provides information about available [[public transport]] services. The application prompts a user to input an origin and a destination, and then uses algorithms to find a good route between the two on public transit services. Time of travel may be constrained to either time of departure or arrival and other routing  preferences may be specified as well.

An intermodal journey planner supports [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal journeys]] i.e. using more than one [[modes of transport]], such as cycling, [[rapid transit]], [[bus]], [[ferry]], etc. Many route planners support door-to-door planning while others only work between stops on the [[transport network]], such as stations, [[airport]]s or [[bus stop]]s.

For public transport routing the trip planner is constrained by times of arrival or departure. It may also support different optimisation criteria – for example, ''fastest route, fewest changes, most accessible''.   Optimisation by price (''cheapest, "most flexible fare'', etc.) is usually done by a separate algorithm or engine,  though trip planners that can return fare prices for the trips they find may also offer sorting or filtering of results by price and product type.  For long distance rail and air trip planning, where price is a significant consideration in price optimising trip planners may suggest the cheapest dates to travel for customers are flexible as to travel time.

=== Car routing ===
The planning of road legs is sometimes done by a separate subsystem within a journey planner, but may consider both single mode trip calculations as well as intermodal scenarios (e.g. [[Park and Ride]], [[kiss and ride]], etc.). Typical optimisations for [[car routing]] are ''shortest route'', ''fastest route'', ''cheapest route'' and with constraints for specific ''waypoints.'' Some advanced journey planners can take into account average journey times on road sections, or even real-time predicted average journey times on road sections.

=== Pedestrian routing ===
A journey planner will ideally provide detailed routing for pedestrian access to stops, stations, points of interest etc. This will include options to take into account accessibility requirements for different types of users, for example; 'no steps', 'wheelchair access', 'no lifts', etc.

=== Bicycle routing ===
Some journey planning systems can calculate bicycle routes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoon|first=Ji Won|last2=Pinelli|first2=Fabio|last3=Calabrese|first3=Francesco|date=2012|title=Cityride: A Predictive Bike Sharing Journey Advisor|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6341407/|journal=Mobile Data Management (MDM), 2012 IEEE 13th International Conference|volume=|pages=306–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrating all paths accessible by bicycle and often including additional information like topography, traffic, on-street cycling infrastructure, etc. These systems assume, or allow the user to specify, preferences for quiet or safe roads, minimal elevation change, [[Cycling infrastructure|bicycle lanes]], etc.

== Data requirements ==
Trip planners depend on a number of different types of data and the quality and extent of this data limits their capability.  Some trip planners integrate many different kinds of data from numerous sources. Others may work with one mode only, such as flight itineraries between airports, or using only addresses and the street network for driving directions.

=== Contextual data ===
==== Point of interest data ====
Passengers don't travel because they want to go to a particular station or stop, but because they want to go some destination of interest, such as a sports arena, tourist attraction, shopping centre, park, law court, etc., etc.  Many trip planners allow users to look for such "Points of interest", either by name or by category (''museum, stadium, prison,'' etc.). Data sets of systematically named, geocoded and categorized popular destinations can be obtained commercially, for example, The UK  PointX  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Webb |url=http://www.pointx.co.uk/ |title=Welcome |publisher=PointX |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; data set, or derived from opensource data sets such as [[Open Street Map]]. Major operators such as [[Transport for London]] or [[National Rail]] have historically had well developed sets of such data for use in their Customer Call centres, along with information on the links to the nearest stops.  For points of interest that cover a large area, such as parks, country houses or stadia, a precise geocoding of the entrances is important.

==== Gazetteer data ====
Trip planning user interfaces can be made more usable by integration of [[Gazetteer]] data. This can be associated with stops to assist with stop finding in particular, for example for disambiguation; there are 33 places named Newport in the US and 14 in the UK - a Gazetteer can be used tops distinguish which is which and also in some cases to indicate the relationship of transport interchanges with towns and urban centres that passengers are trying to reach - for example only one of London's five or so Airports is actually in London. Data for this purpose typically comes from additional layers in a map data set such as that provided by [[Esri]], [[Ordnance Survey]], [[Navtech]],  or specific data sets such as the UK [[National Public Transport Gazetteer]].

=== Road data ===
==== Road network data ====
Road trip planners, sometimes referred to as '''route planners''', use street and footpath network data to compute a route using simply the network connectivity (i.e. trips may run at any time and not constrained by a timetable). Such data can come from one or more public, commercial or crowdsourced datasets such as [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]], [[Esri]] or [[OpenStreetMap]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2017CEUS"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309738462_OSMnx_New_Methods_for_Acquiring_Constructing_Analyzing_and_Visualizing_Complex_Street_Networks |author=Boeing, G.|title=OSMnx: New Methods for Acquiring, Constructing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Complex Street Networks|journal=Computers, Environment and Urban Systems|date=2017|volume=65|pages=126–139|accessdate=2017-08-26|doi=10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.05.004|arxiv=1611.01890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data is fundamental both for computing access legs to reach public transport stops, and to compute road trips in their own right. The fundamental representation is a graph of nodes and edges (i.e. points and links).  The data may be further annotated to assist trip planning for different modes;
* '''Road data''' may be characterised by road type (highway, major road, minor road, track, etc.),  turn restrictions,  speed restrictions etc., as well as average travel times at different times of day on different day types (''Weekday, Weekend, Public Holiday,'' etc.), so that accurate travel time predictions can be offered
* '''Cycle road and path data '''  may be annotated with characteristics such as cycle route number,  traffic levels, surface, lighting, etc. that affect its usability by cyclists.
* '''Footpath data ''' may be annotated with accessibility characteristics such as steps, lifts, wheelchair access, ramps, etc., etc., and also safety indicators (e.g. lighting, [[CCTV]], help points, ) so that accessibility constrained trip plans can be computed.

==== Real-time data for roads ====
Advanced road trip planners take into account the real-time state of the network.  They use two main types of feed to do this, obtained from road data services using interfaces such as  [[Datex II]] or  [[Urban Traffic Management and Control|UTMC]].
* '''Situation data ''', which described the incidents, events and planned roadworks in a structured form that can be related to the network; this is used to decorate trip plans and road maps to show current bottlenecks and incident locations.
* '''Link traffic flow data ''', which gives a quantitative measurement of the current flow on each link of the network that is monitored; this can be used to take actual current conditions into account when computing predicted journey times.

=== Public transport data ===
For transit route planners to work, transit schedule data must always be kept up to date. To facilitate data exchange and interoperability between different trip planners, several standard data formats have emerged.

The [[General Transit Feed Specification]], developed in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/|title=Pioneering Open Data Standards: The GTFS Story|website=beyondtransparency.org|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now used by hundreds of transit agencies around the world.

In the European Union all public passenger travel operators have the obligation to provide the information under the EU railway timetable data exchange format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netex-cen.eu/ |title=NeTEx |publisher=Netex-cen.eu |date=2014-03-18 |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6143191/?reload=true |title=SOA architecture for complying with EU railway timetable data exchange format (link in chapter Präsentationen) |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gip.gv.at/downloads-219.html?...Transnational%20exchang |title=Transnational exchange of timetable and GIS data as a basis for cross-border ITS services |publisher=Gip.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world there similar exchange standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.nl/search?q=timetable+data+exchange&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=6FRpWN3BIeiD3gPJpZJQ |title=Transit Schedule Data Exchange Architecture |publisher=Google.nl |date= |accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stop data ====
The location and identity of Public transport access points such as bus, tram and coach stops, stations, airports, ferry landing and ports are fundamental to trip planning and a stop data set is an essential layer of the transport data infrastructure. In order to integrate stops with spatial searches and road routing engines they are [[Geocoding|geocoded]]. In order to integrate them with the timetables and routes they are given a unique identifier within the transport network.  In order to be recognizable to passengers they are given official names and may also have a public short code (for example the three letter [[IATA]] codes for airports)  to use in interfaces.   Historically, different operators quite often used a different identifier for the same stop and stop numbers were not unique within a country or even a region.  Systems for  managing stop data, such as the  [[International Union of Railways|International Union of Railways (UIC)]] station location code set or the  UK's  [[NaPTAN|NaPTAN (National Public Transport Access Point)]] system  for stop numbers provide a means of ensuring numbers are unique and the stops are fully described,   greatly facilitate the integration of data.   Timetable exchange formats, such as [[GTFS]], [[TransXChange]] or [[NeTEx]] include  stop data in their  formats  and spatial data sets such as   [[OpenStreetMap]] allow stop identifiers to be geocoded.

==== Public transport network topology data ====
For public transport networks with a very high frequency of service, such as urban metro cities and inner city bus services, the topology of the network can also be used for route planning,  with an average interval being assumed rather than specific departure times.  Data on the routes of trains and buses is also useful for providing visualisation of results, for example, to plot the route of a train on a map.  National mapping bodies, such as the UK's [[Ordnance Survey]] typically include a Transport layer in their data sets and the European [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] framework includes public transport infrastructure links in its set of strategic digital data.  The CEN [[NeTEx]] format  allows both the physical layer (e.g. road and railway track infrastructure links)  and the logical layer (e.g. links between scheduled stopping points on a given line)  of the transport infrastructure to be exchanged

=== Public transport timetables ===
Data on public transport schedules is used by trip planners to determine the available journeys at specific times. Historically rail data has been widely available in national formats, and many countries also have bus and other mode data in national formats such as [[Association of German Transport Companies|VDV 452]] (Germany),  [[TransXChange]] (UK) and Neptune (France). Schedule data is also increasingly becoming available in international formats such as  [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] and [[NeTEx]]. To allow a route to be projected onto a map,  GTFS allows the specification of a simple shape plot; whilst [[Transmodel]] based standards such as CEN [[NeTEx]], [[TransXChange]] additionally allow  a more detailed representation which can recognize the constituent links and distinguish several different semantic layers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Real-time prediction information for Public Transport ===
Trip planners may be able to incorporate real-time information into their database and consider them in the selection of optimal routes for travel in the immediate future. [[Automatic Vehicle Location|Automatic vehicle location]] (AVL) systems &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; monitor the position of vehicles using [[Global Positioning System|GPS systems]] and can pass on real-time and forecast information to the journey planning system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jing-Quan|last2=Zhou|first2=Kun|last3=Zhang|first3=Liping|last4=Zhang|first4=Wei-Bin|date=2012-04-01|title=A Multimodal Trip Planning System With Real-Time Traffic and Transit Information|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15472450.2012.671708|journal=Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems|volume=16|issue=2|pages=60–69|doi=10.1080/15472450.2012.671708|issn=1547-2450}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trip planner may use a real time interface such as the CEN [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]] to obtain this data.

=== Situation information ===
A situation is a software representation of an incident{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} (for example security alert, cancellation or bad weather) or event that is affecting or is likely to affect the transport network. A trip planner can integrate situation information and use it both to revise its trip planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. A trip planner will typically use a standard interface such as [[Service Interface for Real Time Information|SIRI]], [[TPEG]] or [[Datex II]] to obtain situation information.

Incidents are captured through an [[Incident Capturing System|incident capturing system]] (ICS) by different operators and stakeholders, for example in transport operator control rooms, by broadcasters or by the emergency services. Text and image information can be combined with the trip result. Recent incidents can be considered within the routing as well as visualized in an interactive map.

== Technology ==

Typically journey planners use an efficient in-memory representation of the network and timetable to allow the rapid searching of a large number of paths. Database queries may also be used where the number of nodes needed to compute a journey is small, and to access ancillary information relating to the journey. A single engine may contain the entire transport network, and its schedules, or may allow the [[Distributed computing|distributed computation]] of journeys using a distributed journey planning protocol such as [[JourneyWeb]] or [[Delfi Protocol]]. A journey planning engine may be accessed by different front ends, using a software protocol or [[Application Program Interface|application program interface]] specialised for journey queries, to provide a [[User Interface|user interface]] on different types of device.

The development of journey planning engines has gone hand in hand with the development of data standards for representing the stops, routes and timetables of the network, such as [[TransXChange]], [[NaPTAN]], [[Transmodel]] or [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] that ensure that these fit together. Journey planning algorithms are a classic example of problems in the field of [[Computational complexity theory]]. Real-world implementations involve a tradeoff of computational resources between accuracy, completeness of the answer, and the time required for calculation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The sub-problem of route planning is an easier problem to solve&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-02094-0_7|title=Algorithmics of Large and Complex Networks|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Sanders|first2=Peter|last3=Schultes|first3=Dominik|last4=Wagner|first4=Dorothea|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=|isbn=9783642020933|editor-last=Lerner|editor-first=Jürgen|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|location=|pages=117–139|language=en|chapter=Engineering Route Planning Algorithms|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-02094-0_7|editor-last2=Wagner|editor-first2=Dorothea|editor-last3=Zweig|editor-first3=Katharina A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it generally involves less data and fewer constraints. However, with the development of "road timetables", associating different journey times for road links at different times of day, time of travel is increasingly relevant for route planners as well.

=== Algorithms ===
Journey planners use a [[Routing|routing algorithm]] to search a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]] representing the transport network. In the simplest case where routing is independent of time, the graph uses (directed) [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] to represent street/path segments and [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]] to represent [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. Routing on such a graph can be accomplished effectively using any of a number of routing algorithms such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm|Dijkstra's]], [[A* search algorithm|A*]], [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm|Floyd-Warshall]], or [[Johnson's algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.pgrouting.org/2.0/en/src/index.html#routing-functions|title=Routing Functions — pgRouting Manual (2.0.0)|website=docs.pgrouting.org|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different weightings such as distance, cost or accessibility may be associated with each edge, and sometimes with nodes (e.g. where there are traffic signals).

When time-dependent features such as public transit are included, there are several proposed ways of representing the transport network as a graph and different algorithms may be used such as RAPTOR&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delling|first=Daniel|last2=Pajor|first2=Thomas|last3=Werneck|first3=Renato F.|date=2014-10-30|title=Round-Based Public Transit Routing|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2014.0534|journal=Transportation Science|volume=49|issue=3|pages=591–604|doi=10.1287/trsc.2014.0534|issn=0041-1655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial software==
Distribution companies may incorporate route planning software into their [[fleet management]] systems to optimize route efficiency. A route planning setup for distribution companies will often include GPS tracking capability and advanced reporting features which enable dispatchers to prevent unplanned stops, reduce mileage, and plan more fuel-efficient routes.

'''Kusunti''' (कुसुन्ती) is located in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]] sub-metropolitan city of [[Nepal]]. The area is small and is getting heavily populated in a short period of time. The reason behind this flow of people is the excavation of a large monument of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] with live snakes taking care of this holy area. It is believed that one of the local residents dreamt of the monument being under the earth. Moreover, she told the locals about the order of God to unearth the monument the very next day. This was found to be true and afterwards there occurred a flow of Hindus from all over the country to pay their homage to Lord Shiva. Now there is a beautiful [[temple]] sheltering the statue of Lord Shiva and is famous as Pancheswor Mahadev (पञ्चेश्वर महादेव) throughout the area and around the country.

== Biography ==
Levan Maruashvili was born on [[25 October]], 1912 in the town of [[Novocherkassk]] of the [[Don Host Oblast]], to the family of engineer-Roadbuilder.&lt;ref name="Geo" /&gt; In 1914 the family moved to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In 1919 he entered labor school No 2 in [[Tbilisi]]. From 1926 to 1930 years he studied at Tbilisi hydro-technical school and simultaneously worked as a technician-hydrologist with field detachments, in [[Upper Svaneti]]. From 1932 to 1933 Levan Maruashvili worked in Kazbegi tourist center.&lt;ref name="Kharadze" /&gt; In 1933 he entered the faculty of natural sciences at [[Tbilisi State University]] and at the same time collaborated with the "[[Vecherni Tbilisi]]" and the "[[Zarya Vostoka]]" newspapers as a literary-man. On graduation from the University in 1938 he began working at [[Kutaisi Pedagogical Institute]] as an assistant at the Geographical Department.&lt;ref name="Mar"&gt;Levan Maruashvili (1912-1992). Compiler Zh. Ivanishvili-Maruashvili, editor Z. Tatashidze, N. Pirtskhalava. Tbilisi, Metsniereba, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, when the [[Great Patriotic War]] broke out he joined the field Forces. After graduation from the accelerated courses of Kharkov Commissariat Academy, Levan Maruashvili took part in the battle by the town of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad defending]] the ways leading to the [[Caucasus]]. In 1943-1946 he was in "Stepsgeo" team fighting in high-mountains of the Caucasus and participated in the military-geographical expeditions in South Georgia. Being demobilized from the army in 1946, in a very short time he got ready his dissertation - "Karst of fragmental rock, its geomorphological characteristics in the light of general karstology, Central Megrelia as an example (Western Georgia)" and successfully defended his master's degree in 1947.&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geo"&gt;Geomorphology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], October–December, № 4 - 2002, pp. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1947, Levan Maruashvili worked as an assistant professor at [[Kutaisi Pedagogical Institute]], and from 1949 to 1953 took over the Department of Geography at [[Sokhumi Pedagogical Institute]].&lt;ref name="Kharadze"&gt;Koba Kharadze, [http://www.nplg.gov.ge/ec/en/cart/catalog.html?pft=biblio&amp;from=391&amp;rnum=10&amp;udc=910 The unrivalled authority on nature study: Levan Maruashvili], Tbilisi, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 after defending his Doctor's degree on the subject "South-Georgian volcanic upland (structure, relief, historical development)" he made a great contribution to the study of volcanic areas of Alpine-Mediterranean belt, which has not lost its significance up till now.&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geo" /&gt;

In 1953, he began working at the [[Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography]], [[Georgian Academy of Sciences]]. At first he headed the department of Physical Geography and from then onwards the Departments of Geomorphology and Paleogeography until his death. Almost for half a century Levan Maruashvili travelled a lot over his native land and studied its nature. Almost all the branches of Geographical science were elucidated in his works: [[geomorphology]], [[physical geography]], [[paleogeography]], [[karstology]] and [[speleology]], [[History of geography|history of geographical discoveries]] et al. In his young years he was fond of [[mountaineering]] and conquered tens of peaks and high-mountain passes.&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geo" /&gt;

== Scientific activities ==
He produced over 500 scientific and popular-scientific works in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Russian language]]s, among then there are 30 [[monograph]]s and [[wikt:Special:Search/booklet|booklets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opentext.org.ge/index.php?y=2014&amp;art=1068 Electronic Archive of Georgian Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kharadze" /&gt; The results of his numerous research field - works in the territory of Georgia and other regions of the Caucasus and the Pamirs are given in these works.&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;

Since 1936 Levan Maruashvili began publishing a series of vivid scientific articles in popular natural-scientific journal of Russia the "[[Priroda]]" - "Zonality of the Great Caucasus", "Lava plateau of Keli" (geomorphological survey). "Glaciation of the Great Caucasus", "Abskril Cave", "Disappearance of Siveraut glacier", "Volcanic caves of South Georgia" and many others.&lt;ref name="Kharadze" /&gt; Versatility, breadth of learning, non-stop working ability, great talent displayed in Levan Maruashvili's diverse scientific interests made the basis of his creative work. In 1959, for the first time he began investigation of periglacial forms, defined their high altitude line and peculiarities of spreading of the major forms of peri-glacial formations on the South-Georgian volcanic upland in the [[Caucasus|Central Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Kharadze" /&gt; In the scientific activity of Levan Maruashvili there may be singled out the following basic branches of Geography, in the study of which be made great contributions: Geomorphology of Georgia, Paleogeography of Georgia and the Caucasus (Neogene-Quaternary period), Regional physical Geography of Georgia and the Caucasus, [[Karstology]] and [[speleology]], History of geographical knowledge and travels, [[Rustvelology]] and [[Mountaineering]].&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;

In 1975 and 1980, for the first time there was published in Georgian a three-volume work entitled "Physical Geography of the Caucasus". He introduced a new concept of [[karst-sphere]] into the [[science]].&lt;ref name="Kharadze" /&gt; These and other points were elucidated in the text-book - "Basic of Cave Study: General Speleology" (1973), based on the author's direct observations and analysis of scientific literature. Being the editor in chief Levan Maruashvili took over organization of all field works connected with the fundamental work entitled "Study of Kolkhida Caves" (1978). In 1982 for active participation in producing the "Red Book of Georgia"&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.tsu.ge/index.php?id=186&amp;lang=eng Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography]&lt;/ref&gt; he was awarded the state Prize of the Georgian SSR.&lt;ref name="Mar" /&gt;

In [[geography]], a '''linear settlement''' is a (normally small to medium-sized) settlement or group of buildings that is formed in a long line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68988 English heritage thesaurus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914043943/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68988 |date=2007-09-14 }}, 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many follow a transport route, such as a road, river, or canal though some form due to physical restrictions, such as coastlines, mountains, hills or valleys. Linear settlements may have no obvious centre, such as a road junction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngfl-cymru.org.uk/vtc/settlement_wales/eng/Linearsettlemen/ Linear settlements], 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Linear settlements have a long and narrow shape.

In the case of settlements built along a route, the route predated the settlement, and then the settlement grew up at some way station or feature, growing along the transport route. Often, it is only a single street with houses on either side of the road. [[Mileham]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]] is a good example of this. Later development may add side turnings and districts away from the original main street. Places such as [[Southport]], England developed in this way.

A linear settlement is in contrast with [[ribbon development]], which is the outward spread of an existing [[town]] along a main street.

==Linear villages==
A ''linear village''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/33028%20Outlane geograph, SE0817 : Outlane - a linear village], 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''chain village''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pg.geo.uj.edu.pl/documents/3189230/4676039/2003_112_161-172.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[village]] that is also a linear settlement.

==Biographies==
===Friedrich Wedeking===
Karl Friedrich Wedeking (10 October 1862 – 5 May 1973) was the first German-born person to reach age 110 (as Ella Ille Rentel, who was the first German supercentenarian, was born in Lithuania) and when he died aged 110 years, 207 days, was also the world's oldest living man. He was born in [[Blomberg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Blomberg]] and died in [[Dortmund]]. He was one of the founding members of the gliders club, which was started in 1931 and is still active in Blomberg today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kreis.aw-online.de/kvar/VT/hjb1974/hjb1974.41.htm|title=Einen guten Rotwein bis zum letzten Tag|website=www.kreis.aw-online.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedeking was succeeded as world's oldest living man by [[Frederick Butterfield]].&lt;ref name="WOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Table M - World's Oldest Men (WOM) Titleholders Since 1973|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/m.HTM|work=grg.org |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maria Laqua===
Maria Laqua (12 February 1889 – 9 February 2002) was a German [[supercentenarian]] who was the [[List of the oldest people by country|oldest person]] ever in Germany (as German-born Augusta Holtz lived in the United States) when she died aged 112 years, 362 days, though until 12 October 2018 when her age was surpassed by [[#Gustav Gerneth|Gustav Gerneth]].

Maria Laqua was born in 1889 in Rheydt-[[Odenkirchen]], North Rhine-Westphalia, as one of 13 children. She worked as a housemaid, married and gave birth to two children in the 1920s. Her husband Charles died in 1958. Both of their sons died in the Second World War. Laqua lived for 35 years in a retirement home in [[Bad Hönningen]], Rhineland-Palatinate and died in her sleep on 9 February 2002, just three days before her 113th birthday. She was only survived by a great-niece who attended her regularly. It was reported that Laqua was in need of care, bedridden and inaccessible during her last years. Nevertheless there were also good days when she had a flash and spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article373633/Aelteste-Frau-Deutschlands-gestorben.html|title=Älteste Frau Deutschlands gestorben|date=12 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermann Dörnemann===
'''Hermann Dörnemann''' (27 May 1893 – 2 March 2005) was a German supercentenarian who, at the time of his death, was the oldest living person in Germany since the death of 111-year-old Lina Zimmer on 28 August 2004 and the [[List of supercentenarians by continent#European supercentenarians|oldest living man in Europe]] since the death of 114-year-old Spaniard [[Joan Riudavets]] on 5 March 2004. He was believed to have become the world's oldest living man upon the death of 113-year-old American man Fred H. Hale Sr. on 19 November 2004&lt;ref&gt;https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article118453/Man-darf-im-Leben-alles-nur-nicht-gruebeln.html&lt;/ref&gt; but later Puerto Rican man [[Emiliano Mercado del Toro]], who died aged 115 in January 2007, was confirmed to be almost two years older than Dörnemann.

Dörnemann credited his longevity to "drinking a beer a day".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stern.de/panorama/gesellschaft/hermann-doernemann-ein-leben-in-drei-jahrhunderten-3555102.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dw.com/en/turning-111-on-a-beer-a-day/a-1219106&lt;/ref&gt; He died of pneumonia in [[Düsseldorf]] on 2 March 2005 aged 111 years, 279 days and was the oldest German man ever before being surpassed by Gustav Gerneth on 22 July 2017 (however, Gerneth is still not verified).

===Elisabeth Schneider===
Elisabeth Schneider (19 August 1901 – 9 February 2013) was a German [[supercentenarian]] who was the oldest living person in Germany from the death of Karolina Gröber on 21 November 2011 until her own death on 9 February 2013 at the age of 111 years and 174 days. She was born in [[Bad Oeynhausen]], North Rhine-Westphalia, in 1901 and had two sisters. She married in 1923 and gave birth to a daughter two years later. Schneider lived on her own until the age of 97.

===Gertrud Henze===
Gertrud Henze (8 December 1901 – 22 April 2014) was a German [[supercentenarian]] who had been the oldest living person in Germany from the death of Elisabeth Schneider on 9 February 2013 until her death on 22 April 2014. The former librarian was born on Rügen and never got married or gave birth to a child. She was still in good condition and lived in a retirement home in [[Göttingen]] since 1993 where she was well-liked by many residents for her open and life-affirming attitude. Henze traced her longevity to reading a lot, having lively contact with other people, enjoying sometimes a cigarette and a glass of wine and never marry. She celebrated her 112th birthday only with some friends and relatives because the public interest in consequence of her birthday the year before was too exhausting. She enjoyed reading, even with the help of a magnifying glass. Notwithstanding her physical limitations, Henze was able to walk with the help of a walking frame to meet acquaintances and friends for a chat. Henze died on 22 April 2014 at the age of 112 years and 135 days. She bequeathed her body for genetic research to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/niedersachsen/article111880071/Gertrud-Henze-feiert-111-Geburtstag.html|title=Gertrud Henze feiert 111.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32510">The following is a partial '''list of adjectival forms of place names''' in [[English (language)|English]] '''and their [[demonym]]ic equivalents''', which denote the people or the inhabitants of these places.

Note: [[Demonyms]] are given in plural forms. Singular forms simply remove the final 's' or, in the case of ''-ese'' endings, are the same as the plural forms.
The ending ''-men'' has [[grammatical gender|feminine]] equivalent ''-women'' (e.g. ''an Irishman and a Scotswoman''). The [[French language|French]] terminations ''-ois'' / ''ais'' serve as both the singular and plural [[grammatical gender|masculine]]; adding 'e' (''-oise'' / ''aise'') makes them singular feminine; 'es' (''-oises'' / ''aises'') makes them plural feminine. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] termination "-o" usually denotes the [[grammatical gender|masculine]] and is normally changed to [[grammatical gender|feminine]] by replacing the "-o" with "-a". The plural forms are usually "-os" and "-as" respectively.

Adjectives ending ''-ish'' can be used as collective demonyms (e.g. ''the English, the Cornish'').  So can those ending in ''-ch'' / ''-tch'' (e.g. ''the French'', ''the Dutch'') provided they are pronounced with a 'ch' sound (e.g., the adjective ''Czech'' does not qualify).

Where an adjective is a link, the link is to the [[language]] or [[dialect]] of the same name. (Reference: [http://www.ethnologue.org/ Ethnologue, Languages of the World])

Many place-name adjectives and many demonyms refer also to various other things, sometimes with and sometimes without one or more additional words.  (Sometimes, the use of one or more additional words is optional.)  Notable examples are [[list of cheeses|cheeses]], [[list of cat breeds|cat breeds]], [[list of dog breeds|dog breeds]], and [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]].  (See [[List of words derived from toponyms]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7212">This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[Guam]]''' (a [[Insular area|U.S. territory]]), grouped by type and sorted by location. It contains all public-use and military airports. Some private-use and former airports may be included where notable, such as airports that were previously public-use, those with commercial enplanements recorded by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] or airports assigned an [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] airport code.

{{OnelinerTOC|no-top=y|Airports|See also|References}}

==Airports==
&lt;!-- Note to editors:

(1) Please do not move or remove the onlyinclude tags; they are used to transclude this state's "Commercial Service - Primary" airports in the [[List of airports in the United States]]. Also please do not add columns to the table since all the U.S. state lists are using the same format so that they can be transcluded into a single sortable table.

(2) To compare airport use, enplanement (passenger boarding) figures are taken from a single source and are for the same year. This list currently contains the 2016 enplanement data, updated by the FAA in October 2017. Please do not change the enplanements for individual airports based on data from other sources. If you wish to add such information, please place it in the airport's article, not on this list.

(3) Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled service on commercial airlines. If you change an airport name to bold, please be sure to also add an ==Airlines and destinations== section to the corresponding airport article.

--&gt;
This list contains the following information:

* '''Location''' - The [[List of villages in Guam|village]] or other location generally associated with the airport.
* '''FAA''' - The [[location identifier]] assigned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
* '''IATA''' - The [[International Air Transport Association airport code|airport code]] assigned by the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). Those that do not match the FAA code are shown in bold.
* '''ICAO''' - The [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|location indicator]] assigned by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).
* '''Airport name''' - The official airport name. Those shown in bold indicate the airport has scheduled service on commercial airlines.
* '''Role''' - One of four [[FAA airport categories]], as per the 2017-2021 [[National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems]] (NPIAS) Report and updated based on FAA Passenger Boarding Data:
** P: ''Commercial Service - Primary'' are publicly owned airports that receive scheduled passenger service and have more than 10,000 passenger boardings (''enplanements'') each year. Each primary airport is sub-classified by the FAA as one of the following four "hub" types:
*** L: ''Large Hub'' that accounts for at least 1% of total U.S. passenger enplanements.
*** M: ''Medium Hub'' that accounts for between 0.25% and 1% of total U.S. passenger enplanements.
*** S: ''Small Hub'' that accounts for between 0.05% and 0.25% of total U.S. passenger enplanements.
*** N: ''Non-Hub'' that accounts for less than 0.05% of total U.S. passenger enplanements, but more than 10,000 annual enplanements.
** CS: ''Commercial Service - Non-Primary'' are publicly owned airports that receive scheduled passenger service and have at least 2,500 passenger boardings each year.
** R: ''Reliever'' airports are designated by the FAA to relieve congestion at a large commercial service airport and to provide more general aviation access to the overall community.
** GA: ''[[General Aviation]]'' airports are the largest single group of airports in the U.S. airport system.
* '''Enpl'''. - The number of ''enplanements'' (commercial passenger boardings) that occurred at the airport in [[calendar year]] 2016, as per FAA records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7591">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Palau'''. There are 12 mammal species in [[Palau]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 2 are endangered, 1 is vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened. 1 of the species listed for Palau is considered to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6383">This is a '''list of [[mayor]]s of [[Istanbul]]''', [[Turkey]].

==Ottoman Empire (1453-1923)==

=== During 1453-1858===
In the Ottoman Empire, the duty of municipal government was the responsibility of "''Şehremini''" (''Şehir'': City and ''Emin'': Trustable Person) and local religious judges called "''Kadı''"

The first mayor of Istanbul after the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest]] on May 29, 1453 was Hızırbey Çelebi. Until 1858, the capital of the Ottoman Empire was governed by a total of 422 kadis.

==Tanzimat period 1858-1876==
The idea to establish a municipality organization in a modern way was first discussed in 1854 during the [[Crimean War]] when diplomats and journalists of allied nations came to Istanbul. Later, the parliament accepted a law for the establishment of the office of a mayor (Turkish: Şehremini) and a city council.

Salih Paşa received the first title of Şehremini on July 13, 1858, and governed until November 4, 1858. During the [[Tanzimat]] period, 18 mayors took office.

===First constitutional monarchy 1876-1908===
In 1876, as First constitutional monarchy was proclamated, Kadri Paşa was the mayor of Istanbul. During this period 10 mayors governed Istanbul.

===Second constitutional monarchy 1908-1923===
During the reign of [[Young Turks]] between 1908-1918 and thenafter until the foundation of the republic, 23 mayors served in the capital.

==Republic of Turkey==

=== Governors as mayors 1923-1960===
After the proclamation of the republic on October 29, 1923, the governor of the city was charged with the duties as deputy mayor. With the municipality act of April 3, 1930, the title of mayor was abandoned and the governor of Istanbul province took over the duties of the mayor. The two separate councils of the province and the municipality were unified. The two councils were reestablished on March 1, 1957.

* 9  Kemal Aygün  December 25, 1958 - May 27, 1960

===Mayors during the military rule (1960-1963)===
After the [[coup d'etat]] on May 27, 1960, the military abandoned the mayor and appointed 7 officials until 1963.

===Elected mayors of Istanbul Municipality(1963-1980)===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="933">{{Politics of Palau}}

[[Palau]] currently has no [[political parties]].  It is a de facto [[non-partisan democracy]] since no law prevents the formation of political parties.

The [[Palau Nationalist Party]], which functioned mainly as an electoral vehicle as opposed to an ideological movement, was founded for the 1996 elections. It is believed to no longer exist.

The [[Ta Belau Party]] was formed in 1987, and likewise is not currently active. It supported the presidency of [[Lazarus Salii]], who committed suicide while in office in 1988.

{{Main|Post-nominal letters}}

This is a list of letters after people's names (otherwise referred to here as ''Post-nominal letters'') that have been nominated by orders from government, and letters from Professional associations in [[Australia]].

==General conventions==

In general, postnominals are arranged in the following sequence:&lt;ref&gt;UTS Publication Style guide, with minor input from other sources not listed. http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/publications/styleguide/names.html&lt;/ref&gt;

# National honours, in their designated [[Australian Honours Order of Wearing|order of wearing]],
# Queen's Counsel, Senior Counsel and Justice of the Peace,
# Degrees and diplomas in chronological order,
# Fellowships then memberships of professional and academic bodies,
# Parliamentary and military designations.

Full-stops are never used in postnominals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsu.uts.edu.au/publications/styleguide/names.html.  http://www.kaplanprofessional.edu.au/faqs/using-post-nominals/&lt;/ref&gt;

They operate independently of post-nominals conferred by membership of the organisation at various grades. For example, a Fellow of CILT with CPL accreditation would use the post-nominals FCILT, CPL. If upon retirement the individual chose to keep up membership of CILT, they would use the post-nominal FCILT alone as they would no longer meet the continuing professional development requirements for CPL.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Living Machine is an intensive [[bioremediation]] system that can also produce beneficial byproducts, such as reuse-quality water, ornamental plants and plant products—for building material, energy biomass, animal feed. Aquatic and [[wetland]] plants, [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[protozoa]], [[plankton]], [[snails]] and other organisms are used in the system to provide specific cleansing or trophic functions. The tidal process operates outdoors in tropical and temperate climates. In colder climates, the system of tanks, pipes and filters may be housed in a greenhouse to prevent freezing and raise the rate of biological activity.

The initial development of the technology in the United States is generally credited to Dr. [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], an ecological designer, and evolved out of the [[bioshelter]] concept developed at the now-defunct [[New Alchemy Institute]]. The Living Machine system falls within the emerging discipline of [[ecological engineering]], and many  systems using earlier generations of the technology are built without being dubbed a Living Machine.

==Design theory==
The scale of Living Machine systems ranges from the individual building to community-scale [[public works]]. Some of the earliest Living Machines were used to treat domestic [[wastewater]] in small, [[ecovillages|ecologically-conscious villages]], such as [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn Community]] in [[Scotland]],.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/biological/index.php Ecovillage Findhorn: Biological Waste Water Treatment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210005606/http://www.ecovillagefindhorn.com/biological/index.php |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some treated the mixed municipal wastewater for semi-urban areas, such as [[South Burlington, Vermont]] (this plant closed recently).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/owmitnet/mtb/living_machine.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The latest-generation Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machines are being used in major urban office buildings, military bases, housing developments, resorts and institutional campuses.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Dave. [http://www.readthehook.com/83481/cover-tao-poo-can-worrells-green-sewage-system-save-water-and-planet "The Tao of Poo: Can Worrell's Green Sewage System Save Water and Planet?"] ''The Hook''. June 11, 2009. Retrieved 2011-9-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each system is designed to handle a certain volume of water per day, but the system is also tailored for the qualities of the specific influent. For example, if the influent contains high levels of [[heavy metals]], ecological wastewater treament systems must be designed to include the proper [[biota (ecology)|biota]] to accumulate the metals.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Nancy J. 2005, A Safe and Sustainable World: The promise of Ecological Design. Island Press, Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; During the “spring cleaning” season, there may be high levels of [[bleach]] in the water. This sudden concentration of a [[toxin]] is an example of a ''steep gradient''.

*''Steep gradients'' are drastic changes in conditions throughout the system that challenge the [[ecosystem]] to become resilient and stable.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt; A well-designed treatment system requires little management, so managers may intentionally create abrupt environmental or [[biochemical]] changes to promote ecosystem self-regulation. This mimics nature’s power and trains the ecosystem to adapt to influent variations.
*Designers seek to increase the surface area of contact that [[biota (ecology)|biota]] have with the sewage to promote high reaction rates. When organisms have ready access to the sewage, they can treat it more thoroughly.
*Ecological [[wastewater treatment]] systems are cellular, as opposed to monolithic, in design. If influent volume or makeup changes, new cells can be added or omitted without halting or disturbing the ecosystem.
*[[Photosynthetic]] plants and algae are important for [[oxygenate|oxygenating]] water, providing a medium for [[biofilms]], sequestering [[heavy metals]] and many other services.
[[biodiversity|Species diversity]] is a design goal that promotes complexity and resiliency in an [[ecosystem]]. Functional redundancy (the presence of multiple species that provide the same function) is an important example of the need for biodiversity. Snails and fish filter sludge and act as diagnostics; when a toxic load enters, snails will rise above the water level on the wall of the tank.

*The micro-ecosystem of a Living Machine system can be integrated with the macro-ecosystem just as ecosystems fade into one another naturally. This connection is commonly made with an outdoor constructed or natural wetland into which the effluent flows. Some living machines are partially or completely open to the outdoors, and this promotes interaction with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with conventional treatment==
Björn Guterstam critiques conventional wastewater treatment for five different inadequacies that ''living machine'' systems address. This evaluation explains the basis of his five points of contention:&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt;

*First, [[Sewage treatment|conventional treatment]] focuses narrowly on treating water and produces an often toxic sludge as a by-product of this cleaning process. ''Living machine'' systems can greatly reduce this sludge by conversion into biomass.
*[[Sewage treatment|Conventional treatment]] uses environmentally harmful chemicals (namely [[chlorine]]) to disinfect effluent following precipitation of solids (sludge) from the wastewater stream.  Ecological treatment uses biological processes instead of chemical inputs.
*Traditional processes do not adequately sequester heavy metals, and the sludge can also contain manmade organic compounds that are extremely difficult to break down. Some critics assert that the disposal of this sludge is not responsibly overseen in the [[United States]], so the excess sludge is sometimes spread on public forest  or even agricultural land, dumped in landfills or the ocean, and sometimes incinerated.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Duff. "Fateful Harvest: The True Story of a Small Town, A Global Industry and a Toxic Secret." Harper, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This not only pollutes the environment with unnaturally high concentrations of toxins but also wastes a valuable resource. Living Machines can sequester heavy metals by plant uptake and the plants can be incinerated and the metals isolated in ash for safe storage. These life-giving machines convert sludge into organic tissues such as fish, flowers and medicinal plants that have human uses.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A contained microsystem can be very successful in recycling nutrients, organic matter, and water. Depending on the toxicity and makeup of the influent, living machines can treat water to tertiary treatment standards and even reach potable standards for most or all metrics. This excellent organic recycling is possible if the [[biosolids]] are not heavily contaminated with persistent pollutants (such as [[aluminum]], which retards biotic growth). Mixed domestic/industrial [[municipal]] influent is more polluted, so a living machine may not always be able to treat every contaminant to levels that would not stress the ecosystem that receives the effluent. In this case, more treatment is necessary, which can be achieved by drainage into [[constructed wetlands]] which provide a different type of ecosystem that provides a fresh lineup of ecological players and services that can further process pollutants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Previous generations of ''Living Machine'' systems have employed clams to filter colloidal materials and fine suspended solids. Conventional treatment runs into engineering troubles when it attempts to handle these microscopic particles.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Conventional treatment is capital and energy intensive, whereas natural treatment is design intensive (and also management intensive if it is not well designed). The embodied fossil fuel energy in the heavy industrial infrastructure used in traditional activated sludge treatment is much greater than in the construction of a living machine system with a large greenhouse, manufacture of plastic tanks, mechanical aerators, pumps and valves among other equipment.

Guterstam contends that traditional facilities require larger capital investment and demand more labor and energy costs than their ecological counterparts. It is difficult to make a generalization about economic comparisons because thus far ''living machine'' systems have only been built for single commercial buildings. The next step in the development of these systems would be a larger scale ecosystem that has more diversity and higher populations to treat a larger volume of sewage. Until there is an equivalence of scale, economic comparison between the two systems is somewhat awkward and speculative. However, it is safe to say that ''Living Machine'' systems are ecologically superior.

[[Sewage treatment|Conventional wastewater treatment]] is heavily embedded in our industrial toolkit. A worldwide revolution in wastewater treatment would require an entire industry and profession to make a major disciplinary shift from a focus on ''industrial'' engineering to ''ecological'' engineering, applied biology and [[applied ecology|ecology]]. ''Living Machine'' systems have yet to be made on a comparable scale to conventional treatment plants, and this “biology of scale” could bring benefits or drawbacks in efficiency.

==Built components==
In tropical and temperate climates, ''Living Machine'' systems can be outdoors, as the temperature will sustain sufficient biological activity throughout the winter. In cold climates, a greenhouse is used to keep water temperatures warm so that plants do not winterize. Supplemental heating may also be necessary.

Living Machine systems use screens, [[biofilters]], plumbing, large plastic tanks, reed beds, rocks, fans, pumps and other mechanical devices. Every system is tailored to the volume and makeup of the sewage. Some are stand-alone greenhouses, while others are built into larger buildings.

[[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Michael Shaw have a patent on a device called an "ecological fluidized bed" which is essentially a pumice-filled tank with a concentric inner tank that contains wetland plants. Pumps rapidly recirculate water to maximize the filtration rate of this device.&lt;ref&gt;John Todd et al. "Ecological fluidized bed method for the treatment of polluted water." US Patent #548U6291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living Machine System Process==

*“Fixed film ecology” has superseded systems based on hydroponics or a fluid medium. In fixed film systems the wetland cells are filled with a solid aggregate medium extensive surface area for beneficial biofilm (treatment bacteria) growth. Fixed film ecology allows for denser and more diverse micro-ecosystems to form than does a liquid medium. These ecosystems go well beyond bacteria to include a variety of organisms up to and including macro-vegetation.
*Tidal cycles (filling and draining the wetland in accelerated tidal action—12 or more cycles per day) are used to passively bring oxygen into the wetland cells. This action mimics the same type of biological action of natural tidal estuaries. Tidal Flow Wetlands replace the need to blow air into a liquid medium and use gravity to bring atmospheric oxygen into the cell when it is drained.

==Hydroponics and Aquaculture==

Some ecological wastewater treatment systems, including first-generation Living Machine systems, employed hydroponics and even aquaculture. However, these processes are not part of today's Tidal Flow Wetland Living Machine systems.

*The first step of the process is an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] settling tank. This closed anaerobic tank serves as a pre-treatment to allow solids to fall out of suspension and precipitate to the bottom of the reactor to reduce the [[turbidity]] of the water. A variety of [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria are present in this tank; they generate acids and ferment methane. This step may be unnecessary if the influent has low levels of solids.
*Next, the sewage flows through a [[biofilter]] of bark and [[humus|humic]] materials. This gives the influent its first filtration and reduces the odors prevalent in anaerobic conditions.
*The mixture then moves into a series of aerobic tanks. The first tank is a dark, closed-top aerobic reactor that serves as a transitional step. The next tank is an open-top, aerobic reactor that contains [[photosynthetic]] [[algae]] that fix [[oxygen]] back into the formerly [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]], turbid water. This provides [[oxygen]] and organic food (dead algae) for biological [[metabolism]] and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Microbial communities [[cell growth|proliferate]], and eventually must consume all of the [[photosynthetic]] algae so that the algae do not choke out [[macrophytes]] in later steps.
*Many types of [[bacteria]] immobilize pollutant [[minerals]], but certain [[species]] of bacteria are crucial to [[nutrient]] conversion. Specifically, ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' work in steps to [[nitrification|nitrify]] [[ammonia]], making it into [[nitrates]], which are available for plant and [[microbial]] uptake. These bacteria need [[calcium carbonate]] to [[catalyst|catalyze]] this reaction, so managers must maintain sufficient calcium levels in the water. Denitrifying bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' convert [[nitrates]] into gaseous [[nitrogen]], which is [[Volatilisation|volatilized]] in these open aerobic tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Nyle and Weil. The Nature and Properties of Soil 14th ed. Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Denitrification is the most desirable sink for nitrogen in living machines.&lt;ref&gt;Teal, John. 1997, “Contribution of Marshes and Salt Marshes to Ecological Engineering.” Chapter 16 in C. Etnier and Bjorn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt; Protozoa have been shown to be capable of [[coliform]] and [[pathogen]] suppression.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, E.B. and E.G. Carrington, 1979. The fate of enteric bacteria and pathogens during sewage treatment. In: A. James and L Evison (Eds.). Biological Indicators of Water Quality. John Wiley, London, pp. 2001-2032.&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial breakdown is the primary biological treatment of both the conventional [[activated sludge]] process as well as these aquatic ecosystem sludge reactors.
*Higher plants are grown [[hydroponic]]ally in the aerobic tanks and provide multiple services. The most common plant used is [[water hyacinth]] (''Eicchornia crassipies''), which has filamentous aquatic roots with a high specific area. These feather-like roots provide a stable habitat for [[microbes]], and over time a bacterial [[biofilm]] builds up around the roots.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, David. “Parallel Performance Comparison Between Aquatic Root Zone and Textile Medium Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFFAS) Wastewater Treatment Systems.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, S.B. and J.M. Teal. 1996, “The role of plants in ecologically engineered wastewater treatment systems.” Ecological Engineering. 6(1-3): 137-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Water hyacinth, bulrush and other macrophytes sequester heavy metals. The bodies of these plants can be harvested and burned, and the heavy metals can be chemically isolated to take them out of the environment. ''[[Brassica juncea]]'' growing in waste streams has been found to contain up to 10% of its dry weight in lead.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda Kumar, P.B.A., V. Dushenkov, H. Motto and I. Raskin, 1995. Phytoextraction: the use of plants
to remove heavy metals from soils. Environ. Sci. Technol., 29: 1232-1238.
&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Plankton]] carries out multiple functions in the system with varying efficacy. [[Zooplankton]] feed on extremely small (&lt;25&amp;nbsp;µm) particles. In juvenile stages they feed on particles smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, David. “Parallel Performance Comparison Between Aquatic Root Zone and Textile Medium Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFFAS) Wastewater Treatment Systems"&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional waste treatment cannot process these fine suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1996. Ecological engineering for wastewater and its application in New England and Sweden. Ecological Engineering 6 (96- 108).&lt;/ref&gt; Although zooplankton do consume these fine particles, which are difficult for conventional treatment systems to process, the placement of plankton in the system is more valuable as a trophic link. Plankton can eat [[microbes]], which are abundant in the system, and the [[plankton]] is an ideal food for filter-feeding fish and [[mollusks]]. This food chain transfers biomass to higher trophic levels and increases the diversity and complexity of the ecosystem. John Todd thinks that “Since zooplankton can exchange the volume of a natural body of water several times per day it is difficult to overstate their importance in [[ecological engineering]].”&lt;ref&gt;Todd, John and B. Josephson. “The Design of Living Technologies for Waste Treatment.” Ecological Engineering 6 (1996) 109-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Björn Guterstam, another one of the most well-published and experienced [[ecological engineering|ecological engineers]], this theoretical role has not been as successful in practice. He concedes that [[phytoplankton]] populations have been limited by toxic and somewhat deoxidized water at the bottom of tanks, as well as light limitations. [[Phytoplankton]] are [[primary production|primary producers]], which provide food for larger zooplankton species, so the zooplankton population drops with its [[photosynthetic]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Guterstam, Bjorn. 1997, “Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Realities.” Chapter 7 in C. Etnier and Björn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt; Because these principles have been implemented only on a small scale, these systems have a lowered buffering capacity due to issues of scale and separation from the macroecosystem, even though genetic and functional diversity is encouraged.
*[[Aquaculture]] can take place in more dilute tanks downstream after the [[eutrophication]]-causing contaminants have been ameliorated. [[Snails]] slide along the tank walls and graze on slime and sludge buildup, cleaning the tank. This self-regulation improves light penetration, which stimulates photosynthetic forms of algae, bacteria and plankton. Filter feeders sift through large volumes of water each day and consume the bacteria and plankton that are small enough to pass through. [[Mollusks]] such as mussels and snails, as well as some fish, are filter feeders. [[Detritus]]-feeding fish consume larger particles of suspended [[biosolids]]. Herbivorous fish are excluded from tanks where macrophytes carry out useful functions (such as [[biofilm]] hosting), but when plants are eventually harvested from the system, this plant tissue can be fed to a tank of herbivorous fish for aquaculture production.&lt;ref&gt;Sifa, Li. 1997 “Aquaculture and its role in ecological wastewater management.” Chapter 3 in C. Etnier and Bjorn Guterstam. Ecological Engineering for Wastewater Treatment, 2nd Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A single ''[[Anodonta]]'' freshwater clam can filter as much as 40 litres/day of water, absorbing [[colloid]]al materials and other suspended solids at a removal rate of 99.5%. Many freshwater clams are in danger of [[extinction]], in part because some have [[gills]] that perform poorly in polluted environments.&lt;ref&gt;Karnaukhov, V.N., 1979. “The role of filtrator mollusks rich in carotenoid in the self-cleaning of fresh
waters.” Symp. Biol. Hung., 19: 151-167.&lt;/ref&gt; Since some of these clams can sequester colloids from streams or lakes, this provides an ecosystem service by slowing the erosion of soil colloids. Humans can strike up a symbiotic relationship with the clam genera ''Unlo'' and ''[[Anodonta]]'' by providing a clean habitat (when the water reaches the clam tank it is cleaner than some of their wild habitats). In exchange for a good home, the clams could aid humans by filtering colloids and suspended solids out of our wastewater. It is yet to be determined if the clams break up these colloids at all or if it is feasible to recycle clam compost back into field (which increases cation exchange capacity—-an agricultural benefit). Ecological engineering supports symbiotic relations between different species to serve the needs of humans as well as promoting the health of the ecosystem.

==Future horizons==
In a 2000 report to the USEPA on a South Burlington, Vermont, living machine, [[Ocean Arks International]] outlined five key areas which could shape the future of this field.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecological Design: Towards A Post-Engineering Perspective." http://www.oceanarks.org/ecodesign/postengineering/&lt;/ref&gt;
The foremost “possible breakthrough areas” is the ongoing classification of species by the biochemical, biological and ecological roles they play and how those roles effect other species under the context of wastewater treatment. The breakthrough would be to study the function of organisms in hopes of being able to more readily and successfully manage overall ecosystem function. Browne et al. (in press) have looked into the structuring of aquatic systems for water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, B., R.A.F. Seaton &amp; P. Jeffrey, In press. “Some propositions on the structuring of aquatic ecologies for water treatment.” Journal of Environmental Science and Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trophic level|Trophic management]] is used to influence entire systems by selective [[predation]] based on diagnosing an imbalance and analyzing the web of ecosystem classifications, roles and relationships. This management technique exploits the close interconnections of the food web, trophic cascade, to send a ripple down through the living community. This stewardship technique is predicated upon an advanced understanding of the conditions in the ecosystem and modeling the dynamic relationships down the trophic cascade. The trophic cascade in lakes has been researched by Carpenter and Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S. R. &amp; J.F. Kitchell, eds. 1993. The Trophic Cascade in Lakes.

Living Machine systems have been composed largely in closed greenhouses which can only react minimally with the surrounding ecosystem, and where populations have been heavily managed to foster equilibrium. If a Living Machine were subject to the ecology of invasions, new species would be free to colonize the system, and natural selection would dictate the success of any species. This would be true ecosystem self-design and self-management partnered with human stewardship.

Photosynthetic changes, specifically the control of light exposure is another powerful management practice capable of slowing or accelerating primary production. This is similar to the idea of trophic management, except that it manipulates the other end of the food web.

Finally, there is economic potential for methane generation, market crops such as [[flower]]s, [[fish]], [[tomato]]es, [[lettuce]] and other foods tolerant of [[hydroponic]] conditions, useful plants or medicinals. Combined with the revenue from wastewater treatment these services could turn living machines into pollution sinks and economic generators.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecological Design: Towards A Post-Engineering Perspective." http://www.oceanarks.org/ecodesign/postengineering/&lt;/ref&gt; It is well documented that a small, well-planned system in a good location can be economically viable. If a living machine can subsist in [[Alaska]], it seems reasonable that [[ecological engineering|ecologically engineered]] [[sewage treatment]] can be tailored to work smoothly in warm [[developing countries]].

Public sanitation and equitable access to water in very poor countries are grave problems. Living machines could be a low-capital approach to treating and recycling water, but skilled biologists may be a limited resource as well. A brick-pool living machine was built by Americans in Auroville, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Architecture for Humanity, "Design Like You Give a Damn." p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mount Tamalpais''' ({{IPAc-en|t|æ|m|əl|ˈ|p|aɪ|.|ᵻ|s}}; {{respell|TAM|əl|PY|iss}}; [[Coast Miwok]]: {{IPA|/t̪ɑmɑlˈpɑis̺/}}, known locally as '''Mount Tam''') is a [[mountain|peak]] in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], [[California]], United States, often considered symbolic of Marin County. Much of Mount Tamalpais is protected within public lands such as [[Mount Tamalpais State Park]], the [[Marin Municipal Water District]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]], and [[National Park Service]] land, such as [[Muir Woods]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Tamalpais-derangedtaco.jpg|thumb|left|Sunset behind Mount Tamalpais]]

Mount Tamalpais is the highest peak in the [[Marin Hills]], which are part of the Northern [[California Coast Ranges]]. The elevation at the West Peak, where a radar dome currently stands, is between {{convert|2560|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|2580|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger|pid=1159|name=Mount Tamalpais-West Peak, California|accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stood over {{convert|2600|ft|m|0}} before the summit was flattened for the radar dome construction. The East Peak is at {{convert|2571|ft|m|0}}. The East Peak was considered the highest point in the county, but now that claim is being disputed by those who believe the west peak is higher. But there is no corroboration of the claim on behalf of west peak from USGS or any other official body. The site ListsOfJohn has marked the west peak to be higher, but added a footnote that the east peak may be higher since the west peak summit was razed. The mountain is clearly visible from the city of [[San Francisco]] and the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] region.

The majority of the mountain is contained in protected public lands, including Mount Tamalpais State Park, [[Muir Woods National Monument]], and the Mount Tamalpais Watershed. It adjoins the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] (which in turn adjoins [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]) as well as several [[Marin County Open Space]] Preserves. This provides nearly {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} of continuous publicly accessible open space. Some of the lower slopes of Mount Tamalpais fall within several cities and unincorporated communities of Marin County, including [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]], [[Tamalpais Valley, California|Tamalpais-Homestead Valley]], [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]], and [[Kentfield, California|Kentfield]]. These areas are generally developed, consisting of mostly low-density [[Single-family detached home|single-family homes]].

==Natural history==

[[File:SE view of Summit of Mount Tamalpais near Mill Valley, California.JPG|thumb|Looking down at Richardson Bay over {{convert|2300|ft|m|-2}} below]]

===Geology and soils===
Like the rest of the California Coast Ranges, Mount Tamalpais is the result of uplift, buckling, and folding of the [[North American plate]] as it slides along the [[Pacific Plate]] near the [[San Andreas Fault|San Andreas fault zone]].

In 2004 it was suggested by a team of Penn State geoscientists that a [[Thrust fault#Blind thrust faults|blind thrust fault]], like the one that caused the infamous [[Northridge earthquake]], lies beneath Mount Tamalpais. This idea was partly based on the steepness of Mount Tamalpais and of nearby [[Bolinas Ridge]], such steepness on the visible surface often being the result of blind thrust faults. Another reason for the suggestion was that the San Andreas Fault creeps more slowly south of Mount Tamalpais than it does in its sections north of Mount Tamalpais and in the [[Olema Valley]], and that the existence of a blind thrust fault may explain the different creeping velocities. If a blind thrust fault does exist under Mount Tamalpais, and if it ruptures, it could be potentially devastating to the North Bay, San Francisco, and any other nearby locale resting on unstable earth and loose fill.&lt;ref name=Davidson2004/&gt;

Major Mount Tamalpais rockforms include [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], particularly evident in outcroppings near the summit and on the north side. A number of serpentine [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants grow in the [[serpentine soils]] in this part of the mountain.

===Hydrology===
Since the steep slopes of Mount Tamalpais force out moisture from passing storms and/or fog, the mountain supports several year-round streams like Redwood Creek on the southern face of the mountain down into Muir Woods. The steep southeastern slopes of Mount Tamalpais drain to [[Arroyo Corte Madera del Presidio]], which in turn discharges to [[Richardson Bay]].

===Climate===
[[Image:Mount tamalpais from berkeley.JPG|thumb|left|From Berkeley, across the bay, after a hot day]]
With its height, various faces, and proximity to the ocean and bay, the mountain contains many [[microclimate]]s, ranging from cool and foggy in lower ocean-facing valleys with their [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests, to hot and dry on the [[manzanita]] slopes, cool and breezy at the summit, and shady on the heavily [[Douglas-fir]]-forested north slopes near Alpine Lake.

[[File:Fog over Mill Valley near Mt. Tamalpais.jpg|thumb|Fog forming and flowing over the marine layer over Mill Valley, California, north of San Francisco, on the slopes of Mt. Tamalpais.]]
Annual precipitation&lt;ref&gt;[http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m356/graphics/BayAreaRainfall.jpg San Francisco State University] SFSU Bay Area Rainfall Map&lt;/ref&gt; around Mount Tamalpais varies greatly from around 27.5–31.5&amp;nbsp;inches (700–800&amp;nbsp;mm) in the drier, eastern foothills to about 59&amp;nbsp;inches (1,500&amp;nbsp;mm) near the [[Bolinas Ridge]], close to the Pacific Ocean. Both Mount Tamalpais and the Bolinas Ridge force moisture out of the air efficiently, since the air is cooled rapidly as it ascends the steep mountain faces and thus Mount Tamalpais's western part is heavily forested with tall redwoods and Douglas firs. The same fact holds for the steep, south-facing bowl canyon that Muir Woods is located in, with precipitation in Redwood Canyon at around 39.4–47.2&amp;nbsp;inches (1,000–1,200&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N37W122+2200+045995C Worldclimate.com] Rainfall station at about 950 feet (290 m) elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount_Tamalpais.jpg |thumb|Mt. Tamalpais as seen from Muir Beach Overlook ]]As in [[San Francisco]], most of the annual precipitation falls during the winter months. During cold, wet winter storms, the mountain also regularly gets some snowfall, sometimes as much as {{convert|6|in|cm}} overnight, as observed in February 2001, March 2006, and February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidsanger.com/stockimages/2-236-31.snowontam Davidsanger.com] Photograph of snow on Mount Tamalpais.&lt;/ref&gt; The region sometimes gets hit with strong Pacific storms that may topple trees, and bring hurricane-force winds to exposed, barren areas like the Bolinas Ridge and the summit of Mount Tamalpais. In summer, the area gets almost no precipitation, except for [[fog drip]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sightseeingworld.com/SanFrancisco/muirwoods.htm Sightseeingworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213234106/http://www.sightseeingworld.com/SanFrancisco/muirwoods.htm |date=2007-02-13 }} Climate description of the local area.&lt;/ref&gt; that occurs in Muir Woods, the Bolinas Ridge and the western end of Mount Tamalpais, where summer fog and oceanic breezes are more prevalent. In contrast, the eastern foothills, sheltered from the oceanic breezes and fog, are drier, since the foothills force little moisture out of the air. This leads to the fact that the eastern slopes contain only oak, pine, [[chaparral]] shrub, [[coastal sage scrub]], grassland and sparse Douglas-fir forest. Coastal sage scrub also occurs on some of the exposed coastal slopes.

Temperatures on top of Mount Tamalpais are generally somewhat cooler than places next to the San Francisco Bay or the ocean due to elevation. In summer, however, the top of Mount Tamalpais may actually be warmer than the middle, foggy elevations due to a [[thermal inversion]]. The summer fog and breezes make locations on Mount Tamalpais, closer to the ocean, cooler than the blazing hot interior valleys.

===Plant communities===
[[Image:West of Mount Tam.JPG|thumb|Open Douglas-fir/oak woodland/grassland to the west transitioning to a mostly dense Douglas-fir forest to the east]]

Hardwood woodland types are generally subtypes of [[California oak woodland]], including oak-bay-madrone forest, oak woodland, and oak savannah. Oak-bay-madrone forests are found in areas with moderate moisture and particularly favor north-facing slopes. They are dominated by one or more of three hardwood tree species – [[Quercus agrifolia|Coast Live Oak]], [[Umbellularia|California bay]], and [[Arbutus menziesii|madrone]]. Coast live oak tends to be dominant in somewhat drier areas, while bay is more dominant in shadier, moister areas; madrone is abundant in certain soil types in both moist and dry spots. Oak woodlands are a more open-canopy forest dominated by coast live oak, while oak [[savannah]] has a completely open canopy and represents a mixture of coast live oak woodland and grassland.&lt;ref name=pcmc&gt;Shufford WD, Timossi IC. (1989). ''Plant Communities of Marin County''. Sacramento, CA: [[California Native Plant Society]]. {{ISBN|0-943460-15-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great diversity of microclimates on Mount Tamalpais ensures a wide variety of [[Plant community|plant communities]] as well. Plant communities on the mountain include various types of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|hardwood]] and [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]], [[Coastal sage scrub|coastal scrub]], [[chaparral]], [[grassland]], and [[wetland]] vegetation. Wholly or partially coniferous forest types are found in the moistest areas of Mount Tamalpais. [[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast redwood]] forests are restricted to areas where the particular ecological needs of redwood are met: areas characterized by high overall moisture, low elevations below the fog line, and deep soils. Muir Woods is the most extensive and best-known redwood forest of the Mount Tamalpais area. Mixed evergreen forests of various combinations of [[Notholithocarpus|tanoak]], madrone, [[Quercus agrifolia|coast]] and [[Quercus chrysolepis|canyon live oak]], and [[Douglas-fir]] are found in moist areas on middle to high elevations on the mountain. Very moist areas of mixed evergreen forest may also include bay, redwood, and [[Torreya californica|California torreya]]. Areas in which mixed evergreen forests are predominant include areas of Fairfax-Bolinas Road and Ridgecrest Boulevard and around [[Alpine Lake (Marin County, California)|Alpine Lake]].&lt;ref name=pcmc/&gt;

[[File:Douglas firs near the summit of Mount Tamalpais, Mill Valley, CA.JPG|thumb|left|A stand of Douglas-firs near the summit]]
Various kinds of [[scrubland|scrub]] communities are also widespread. Low-elevation areas below the fog line with relatively low overall rainfall or thin soils are often the site of a [[northern coastal scrub]] community characterized by [[coastal sage]]-[[coyote brush]] association, with lesser amounts of [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|poison-oak]], [[Mimulus aurantiacus|bush monkeyflower]], California [[blackberry]], western [[bracken|bracken fern]], and various species of [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s. [[Chaparral]] is predominant in areas characterized by thin, rocky soils and little moisture. Two main types of chaparral are found the mountain [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] chaparral and [[manzanita]] chaparral. Chamise is dominant in the hottest, most [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric]] areas of the mountain, particularly on south- and west-facing slopes, while manzanita is dominant in other xeric areas, particularly on east-facing slopes and forest borders. Areas of mixed chamise-manzanita chaparral occur in relatively more [[Mesic habitat|mesic]] areas; ''[[Ceanothus]]'' and dwarfed [[Quercus wislizeni|interior live oak]] may also predominate on such sites. Areas in which various kinds of chaparral communities are dominant include areas along Old Railroad Grade.&lt;ref name=pcmc/&gt;

Grassland areas are also common on Mount Tamalpais. Native perennial [[Tussock (grass)|bunchgrass]] species were originally dominant, but most of these grasslands are now dominated by [[Invasive species|invasive]] annual grasses of European origin. Native grasslands, still found in a few isolated areas, are of two types. [[California coastal prairie|Northern coastal prairie]] is found below the fog line and is characterized by a ''[[Festuca]]''-''[[Danthonia]]'' association, while [[California valley grassland|valley grassland]], found in drier areas, is dominated by ''[[Nassella pulchra]]'', with ''[[Elymus glaucus]]'' and ''[[Leymus triticoides]]'' also being common.&lt;ref name=pcmc/&gt;

[[File:Mount Tamalpais, CA, 2005.JPG|thumb|Dying pine tree near the summit of Mount Tamalpais]]
Wetland vegetation types found on Mount Tamalpais include coastal riparian forests, wet meadows, and some marsh areas. Coastal riparian forest is predominant along the valley streams of Mount Tamalpais. Red and white [[alder]] (''[[Alnus rubra]]'' and ''[[Alnus rhombifolia]]'') and arroyo and yellow [[willow]] (''[[Salix lasiolepis]]'' and ''[[Salix lucida|S. lasiandra]]'') are dominant in these types of woodland, with bigleaf maple (''[[Acer macrophyllum]]''), box-elder (''[[Acer negundo]]'' ssp. ''californicum''), and California bay also being common.&lt;ref name=pcmc/&gt; Wet [[meadows]] are present in several high-elevation spots on the mountain,&lt;ref name=howell&gt;Howell JT. (1970). ''Marin Flora'' (2nd ed). Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-00578-3}} {{ISBN|0-520-05621-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while High Marsh represents a rare example of a [[marsh]] community on the mountain.

[[Serpentine soil]]s have a high rate of [[endemism]] and are the site of several unique subtypes of the above plant communities. Serpentine grasslands are some of the few grasslands in which native perennial grasses are still relatively dominant. Serpentine chaparral forms a unique plant community, dominated by dwarfed leather oak (''[[Quercus durata]]''), Jepson ceanothus (''[[Ceanothus jepsonii]]''), Tamalpais manzanita (''{{lang|la|Arctostaphylos montana}}''), and Sargent cypress (''[[Cupressus sargentii]]''). On the upper slopes of the mountain, small groves of Sargent cypress trees up to 50 feet (15 m) tall can be found in serpentine areas.&lt;ref name=pcmc/&gt;

Several species of endemic plants are found only on serpentine soils; these species may be widespread, but only occur on serpentine soils, or the may be more restricted, only growing in a few other places besides Mount Tamalpais, or may even be restricted just to Mount Tamalpais. The Mount Tamalpais thistle (''[[Cirsium hydrophilum]]'' var. ''vaseyi''), for example, is a rare variety of thistle known only from the serpentine seeps of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northcoastcnps.org/cgi-bin/inv/inventory.cgi/Go?_id=cirsium_hydrophilum_var._vaseyi&amp;sort=DEFAULT&amp;search=Cirsium%20hydrophilum%20var.%20vaseyi California Native Plant Society: ''Cirsium hydrophilum'' var. ''vaseyi'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Mount Tamalpais jewelflower (''[[Streptanthus batrachopus]]'') is also limited to the area.

===Wildlife===
Mount Tamalpais provides one of the last remaining [[wildlife]] refuges in the Bay Area. Urbanization has invaded wildlife habitat, forcing many [[fauna]] in southern Marin County to retreat up onto Mount Tamalpais, [[Muir Woods National Monument|Muir Woods]], and the [[Bolinas Ridge]]. [[Biodiversity|A wide variety]] of [[Bird|avifauna]], [[amphibian]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[mammal]]s are found on Mount Tamalpais, including a number of [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]]. Nonetheless, Mt. Tamalpais and the neighboring Golden Gate Recreation Area together encompass over 115 square miles (298 square kilometers) of land, forming one of the largest preserved parklands located near a U.S. urban center.

The name ''Tamalpais'' was first recorded in 1845. It comes from the [[Coast Miwok language|Coast Miwok]] name for this mountain, ''[[wikt:támal pájiṣ|támal pájiṣ]]'', literally "west hill".&lt;ref&gt;Callaghan, Catherine. (1970). ''Bodega Miwok Dictionary''. University of California Publications in Linguistics 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Various different [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]] also exist, but they are unsubstantiated. One holds that it comes from the Spanish ''Tamal país'', meaning "Tamal country," ''Tamal'' being the name that the Spanish missionaries gave to the [[Coast Miwok]] people. Another holds that the name is the Coast Miwok word for "sleeping maiden" and is taken from a "[[List of mountain ranges in the world named The Sleeping Lady|Legend of the Sleeping Maiden]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointreyesvisions.com/NewFiles/PRV_Book/Mount_Tamalpais.html "Mt.

The Coast Miwok are said to have believed that an evil witch dwelled at the top of Mount Tamalpais and therefore never set foot on the peak.&lt;ref name="sahm" /&gt; However, it has been said the Miwoks only said this in order to keep settlers off the sacred mountain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Tamalpais was home to the [[Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway]], also known as "The Crookedest Railroad in the World," a railroad which meandered its way up to the peak from downtown [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] until a road was constructed to the peak, and automobiles gained popularity. The 8-mile [[standard-gauge]] railroad required [[geared steam locomotive]]s and operated from 1896 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hunza1.tripod.com/tamalpais/ The Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214083056/http://hunza1.tripod.com/tamalpais/ |date=2006-12-14 }} (website) by Don Hargraves.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wurm, Ted and Graves, Al. (1983). ''The Crookedest Railroad in the World''. {{ISBN|0-87046-063-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early wireless towers were constructed on the mountain in the early 20th century, only to be destroyed by one of the periodic hurricane-force windstorms.

The U.S. Weather Bureau operated a weather station at the site of the now defunct [[Mill Valley Air Force Station]] for many years.

The peak and its surrounding areas are the birthplace of [[mountain biking]] in the 1970s, where early mountain bikers such as [[Gary Fisher]], [[Charlie Kelly (businessman)|Charlie Kelly]], and [[Joe Breeze]] were active.

==Recreation==
Mount Tamalpais is a hiking, picnicking, mountain and road cycling, horseback riding, and hang-gliding destination for residents of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], with over {{convert|100|mi|km}} of trails and fire roads. With numerous trailheads, a well-networked trail and road system, and hikes of greatly varying length and difficulty, the mountain offers a compelling range of attractions. [[Marin Municipal Water District]] maintains several reservoirs on the north slopes of Mount Tamalpais, including [[Alpine Lake (Marin County, California)|Alpine Lake]], [[Kent Lake]], [[Bon Tempe Lake]], Phoenix Lake, and [[Lake Lagunitas]].

The western slopes of the mountain descend to the [[Pacific Ocean]] at [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]]. The annual [[Dipsea Race]] traverses the mountain from [[Mill Valley]] to Stinson Beach. Though backpack camping isn't allowed, walk-in camping exists at the Pantoll and Bootjack campgrounds. The historic Bootjack Campground was originally established in the early 1920s by the Tamalpais Conservation Corps, and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] further refined the campground facilities in the
1930s. Showing substantial signs of overuse, the campground was closed by State Parks in 1969. The Bootjack Campground and Trail were reopened on Thursday, June 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/712/files/2014mt%20tam%20bootjack%20campground%20and%20trail%20reopening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trailhead]] parking within Mt. Tamalpais State Park is available generally with a self-service fee ($8). The scenic Ridgecrest Blvd. running along the ridgeline between the Rock Spring trailhead and Fairfax-Bolinas Road, with panoramic views of the summit, Pacific, [[San Francisco]], [[Bolinas]], and [[Point Reyes]], is featured in many automobile and other advertisements, as well as being the local hang-gliding launch point. Mount Tam is also home to the [[Edgewood Botanic Garden]] and to the [[Mountain Play|Sidney B. Cushing Amphitheatre]] where Broadway musical productions are performed every year by the [http://www.mountainplay.org Mountain Play Association]. Monthly astronomy viewings and lectures are held at Rock Spring and Mountain Theater April through October.

===Hiking and mountain biking===
{{Main article|Mountain biking on Mount Tamalpais}}
[[File:Mt. Tam coastline.jpg|thumb|Rocky coastline, Mt. Tamalpais State Park]]
Since the Mount Tamalpais area contains large expanses of undeveloped, natural land, there are many trails and trailheads that criss-cross the area. Many of these trails are used by hikers and bikers seeking refuge from the urban landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Some of these trails, including the mountaintop or ridgetop trails, have views of the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. Other trails, usually lower elevation valley trails, lead into natural, dense groves of mature [[Douglas-fir]] and [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees, clear, open grassland, and shrublands. All roads leading to the many trailheads around Mount Tamalpais are usually open, but during fire season some of these roads may be closed due to high fire risk.

The many roads, paved and unpaved, that cross the Mount Tamalpais region are used by mountain bikers, especially on weekends. Mount Tamalpais played a role in the birth of [[mountain biking#History|mountain biking]] many years ago. There has been considerable controversy over trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of [[Mountain biking#Environmental impact|environmental impact]] and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles have been banned from the majority of narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are still allowed on fire roads. The fire roads on Mt. Tam are mixed-use and they are commonly used as running, hiking, biking and horseback riding routes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calacademy.org/calwild/2000spring/stories/habitats.html "Single-Track Trail Mix"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041104081407/http://www.calacademy.org/calwild/2000spring/stories/habitats.html |date=2004-11-04 }} by Gordy Slack, ''California Wild'' 53:2, Spring 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Myōjinyama'''|明神山}} is a grassy area on a mountain ridge in [[Japan]], {{convert|20|km|mi}} east from [[Mount Fuji]] and {{convert|5|km|mi}} south-east from [[Lake Yamanaka]], off of road 147. The area is suitable for hiking and [[paragliding]].

==Gliding at Myōjinyama==
[[File:DSC02614GliderAtMyouyama.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Paraglider at Myōjinyama launch]]
The paragliding at Myōjinyama requires neither registration nor inscription fee. The launch is shallow, thus suitable for novice pilots. The {{convert|1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area can be used for both launches and landings. There is also an additional free landing zone courtesy of the Minami Green Hill Resort in the vicinity of Lake Yamanaka. Other landing areas include most of the coast of Lake Yamanaka and the multiple tennis courts and football fields that can serve for an emergency landing.

&lt;!-- ===Wind conditions===!--&gt;
The best launch conditions are with a western to northern wind; so, the site is complementary to [[Gotenba Gogome]] and [[Zubashiri]] at Mt. Fuji, which is a 30-minute to drive from Myōjinyama. Lake Yamanaka makes the lift smooth; but at other wind directions, the lift is bumpy.

'''Pansharpening''' is a process of merging high-resolution [[panchromatic]] and lower resolution [[multispectral]] imagery to create a single high-resolution color image. [[Google Maps]] and nearly every map creating company use this technique to increase image quality.  Pansharpening produces a high-resolution color image from three, four or more low-resolution multispectral satellite bands plus a corresponding high-resolution panchromatic band:

{{quote|Low-res color bands + High-res grayscale band {{=}} Hi-res color image}}

Such band combinations are commonly bundled in satellite data sets, for example [[Landsat 7]], which includes six 30&amp;nbsp;m resolution multispectral bands, a 60&amp;nbsp;m thermal infrared band plus a 15&amp;nbsp;m resolution panchromatic band.  [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]], [[GeoEye]] and [[DigitalGlobe]] commercial data packages also commonly include both lower-resolution multispectral bands and a single panchromatic band.  One of the principal reasons for configuring satellite sensors this way is to keep satellite weight, cost, bandwidth and complexity down.  Pan sharpening uses spatial information in the high-resolution grayscale band and color information in the multispectral bands to create a high-resolution color image, essentially increasing the resolution of the color information in the data set to match that of the panchromatic band.

One common class of algorithms for pansharpening is called “component substitution,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = WorldView-2 Pan-Sharpening | url = http://www.asprs.org/a/publications/proceedings/sandiego2010/sandiego10/Padwick.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; which usually involves the following steps: 
* Up-sampling: the color bands are up-sampled to the same resolution as the panchromatic band;
* Alignment: the up-sampled color bands and the panchromatic band are aligned to reduce artifacts due to mis-registration (generally, when the data comes from the same sensor, this step is usually not necessary);
* Forward transform: the up-sampled color bands are transformed to an alternate color space (where intensity is orthogonal to the color information);
* Intensity matching: the intensity of the color bands is matched to the pan band intensity in the transformed space;
* Component substitution: the pan band is then directly substituted for the transformed intensity component;
* Reverse transform: the reverse transformation is performed using the substituted intensity component to transform back to the original color space.

Common color-space transformation used for pan sharpening are [[HSL and HSV|HSI]] (hue-saturation-intensity), and [[YCbCr]].  The same steps can also be performed using wavelet decomposition or [[Principal component analysis|PCA]] and replacing the first component with the pan band.

Pan-sharpening techniques can result in spectral distortions when pan sharpening satellite images as a result of the nature of the panchromatic band.  The Landsat panchromatic band for example is not sensitive to blue light.  As a result, the spectral characteristics of the raw pansharpened color image may not exactly match those of the corresponding low-resolution RGB image, resulting in altered color tones.  This has resulted in the development of many algorithms that attempt to reduce this spectral distortion and to produce visually pleasing images.

The '''Samora Machel Statue''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese:]] ''A Estátua de Samora Machel'') is a [[bronze sculpture]] located in the center of [[Praça da Independência]] in [[Maputo]], [[Mozambique]]. The statue depicts [[Samora Machel]] (1933-1986), military, revolutionary, and the first  [[President of Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

The statue was designed and constructed in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]] by the [[Mansudae Overseas Projects]], an arm of the [[Mansudae Art Studio]].&lt;ref name="s"/&gt; It stands {{convert|9|m|ft}} and weighs 4.8 tons. The statue sits on a marble slab {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} high at the head of Samora Machel Avenue, and is illuminated at night. The statue has been criticized for bearing little resemblance to Samora.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The Samora Machel Statue sits in front of [[Maputo City Hall]] on the spot formerly occupied by a statue of [[Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque]], Governor-General of [[Portuguese Mozambique]] from 1896 to 1897.

The statue was inaugurated on October 19, 2011, the 25th anniversary of Machel's death in an [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash|aircraft crash]] on the convergence of the borders of Mozambique, [[Swaziland]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Armando Guebuza]], the President of Mozambique, led the construction of the statue and its inauguration ceremony, which was attended by numerous foreign dignitaries.

A smaller statue of Samora Machel sits at the entrance of the [[Tunduru Gardens]].

{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}} 

The term “'''set and drift'''” is used to describe external forces that affect a boat and keep it from following an intended course. To understand and calculate set and drift, one needs to first understand currents. [[Ocean current|Ocean currents]] are the horizontal movements of water from one location to another. The movement of water is impacted by: meteorological effects, wind, temperature differences and gravity and on occasion [[Earthquake|earthquakes]]. Set is referred to as the current’s direction, expressed in true degrees, and the drift is referred to as the current’s speed, which is usually measured in [[Knot (unit)|knots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Practical Navigator|last=Bowditch|first=Nathaniel|publisher=Bethesda, Maryland: NATIONAL IMAGERY AND MAPPING AGENCY|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ignoring set and drift can cause a mariner to get off their desired course, sometimes by hundreds of miles. A mariner needs to be able to steer the ship and compensate for the effects of set and drift upon their vessel while underway. A vessel’s actual course that is travels is referred to as the course over the ground and the current of the ocean alters this course whether pushing it away from its desired course of in the same direction. The vessel’s speed through the water is also referred to as the speed over the ground and the current can affect how fast or slow the vessel moves through the water.

== How to Calculate ==
In order to utilize set and drift in [[navigation]], navigators much first set the course using Dead Reckoning.

A [[Dead reckoning|Dead Reckoning]], DR, is calculated by using a previously determined position on a chart, and advancing that position based on known or estimated speed over a set amount of time. This can be calculated by using the formula Speed = Distance / Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decklicenseprep.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NS-140-Chapter-10-Set-Drift-and-Leeway.pdf|title=Set &amp; Drift and Leeway|last=Deck License Prep|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=8 February 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an advance position has been plotted, then set and drift can be factored in. If there is a known set and drift, then the corrections can be applied to the Dead Reckoning position to then get an Estimated Position on a chart.

The Course Made Good is the direction in which a ship or vessel has traveled with the effects of current, wind, and helmsman ship. If a current is flowing in the same direction as the ships heading, then the Course Made Good remains the same, but the current speed and ship speed are added together. If the speeds are in opposite directions, then the smaller speed is subtracted from the larger speed. If a vessel runs directly against a current or directly with a current, the speed of the vessel and speed of the current can be added or subtracted from each other. Such as, a vessel has a speed of 8 knots through the water and the vessel is traveling with the current, which is at 2 knots, then the speed over ground is 8+2 and the vessel’s true speed is 10 knots. 

Set and Drift can be calculated by using a vector diagram and can be drawn and measured on a chart, [[maneuvering board]] or even a plain piece of paper.

== Example Calculation ==
[[File:Set-Drift Problems.jpg|thumb|Set and Drift Example]]
You are underway on course 150 degrees true at 8 knots. Your vessel is making good a course of 166 degrees true and a speed made good of 8.8 knots. What is your set and drift? 

Step 1. Plot out course of 150 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet

Step 2. Measure length of course by using speed of 8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale

Step 3. Plot the length of speed on Radar Plotting sheet

Step 4. Plot out desired course of 166 degrees true on Radar Plotting Sheet

Step 5. Measure length of course by using speed of 8.8 knots and converting into nautical miles via the time, speed, and distance scale

Step 6. Connect the two ends of the vectors from the current course to the course made good. Thus creating your set and drift vector

Step 7. Using the navigational triangle, place on set and drift vector. Then drag to center crosshairs keeping the same angle and find the degrees on the outer circle

Step 8. Measure the length of the set and drift vector with the compass.  Convert from nautical miles into knots using the time, speed, and distance scale.

Step 9. Your set is 230 degrees true at a drift of 2.5 knots

== Tools used to calculate ==
To use Navigation Triangles, a navigator need two of them to be able to navigate correctly. Navigation Triangles can be used to find [[Position line|Lines of Positions]], Dead Reckoning, [[Ranges-Navigation Aids|ranges]], Estimated Positions, Running Fixes and so on. They are also used to connect all the types of fixes to be able to determine a [[course (navigation)|course]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sydneem/sandbox#cite_note-2|title=A Short Course on Nautical Charts and Basic Plotting For the Recreational Boater|last=Kessler|first=Gary|date=4 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}

Dividers can be used for the measurement of lengths of lines on a chart and approximating the lengths of non-linear lines on a chart. Dividers can also be turned into a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass]] by replacing the metal leg of the divider with a piece of lead. A compass can measure and draw arc and circles on charts and maneuvering boards.

The '''Sherrard Falls''' is a [[Waterfall#Types|cascade waterfall]] on an unnamed stream that is located in the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

==Location and features==
The waterfall is situated adjacent to the [[Waterfall Way]] between the town of {{NSWcity|Dorrigo}} and the locality of {{NSWcity|Thora}}, in the [[Dorrigo National Park]]. It is around {{convert|7|km}} from the town of Dorrigo and around {{convert|1|km}} from the [[Newell Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-sherrard-falls.html|title=Sherrard Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|date=|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge across Sherrard Falls is one lane. Vehicular and pedestrian access and viewing of the Sherrard Falls is difficult due to no car parking on the narrow Waterfall Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/australia-newell-falls.html|title=Newell Falls and Sherrard Falls|work=World of Waterfalls|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Waterfall Way is subject to closure at Sherrard Falls and Newell Falls in times of high rain, due to flooding over the road.

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable development ties together concern for the [[carrying capacity]] of [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. [[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

In 1980 the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.a21italy.it/medias/31C2D26FD81B0D40.pdf|title=World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable Development|date=1980|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the term "sustainable development".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sustainable Development|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780231173155|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4}} Two years later, the [[United Nations]] [[World Charter for Nature]] raised five principles of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=World Charter for Nature|date=28 October 1982|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations, General Assembly, 48th Plenary Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] released the report ''Our Common Future'', commonly called the Brundtland Report.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth. Philadelphia: [[Westminster John Knox Press|Westminster Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in many fields have highlighted ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., D.L. Meadows, J.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====
{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}
Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000. "New Directions in Planning Theory," ''Urban Affairs Review'' 35:4 (March)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar energy]] is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedsworf | first1 = Louise W. | last2 = Hanak | first2 = Ellen | year = 2010 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 76 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt; Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system.  These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[Open-source model|open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

In the last twenty years the main east–west thoroughfares, Ariapita Avenue and Tragarete Road, have become almost entirely commercialised, and Ariapita Avenue west of Murray Street has become a relatively upscale dining and entertainment "strip". A few small parks are sprinkled through the neighbourhood; Adam Smith Square and Siegert Square are the two largest. The Community Association held a series of events in August 2011 to celebrate its 100th anniversary.

Just north of Woodbrook along Tragarete Road is the [[Queen's Park Oval]], a major [[Test cricket]] ground, which is owned by the private [[Queen's Park Cricket Club]] (QPCC). At Woodbrook's western end, at the edge of Invaders Bay, is the [[Hasely Crawford Stadium]], the national venue for [[soccer|football]] and [[track and field]] events.

One of the larger and older green spaces in Woodbrook is  Adam Smith Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mytrinilime.com/locations/adam-smith-square/ Adam Smith Square – My Trini Lime]. Mytrinilime.com. Retrieved on 2016-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This square is located on Ariapita Avenue in close proximity to Murray Street and was one of the parks of the old days. Adam Smith Square is surrounded by residences which have been restored and modified, many of which now function as business places.

In the weeks preceding Carnival each year, the look of the square changes as stadium style benches are built up by one of the City Corporations. On Carnival Monday and Tuesday, this square is one of the judging points for mas Bands which elect to cross the stage at this location.

Outside of Carnival, the square functions as a time-out spot as persons sit on benches while visiting any of the businesses in the neighbourhood. On weekends several  young families bring their toddlers and young children to the square to run, play and get in some exercise and bonding time prior to the start of the next week.

In 2015, Adam Smith Square was one of the outdoor locations for a community cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttfilmfestival.com/gallery/ttff13-bptt-community-cinergy-adam-smith-square/ ttff/13 bpTT community cinergy – adam smith square – trinidad+tobago film festival].
