'''Abu'l-Husayn al-Basri''' (died 436/1044) was a [[Mu'tazili]]te [[faqih]] (expert in Islamic jurisprudence) and theologian (mutakallim). He wrote ''al-Mu'tamid fi usul l-fiqh'', a major source of influence in the field of [[Usul al-fiqh|usul]] until [[ar-Razi|Razi's]] ''Mahsul''.

He was a [[physician]] as well as a disciple of the [[Qadi Abd al-Jabbar]] in [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]. He challenged some of his master’s teaching  and eventually compiled a huge (two volumes; 1500 pages) critical review of the arguments and proofs used in [[kalam|Islamic Scholastic Theology]] . This he summarised in ''al Mu'tamad "The Reliable''". He including a critique of the [[Qualifications for a mujtahid|qualifications a scholar of Islamic law]] needed to practice. His [[Kalam|theological]] works were generally handed down among students of [[Islamic medicine|medicine]] and it was a century before his teaching was revived and espoused by the [[Mu'tazili]] scholar [[Mahmud b. al-Malahimi]] in [[Khorezm]] in [[Central Asia]]  where they gained recognition as a school of [[Mu'tazili]] [[Kalam|theology]].

He succeeded his brother [[Abd al-Wahid II]] in a period in which the Almohads controlled only parts of [[Morocco]]. During his reign, the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsids]] of [[Tunis]] extended  their rule to [[Algeria]] and [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], while the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] conquered [[Meknes]]. As-Said was able to obtain a contingent from the Marinids to fight the Hafsids, but was killed in an ambush.

The Marinids then took the opportunity to conquer [[Fes]], reducing the Almohads’ effective control to the [[Marrakesh]] area.

An '''action potential pulse''' is a mathematically and experimentally correct Synchronized Oscillating Lipid Pulse coupled with an [[Action potential|Action Potential.]] This is a continuation of Hodgkin Huxley's work in 1952 with the inclusion of accurately modelling [[ion channel]] proteins, including their dynamics and speed of activation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson A|first=Winlow W|date=Summer 2018|title=Mysteries of the action potential - From 1952 to infinity and beyond |journal=Physiology News |volume=38 |issue=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3389/fphys.2018.00779|pmid=29988539|pmc=6026668|title=The Soliton and the Action Potential – Primary Elements Underlying Sentience|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=9|pages=779|year=2018|last1=Johnson|first1=Andrew S|last2=Winlow|first2=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson A|first=Winlow W|date=15 Oct 2015|title=The Coupled Action Potential Pulse (APPulse)|url=https://www.ecronicon.com/ecne/pdf/ECNE-02-000018.pdf|journal=EC Neurology|volume=2.2|pages=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgkin Huxley|first=|date=1952|title=A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in  nerve|url=|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=117 |issue=4|pages=500–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action potential pulse is a model of the speed an action potential that is dynamically dependant upon the position and number of ion channels, and the shape and make up of the axon. The action potential pulse model takes into account entropy and the conduction speed of the action potential along an axon. It is an addition to the Hodgkin Huxley model.

Investigation into the [[Cell membrane|membrane]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of axons have shown that the spaces in between the channels are sufficiently large, such that [[cable theory]] cannot apply to them, because it depends upon the capacitance potential of a membrane to be transferred almost instantly to other areas of the membrane surface. In electrical circuits this can happen because of the special properties of electrons, which are negatively charged, whereas in membrane biophysics potential is defined by positively charged ions instead. These ions are usually Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which move slowly by diffusion and have limited [[Ionic radius|ionic radii]] in which they can affect adjacent ion channels. It is mathematically impossible for these positive ions to move from one channel to the next, in the time required by the action potential flow model, due to instigated [[depolarization]]. Furthermore entropy measurements have long demonstrated that an action potential's flow starts with a large increase in entropy followed by a steadily decreasing state, which does not match the Hodgkin Huxley theory. In addition a [[Soliton model in neuroscience|soliton]] pulse is known to flow at the same rate and follow the action potential. From measurements of the speed of an action potential, [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] must have a further component of which the 'soliton' mechanical pulse is the only candidate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The resulting action potential pulse therefore is a synchronized, coupled pulse with the entropy from depolarization at one channel providing sufficient [[entropy]] for a pulse to travel to sequential channels and mechanically open them.

This mechanism explains the speed of transmission through both [[myelin]]ated and unmyelinated [[axon]]s.

This is a timed pulse, that combines the entropy from ion transport with the efficiency of a flowing pulse.

The action potential pulse model has many advantages over the simpler Hodgkin Huxley version including evidence, efficiency, timing entropy measurements, and the explanation of nerve impulse flow through myelinated axons.

'''Myelinated axons'''

This model replaces [[saltatory conduction]], which was a historical theory that relied upon cable theory to explain conduction, and was an attempt at a model that has no basis is either physiology or membrane biophysics.

In myelinated axons the myelin acts as a mechanical transducer preserving the entropy of the pulse and insulating against mechanical loss. In this model the [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]] (where ion channels are highly concentrated) concentrate the ion channels providing maximum entropy to instigate a pulse that travels from node to node along the axon with the entropy being preserved by the shape and dynamics of the myelin sheath.

==Early life and career==
Ardoin was born near [[Basile, Louisiana|Basile]] in [[Evangeline Parish, Louisiana]] a descendant of both free and captive people. Amadee spoke only French and did not speak English, as did most people in this French speaking region.  Developing his musical talents in preference to undertaking farm work, he played at dances, often for Cajun audiences, with [[fiddle]] players Alphonse LaFleur and Douglas Bellard.  He moved around the area frequently, settling at one point near [[Chataignier, Louisiana|Chataignier]] where he met Cajun fiddle player [[Dennis McGee]].  They established a more regular musical partnership, playing at local [[house party|house parties]], sometimes attended by Ardoin's young cousin, [[Alphonse "Bois Sec" Ardoin]].&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/am%C3%A9d%C3%A9-ardoin-mn0000022065/biography  Biography by Craig Harris, ''Allmusic.com'']. Retrieved 24 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sandmel/&gt;

Ardoin and McGee were among the first artists to record the music of the [[Acadiana]] region of [[Louisiana]]. On December 9, 1929, they recorded six songs for [[Columbia Records]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |others=Amédé Ardoin |title=I'm Never Comin' Back |year=1995 |url=http://www.arhoolie.com/titles/7007.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010204200900/http://www.arhoolie.com/titles/7007.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-02-04 |first=Jared |last=Snyder |page=10 |type=CD Liner |publisher=[[Arhoolie Records]] |id=096297700723 |location=[[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They made further recordings together in New Orleans in 1930, and in [[San Antonio, Texas]] in August 1934.  Ardoin also made solo recordings in [[New York City]] in December 1934.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  The recordings were issued on various labels, including [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]], [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]] and [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]].&lt;ref name=sandmel/&gt;    In all, thirty-four recordings with Ardoin playing accordion are known to exist.

His recordings and performances became popular throughout southern Louisiana.  In the late 1930s, he played regularly in [[Eunice, Louisiana]] with fiddle player [[Sady Courville]], but the two did not record together.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  Ardoin's music combined "European song forms and African rhythmic approaches such as swing and syncopation... [He] personified this cultural blend and enhanced its development through his deft technique and his ability to improvise. Ardoin was a lively, inventive accordionist who could keep a crowd dancing while playing alone. He was also a soulful singer whose emotional style made dramatic use of elongated, high-pitched notes."&lt;ref name=sandmel&gt;[https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/amede-ardoin/  Ben Sandmel, "Amede Ardoin", in ''knowlouisiana.org Encyclopedia of Louisiana'', edited by David Johnson, Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, April 20, 2016]. Retrieved 24 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
The circumstances that led to Ardoin's death, and the final cause of his death, are uncertain.   Descendants of family members and musicians who knew Ardoin tell a story, now well-known, about a racially motivated attack on him in which he was severely beaten, in about 1939, while walking home after playing at a house dance near Eunice. The most common story says that some white men were angered when a white woman, daughter of the house, lent her handkerchief to Ardoin to wipe the sweat from his face.&lt;ref name=sandmel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |others=Amédé Ardoin |title=I'm Never Comin' Back |year=1995 |url=http://www.arhoolie.com/titles/7007.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010204200900/http://www.arhoolie.com/titles/7007.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-02-04 |first=Michael |last=Tisserand |pages=5–7 |type=CD Liner |publisher=[[Arhoolie Records]] |id=096297700723 |location=[[El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, California|El Cerrito]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Canray Fontenot]] and [[Wade Fruge]], in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''American Patchwork'', Ardoin left the place and was run over by a [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] car which crushed his head and throat, damaging his vocal cords.  He was found the next day, lying in a ditch. According to Fontenot, he "went plumb crazy" and "didn't know if he was hungry or not.  Others had to feed him. He got weaker and weaker until he died."  Others consider this story apocryphal. Other versions say that Ardoin was poisoned, not beaten, possibly by a jealous fellow musician.

Contemporaries said that Ardoin suffered from impaired mental and musical capacities later in his life.   Some recent studies have concluded that he died as a result of a [[venereal disease]].&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  He ended up in an asylum in [[Pineville, Louisiana]], where he was admitted in September 1942. He died at the hospital two months later, and was buried in the hospital's common grave.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman Fuselier, "Mr. Ardoin, He Dead", OffBeat Magazine, Vol. 24, Num. 6, June 2011, Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2018, a life-sized statue of Ardoin was unveiled at the [[St. Landry Parish]] Visitor Center.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Anne Hutchinson''' (née '''Marbury'''; July 1591 – August 1643) was a [[Puritan]] spiritual adviser, mother of 15, and an important participant in the [[Antinomian Controversy]] which shook the infant [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from 1636 to 1638. Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the [[Boston]] area, and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological [[schism (religion)|schism]] that threatened to destroy the Puritans' religious community in New England. She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters.

Hutchinson was born in [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], [[Lincolnshire]], England, the daughter of [[Francis Marbury]], an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received. She lived in London as a young adult, and there married her old friend from home [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William Hutchinson]]. The couple moved back to Alford where they began following dynamic preacher [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] in the nearby port of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]]. Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in [[New England]]. Anne was a [[midwife]] and very helpful to those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings. Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony [[Henry Vane the younger|Henry Vane]].

She began to accuse the local ministers (except for Cotton and her husband's brother-in-law [[John Wheelwright]]) of preaching a "covenant of works" rather than a "covenant of grace," and many ministers began to complain about her increasingly blatant accusations, as well as certain theological teachings that did not accord with orthodox Puritan theology. The situation eventually erupted into what is commonly called the [[Antinomian Controversy]], culminating in her 1637 trial, conviction, and banishment from the colony. This was followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was put out of her congregation.

Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] with encouragement from [[Providence Plantations]] founder [[Roger Williams]] in what became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. After her husband's death a few years later, threats of Massachusetts taking over Rhode Island compelled Hutchinson to move totally outside the reach of Boston into the lands of the [[New Netherland|Dutch]]. Five of her older surviving children remained in New England or in England, while she settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark called [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]] in what later became [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. Tensions were high at the time with the [[Siwanoy]] Indian tribe. In August 1643, Hutchinson, six of her children, and other household members were massacred by Siwanoys during [[Kieft's War]]. The only survivor was her nine year-old daughter [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]], who was taken captive.

Hutchinson is a key figure in the history of religious freedom in England's [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and the history of women in ministry, challenging the authority of the ministers. She is honored by Massachusetts with a [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] monument calling her a "courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration."  She has been called the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history.

== Life in England ==

=== Childhood ===

[[File:The first Marshalsea prison in the 18th century.jpg|thumb|[[Marshalsea Prison]], London, where Hutchinson's father was detained for two years for "heresy"|alt=A three-story building with three men standing in front having a conversation, and one or more other people near the building.]]

Anne Hutchinson was born Anne Marbury in [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], Lincolnshire, England, and baptised there on 20 July 1591, the daughter of [[Francis Marbury]] and Bridget Dryden.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=479}}{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}} Her father was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Clergy|cleric]] in [[London]] with strong [[Puritan]] leanings, who felt strongly that clergy should be well educated and clashed with his superiors on this issue.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}} Marbury's repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born. In 1578, he was given a public trial, of which he made a transcript from memory during a period of house arrest.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=19}} He later used this transcript to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero and the Bishop of London being portrayed as a buffoon.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=19}} For his conviction of heresy, Marbury spent two years in [[Marshalsea]] Prison on the south side of the [[River Thames]] across from London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=26}} In 1580, at the age of 25, he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach. He moved to the remote market town of Alford in Lincolnshire, about {{convert|140|mi}} north of London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=27}}

Anne's father was soon appointed curate (deputy vicar) of [[St. Wilfrid's Church, Alford|Saint Wilfrid's]], the local church in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford [[Free Grammar School]], one of many such public schools, free to the poor and begun by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=29–30}} About this time, Marbury married his first wife Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=31}}  Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he and from a prominent [[Northampton]] family.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=31}}  Bridget's brother Erasmus was the grandfather of [[John Dryden]], the famous playwright and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]].{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=9}}  Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood.{{sfn|Colket|1936|pp=33–34}} The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne's life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father's strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}} Education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men. One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=31–32}}

The family moved from Alford to the heart of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the position of vicar of the Church of [[St Martin Vintry|Saint Martin's in the Vintry]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=34}} Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=34}}{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}} Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of [[St Pancras, Soper Lane|Saint Pancras]], several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}} In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of [[St Margaret, New Fish Street|Saint Margaret's]] on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}} He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}}

=== Adulthood—Following John Cotton ===

The year after her father's death, Anne Marbury, aged 21, married [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William Hutchinson]], a familiar acquaintance from Alford who was a fabric merchant then working in London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}  The couple was married at [[St Mary Woolnoth]] Church in London on 9 August 1612, shortly after which they moved back to their hometown of Alford.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=479}}{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}

Soon they heard about an engaging minister named [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] who preached at [[St Botolph's Church, Boston|Saints Botolph's Church]] in the large port of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], about {{convert|21|mi}} from Alford.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}} Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married, after having been a tutor at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] in [[Cambridge]].{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  He was only 27&amp;nbsp;years old, yet he had gained a reputation as one of the leading Puritans in England.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible, enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}  Cotton's spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans, as he placed less emphasis on one's behaviour to attain God's salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion "in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace."{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}}  Anne Hutchinson was greatly attracted to Cotton's theology of "absolute grace", which caused her to question the value of "works" and to view the Holy Spirit as "indwelling in the elect saint".{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=86}}{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=x}}  This allowed her to identify as a "mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty"; such a theology was empowering to women, according to Eve LaPlante, whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=86–87}}

[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|left|thumb|Reverend [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] was Hutchinson's mentor and her reason for emigrating to New England.|alt=A painting of a man with long curly hair and a slight smile, wearing the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

Another strong influence on Hutchinson was closer to her home in the nearby town of [[Bilsby]]. Her brother-in-law, the young minister [[John Wheelwright]], preached a message like that of Cotton.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}} As reformers, both Cotton and Wheelwright encouraged a sense of religious rebirth among their parishioners, but their weekly sermons did not satisfy the yearnings of some Puritan worshippers. This led to the rise of [[conventicle]]s, which were gatherings of "those who had found grace" to listen to sermon repetitions, discuss and debate scripture, and pray.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  These gatherings were particularly important to women because they allowed women to take on roles of religious leadership that were otherwise denied them in a male-dominated church hierarchy, according to some modern scholars.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}} Hutchinson was inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles, and she began holding meetings in her own home, where she reviewed recent sermons with her listeners, and provided her own explanations of the message.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=87}}

The Puritans wanted to do away with the ceremony of the Church of England and govern their churches based on a consensus of the parishioners. They preferred to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, choose their own church elders (or governors), and provide for a lay leader and two ministers—one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people's souls.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=7}}  By 1633, Cotton's inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop [[William Laud]], who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the practices of the [[established church|established]] [[Anglican Church]].{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  In that year, Cotton was removed from his ministry, and he went into hiding.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  Threatened with imprisonment, he made a hasty departure for [[New England]] aboard the ship ''Griffin'', taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their child during the voyage to the colonies, whom they named Seaborn.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|pp=3–4}}

When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson described it as a "great trouble unto her," and said that she "could not be at rest" until she followed her minister to New England.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Hutchinson believed that the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] instructed her to follow Cotton to America, "impressed by the evidence of divine providence".{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  She was well into her 14th pregnancy, however, so she did not travel until after the baby was born.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  With the intention of soon going to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]] to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=4}}  In 1634, 43-year-old Anne Hutchinson set sail from England with her 48-year-old husband William and their other ten surviving children, aged about eight months to 19 years. They sailed aboard the [[Griffin (ship)|''Griffin'']], the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=4}}

== Boston ==

William Hutchinson was highly successful in his mercantile business and brought a considerable estate with him to New England,{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=156}} arriving in Boston in the late summer of 1634. The Hutchinson family purchased a half-acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula, now downtown Boston.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=154}}  Here they had a house built, one of the largest on the peninsula, with a timber frame and at least two stories.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=154}}  (The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the [[Great Fire of Boston|great fire of Boston]], after which the [[Old Corner Bookstore]] was built on the site.){{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=257}} The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor's Island in the Boston harbour, where they grazed their sheep, and they also acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston, {{convert|10|mi}} south of Boston in the area that later became [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=155–156}}  Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade, and made land purchases and investments. He became a town [[selectman]] and deputy to the General Court.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}} Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  She became an active [[midwife]], and while tending to women in childbirth, she provided them with spiritual advice.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=33}}  Magistrate [[John Winthrop]] noted that "her ordinary talke was about the things of the Kingdome of God," and "her usuall conversation was in the way of righteousness and kindnesse."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=33}}

=== Boston Church ===

The Hutchinsons became members of the [[First Church of Boston|Boston church]], the most important church in the colony.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  With its location and harbour, Boston was New England's centre of commerce, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as "the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton's first four months there. In his journal, Winthrop proclaimed, "more were converted &amp; added to that Churche, than to all the other Churches in the Baye." Historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  Early Massachusetts historian [[William Hubbard (clergyman)|William Hubbard]] found the church to be "in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where else to be paralleled."  Winship considers it an exceptional twist of fate that the colony's most important church also had the most unconventional minister in [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]].{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=39}} The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]], the colony's young governor, did not much stand out because of Cotton's divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=39}}

=== Home Bible study group ===

Hutchinson's visits to women in childbirth led to discussions along the lines of the conventicles in England. She soon began hosting weekly meetings at her home for women who wanted to discuss Cotton's sermons and hear her explanations and elaborations.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  Her meetings for women became so popular that she had to organise meetings for men, as well, and she was hosting 60 or more people per week.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  These gatherings brought women, as well as their husbands, "to enquire more seriously after the Lord Jesus Christ."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=34}}

As the meetings continued, Hutchinson began offering her own religious views, stressing that only "an intuition of the Spirit" would lead to one's [[Predestination|election]] by God, and not good works.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  Her theological interpretations began diverging from the more legalistic views found among the colony's ministers, and the attendance increased at her meetings and soon included Governor Vane.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  Her ideas that one's outward behaviour was not necessarily tied to the state of one's soul became attractive to those who might have been more attached to their professions than to their religious state, such as merchants and craftsmen.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  The colony's ministers became more aware of Hutchinson's meetings, and they contended that such "unauthorised" religious gatherings might confuse the faithful. Hutchinson responded to this with a verse from [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]], saying that "the elder women should instruct the younger."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=39}}

=== Antinomian controversy ===

{{main|Antinomian Controversy}}

==== Tensions build ====
Hutchinson's gatherings were seen as unorthodox by some of the colony's ministers, and differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates. The resulting religious tension erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy, but has more recently been labelled the Free Grace Controversy.

[[File:Wheelwright.John.AmAntiquarianSoc.jpg|thumb |right|Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] was an ally of Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and both were banished.|alt=A painting of a man with a white moustache and small beard. He is wearing a skull cap and the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

The Reverend [[Zechariah Symmes]] had sailed to New England on the same ship as the Hutchinsons. In September 1634, he told another minister that he doubted Anne Hutchinson's orthodoxy, based on questions that she asked him following his shipboard sermons.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}  This issue delayed Hutchinson's membership to the Boston church by a week, until a pastoral examination determined that she was sufficiently orthodox to join the church.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=41}}

In 1635, a difficult situation occurred when senior pastor [[John Wilson (Puritan)|John Wilson]] returned from a lengthy trip to England where he had been settling his affairs. Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and she immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his.{{sfn|Battis|1962 |p=105}}  She found his emphasis on morality and his doctrine of "evidencing justification by sanctification" to be disagreeable. She told her followers that Wilson lacked "the seal of the Spirit."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=105}}  Wilson's theological views were in accord with all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who stressed "the inevitability of God's will" ("free grace") as opposed to [[Preparationism|preparation]] (works).{{sfn|Bremer|1995|p=66}}  Hutchinson and her allies had become accustomed to Cotton's doctrines, and they began disrupting Wilson's sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}}

[[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]], the minister of Newtown (which later became [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]), began writing letters to Cotton as early as the spring of 1636.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=64–69}} He expressed concern about Cotton's preaching and about some of the unorthodox opinions found among his Boston parishioners. Shepard went even further when he began criticising the Boston opinions to his Newtown congregation during his sermons.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=64–69}}  In May 1636, the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] arrived from England and immediately aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson, and other "free grace" advocates. Wheelwright had been a close neighbor of the Hutchinsons in Lincolnshire, and his wife was [[Edward Hutchinson (mercer)#Mary Hutchinson|a sister]] of Hutchinson's husband.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=44–45}}  Another boost for the free grace advocates came during the same month, when the young aristocrat [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] was elected as the governor of the colony. Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but he also had his own ideas about theology that were considered not only unorthodox, but radical by some.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=6–7}}

Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continued to question the orthodox ministers in the colony. Wheelwright began preaching at [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Mount Wollaston]], about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse, and his sermons began to answer Shepard's criticisms with his own criticism of the covenant of works. This mounting "pulpit aggression" continued throughout the summer, along with the lack of respect shown Boston's Reverend Wilson. Wilson endured these religious differences for several months before deciding that the affronts and errors were serious enough to require a response.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=39}}  He is the one who likely alerted magistrate John Winthrop, one of his parishioners, to take notice. On or shortly after 21 October 1636, Winthrop gave the first public warning of the problem that consumed him and the leadership of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for much of the next two years.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=481–482}}  In his journal he wrote, "One Mrs. Hutchinson, a member of the church at Boston, a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit, brought over with her two dangerous errors: 1.&amp;nbsp;That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person. 2.&amp;nbsp;That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification."{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}  He went on to elaborate these two points, and the Antinomian Controversy began with this journal entry.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}

==== Ministerial confrontation ====

On 25 October 1636, seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a "private conference" which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=86}} Some agreement was reached, and Cotton "gave satisfaction to them [the other ministers], so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}  Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the [[New Testament]]. Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=86–89}}  A year later, her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=90}}

[[File:Henry Vane the Younger by Sir Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|right|Governor [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] strongly supported Hutchinson during the colony's difficulties.|alt=A painting of a man with a virile face and long dark hair; he is wearing a dark red robe-like outfit, and his demeanour conveys elegance and importance.]]

By late 1636, as the controversy deepened, Hutchinson and her supporters were accused of two heresies in the Puritan church: [[antinomianism]] and [[Familia Caritatis|familism]]. The word "antinomianism" literally means "against or opposed to the law"; in a theological context, it means "the moral law is not binding upon Christians, who are under the law of grace."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=3}} According to this view, if one was under the law of grace, then moral law did not apply, allowing one to engage in immoral acts.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}} Familism was named for a 16th-century sect called the [[Familia Caritatis|Family of Love]], and it involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom both from sin and from the responsibility for it.{{Sfn|Winship|2002|p=22}}  Hutchinson and her supporters were sometimes accused of engaging in immoral behaviour or "free love" in order to discredit them, but such acts were antithetical to their doctrine.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=3}}  Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and Vane all took leading roles as antagonists of the orthodox party, but theologically, it was Cotton's differences of opinion with the colony's other ministers that was at the centre of the controversy.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=4}}

By winter, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties. During the appointed fast-day on Thursday, 19 January 1637, Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon. To the Puritan clergy, his sermon was "censurable and incited mischief."{{Sfn|Bell|1876|p=11}}  The colony's ministers were offended by the sermon, but the free grace advocates were encouraged, and they became more vociferous in their opposition to the "legal" ministers. Governor Vane began challenging the doctrines of the colony's divines, and supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the [[Pequot War]] of 1637 because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}}{{Sfn|Winship|2002|p=116}}  Ministers worried that the bold stand of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the "Puritan's holy experiment."{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}} Had they succeeded, historian Dunn believes that they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history.{{sfn|Dunn|1981|p=143}}

==== Events of 1637 ====

By March, the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates. Wheelwright was tried for contempt and sedition that month for his fast-day sermon and was convicted in a close vote, but not yet sentenced. During the election of May 1637, Henry Vane was replaced as governor by John Winthrop; in addition, all the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office. By the summer of 1637, Vane sailed back to England, never to return. With his departure, the time was ripe for the orthodox party to deal with the remainder of their rivals.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=126–148}}

The autumn court of 1637 convened on 2 November and sentenced Wheelwright to banishment, ordering him to leave the colony within 14 days. Several of the other supporters of Hutchinson and Wheelwright were tried and given varied sentences. Following these preliminaries, it was Anne Hutchinson's turn to be tried.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=167–168}}

==== Civil trial: Day 1 ====

Hutchinson was brought to trial on 7 November 1637, with Wheelwright banished and other court business taken care of. The trial was presided over by Governor John Winthrop, on the charge of "traducing [slandering] the ministers". Other charges against her were laid out by Winthrop, including being one who "troubled the peace of the commonwealth and churches", promoting and divulging opinions that had caused recent troubles, and continuing to hold meetings at her home despite a recent [[Antinomian Controversy#Synod of 1637|synod]] that had condemned them.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=170}}

They found it difficult to charge her because she had never spoken her opinions in public, unlike Wheelwright and the other men who had been tried, nor had she ever signed any statements about them. Winthrop's first two lines of prosecution were to portray her as a co-conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony, and then to fault her for holding conventicles. Question by question, Hutchinson effectively stonewalled him in her responses,{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=170–171}} and Winthrop was unable to find a way to convert her known membership in a seditious faction into a convictable offence. Deputy governor [[Thomas Dudley]] had a substantial background in law, and he stepped in to assist the prosecution. Dudley questioned Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators. With no answer by Hutchinson, he moved on to the charge of her slandering the ministers.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}

His hands are placed in front of him, separately, one above the other.]]

The remainder of the trial was spent on this last charge. The prosecution intended to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony's ministers, and to use the October meeting as their evidence.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  Six ministers had presented to the court their written versions of the October conference, and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements. Her defence was that she had spoken reluctantly and in private, that she "must either speak false or true in my answers" in the ministerial context of the meeting.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  In those private meetings, she had cited Proverbs 29:25, "The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  The court was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=173}}

At the end of the first day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to acknowledge the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=60}} The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=60}} Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=68}}

==== Civil trial: Day 2 ====

During the morning of the second day of the trial, it appeared that Hutchinson had been given some legal counsel the previous evening, and she had more to say. She continued to criticise the ministers of violating their mandate of confidentiality. She said that they had deceived the court by not telling about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them. She insisted that the ministers testify under oath, which they were very hesitant to do.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=173}}  Magistrate [[Simon Bradstreet]] said that "she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath", but she answered that if they were going to accuse her, "I desire it may be upon oath."{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=173–174}}  As a matter of due process, the ministers would have to be sworn in, but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first.

There were three such witnesses, all from the Boston church: deacon [[John Coggeshall]], lay leader Thomas Leverett, and minister John Cotton.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=175}}  The first two witnesses made brief statements that had little effect on the court, but Cotton was grilled extensively. When Cotton testified, he tended to not remember many events of the October meeting, and attempted to soften the meaning of statements that Hutchinson was being accused of. He stressed that the ministers were not as upset about any Hutchinson remarks at the end of the October meeting as they appeared to be later.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=176}}  Dudley reiterated that Hutchinson had told the ministers that they were not able ministers of the New Testament; Cotton replied that he did not remember her saying that.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=176}}

There was more parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not picked up in the transcript of the proceedings. Hutchinson asked the court for leave to "give you the ground of what I know to be true."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=62}} She then addressed the court with her own judgment:
&lt;!--
the source has some archaic spelling/typography&amp;nbsp;— keep spelling, e.g., "ruin" as ruine", etc., but fix the typography, e.g., the old "
--&gt;
{{quotation|You have no power over my body, neither can you do me any harm—for I am in the hands of the eternal Jehovah, my Saviour, I am at his appointment, the bounds of my habitation are cast in heaven, no further do I esteem of any mortal man than creatures in his hand, I fear none but the great Jehovah, which hath foretold me of these things, and I do verily believe that he will deliver me out of our hands. Therefore take heed how you proceed against me—for I know that, for this you go about to do to me, God will ruin you and your posterity and this whole state.{{sfn|Adams|1894|p=175}}|Anne Hutchinson at trial}}

This was the "dramatic high point of the most analyzed event of the free grace controversy", wrote historian Michael Winship.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=175}}  Historians have given a variety of reasons for this seemingly impulsive statement, including an "exultant impulse", "hysteria", "cracking under the strain of the inquest", and being "possessed of the Spirit".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=177}}  Winship, citing the work of historian [[Mary Beth Norton]], suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament. This was "not histrionics, but pedagogy," according to Winship; it was Hutchinson's attempt to teach the Court, and doing so was consistent with her character.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=177}}

==== Civil trial: Verdict ====

Hutchinson simplified the task of her opponents, whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=178}}  Her revelation was considered not only seditious, but also in [[contempt of court]]. Cotton was pressed by Dudley on whether or not he supported Hutchinson's revelation; he said that he could find theological justification for it. Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=180}}  Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling, though; he was using Hutchinson's bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history, according to the historical interpretations of Winship. Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the culprit.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=181–182}}  Winthrop addressed the court, "if therefore it be the mind of the court, looking at [her] as the principal cause of all our trouble, that they would now consider what is to be done with her."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=182}}

The Bostonians made a final effort to slow the proceedings. [[William Coddington]] rose, asserting, "I do not see any clear witness against her, and you know it is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," ending with, "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke, and therefore deserve no censure."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=63}} The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=182–183}}  Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." Winthrop responded, "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=183}}

Hutchinson was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil, and was condemned to banishment by the Court "as being a woman not fit for our society".{{sfn|Crawford|1970|pp=144–146}}  The Puritans sincerely believed that, in banishing Hutchinson, they were protecting God's eternal truth.{{sfn|Morgan|1981|p=57}}  Winthrop summed up the case with genuine feeling: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus it pleased the Lord to heare the prayers of his afflicted people&amp;nbsp;... and by the care and indevour of the wise and faithfull ministers of the Churches, assisted by the Civill authority, to discover this Master-piece of the old Serpent.... It is the Lords work, and it is marvellous in our eyes.{{sfn|Morgan|1981|p=57}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Detention ====

Following her civil trial, Hutchinson was put under house arrest and ordered to be gone by the end of the following March. In the interim, she was not allowed to return home, but was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Thomas Weld]], located in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], about two miles from her home in Boston.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=158}} The distance was not great, yet Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather, which was particularly harsh that winter.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}} Winthrop referred to Hutchinson as "the prisoner" and was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her, according to LaPlante.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}} She was frequently visited by various ministers, whose intent, according to LaPlante, was to reform her thinking but also to collect evidence against her.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}}  [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]] was there to "collect errors", and concluded that she was a dangerous woman.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=122}}  Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drew up a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church, which decided that she should stand trial for these views.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=197}}

==== Church trial ====

Hutchinson was called to trial on Thursday, 15 March 1638, weary and in poor health following a four-month detention. The trial took place at her home church in Boston, though many of her supporters were gone. Her husband and other friends had already left the colony to prepare a new place to live. Her only family members present were her oldest son [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]] and his wife, her daughter Faith and son-in-law [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]], and her sister [[Katherine Marbury Scott|Katherine]] with her husband [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard Scott]].{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=235}}

[[File:JohnWilson 1stChurch Boston.png|thumb|right|[[John Wilson (Puritan)|Reverend John Wilson]] had been ridiculed by Hutchinson; he made the final pronouncement of excommunication during her church trial.|alt=Sketch of a man with long flowing hair who is wearing the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

The ministers intended to defend their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson's theological errors.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=235}}  Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged, and a nine-hour interrogation followed in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=236}}  At the end of the session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. He said, "I would speake it to Gods Glory [that] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us… he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}} The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}}  
Cotton continued, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;You cannot Evade the Argument… that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow&amp;nbsp;. Though I have not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here Cotton was making a link between Hutchinson's theological ideas and the more extreme behaviour credited to the antinomians and familists.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=202}}  He concluded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefor, I doe Admonish you, and alsoe charge you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus], in whose place I stand… that you would sadly consider the just hand of God agaynst you, the great hurt you have done to the Churches, the great Dishonour you have brought to Je[sus] Ch[rist], and the Evell that you have done to many a poore soule.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=243}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return in one week on the next lecture day.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=243}}

Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner. With the permission of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend [[John Davenport (Puritan)|John Davenport]] was also staying. All week, the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she wrote out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=244}}  Hutchinson stood at the next meeting on Thursday, 22 March and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. She admitted to having been wrong about the soul and spirit, wrong about the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, and wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and she agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (what she called a "covenant of works") "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=203}}  Had the trial ended there, she would likely have remained in good standing with the Boston church, and had the possibility of returning some day.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=204}}

Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard at the end of the previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults. The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day's grilling, but her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=204}}  With this, she was accused of lying but, even at this point, Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she "set forth her owne stuffe".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=206}}  To these sentiments, Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a "Notorious Imposter" in whose heart there was never any grace. He admonished the "heinousness of her lying" during a time of supposed humiliation.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=207–208}}

Shepard had swayed the proceedings, with Cotton signalling that he had given up on her, and her sentence was presented by Wilson: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended… and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye…. Therefor in the name of our Lord Je[sus] Ch[rist]… I doe cast you out and… deliver you up to Sathan… and account you from this time forth to be a Hethen and a Publican…. I command you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus] and of this Church as a Leper to withdraw your selfe out of the Congregation.{{sfn|Battis|1962|pp=246–247}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hutchinson was now banished from the colony and removed from the congregation, and her leading supporters had been given three months to leave the colony, including Coddington and Coggeshall, while others were disenfranchised or dismissed from their churches.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=63}} The court in November had ordered that 58 citizens of Boston and 17 from adjacent towns be disarmed unless they repudiated the "seditious label" given them, and many of these people followed Hutchinson into exile.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=64}}

== Rhode Island ==

[[File:Portsmouth Compact document.jpg|thumb|[[Portsmouth Compact]]|alt=A document with some hand-written and difficult to read text at the top, followed by 23 signatures, some of which are also difficult to read, with some washed-out text appearing in the margins. The document appears old and fragile.]]

During Hutchinson's imprisonment, several of her supporters prepared to leave the colony and settle elsewhere. One such group of men, including her husband Will, met on 7 March 1638 at the home of wealthy Boston merchant William Coddington. Ultimately, [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Founders of Portsmouth|23 men signed]] what is known as the [[Portsmouth Compact]], forming themselves into a "Bodie Politick" and electing Coddington as their governor, but giving him the Biblical title of "judge". Nineteen of the signers initially planned to move to New Jersey or Long Island, but [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] convinced them to settle in the area of his [[Providence Plantations]] settlement. Coddington purchased [[Aquidneck Island]] (later named Rhode Island) in the [[Narragansett Bay]] from the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], and the settlement of Pocasset was founded (soon renamed [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]]). Anne Hutchinson followed in April, after the conclusion of her church trial.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

Hutchinson, her children, and others accompanying her travelled for more than six days by foot in the April snow to get from Boston to Roger Williams' settlement at Providence.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=208}} They took boats to get to Aquidneck Island, where many men had gone ahead of them to begin constructing houses.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=212}}  In the second week of April, she reunited with her husband, from whom she had been separated for nearly six months.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=212}}

=== Final pregnancy ===

Hutchinson went into labour in May 1638, following the stress of her trial, her imprisonment all winter, and the difficult trip to Aquidneck Island. She delivered what her doctor [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]]{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} described as a handful of transparent grapes. This is known now as a [[hydatidiform mole]], a condition occurring most often in women over 45, resulting from one or two sperm cells fertilising a blighted egg.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=217}}  Hutchinson had been ill most of the winter, with unusual weakness, throbbing headaches, and bouts of vomiting.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=217}} Most writers on the subject agree that she had been pregnant during her trial. Historian Emery Battis, citing expert opinion, suggests that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time, but displaying acute symptoms of [[menopause]].{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} The following April after reuniting with her husband, she became pregnant, only to miscarry the hydatidiform mole.{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} A woman could have suffered severe menopausal symptoms who had undergone a continuous cycle of pregnancies, deliveries, and lactations for 25&amp;nbsp;years, with the burdens of raising a large family and subjected to the extreme stress of her trials.{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=17}}

The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's suffering and also that of [[Mary Dyer]], a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}  Winthrop wrote, "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=218}}  Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!"{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=64}}

=== Dissension in government ===

Less than a year after Pocasset was settled, it suffered rifts and civil difficulties. Coddington had openly supported Hutchinson following her trial, but he had become autocratic and began to alienate his fellow settlers.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=222}} Early in 1639, Hutchinson became acquainted with [[Samuel Gorton]], who attacked the legitimacy of the magistrates.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=223}} On 28 April 1639, Gorton and a dozen other men ejected Coddington from power. Hutchinson may not have supported this rebellion, but her husband was chosen as the new governor. Two days later, [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Residents of Portsmouth after split with Newport|over 30 men]] signed a document forming a new "civil body politic". Winthrop noted in his journal that at Aquidneck, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates, and chose Mr. William Hutchinson only, a man of very mild temper and weak parts, and wholly guided by his wife, who had been the beginner of all the former troubles in the country and still continued to breed disturbance.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coddington and several others left the colony, establishing the settlement of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] at the south end of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}} The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, [[Nicholas Easton]], [[William Brenton]], [[Jeremy Clarke (governor)|Jeremy Clarke]], and [[Henry Bull (governor)|Henry Bull]].{{sfn|Arnold|1859|p=132}} On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

During her tenure in Portsmouth, Hutchinson developed a new philosophy concerning religion. She persuaded her husband to resign from his position as a magistrate, as Roger Williams put it, "because of the opinion, which she had newly taken up, of the unlawfulness of magistracy."{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

Hutchinson's husband William died some time after June 1641 at the age of 55, the same age at which Anne's father had died.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=228}}{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=479–481}} He was buried in Portsmouth. No record of his death exists because there was no established church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=228}}

== New Netherland ==

[[File:SplitRock.EastFace.LookingWest.20110820.jpg|thumb|left|[[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], near where the Hutchinson family was massacred|alt=A photograph of a very large rock, about the size of a small truck, that has a large fissure in the middle. The rock is surrounded by trees and other vegetation.]]

Not long after the settlement of Aquidneck Island, the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats to take over the island and the entire Narragansett Bay area, causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety. This compelled her to move totally out of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Hutchinson went to [[New Netherland]] some time after the summer of 1642 with seven of her children, a son-in-law, and several servants—16 total persons by several accounts. There they settled near an ancient landmark called [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], not far from what became the [[Hutchinson River]] in northern [[Bronx]], [[New York City]].{{sfn | Champlin | 1913 | p = 11}}  Other Rhode Island families were in the area, including the Throckmortons and the Cornells. By one account, Hutchinson bought her land from [[John Throckmorton (settler)|John Throckmorton]] (for whom [[Throggs Neck]] is named) who had earlier been a settler of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] with [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], but was now living in New Netherland.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p= 11}}

The Hutchinsons stayed temporarily in an abandoned house while a permanent house was being built with the help of [[James Sands]], who had married Katherine Walker, a granddaughter of William Hutchinson's brother Edward.{{sfn|Barr|1946| p= 7}} Sands later became a settler of [[Block Island]] (later [[Shoreham-by-Sea|New Shoreham]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]), and the Reverend Samuel Niles, another early settler of Block Island, recorded the following about Sands' experience in New Netherland:
{{Quote | Mrs. Hutchinson... removed to Rhode Island, but making no long stay there, she went further westward to a place called [[Eastchester, Bronx|Eastchester]], now in the eastern part of the province of New York, where she prepared to settle herself; but not to the good liking of the Indians that lived back in the woods, as the sequel proves. In order to pursue her purpose, she agreed with Captain James Sands, then a young man, to build her house, and he took a partner with him in the business... there came a company of Indians to the frame where he was at work, and made a great shout and sat down. After some time, they gathered up his tools, put his broad axe on his shoulders and his other tools into his hands, and made signs for him to go away. But he seemed to take no notice of them, but continued in his work.{{sfn|Barr|1946|p= 8}}}}

Thus the natives gave overt clues that they were displeased with the settlement being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by an agent of the Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the [[Siwanoy]] people in distant [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], and the local natives likely had little to do with that transaction, if they even knew of it at all.{{sfn|Bolton|1922| p= 44}} Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.{{sfn|Bolton|1922| p = 44}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bolton |first=Reginald Pelham |title=The Home of Mistress Ann Hutchinson |journal=New York Historical Society Quarterly Review|date=July 1922 |volume=VI |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact location of the Hutchinson house has been a source of great interest for several centuries. LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day [[Pelham Bay Park]], on the east side of the Hutchinson River. Lockwood Barr offers another hypothesis, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929. He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester.{{sfn |Barr|1946|p=5}} A map in Barr's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called [[Baychester, Bronx|Baychester]], between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook.{{sfn|Barr|1946| pp= 28–29, plate VI}}  This area of the Bronx is now highly developed; Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts,{{sfn|Corbett}} but Black Dog Brook is defunct.{{sfn|New York Parks|2001}}

=== Death ===
The Hutchinsons' settlement in this area coincided with the local unrest between the Colonists and the Indians. Governor [[Willem Kieft]] had aroused the ire of the Indians with his inhumanity and treachery, according to the opinion of some modern writers.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Mrs. Hutchinson had a favorable relationship with the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] in Rhode Island, and she may have felt a false sense of safety among the Siwanoy of New Netherland.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} The Hutchinsons had been friendly to them, but the Indians destroyed the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as [[Kieft's War]]. The fate of the Hutchinson family was summarized by LaPlante:

[[File:Hutchinson.massacre.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Hutchinsons|alt=Sketch of a crouched woman who is sheltering a small child, with four other children nearby. The children are being attacked by seven native Americans wielding tomahawks and knives, near the doorway of a dwelling house.

{{Quote | The Siwanoy warriors stampeded into the tiny settlement above Pelham Bay, prepared to burn down every house. The Siwanoy chief, [[Chief Wampage|Wampage]], who had sent a warning, expected to find no settlers present. But at one house the men in animal skins encountered several children, young men and women, and a woman past middle age. One Siwanoy indicated that the Hutchinsons should restrain the family's dogs. Without apparent fear, one of the family tied up the dogs. As quickly as possible, the Siwanoy seized and scalped Francis Hutchinson, William Collins, several servants, the two Annes (mother and daughter), and the younger children—William, Katherine, Mary, and Zuriel. As the story was later recounted in Boston, one of the Hutchinson's daughters, "seeking to escape," was caught "as she was getting over a hedge, and they drew her back again by the hair of the head to the stump of a tree, and there cut off her head with a hatchet."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p= 237}}}}

The warriors then dragged the bodies into the house, along with the cattle, and burned the house to the ground.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=237}} During the attack, Hutchinson's nine year-old daughter [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]] was out picking blueberries; she was found, according to legend, hidden in the crevice of [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]] nearby.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=239}} She is believed to have had red hair, which was unusual to the Indians, and perhaps because of this curiosity her life was spared. She was taken captive, was named "Autumn Leaf" by one account,{{sfn|Pritchard|2002|pp=1–42}} and lived with the Indians for two to six years (accounts vary) until ransomed back to her family members, most of whom were living in Boston.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p= 228}}

The exact date of the Hutchinson massacre is not known. The first definitive record of the occurrence was in John Winthrop's journal, where it was the first entry made for the month of September, though not dated.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp= 479–81}} It took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news, so the event almost certainly occurred in August 1643, and this is the date found in most sources.{{sfn|Anderson|2003| pp= 479–81}}{{sfn |LaPlante|2004| p= 239}}

The reaction in Massachusetts to Hutchinson's death was harsh. The Reverend [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Thomas Weld]] wrote, "The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed us from our great and sore affliction…. I never heard that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman".{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=12}} [[Peter Bulkley]], the pastor at Concord, wrote, "Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any more to do with her leaven."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=243}}

[[Wampage]] claimed to have slain Hutchinson, and legend has it that he assumed her name after the massacre, calling himself "Anne Hoeck" to be honored by using the name of his most famous victim.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Eleven years after the event, he confirmed a deed transferring the Hutchinsons' property to Thomas Pell, with his name on the document being given as "Ann Hoeck alias Wampage."{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p= 11}}

== Historical impact ==

Hutchinson claimed that she was a prophetess, receiving direct revelation from God. In this capacity, she prophesied during her trial that God would send judgment upon the Massachusetts Bay Colony and would wipe it from existence.&lt;ref&gt;In Puritan thinking, any prophecy that did not come true was a false prophecy, and therefore could not have come from God. The Puritan teachers and ministers in Boston would have been outraged by Hutchinson's false prophecies.&lt;/ref&gt; She further taught her followers that [[direct revelation|personal revelation]] from God was as authoritative in a person's life as the Bible, a teaching that was strongly antithetical to Puritan theology. She also claimed that she could identify "the elect" among the colonists.{{sfn|Humpherey|1919|pp=18–29}}  These positions ultimately caused John Cotton, John Winthrop, and other former friends to view her as an [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] heretic.{{sfn|Humpherey|1919|pp=18–29}}

According to modern historian Michael Winship, Hutchinson is famous, not so much for what she did or said during the [[Antinomian Controversy]], but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the ''Short Story''. According to Winship, Hutchinson became the reason in Winthrop's mind for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through, though inaccurately portrayed and, with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}}  Winthrop's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and, as with all legends, what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}} Winthrop described her as "a woman of ready wit and bold spirit".{{sfn|Lauter|2006|p=308}} In the words of Winship, to Winthrop, Hutchinson was a "hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy".{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}} The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds.{{sfn|Lauter|2006|p=308}}  To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of the separation of church and state. Finally, in the 20th century, she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views but because she was an assertive, highly visible woman.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}} According to feminist Amy Lang, Hutchinson failed to understand that "the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy".{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=65}}  Lang argues that it was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes, according to Lang's interpretation, was the violation of her role in Puritan society, and she was condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=65}}  (However, the Puritans themselves clearly stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological, and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender.)&lt;ref&gt;See David Hall, ''The Antinomian Controversy, 1636–1638, A Documentary History'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winship calls Hutchinson "a prophet, spiritual adviser, mother of fifteen, and important participant in a fierce religious controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638",{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=1}} upheld as a symbol of religious freedom, liberal thinking, and [[Christian feminism]]. Anne Hutchinson is a contentious figure, having been lionized, mythologized, and demonized by various writers. In particular, historians and other observers have interpreted and re-interpreted her life within the following frameworks: the status of women, power struggles within the Church, and a similar struggle within the secular political structure. As to her overall historical impact, Winship writes, "Hutchinson's well-publicized trials and the attendant accusations against her made her the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=1}}

== Memorials and legacy ==

In front of the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] in Boston, Massachusetts stands a statue of Anne Hutchinson with her daughter Susanna as a child. The statue, dedicated in 1922, has an inscription on the marble [[pediment]] that reads:

The memorial is featured on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beacon Hill|url=http://bwht.org/beacon-hill/|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another memorial to Hutchinson was erected south of Boston in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], at the corner of Beale Street and Grandview Avenue. This is near the location where the Hutchinsons owned a 600-acre farm with a house, and this is where they stayed for several days in early spring 1638 while making the trip from Boston to their new home on [[Aquidneck Island]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=208}}

Anne Hutchinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/anne-hutchinson/|title=Hutchinson, Anne |publisher=National Women’s Hall of Fame|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary works ===

According to Hutchinson biographer [[Eve LaPlante]], some literary critics trace the character of [[Hester Prynne]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' to Hutchinson's persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=xvii}}  Historian Amy Lang wrote that Hester Prynne was the embodiment of a fictional Anne Hutchinson—a Hutchinson created by the early Puritan chroniclers.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=165}}  Lang notes that Hester was what orthodox Puritans said Hutchinson was, either in reality or at least spiritually.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=165}}  The parallel is that Hutchinson was the heretic who metaphorically seduced the Puritan community, while in Hawthorne's novel Hester Prynne literally seduced the minister of her community.{{sfn|Lang|1987|pp=165–166}}

Anne Hutchinson and her political struggle with Governor Winthrop are depicted in the 1980 play ''Goodly Creatures'' by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]]. Other notable historical characters who appear in the play are Reverend [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]], Governor [[Henry Vane the Younger|Harry Vane]], and future Quaker martyr [[Mary Dyer]].{{sfn|Gibson|1986|p=4}}  In January 2014, [[Dan Shore]]'s opera ''Anne Hutchinson'', with libretto by William A. Fregosi and Fritz Bell, was performed twice in Boston, Massachusetts by the Intermezzo Opera Company.{{sfn|Intermezzo Opera|2013}}  In February 2015, researcher Claire Bellerjeau discovered and positively identified a tribute poem to Anne Hutchinson written in 1770 by [[Jupiter Hammon]], the first published Black American poet.{{sfn|Bleyer|2015}}

=== Namesakes ===

[[File:AnneHutchinsonMaryDyerMemorialHerbGarden.jpg|thumb|Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden at Founders' Brook Park, Portsmouth, Rhode Island|alt=photograph of a multi-coloured carved wooden sign which reads "Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden," behind which is a scenic small waterfall surrounded by green foliage.]]

In southern New York, Hutchinson's most prominent namesakes are the [[Hutchinson River]], one of the very few rivers named after a woman, and a highway, the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]].{{sfn|Hutchinson River Parkway}}  Elementary schools are named for her, such as in the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] towns of [[Pelham (town), New York|Pelham]] and [[Eastchester (town), New York|Eastchester]].{{sfn|Pelham Patch|2012}}{{sfn|Anne Hutchinson School|2012}}

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson and her friend [[Mary Dyer]], the Quaker martyr, have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden set by a scenic waterfall and historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth.{{sfn|Heritage Passage}}  The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women. The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organisation, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist Valerie Debrule. The organization is called Friends of Anne Hutchinson; it meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne's baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island.{{sfn|Herald News|2011}} Hutchinson Hall, an underclassmen residence hall at the [[University of Rhode Island|University of Rhode Island]], is named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hutchinson Hall |url=https://web.uri.edu/housing/hutchinson-hall/ |website=web.uri.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hutchinson is honoured together with [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar]] of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 5 February.{{sfn|Satucket Lectionary}}

=== Pardon ===

In 1987, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] pardoned Anne Hutchinson, revoking the order of banishment by [[John Winthrop|Governor Winthrop]] 350&amp;nbsp;years earlier.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=256}}

== Family ==

=== Immediate family ===

Anne and [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William Hutchinson]] had 15 children, all of them born and baptized in Alford except for the last child, who was baptized in Boston, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  Of the 14 children born in England, 11 lived to sail to [[New England]].{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}

[[File:Major Thomas Savage.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Major [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]] married Hutchinson's daughter Faith|alt=Painting of a balding man with grey hair. The man is wearing a highly decorated coat, and he is holding a staff of sorts.]]

The oldest child [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]] was baptized 28 May 1613. He signed the [[Portsmouth Compact]] and settled on Aquidneck Island with his parents, but he soon made peace with the Massachusetts authorities and returned to Boston.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  He was an officer in the colonial militia, and died from wounds received during [[King Philip's War]]. Susanna was baptised 4 September 1614 and died in Alford during the [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1630. Richard (baptized 8 December 1615) was admitted to the Boston church in 1634, but he returned to England and no further record has been found.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  Faith (baptized 14 August 1617) married [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]] and lived in Boston, dying about 1651.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}  Bridget (baptised 15 January 1618/9) married [[John Sanford (governor)|John Sanford]] and lived in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island]], where her husband was briefly governor of the island; she died by 1698.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}

Francis (baptized 24 December 1620) was the oldest of the children to perish in the massacre in [[New Netherland]]. Elizabeth (baptized 17 February 1621/2) died during the plague in Alford and was buried there on 4 October 1630.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  William (baptized 22 June 1623) died during infancy. Samuel (baptized 17 December 1624) lived in Boston, married, and had a child, but left behind few records.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  Anne (baptized 5 May 1626) married William Collins, and both of them went to New Netherland and perished in the massacre with her mother.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  Mary (baptized 22 February 1627/8), Katherine (baptized 7 February 1629/30), William (baptized 28 September 1631), and daughter Zuriel (baptized in Boston 13 March 1635/6) were all children when they went with their mother to New Netherland, and were killed during the Indian massacre in the late summer of 1643.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480–481}}  [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]] was the 14th child of the Hutchinsons and the youngest born in England, baptized 15 November 1633. She survived the Indian attack in 1643, was taken captive, and eventually was traded to the English, after which she married John Cole and had 11 children with him.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}

Of Hutchinson's dozen or more siblings who survived childhood, only one other came to New England; her youngest sister, [[Katherine Marbury Scott|Katherine]], the wife of [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard Scott]], came to Boston and then Providence. With her husband, Katherine was a Puritan, Baptist, and then Quaker, and was whipped in Boston for supporting her future son-in-law [[Christopher Holder]] who had his right ear cut off for his Quaker evangelism.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=272}}

=== Descendants ===

[[File:Stephen A Douglas - headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Stephen A. Douglas]] was descended from Hutchinson|alt=Photograph of a man with longish dark hair; he is wearing formal attire which consists of a dark vest, a white shirt, and a tie of the style worn in 1860.]]

A number of Anne Hutchinson's descendants have reached great prominence. Among them are United States Presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[George W. Bush]],{{sfn|Roberts|2009|pp=365–366}} as are presidential aspirants [[Stephen A. Douglas]], [[George W. Romney]], and [[Mitt Romney]].{{sfn|Family Search|2008}}  Her grandson [[Peleg Sanford]] was a governor of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=171}}  Other descendants include Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court [[Melville Weston Fuller]] and Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]; [[Lord Chancellor]] of England John Singleton Copley, Jr., who was the first [[Lord Lyndhurst]]; and President of Harvard University [[Charles William Eliot]]. One descendant bearing the Hutchinson name was her ill-fated great-great-grandson [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], who was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] at the time of the [[Boston Tea Party]], an event leading to the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfn|Family Search|2008}}

=== Ancestry ===

In 1914, [[John Denison Champlin, Jr.|John Champlin]] published the bulk of the currently known ancestry of Anne Hutchinson, showing her descent on her father's side of the family from [[Charlemagne]] and [[Alfred the Great]].{{sfn|Champlin|1914|p=18}}  [[Gary Boyd Roberts]] and others have published her line of descent on her mother's side from [[Edward I of England]], thus connecting her with Edward's great grandparents, [[Henry II of England]] and his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].{{sfn|Roberts|2008|p=278}}{{sfn|Richardson|2004|p=492}}  Most of the material in the following ancestor chart is from Champlin, except for the Williamson line which was published in ''[[The American Genealogist]]'' by F. N. Craig in 1992.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=484}}

==Using artificial intelligence for Wikimedia projects==
Various projects seek to improve Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects by using artificial intelligence tools.

===ORES===
The Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES) project is an artificial intelligence service for grading the quality of Wikipedia edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |title=Software That Can Spot Rookie Mistakes Could Make Wikipedia More Welcoming |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544036/artificial-intelligence-aims-to-make-wikipedia-friendlier-and-better/ |website=MIT Technology Review |language=en |date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Metz |first1=Cade |title=Wikipedia Deploys AI to Expand Its Ranks of Human Editors |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/wikipedia-is-using-ai-to-expand-the-ranks-of-human-editors/ |journal=Wired |date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wikimedia Foundation presented the ORES project in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halfaker |first1=Aaron |last2=Taraborelli |first2=Dario |title=Artificial intelligence service "ORES" gives Wikipedians X-ray specs to see through bad edits |url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/2015/11/30/artificial-intelligence-x-ray-specs/ |website=Wikimedia Foundation |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detox===
Detox is a project to prevent users from posting unkind comments in Wikimedia community discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Research:Detox - Meta |url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Detox |website=meta.wikimedia.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other parts of the Detox project, the Wikimedia Foundation and [[Jigsaw (company)|Jigsaw]] collaborated to use artificial intelligence for basic research and to develop technical solutions to address the problem. In October 2016 those organizations published "Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale" describing their findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ex Machina: Personal Attacks Seen at Scale |pages=1391–1399 |doi=10.1145/3038912.3052591 |arxiv=1610.08914|chapter=Ex Machina |year=2017 |last1=Wulczyn |first1=Ellery |last2=Thain |first2=Nithum |last3=Dixon |first3=Lucas |isbn=9781450349130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jigsaw |title=Algorithms And Insults: Scaling Up Our Understanding Of Harassment On Wikipedia |url=https://medium.com/jigsaw/algorithms-and-insults-scaling-up-our-understanding-of-harassment-on-wikipedia-6cc417b9f7ff |website=Medium |date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various popular media outlets reported on the publication of this paper and described the social context of the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last1=Wakabayashi |first1=Daisuke |title=Google Cousin Develops Technology to Flag Toxic Online Comments |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/technology/google-jigsaw-monitor-toxic-online-comments.html |journal=The New York Times |language=en |date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smellie |first1=Sarah |title=Inside Wikipedia's Attempt to Use Artificial Intelligence to Combat Harassment |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/aeyvxz/wikipedia-jigsaw-google-artificial-intelligence |website=Motherboard |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |language=en-us |date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gershgorn |first1=Dave |title=Alphabet's hate-fighting AI doesn't understand hate yet |url=https://qz.com/918640/alphabets-hate-fighting-ai-doesnt-understand-hate-yet/ |website=Quartz |date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In August 2018 a company called Primer reported attempting to use artificial intelligence to create Wikipedia articles about women as a way to address [[gender bias on Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Simonite |first1=Tom |title=Using Artificial Intelligence to Fix Wikipedia's Gender Problem |url=https://www.wired.com/story/using-artificial-intelligence-to-fix-wikipedias-gender-problem/ |journal=Wired |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verger |first1=Rob |title=Artificial intelligence can now help write Wikipedia pages for overlooked scientists |url=https://www.popsci.com/artificial-intelligence-scientists-wikipedia |website=Popular Science |language=en |date=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using Wikimedia projects for artificial intelligence==
Content in Wikimedia projects is useful as a dataset in advancing artificial intelligence research and applications. For instance, in the development of the Google's [[Perspective API]] that identifies toxic comments in online forums, a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia talk page comments with human-labelled toxicity levels was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/01/google-perspective-comment-ranking-system/|title=Google’s comment-ranking system will be a hit with the alt-right|work=Engadget|date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 paper reported that more than 1000 academic articles, including those using artificial intelligence, examine Wikipedia, reuse information from Wikipedia, use technical extensions linked to Wikipedia, or research communication about Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nielsen |first1=Finn Årup |title=Wikipedia Research and Tools: Review and Comments |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2012 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2129874 |language=en |issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 paper described Wikipedia as the [[mother lode]] for human-generated text available for machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mehdi |first1=Mohamad |last2=Okoli |first2=Chitu |last3=Mesgari |first3=Mostafa |last4=Nielsen |first4=Finn Årup |last5=Lanamäki |first5=Arto |title=Excavating the mother lode of human-generated text: A systematic review of research that uses the wikipedia corpus |journal=Information Processing &amp; Management |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=505–529 |doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2016.07.003 |date=March 2017|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/excavating-the-mother-lode-of-humangenerated-text-a-systematic-review-of-research-that-uses-the-wikipedia-corpus(506cdbd1-1783-47dd-b77a-30e44072d6b1).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 research project called "One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence" named Wikipedia as a key early project for understanding the interplay between artificial intelligence applications and human engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AI Research Trends - One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) |url=https://ai100.stanford.edu/2016-report/section-i-what-artificial-intelligence/ai-research-trends |website=ai100.stanford.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Kurdish–Turkish conflict}}
The '''Başbağlar massacre''' ({{lang-tr|Başbağlar Katliamı}}) is the name given to the 5 July 1993 event in which 33 civilians were killed, and the village of [[Başbağlar]] near [[Erzincan]] burnt down. Ex-special forces soldier Ayhan Çarkin claimed that the [[Deep state in Turkey|deep state]] was behind the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Basbaglar katliami, Bilan kazasi olayi, Jave köyleri...Ayni ekip yapti bunlari. Basbaglar katliami kesinlikle Ergenekon zihniyeti ürünüdür, [http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/ayhan-carkin-emniyette-1044071]&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was attributed to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK). Some journalists and politicians have argued that both incidents were part of a "[[strategy of tension]]" that was part of [[1993 alleged Turkish military coup|an alleged military coup in 1993]].

== Background ==
The small village of [[Başbağlar]] is located 220 kilometers from the city of [[Erzincan]] in the eastern [[Anatolia]]n [[Erzincan Province|province of Erzincan]]'s [[Kemaliye|Kemaliye district]].

==Incident==
Turkish authorities claimed that approximately 100 heavily armed militants rampaged through the village, dragged all the civilians to the village square and burned their homes and property. After an hour of propaganda session dozens of men from the village were killed in front of their families. The militants then moved on to setting the whole village on fire. 214 homes, the school, the mosque and the community center were burnt down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haber10.com/haber/129118/ "Başbağlar da 15 yıldır adalet bekliyor"], Haber10, July 6, 2008.

The Başbağlar massacre is considered one of the bloodiest mass killings in the history of the PKK. The massacre, in which those killed were [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]], is believed to have been in retaliation for the [[Sivas massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=sorrow-of-basbaglar-massacre-will-not-be-forgotten-says-minister-2010-07-05|title=Turkish minister remembers victims of Başbağlar massacre|last=|first=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Nearly twenty people were allegedly arrested as part of the investigation, in which two people were jailed and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for being members of the PKK. Turkish authorities claimed that although the PKK apparently claimed responsibility for the attack, during interrogations, jailed PKK leader [[Abdullah Öcalan]] said that he had been unaware of the incident. In 1998 the case was closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikal.com.tr/1998/10/24/turkiye/bas.html "Başbağlar'da geç gelen adalet" (Late justice at Başbağlar)], [[Radikal]], October 24, 1998.

== Reactions ==
On 5 July 2010, the Turkish minister [[Faruk Çelik]] visited Başbağlar to commemorate the day, he said: "No matter how many years pass after this incident, we will never forget this sorrow and those who caused it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=sorrow-of-basbaglar-massacre-will-not-be-forgotten-says-minister-2010-07-05|title=Turkish minister remembers victims of Başbağlar massacre|last=|first=|date=|website=Hürriyet Daily News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''Biomedical technology''' broadly refers to the application of [[engineering]] and [[technology]] principles to the domain of living or biological [[system]]s. Usually inclusion of the term ''biomedical'' denotes a principal emphasis on problems related to human health and diseases, whereas terms like "biotechnology" can be medical, environmental, or agricultural in application. But most terms in this general realm still lack clear boundaries. [[Biomedical engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]] alike are often loosely called ''Biomedical Technology'' or [[Bioengineering]]. The Biomedical technology field is currently growing at a rapid pace. Required jobs for the industry expect to grow 23% by 2024, and with the pay averaging over $86,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Biomedical_Technology.html|title=What Is Biomedical Technology?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the Ugandan poet|Okot p'Bitek}}
'''Bitek''' is a fictional substance mentioned numerous times in [[the Night's Dawn Trilogy]] by [[Peter F. Hamilton]]. Bitek is in essence a supremely advanced "Edenist" [[biotechnology]] which can grow and change shape. Bitek is technically living material, however it is genetically engineered to act similarly to a computer, often "programmed" via affinity (telepathy).

Edenists use bitek for almost everything. For example, a bitek spider can be used to spy on others covertly, since it can have sensors and a broadcaster. Voidhawks (Edenist spaceships) and habitats are almost entirely made of Bitek which are grown from eggs and or seeds respectively, which are later adapted through various means to fill specific roles 
if need be.

Bitek habitats are essentially gigantic living [[biosphere]]s; the Bitek habitats like the Voidhawks are sentient in and off themselves and are controlled through affinity which allows them to readily adapt and to grow functions to suit the needs of their  inhabitants. Bitek habitats usually orbit [[gas giant]]s (for the [[Helium-3]] they contain) and some, e.g. Tranquillity, have the ability to "jump" away from a battle. This tactic is achieved via specialist organs known as "patterning nodes" which open controlled [[wormhole]]s.

[[File:CMAC system block diagram.jpg|thumb|320px|A block diagram of the CMAC system for a single joint. The vector S is presented as input to all joints. Each joint separately computes an S -. A* mapping and a joint actuator signal pi. The adjustable weights for a l l joints may reside in the same physical memory.&lt;ref name="Albus75"&gt;J.S. Albus (1975). "A New Approach to Manipulator Control: the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC)". In: ''Trans. ASME, Series G. Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control'', Vol. 97, pp. 220–233, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The '''cerebellar model arithmetic computer''' (CMAC) is a type of neural network based on a model of the mammalian [[cerebellum]]. It is also known as the cerebellar model articulation controller. It is a type of [[Association (psychology)|associative]] [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Albus (1979). "Mechanisms of Planning and Problem Solving in the Brain". In: ''Mathematical Biosciences''. Vol. 45, pp. 247293, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMAC was first proposed as a function modeler for robotic controllers by [[James Albus]] in 1975&lt;ref name="Albus75"/&gt; (hence the name), but has been extensively used in [[reinforcement learning]] and also as for automated classification in the [[machine learning]] community. CMAC computes a function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1 ... x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of input dimensions. The input space is divided up into hyper-rectangles, each of which is associated with a memory cell. The contents of the memory cells are the weights, which are adjusted during training. Usually, more than one quantisation of input space is used, so that any point in input space is associated with a number of hyper-rectangles, and therefore with a number of memory cells. The output of a CMAC is the algebraic sum of the weights in all the memory cells activated by the input point.

A change of value of the input point results in a change in the set of activated hyper-rectangles, and therefore a change in the set of memory cells participating in the CMAC output. The CMAC output is therefore stored in a distributed fashion, such that the output corresponding to any point in input space is derived from the value stored in a number of memory cells (hence the name associative memory). This provides generalisation.

== Building blocks ==
[[Image:CmacHashing.jpg|thumb|CMAC, represented as a 2D space]]
In the adjacent image, there are two inputs to the CMAC, represented as a 2D space. Two quantising functions have been used to divide this space with two overlapping grids (one shown in heavier lines). A single input is shown near the middle, and this has activated two memory cells, corresponding to the shaded area. If another point occurs close to the one shown, it will share some of the same memory cells, providing generalisation.

The CMAC is trained by presenting pairs of input points and output values, and adjusting the weights in the activated cells by a proportion of the error observed at the output. This simple training algorithm has a proof of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Wong, CMAC Learning is Governed by a Single Parameter, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, San Francisco, Vol. 1, pp. 1439–43, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normal to add a kernel function to the hyper-rectangle, so that points falling towards the edge of a hyper-rectangle have a smaller activation than those falling near the centre.&lt;ref&gt;P.C.E. An, W.T. Miller, and P.C. Parks, Design Improvements in Associative Memories for Cerebellar Model Articulation Controllers, Proc. ICANN, pp. 1207–10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems cited in practical use of CMAC is the memory size required, which is directly related to the number of cells used. This is usually ameliorated by using a [[hash function]], and only providing memory storage for the actual cells that are activated by inputs.

== One-step convergent algorithm  ==
Initially least mean square (LMS) method is employed to update the weights of CMAC. The convergence of using LMS for training CMAC is sensitive to the learning rate and could lead to divergence. In 2004 &lt;ref name="Qin1"&gt;Ting Qin, et al. "A learning algorithm of CMAC based on RLS." Neural Processing Letters 19.1 (2004): 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt;, a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm was introduced to train CMAC online. It does not need to tune a learning rate.  Its convergence has been proved theoretically and can be guaranteed to converge in one step. The computational complexity of this RLS algorithm is O(N3).
[[File:Cmac.jpg|thumb|520x520px|Parallel pipeline structure of CMAC neural network
&lt;ref name="Qin2" /&gt;]]

[[File:Ccmac.jpg|thumb|Left panel: real functions; right panel: CMAC approximation with derivatives|360x360px]]

== Hardware implementation infrastructure ==
Based on QR decomposition, an algorithm (QRLS) has been further simplified to have an O(N) complexity. Consequently, this reduces memory usage and time cost significantly. A parallel pipeline array structure on implementing this algorithm has been introduced&lt;ref name="Qin2"&gt;Ting Qin, et al. "Continuous CMAC-QRLS and its systolic array." Neural Processing Letters 22.1 (2005): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Overall by utilizing QRLS algorithm, the CMAC neural network convergence can be guaranteed, and the weights of the nodes can be updated using one step of training. Its parallel pipeline array structure offers its great potential to be implemented in hardware for large-scale industry usage.

==Continuous CMAC ==
Since the rectangular shape of CMAC receptive field functions produce discontinuous staircase function approximation, by integrating CMAC with B-splines functions, continuous CMAC offers the capability of obtaining any order of derivatives of the approximate functions.
==Deep CMAC ==
In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed that by stacking several shallow structures into a single deep structure, the overall system could achieve better data representation, and, thus, more effectively deal with nonlinear and high complexity tasks. In 2018 &lt;ref&gt;* Yu Tsao, et al. "Adaptive Noise Cancellation Using Deep Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller." IEEE Access Vol. 6, pp. 37395 - 37402, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, a deep CMAC (DCMAC) framework was proposed and a backpropagation algorithm was derived to estimate the DCMAC parameters. Experimental results of an adaptive noise cancellation task showed that the proposed DCMAC can achieve better noise cancellation performance when compared with that from the conventional single-layer CMAC.

'''Conan I''' († 27 June 992) nicknamed ''Le Tort'' (The Crooked) was the [[Duke of Brittany]] from 990 to his death. He was the son of [[Judicael Berengar]], succeeding his father as Count of Rennes in 970.&lt;ref name="ESII-75"&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, [[Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten]], Neue Folge, Band II (Verlag von J. A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 75&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Life==
He assumed the title of Duke of [[Brittany]] in the spring of 990 following his attack on Nantes and the subsequent death of Count Alan.{{sfn|Bachrach 1993 |page=38}}   As duke his rule succeeded the Regency that governed Brittany during the life of [[Drogo, Duke of Brittany|Drogo]] and the fractured rule of Brittany after Drogo's death by his illegitimate brothers [[Hoël I, Duke of Brittany|Hoël]] and [[Guerech, Duke of Brittany|Guerech]], and the latter's son [[Alan, Count of Nantes (988–90)|Alan]].{{sfn|Delumeau|page=141}} The fractured rule over Brittany resulted in a short vacancy in the title [[Duchy of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]]. Conan I had to ally himself with the [[Odo I, Count of Blois]] in order to defeat Judicael Berengar before he could assume the title of Duke.{{sfn|Price|page=370}}
[[File:Mont-Saint-Michel depuis la mer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mont Saint-Michel]], endowed by Conan I, and his final resting place]] 
In a charter dated 28 July 990, Conan gave the lands of [[Villamée]], Lillele and Passille to [[Mont Saint-Michel]], all of which later became part of the seigneury of [[Fougères]]. {{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1994|page=18-19}}

Conan married [[Ermengarde-Gerberga of Anjou]],&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Rodulfus Glaber|Raoul Glaber]] in his ''Histories'' [Bk. II, Ch. 3, para. 4] was openly hostile to Conan and stated that after he married Ermengarde-Gerberga, Fulk Nerra's sister, he was "the most insolent of ''principes'' (Latin: leader, first among his people)." See: Bachrach, ''Fulk Nerra'' (1993),p. 42 &amp; n. 99; Rodulfus Glaber, ''The Five Books of the Histories'', ed. &amp; trans. John France (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1989), pp. 58-61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bachrach 1993|page=42}} in 973, daughter of [[Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou]] and [[Adele of Meaux|Adele of Vermandois]].&lt;ref name="ESII-75"/&gt;

Conan's alliance with the Odo of Blois {{sfn|Delumeau|page=141}}  had helped him defeat Judicael Berengar. However the alliance with Blois became troublesome and he later needed to ''"rid himself of influence from Blois, [which he accomplished by signing] a pact with Richard I of Normandy; [this pact] established firm Breton-Norman links for the first time."'' {{sfn|Price|page=370}} Richard I had married the daughter of Hugh I the Great, and after this marriage had re-asserted his father's claim as Overlord of the Breton duchy. {{sfn|Price|page=370}} Conan I's pact with Normandy strengthened that assertion but the historical documentation for that Overlordship claim remains doubtful because it largely appears only in the less than authoritative writings of Dudo of Saint-Quentin. {{sfn|Price|page=370}} {{efn|Price also refers us to de la Borderie 1898, page 246-248 for a discussion of the relationship between Conan I and Richard I. }}

Conan died fighting his brother-in-law [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou|Fulk Nerra, Count of Anjou]] at the [[Battle of Conquereuil]] on 27 June 992.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard S. Bachrach, ''Warfare and Military Organization in Pre-Crusade Europe'' (Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, UK and Burlington, Vermont, 2002), IX, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Conan is buried at [[Mont Saint-Michel]] [[Abbey]]. {{sfn|Alexander|page=8}}

== Family ==
By his wife Ermengarde-Gerberga he had the following issue:

*[[Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] (c.980-1008), the eventual heir.&lt;ref name="ESII-75"/&gt;
*[[Judith of Brittany|Judith]] (982–1017), married [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]].&lt;ref name="ESII-75"/&gt;
*Judicael, count of [[Porhoët]] (died 1037).&lt;ref name="ESII-75"/&gt;

[[File:ConstantineDillon.jpg|thumb|Constantine Dillon, Nelson Provincial Museum]]
'''Constantine Augustus Dillon''' (14 September 1813 – 16 April 1853) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]], the [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th Lancers]], and the [[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th Dragoons]], a prominent settler of New Zealand, and the fourth son of [[Henry Dillon, 13th Viscount Dillon]].

==Biography==
Constantine Augustus was born in 1813 to the 13th Viscount Dillon and his wife Henrietta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p5114.htm#i51135 |title=Person Page |website=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Colonel Dominick Browne, Governor of the County of Mayo. Through his father he was a descendant of both [[Charles II of England]] (by his mistress [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Palmer]]), and [[James II of England]] (by his mistress [[Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester|Catherine Sedley]]). Dillon had many notable female relations including [[Clementine Churchill]], the Mitford sisters, and [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle]] known as ''The Radical Countess''.

Dillon served as aide-de-camp to [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] during his office in Canada, and also served [[Hugh Fortescue, 2nd Earl Fortescue|Viscount Ebrington]] while he was [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=LT18530521.2.18 |title=Papers Past — Lyttelton Times — 21 May 1853 — DEATH OF THE HON. CONSTANTINE AUGUSTUS DILLON |website=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1842 Dillon married Fanny Dorothea Story, the daughter of Philip Laycock Story and his wife Lydia, the daughter of merchant banker [[Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Lydia-Story/6000000006592170266 |title=Lydia Story (Baring) (1787 - d.) - Genealogy |website=Geni.com |date=2014-12-08 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple sailed to New Zealand on the ''George Fyfe'', arriving in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] on 12 December 1842. On arrival to New Zealand Dillon gained substantial holdings in the [[Waihopai Valley]], known as Leefield, and became a local magistrate.

In 1848 Dillon was appointed civil and military secretary to Governor [[George Grey]] resulting in a brief relocation to [[Auckland]]. In 1850 he returned to Nelson and was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands. In 1851 Dillon was appointed a member of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], New Zealand's upper House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theprow.org.nz/people/constantine-and-fanny-dillon/#.V1oozJN978M |title=Constantine and Fanny Dillon |website=Theprow.org.nz |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 1853, Dillon drowned in the [[Wairau River]] while returning to Nelson with his son from Leefield. As a result, the family returned to [[Oxfordshire]] indefinitely until his eldest surviving son Philip returned to New Zealand to take up the family's {{convert|32000|acre}} estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc05Cycl-t1-body1-d2-d28-d20.html |title=Renwicktown &amp;#124; NZETC |website=Nzetc.victoria.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dillon River (New Zealand)|Dillon River]] was named after him.

[[File:Beethoven Funerals.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Beethoven's funeral as depicted by [[Franz Xaver Stöber]] (1795–1858)]]
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] died in his apartment in the Schwarzspanierhaus (House of the Black Friars), Vienna, on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56, following a prolonged illness. It was witnessed by his sister-in-law and by his close friend [[Anselm Hüttenbrenner]], who provided a vivid description of the event. Beethoven's funeral was held three days later, and the procession was witnessed by a large crowd. He was buried in the cemetery at [[Währing]], although his remains were moved in 1888 to the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]].

Hüttenbrenner's account has been used to ascribe motivations of resistance and anger to Beethoven in his final moments. Beethoven's last words, and the exact cause of Beethoven's death have also been the subject of some historical debate.

==Final illness==
Beethoven suffered declining health throughout the last years of his life, including the so-called "Late period" when he produced some of his most admired work. The last work he was able to complete was the substitute final movement of the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 13, Op. 130]], composed to replace the difficult [[Große Fuge]], which was published separately as Opus 133. Shortly thereafter, in late 1826, illness struck again, with episodes of vomiting and [[diarrhea]] that nearly ended his life.

As it became apparent that Beethoven would not recover, his friends gathered to help and to pay their final respects. Beethoven's doctors conducted four minor operations to relieve [[ascites]] (abdominal swelling), of which the first resulted in infection, the others not. On 24 March he was given his [[last rites]], and on 26 March he slipped into unconsciousness and died. While others, including Beethoven's brother and some friends, were probably in the house, Hüttenbrenner reports in his 1860 account that only he and Beethoven's sister-in-law were present in the room at the time of death.&lt;ref name="ThayerV3_308"/&gt;

===Final words===
{{quote box|width=30%|At this startling, awful peal of thunder, the dying man suddenly raised his head from Hüttenbrenner's arm, stretched out his own right arm majestically—like a general giving orders to an army. This was but for an instant; the arm sunk back; he fell back; Beethoven was dead.|Thayer's summary of Beethoven's death&lt;ref name="ThayerV3_308"&gt;[[#ThayerV3|Thayer (1921), volume 3]], p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beethoven's last recorded words were "Pity, pity—too late!", as the dying composer was told of a gift of twelve bottles of wine from his publisher.&lt;ref name="ThayerV3_307"&gt;[[#ThayerV3|Thayer (1921) volume 3]], p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; One common belief was that his last words were {{Lang|it|"Plaudite, amici, comedia finita est"}} ("Applaud, my friends, the comedy is over"), the typical conclusion to performances of Italian ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''; this was specifically denied by Hüttenbrenner in 1860.&lt;ref name="ThayerV3_306"&gt;[[#ThayerV3|Thayer (1921) volume 3]], p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have listed his last words as, "I shall hear in heaven," apropos his deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/beethoven-dies/|title=Beethoven Dies |website=History Channel on Foxtel|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one account, moments before his death, Beethoven was lying upon bed, pale and suffering, when a man entered. It was fellow composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], who was Beethoven's old and only friend, and one of his contemporaries. Hummel, who had heard of Beethoven's illness, came to him with succor and money. But it was too late; Beethoven was speechless, and a grateful smile was all that he had to bestow upon his friend. Hummel bent toward him, and, by the aid of an acoustic instrument, enabled Beethoven to hear a few words of his compassion and regret. Beethoven seemed reanimated, his eyes shone, he struggled for utterance, and gasped, "Is it not true, Hummel, that I have some talent after all?". After these words, his eyes grew fixed, his mouth fell open, and he passed away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87|title= Last Moments of Beethoven|work=The Guardian|last=|first=|date=1877|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other quotes claimed to be Beethoven's last words are "There, do you hear the bell? Don't you hear it ringing? The curtain must drop. Yes! My curtain is falling." and "I feel as if up to now I had written no more than a few notes."

Another account states that Beethoven received [[last rites]] of the Roman Catholic Church, and said to the priest, "I thank you, Reverend Sir. You have brought me comfort." Shortly thereafter, he apparently lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8xwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67&amp;lpg=PT67&amp;q=There%2C%20do%20you%20hear%20the%20bell%3F%20Don't%20you%20hear%20it%20ringing%3F%20The%20curtain%20must%20drop.%20Yes!%20My%20curtain%20is%20falling.|title=Last and Near-Last Words of the Famous, Infamous and Those In-Between|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beethoven biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]], in his notebook, recorded Hüttenbrenner's account of Beethoven's death.&lt;ref name="ThayerV3_308"/&gt; Hüttenbrenner's eye-witness report is sometimes recast to imply that Beethoven "shook his fist at the heavens" in the moment before death. Since any imputations as to the dying man's emotional state are impossible to verify, they tend to be glossed over or ignored as irrelevant by modern Beethoven scholars.

==Autopsy and post-mortem findings==
[[File:Beethovendeathmask.jpg|thumb|Death mask by Josef Dannhauser]]
An [[autopsy]] was performed on 27 March 1827 by Dr. Johann Wagner. While it is unclear who ordered the autopsy, a specific request by Beethoven in his [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] may have played a role in the decision.&lt;ref name="Meredith1"&gt;[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 1 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy revealed a severely cirrhotic and shrunken [[liver]], of which [[ascites]] is a common consequence. Scholars disagree over whether Beethoven's liver damage was the result of heavy alcohol consumption, hepatic infection, or both. [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] are causes of cirrhosis, but they spread from contact with contaminated body fluids and were extremely rare in Beethoven's day. [[Hepatitis A]] on the other hand can be contracted from food and water that were not handled properly and was very common in the 19th century, although it does not cause liver cirrhosis or permanent organ damage.

Heavy metal contamination is thought to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally fortified wine. Putting [[lead sugar]] into wine was a very common practice to sweeten cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well.

The autopsy indicated damage to his aural nerves as well as hardening of their accompanying arteries, although the latter appears to be consistent with natural aging and not inflammatory damage from [[syphilis]]. Beethoven's brain was described as possessing "exaggerated folds", an excess of fluid in the skull, and some thickening of the membranes inside the left ventricle. Scholars believe he may have had a degree of cerebral atrophy, although he showed no sign of cognitive impairment to the end. The skull was described as "possessing unusual thickness".

Beethoven's kidneys had calcareous growths in them, indicating that he was likely developing [[renal papillary necrosis]] (RPN), a common result of [[analgesic]] abuse (it is known that he used large amounts of various drugs obtained from his brother Johann, a [[pharmacist]]). Diabetes is also a cause of RPN, and scholars have not ruled out the possibility that the composer had [[diabetes mellitus]]. His [[spleen]] was swollen to twice the normal size and he had [[portal hypertension]], all consistent with end-stage liver failure. He also appears to have had severe [[pancreatitis]], as the doctors described his [[pancreas]] as "shrunken and fibrous", with the exit duct being very thin and narrowed. Large amounts of reddish fluid had accumulated in Beethoven's abdomen, likely from spontaneous bacterial infections mixed with some blood. This was possibly a result of draining fluid from his abdomen in his last days, a practice that frequently caused infection and often death of the patient in a time before antibiotics and bacterial pathology were known.

In the days immediately preceding and following his death, a number of people, including [[Anton Schindler]] and [[Ferdinand Hiller]], cut locks of hair from Beethoven's head. Most of Hiller's lock is now in the Center for Beethoven Studies at [[San Jose State University]].&lt;ref name="Meredith2"&gt;[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 2 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Beethoven's friends incorrectly thought that "strangers had cut all of his hair off"; in fact, the apparent lack of hair was due to a cloth cap that covered the hair while the body was lying in state.&lt;ref name="Meredith3"&gt;[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 3 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1827, castings for a [[death mask]] were taken.&lt;ref name="Meredith2"/&gt; The body was clothed and placed in an oaken coffin, with the head given a wreath of white roses. Beethoven's hands held a wax cross and a lily.&lt;ref name="Meredith3"/&gt;

In 1970 Dr. John Spencer Madden,&lt;ref name="maddenobit"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/4/369.extract|title=Obituary: J. S. Madden|accessdate=18 February 2014|date=12 June 2012|first=Bruce|last=Ritson|issue=4|volume=47|doi=10.1093/alcalc/ags061|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|pages=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; the editor of the journal ''[[Alcohol and Alcoholism]]'' wrote a post-mortem analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|volume=5|pages=101&amp;ndash;103|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/3/101.citation|year=1970|issue=3|accessdate=18 February 2014|title=Ludwig van Beethoven|last=Madden|first=John Spencer|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a045900}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; This post-mortem became well known by being referenced by a short comical essay by the humorist [[Alan Coren]] entitled "Careful, Mr. Beethoven, that was your fifth!"&lt;ref name="maddenobit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|date=27 November 2008|first=Peter|last=Moss|title=Review: Chocolate and Cuckoo clocks: The Essential Alan Coren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral and burial==
[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumbnail|Beethoven's grave]]
The funeral was held on 29 March 1827 at the parish church in [[Alsergrund]], and he was buried in the [[Währing]] cemetery, northwest of Vienna. Many thousands of citizens lined the streets for the funeral procession. As with all crowds, estimates vary, with witnesses reporting anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 onlookers.&lt;ref name="Gibbs139"&gt;[[#Gibbs|Gibbs (2000)]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Theaters were closed, and many notable artists participated in the funeral procession as pallbearers or torch bearers, including [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Carl Czerny]], and [[Franz Schubert]].&lt;ref name="Gibbs139"/&gt; At a memorial mass in a Vienna church on 3 April, [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart's Requiem]] was sung with an additional [[Libera me]] by [[Ignaz von Seyfried]].

In the days following the funeral, one of the grave-diggers was reportedly offered a substantial sum of money to remove the head from the grave. As a result, Beethoven's friends had a watch put on the grave.&lt;ref name="Meredith3"/&gt;

In 1863 Beethoven's body (and also that of Schubert, who was buried nearby) was exhumed, studied and reburied, in proceedings paid for by the [[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]].&lt;ref name="Meredith4"&gt;[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 4 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, fragments from the back of his skull, which had been separated during the autopsy, were acquired by the Austrian doctor Romeo Seligmann, which are also now in the Center for Beethoven Studies. His remains were moved in 1888 to the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Meredith5_6_17"&gt;[[#Meredith|Meredith]], pp. 5–6, 17 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead poisoning overdose==
There is dispute about the cause of Beethoven's death; alcoholic [[cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[hepatitis A|infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F.M.|last=Mai|title=Beethoven's terminal illness and death|journal=J R Coll Physicians Edinb.|volume= 36|date=1 October 2006|pages=258–263 |url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;term=Beethoven%27s+terminal+illness+and+death&amp;log$=activity | issue=3|pmid=17214130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Austria]]n [[Pathology|pathologist]] Christian Reiter asserted that Beethoven's doctor, Andreas Wawruch, accidentally killed the composer by giving him an overdose of a lead-based cure. According to Reiter, Wawruch used the cure to alleviate fluid in the abdomen; the lead penetrated Beethoven's [[liver]] and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/28/AR2007082800980_pf.html

|accessdate =29 December 2008
|last = Jahn
|first = George
|date = 28 August 2007
|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiter's hypothesis however is at odds with Dr. Wawruch's written instruction "that the wound was kept dry all the time". Furthermore, human hair is a very bad biomarker for lead contamination, and Reiter's hypothesis must be considered dubious as long as proper scholarly documentation remains unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Josef|last=Eisinger|title=The lead in Beethoven's hair|journal=Toxicological &amp; Environmental Chemistry|volume= 90|date=1 January 2008|pages=1–5|doi=10.1080/02772240701630588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Dr. Andrew C. Todd, of the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in New York City tested two pieces of Beethoven's skull for lead, and determined that the concentration of lead was no greater than would be expected for a normal man of 56 at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/music/29skull.html "Beethoven May Not Have Died of Lead Poisoning, After All"] by [[James Barron (journalist)|James Barron]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading cause of death still remains lead poisoning, however. M. H. Stevens and his team have concluded that high levels of lead deep in the bone sampled from Beethoven's skull suggest repeated exposure over a long period of time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=M. H.|last=Stevens|title=Lead and the deafness of Ludwig van Beethoven|journal=Laryngoscope|volume=123|issue=11|date=November 2013|pages=2854–2858|doi=10.1002/lary.24120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natalee Ann Holloway''' (October 21, 1986 – c. May 30, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] woman whose disappearance made international news after she vanished on May 30, 2005, while on a high school graduation trip to [[Aruba]] in the [[Caribbean]]. Holloway lived in [[Mountain Brook, Alabama|Mountain Brook]], [[Alabama]], and graduated from [[Mountain Brook High School]] on May 24, 2005, shortly before the trip.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2005-06-02" /&gt; Her disappearance caused a [[sensationalism|media sensation]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" /&gt; and the case remains unsolved.

Holloway was scheduled to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight.&lt;ref name="Court TV 2005-06-08" /&gt; She was last seen by her classmates outside of [[Carlos'n Charlie's]], a restaurant and [[nightclub]] in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-09" /&gt; She was in a car with local residents [[Joran van der Sloot]] and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /&gt; Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime.&lt;ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /&gt; Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a [[boycott]] of Aruba, which gained [[Governor of Alabama|Alabama Governor]] [[Bob Riley]]'s support but failed to gain widespread backing.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatSupport" /&gt;

With the assistance of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive [[search and rescue]]/recovery operation. American [[special agent]]s from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]],&lt;ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /&gt; fifty [[Netherlands Army|Dutch soldiers]] and three specially-equipped [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Dutch Air Force]] [[F-16]] aircraft participated in the search.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, F16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="demonstration" /&gt; In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body.&lt;ref name="divers" /&gt; Her remains were not found.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2006-05-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcohol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" /&gt; On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2007-12-19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today 2007-12-18" /&gt; The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, under the influence of [[marijuana]], saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2008-02-03" /&gt; Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name="Fox News 2008-11-24" /&gt; He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].

At the request of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King declared Holloway [[legally dead]] ''[[Declared death in absentia|in absentia]]'' on January 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natalee Holloway declared dead by judge six years after disappearance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/12/natalee-holloway-declared-legally-dead|work=The Guardian|accessdate=October 19, 2012|location=London|date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

[[File:MBHSfront.jpg|thumb|[[Mountain Brook High School]], where Holloway graduated just before her ill-fated trip to Aruba]]

Holloway was the first of two children born to Dave and [[Beth Holloway|Elizabeth "Beth" Holloway]] (1961–) in [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]], [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="AP 2006-04-25" /&gt; Her parents divorced in 1993, and she and her younger brother Matthew were raised by their mother. In 2000, Beth married George "Jug" Twitty, a prominent [[Alabama]] businessman; and the family moved to [[Mountain Brook, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="DHolloway 2006, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /&gt; Holloway graduated with honors from [[Mountain Brook High School]], located in a wealthy suburb of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. She was a member of the [[National Honor Society]] and the school [[dance squad]] and participated in other extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name="dependable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reward" /&gt; Holloway was scheduled to attend the [[University of Alabama]] on a full scholarship,&lt;ref name="HansenSearch" /&gt; where she planned to pursue a [[Pre-medical|pre-med track]].&lt;ref name="ABC News 2005–06-08" /&gt; At the time of his daughter's disappearance, Dave Holloway was an insurance agent for [[State Farm Insurance|State Farm]] in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], while Beth Twitty was employed by the [[Mountain Brook School System]].&lt;ref name="DHolloway 2006, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="State Farm Dave Holloway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-08-18" /&gt;

== Disappearance in Aruba ==

On Thursday, May 26, 2005, Holloway and 124 fellow graduates of Mountain Brook High School arrived in Aruba for a five-day, unofficial graduation trip.&lt;ref name="dependable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Court TV 2005-06-07" /&gt; The teenagers were accompanied by seven [[chaperone (social)|chaperone]]s.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; According to teacher and chaperone Bob Plummer, the chaperones met with the students each day to make sure everything was fine.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-02-24" /&gt; Jodi Bearman, who organized the trip, stated, "the chaperones were not supposed to keep up with their every move."&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FNCThree" /&gt; [[Police Commissioner]] Gerold Dompig, who headed the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, stated that the Mountain Brook students engaged in "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night. We know the [[Holiday Inn]] told them they weren't welcome next year. Natalee, we know, she drank all day every day. We have statements she started every morning with cocktails—so much drinking that Natalee didn't show up for breakfast two mornings."&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; Two of Holloway's classmates, Liz Cain and Claire Fierman, "agreed that the drinking was kind of excessive."&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt;

Holloway was last seen by her classmates around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Monday, May 30, as she was leaving the [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] bar and [[nightclub]] [[Carlos'n Charlie's]].&lt;ref name="Court TV 2005-06-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI Holloway" /&gt; She left in a car with 17-year-old [[Joran van der Sloot]]—a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] honors student who was living in Aruba and attending the [[International School of Aruba]]—&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-05" /&gt; and his two [[Suriname]]se friends, 21-year-old Deepak Kalpoe (the owner of the car)&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt; and 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News 2006-02-17" /&gt; Holloway was scheduled to fly home later that day, but she didn't appear for her return flight.&lt;ref name="Court TV 2005-06-08" /&gt; Her packed luggage and her passport were found in her Holiday Inn room.&lt;ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; Aruban authorities initiated searches for Holloway throughout the island and surrounding waters but did not find her.&lt;ref name="CNN 2006-05-31" /&gt;

== Investigation ==

=== Early investigation ===

Immediately following Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty and friends flew to Aruba by [[private jet]].&lt;ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /&gt; Within four hours of landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2006-02-23" /&gt; Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape.&lt;ref name="HansenSearch" /&gt; The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house:&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the [[California Lighthouse]] area of [[Arashi Beach]] because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="3More" /&gt; According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help.&lt;ref name="3More" /&gt; He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.&lt;ref name="3More" /&gt;

[[File:CarlosnCharlies Oranjestad, Aruba.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos'n Charlie's]] in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]]. The restaurant was the last place Holloway was seen by her classmates.]]

The [[search and rescue]] efforts for Holloway began immediately. Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined in the effort. During the first days of the search, the Aruban government gave thousands of [[civil servant]]s the day off to participate in the rescue effort.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /&gt; Fifty [[Dutch marines]] conducted an extensive search of the shoreline.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-06" /&gt; Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams.&lt;ref name="demonstration" /&gt; Beth Twitty was provided with housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she coincidentally stayed in the same room her daughter had occupied.&lt;ref name="lighton" /&gt; She subsequently stayed at the nearby [[Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts|Wyndham Hotel]]'s presidential suite.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

Reports indicated that Holloway did not appear on any nighttime [[surveillance camera]] footage of her hotel's lobby;&lt;ref name="NewDNat" /&gt; however, Twitty has made varying statements as to whether the cameras were operational that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by Twitty, the video cameras at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished.&lt;ref name="NewDNat" /&gt; Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-12-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BethBook" /&gt; Police Commissioner Jan van der Straaten —the initial head of the investigation until his 2005 retirement— said that Holloway did not have to go through the lobby to return to her room.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-02" /&gt;

The search for physical evidence was extensive and subject to occasional false leads; for example, a possible blood sample taken from Deepak Kalpoe's car was tested but determined not to be blood.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-13" /&gt;

From the early days of the investigation, American law enforcement participated in wide-ranging involvement in the case. [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] stated to reporters that the U.S. was in constant contact with Aruban authorities. Another [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official indicated, "Substantial resources are being applied to this as they &lt;nowiki&gt;[Aruba officials]&lt;/nowiki&gt; continue to ask for more."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-15" /&gt;

=== 2005 arrests of multiple suspects===

On June 5, Aruban police detained Nick John and Abraham Jones, former [[security guard]]s&lt;ref name="CBS News 2005-06-09" /&gt; from the nearby [[Allegro Resorts Corporation|Allegro Hotel]]&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-09" /&gt; (which was then closed for renovation)&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-04" /&gt; on suspicion of murder and kidnapping.&lt;ref name="MSBNC 2005-06-09" /&gt; Authorities have never officially disclosed the reason for their arrests; but, according to news accounts, statements made by Van der Sloot and Kalpoe may have been a factor in the arrests of John and Jones.&lt;ref name="Oglesby 2005-06-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-26" /&gt; Reports also indicated that the two former guards were known for cruising hotels to [[Pickup artist|pick up women]], and at least one of them had a prior incident with law enforcement.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2005-06-10" /&gt; John and Jones were released on June 13 without being charged.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt;

On June 9, 2005, Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Holloway.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-06-13" /&gt; Aruban law allows for investigators to make an arrest based on serious suspicion. In order to continue holding the suspect in custody, an increasing evidential burden must be met at periodic reviews.&lt;ref name="MSBNC 2005-06-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /&gt; According to Dompig, the focus of the investigation centered on these three suspects from the "get-go".&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt; Dompig stated that close observation of the three men began three days after Holloway was reported missing, and the investigation included [[surveillance]], telephone [[wiretap]]s, and even monitoring of their e-mail.&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt; Dompig indicated that pressure from Holloway's family caused the police to prematurely stop their surveillance and detain the three suspects.&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt;

As the investigation continued, David Cruz—spokesman for the Aruban [[Justice ministry|Minister of Justice]]—falsely indicated on June 11 that Holloway was dead and that authorities knew the location of her body.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /&gt; Cruz later retracted the statement, saying he was a victim of a "misinformation campaign."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /&gt; That evening, Dompig alleged to the [[Associated Press]] that one of the detained young men admitted "something bad happened" to Holloway after the suspects took her to the beach and that the suspect was leading police to the scene.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /&gt; The next morning, prosecution spokeswoman Vivian van der Biezen refused to confirm or deny the allegation, simply stating that the investigation was at a "very crucial, very important moment."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-06-11" /&gt;

On Friday, June 17, a sixth person later identified as [[disc jockey]] Steve Gregory Croes was also arrested. Van der Straaten told the media that "Croes was detained based on information from one of the other three detainees."&lt;ref name="FNCThree" /&gt; On June 22, Aruban police detained Joran's father Paulus van der Sloot for questioning; Paulus was arrested that same day. Both Paulus van der Sloot and Croes were ordered to be released on June 26.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt;

During this period, the suspects who had been detained changed their stories.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt; All three suspects indicated that Van der Sloot and Holloway were dropped off at the [[Marriott Hotel]] beach near the fishermen's huts. Van der Sloot stated that he did not harm Holloway but left her on the beach.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-08-02" /&gt; According to Satish Kalpoe's attorney, David Kock, Van der Sloot called Deepak Kalpoe to tell the latter that he was walking home and sent him a text message forty minutes later.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-06-25" /&gt; At some time during the interrogation, Van der Sloot detailed a third account that he was dropped off at home and Holloway was driven off by the Kalpoe brothers.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; Dompig discounted the story, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This latest story [came] when [Van der Sloot] saw the other guys, the Kalpoes, were kind of finger-pointing in his direction, and he wanted to screw them also, by saying he was dropped off. But that story doesn't check out at all. He just wanted to screw Deepak. They had great arguments about this in front of the judge. Because their stories didn't match. This girl, she was from Alabama, she's not going to stay in the car with two black kids. We believe the second story, that they were dropped off by the Marriott.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following hearings before a judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released on Monday, July 4; but Van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2005-06-04" /&gt;

=== Continued search, rearrests and releases ===

[[File:NataleeHollowaySearch.jpg|thumb|[[Netherlands Marine Corps|Dutch Marines]] searching for Holloway near the [[California Lighthouse]] ]]

On July 4, the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] deployed three [[F-16]] aircraft equipped with [[infrared]] sensors to aid in the search, but the results came up empty.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, F16" /&gt; In March 2006 it was reported that satellite photos were being compared with photographs taken more recently (presumably from the F-16s) in an attempt to find unexpected shifts of ground that might be Holloway's grave.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2006-01-17" /&gt;

After an individual ("the gardener"&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-07-27" /&gt;) came forward with information, a small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30, 2005. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Van der Sloot attempting to hide his face as he drove into the Racquet Club with the Kalpoe brothers on the very early morning of May 30 between 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2005-07-27" /&gt; [[Nancy Grace]] described the gardener as "the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open".&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-08-12" /&gt; Another person, "the jogger",&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt; claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a [[landfill]] during the afternoon of May 30.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-31" /&gt; The police had searched the landfill in the days following Holloway's disappearance.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2005-07-31" /&gt; After the jogger's statements, the landfill was searched three more times; the FBI used [[Search and rescue dog|cadaver dogs]] to assist in the recovery operation.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-08-01" /&gt; The searches were fruitless.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

Following Holloway's disappearance on May 30, 2005, the family offered $175,000 and donors offered $50,000 for her safe return.&lt;ref name="reward" /&gt; Two months later, the reward was increased from $200,000 to $1,000,000, with a $100,000 reward for information leading to the location of her remains.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-07-26" /&gt; In August 2005, the reward for information leading to Natalee's corpse was increased from $100,000 to $250,000.&lt;ref name="FCN-20050809" /&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] announced that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence. Investigators found a piece of [[duct tape]] with strands of blond hair attached to it; the samples were tested at a Dutch lab. A group from the Aruban police and prosecutor's office then traveled to the FBI central laboratory at [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], [[Virginia]], to consult with American investigators. The hair samples were then tested a second time.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-07-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-07-18" /&gt; The FBI announced that the hair samples did not belong to Holloway.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-07-29" /&gt;

The Kalpoe brothers were rearrested on August 26 along with another new suspect, 21-year-old Freddy Arambatzis.&lt;ref name="divers" /&gt; Arambatzis' lawyer said that his client was suspected of taking photographs of an underage girl and also of having inappropriate physical contact with the same girl. This incident allegedly occurred before the Holloway disappearance. Arambatzis' friends Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were supposedly involved in the incident. Van der Sloot's mother, Anita van der Sloot, stated, "It's a desperate attempt to get the boys to talk. But there is nothing to talk about."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-09-01" /&gt; While no public explanation was then made for the Kalpoe rearrests, Dompig later said that it was an unsuccessful attempt to pressure the Kalpoe brothers into confessing.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

On September 3, 2005, the four detained suspects were released by a judge despite the attempts of the prosecution to keep them in custody. The suspects were released on the condition that they remain available to police.&lt;ref name="AMW 2008-02-15" /&gt; On September 14, all restrictions on them were removed by the [[Combined Appeals Court of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba]].&lt;ref name="timeline1" /&gt;

In the months following his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained his version of events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with [[Fox News]] that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted to have sex with him, but he did not because he didn't have a [[condom]].&lt;ref name="ABC News 2006-02-22" /&gt; Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that he had to go to school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;am and left Holloway sitting on the beach.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-03-01" /&gt; In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2005-08-24" /&gt; Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-03-01" /&gt;

In January 2006, the FBI and Aruban authorities interviewed—or in some cases, re-interviewed—several of Holloway's fellow classmates in Alabama.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-01-27" /&gt; On January 17, Aruban police searched for Holloway's body in sand dunes on the northwest coast of Aruba, as well as areas close by the Marriott beach.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2006-03-29" /&gt; Additional searches took place in March and April 2006, without result.&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt;

Shortly before leaving the case, Dompig gave an interview to [[CBS]] in which he stated that he believed Holloway probably died from alcohol and/or drug poisoning, was not murdered, and that someone later hid her body. Dompig also stated that Aruba had spent about $3&amp;nbsp;million on the investigation, which was about 40% of the police operational budget.&lt;ref name="dompigalcohol" /&gt; Dompig indicated that there was evidence that pointed to possession (though not necessarily use) of illicit drugs by Holloway.&lt;ref name="Alcohol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-03-24" /&gt; Members of Holloway's family have denied that she used drugs.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2006-03-24" /&gt;

On April 11, 2006, Dave Holloway published his book—co-authored with R. Stephanie Good and [[Larry Garrison]]—called ''[[Aruba: The Tragic Untold Story of Natalee Holloway and Corruption in Paradise]]'', that recounted the search for his daughter.&lt;ref name="DHolloway 2006, ch. Everybody's Child / Aruba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News 2006-04-11" /&gt;

=== 2006 arrests of new suspects; Dutch investigation takeover ===
On April 15, 2006, Geoffrey von Cromvoirt was arrested by Aruban authorities on suspicion of criminal offenses related to [[illegal drug trade|dealing in narcotics]] which, according to the prosecutor, might have been related to the disappearance of Holloway.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2006-04-17" /&gt; At his first court appearance, his detention was extended by eight days. Von Cromvoirt was released, however, on April 25.&lt;ref name="Cromvoirt" /&gt; In addition, another individual with initials "A.B." was arrested on April 22, but was released the same day.&lt;ref name="Cromvoirt" /&gt;

On May 17, 2006, another suspect, Guido Wever (the son of a former Aruban politician) was detained in [[the Netherlands]] on suspicion of assisting in the abducting, battering, and killing of Holloway.&lt;ref name="CNN 2006-05-22" /&gt; Wever was questioned for six days in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Aruban prosecutors initially sought his transfer to the island, but he was instead released by agreement between the prosecutor and Wever's attorney.&lt;ref name="Wever" /&gt;

At Aruba's request, the Netherlands took over the investigation. Following receipt of extensive case documentation in [[Rotterdam]], a team of the [[Korps landelijke politiediensten|Dutch National Police]] started work on the case in September 2006 .&lt;ref name="KLPD" /&gt; On April 16, 2007, a combined Aruban–Dutch team began pursuing the investigation in Aruba.&lt;ref name="KLPD" /&gt;

=== Book, search, and inspection ===

A book by Van der Sloot and reporter Zvezdana Vukojevic, ''[[De zaak Natalee Holloway]]'' (''The Case of Natalee Holloway'') was published in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in April 2007.&lt;ref name="Van der Sloot 2007" /&gt; In the book, Van der Sloot gives his perspective of the night Holloway disappeared and the media frenzy that followed. He admits to and apologizes for his initial untruths, but maintains his innocence.&lt;ref name="ABC/Brouwer 2007-11-28" /&gt;

On April 27, 2007, a new search involving approximately 20 investigators was launched at the Van der Sloot family residence in Aruba.&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 2007-04-30" /&gt; Dutch authorities searched the yard and surrounding area, using shovels and thin metal rods to penetrate the dirt.&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /&gt; Prosecution spokeswoman Van der Biezen stated, "The investigation has never stopped and the Dutch authorities are completely reviewing the case for new indications."&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /&gt; A statement from the prosecutor's office related, "The team has indications that justify a more thorough search."&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /&gt; Investigators did not comment on what prompted the new search,&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-04-27" /&gt; except that it was not related to Van der Sloot's book.&lt;ref name="KLPD" /&gt; According to Paulus van der Sloot, "nothing suspicious" was found, and all that was seized were diary entries of him and his wife, and his personal computer—which was subsequently returned.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2007-05-01" /&gt; According to [[Jossy Mansur]], managing editor of Aruba's ''[[Diario (Aruba)|Diario]]'' newspaper, investigators were following up on statements made during early suspect interrogations regarding communications between the Kalpoe brothers and Van der Sloot. He also said investigators could be seen examining a laptop at the house.&lt;ref name="NBC News May 2007" /&gt;

On May 12, 2007, the Kalpoe family home was subject to a search.&lt;ref name="KBrosNBC" /&gt; The two brothers were detained for about an hour upon objecting to the entry by police and Dutch investigators, but were released when the authorities left.&lt;ref name="KBrosNBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KBrosFOX" /&gt; According to Kock, the brothers objected to the search because officials did not show them an order justifying the intrusion. A statement from Van der Biezen did not mention what, if anything, officials were searching for, but indicated nothing was removed from the home.&lt;ref name="KBrosNBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KBrosFOX" /&gt; A subsequent statement from Het Openbaar Ministerie van Aruba (the Aruban prosecutor's office) indicated that the purpose of the visit was to "get a better image of the place or circumstances where an offense may have been committed and to understand the chain of events leading to the offense."&lt;ref name="Antilliaans Dagblad 2007-05-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RNW 2007-05-14" /&gt;

=== 2007 rearrests and re-releases ===

Aruban investigators cited what was described as newly discovered evidence, and Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were rearrested November 21, 2007, on suspicion of involvement in "[[manslaughter]] and causing serious bodily harm that resulted in the death of Holloway."&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /&gt; Van der Sloot was detained by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands, while the Kalpoe brothers were detained in Aruba.&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /&gt; Van der Sloot returned to Aruba and was incarcerated.&lt;ref name="AP 2007-11-22, 3 re-arrested" /&gt;

In November 2007, Dave Holloway announced a new search for his daughter that probed the sea beyond the original {{convert|330|ft|m|adj=on}} depths in which earlier searches had taken place.&lt;ref name="AP/Wever 2007-11-22, search" /&gt; That search involved a vessel called the ''Persistence'' and was abandoned due to lack of funds at the end of February 2008, when nothing of significance was found.&lt;ref name="sowhatelseisnew" /&gt;

On November 30, 2007, a judge ordered the release of Satish and Deepak Kalpoe, despite attempts by the prosecution to extend their detention.&lt;ref name="APKrelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NovRelease" /&gt; The two brothers were released on the following day.&lt;ref name="CNN 2007-12-01" /&gt; The prosecution appealed the Kalpoes' release, which was denied on December 5, 2007, with the court writing, "Notwithstanding expensive and lengthy investigations on her disappearance and on people who could be involved, the file against the suspect does not contain direct indications that Natalee passed away due to a violent crime."&lt;ref name="USA Today 2007-12-05" /&gt; Van der Sloot was released without charge on December 7, 2007, due to lack of evidence implicating him as well as a lack of evidence that Holloway died as the result of a violent crime. The prosecution indicated it would not appeal.&lt;ref name="CNN 2007-12-07" /&gt;

On December 18, 2007, prosecutor Hans Mos officially declared the case closed, and that no charges would be filed due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="Newsweek 2008-02-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="People 2007-12-18" /&gt; The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Van der Sloot (though they legally ceased to be suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a [[chat room]] message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from [[Papiamento]] to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway.&lt;ref name="KBrosUSA" /&gt; Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, "Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one of these kids, there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore."&lt;ref name="ceeya" /&gt;

===Dutch television programme===
On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime reporter [[Peter R. de Vries]] claimed that he had solved the Holloway case.&lt;ref name="confession" /&gt; De Vries stated that he would tell all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3.&lt;ref name="confession" /&gt; On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that he was telling the individual what he wanted to hear, and that he had no role in her disappearance.&lt;ref name="denial" /&gt; That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2008-02-03" /&gt;

The broadcast, aired on February 3, 2008, included excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones in the vehicle of [[Patrick van der Eem]], a Dutch businessman and ex-convict&lt;ref name="stoner" /&gt; who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van der Sloot was seen smoking [[marijuana]]&lt;ref name="DutchNews 2008-02-03" /&gt; and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van der Sloot stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van der Sloot to go home and who disposed of the body.&lt;ref name="denial1" /&gt; An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in [[Rotterdam]] at school.&lt;ref name="daury" /&gt;

The Aruban prosecutor's office attempted to obtain an [[arrest warrant]] for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request.&lt;ref name="DutchNews 2008-01-04" /&gt; The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="RNW 2008-02-15" /&gt; The appeals court held that the statements on the tape were inconsistent with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.&lt;ref name="ruling" /&gt;

On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot met with Aruban investigators in the Netherlands and denied that what he said on the tape was true, stating that he was under the influence of marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.&lt;ref name="stoner" /&gt;

In March 2008, news reports indicated that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban television. Van der Eem, under the impression that cameras had been turned off, disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), that he expects to become a millionaire through his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body—and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand [[euro]]s to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]], Van der Eem, who had already signed a book deal, "was furious" after learning of the taping, and "threatened" the interviewer, who sought legal advice.&lt;ref name="DutchNews 2008-03-07" /&gt; Van der Eem's book ''Overboord'' (''Overboard''),&lt;ref name="nl dictionary" /&gt; co-written with E.E. Byars, was released (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) on June 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="moreboo" /&gt; Van der Eem was arrested on December 13, 2008, in the Netherlands for allegedly hitting his girlfriend with a crowbar and engaging in risky driving behavior while fleeing police.&lt;ref name="AD Van der Eem" /&gt;

The De Vries broadcast was discussed in a seminar by Dutch legal [[psychologist]] [[Willem Albert Wagenaar]], who indicated that the statements did not constitute a confession. Wagenaar criticized De Vries for broadcasting the material, stating that the broadcast made it harder to obtain a conviction, and had De Vries turned over the material to the authorities without broadcasting it, they would have held "all the trumps" in questioning Van der Sloot. Wagenaar opined that not only was the case not solved, it was not even clear that a crime had been committed. Professor Crisje Brants, in the same seminar, also criticized De Vries' methods.&lt;ref name="RNW 2008-02-11" /&gt;

On November 24, 2008, [[Fox News]] aired an interview with Van der Sloot in which he alleged that he sold Holloway into [[sexual slavery]], receiving money both when Holloway was taken, and later on to keep quiet. Van der Sloot also alleged that his father paid off two police officers who had learned that Holloway was taken to [[Venezuela]]. Van der Sloot later retracted the statements made in the interview.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2008-11-24" /&gt; The show also aired part of an audio recording provided by Van der Sloot, which he alleged is a phone conversation between him and his father, in which the father displays knowledge of his son's purported involvement in [[human trafficking]]. According to Mos, this voice heard on the recording is not that of Paulus van der Sloot—the Dutch newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' reports that the "father's" voice is almost certainly that of Joran van der Sloot himself, trying to speak in a lower tone.&lt;ref name="Telegraaf" /&gt; Paulus van der Sloot died of a heart attack on February 10, 2010.&lt;ref name="RNW 2010-02-11" /&gt;

On March 20, 2009, Dave Holloway transported a search dog to Aruba to search a small [[reservoir]] in the northern part of the island. The reservoir was previously identified by a supposed witness as a possible location of Natalee's remains. Aruban authorities indicated that they had no new information in the case, but that Holloway had been given permission to conduct the search.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2009-03-20" /&gt;

On February 23, 2010, it was reported that Van der Sloot had stated in an interview (first offered to [[RTL Group]] in 2009) that he had disposed of Holloway's body in a [[marsh]] on Aruba.  New chief prosecutor Peter Blanken indicated that authorities had investigated the latest story, and had dismissed it.  Blanken stated that the "locations, names, and times he gave just did not make sense."&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2010-02-23" /&gt;

In March 2010, underwater searches were conducted by Aruban authorities after an American couple reported&lt;ref name="National Ledger 2010-03-27" /&gt; that they were snorkeling when they photographed what they thought might be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway.  Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-03-24" /&gt;

=== Van der Sloot's extortion of Holloway family ===

On March 29, 2010, Van der Sloot contacted John Q. Kelly, Beth Twitty's legal representative, with an offer to reveal the location of Holloway's body and the circumstances surrounding her death, if he were given advance of [[United States dollar|US$]]25,000 against a total of $250,000.&lt;ref name="CNN-interpol-extortion" /&gt; After Kelly notified the FBI, they arranged to proceed with the transaction.&lt;ref name="Fox-20100611-holloway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ET-20100609-fbi" /&gt; On May 10, Van der Sloot had a $15,000 [[wire transfer|wire]] transferred to his account in the Netherlands, following the receipt of $10,000 in cash that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba.&lt;ref name="Fox-extortion-details" /&gt; Authorities stated that the information that he provided in return was false because the house in which he said Holloway's body was located had not yet been built at the time of her disappearance.&lt;ref name="CNN-20100609-sting" /&gt; On June 3, Van der Sloot was charged in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama|U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama]] with [[extortion]] and [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref name="WSFA-extortion" /&gt; [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Joyce White Vance]] obtained an [[arrest warrant]] and transmitted it to [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name="interpol Van Der Sloot wanted" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-alabama" /&gt; On June 30, Van der Sloot was indicted on the charges.&lt;ref name="WHNT-20100630-indict" /&gt;

At the request of the [[United States Justice Department|U.S. Justice Department]], authorities conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands. One of the homes belonged to reporter [[Jaap Amesz]], who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of criminal activities by Van der Sloot.&lt;ref name="AOL-holloways-mom" /&gt; Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found.&lt;ref name="GMA-20100611-rotten" /&gt; Dave Holloway returned to Aruba on June 14 to pursue possible new clues.&lt;ref name="AP-20100614-aruba" /&gt;

=== Van der Sloot's murder of Stephany Flores in Peru ===

On May 30, 2010—five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, a 21-year-old business student, was reported missing in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in Van der Sloot's name.&lt;ref name="CNN-Google" /&gt; On June 3, Van der Sloot was arrested in [[Chile]] on a murder charge and [[Extradition|extradited]] to Peru the next day.&lt;ref name="AP-in-peru" /&gt; On June 7, Peruvian authorities said that Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to Holloway.&lt;ref name="CNN-Holloway-link" /&gt; Police chief César Guardia related that Van der Sloot told Peruvian police that he knew where Holloway's body was and offered to help Aruban authorities find it.&lt;ref name="Fox-20100611-holloway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-06-11" /&gt; However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided.&lt;ref name="FWST 2010-06-10" /&gt; On June 11, Van der Sloot was charged in Lima Superior Court with [[murder|first-degree murder]] and [[robbery]].&lt;ref name="CBS5-20100611-charged" /&gt; On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview Van der Sloot at [[National Penitentiary Institute (Peru)|Miguel Castro Castro]] prison in Peru.&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-06-15" /&gt; In a September 2010 interview from the prison, Van der Sloot reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family—her parents have been making my life tough for five years."&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2010-09-06" /&gt; On January 11, 2012, Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Ramírez&lt;ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" /&gt; and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.&lt;ref name="CNN 2012-01-13" /&gt;

=== Death declaration ===

In June 2011, six years after Natalee's disappearance, Dave Holloway filed a petition with the Alabama courts seeking to have his daughter declared [[legally dead]]. The papers were served on Beth Twitty, his former wife, who announced her intention to oppose the petition.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2011-09-14" /&gt; A hearing was held on September 23, 2011, at which time Probate Judge Alan King ruled that Dave Holloway had met the requirements for a legal presumption of death.&lt;ref name="Rawls 2011-09-23" /&gt; On January 12, 2012, a second hearing was held, after which Judge King signed the order declaring Natalee Holloway to be dead.&lt;ref name="Rawls 2012-01-12" /&gt;

=== Unrelated bone discovery, contested Oxygen documentary ===
On November 12, 2010, tourists found a [[jawbone]] on an Aruban beach near the Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp.&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2010-11-16" /&gt; Preliminary examination by a forensic expert on the island determined that the bone was from a young woman.&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-11-16" /&gt; A part of the bone was sent to [[The Hague]] for testing by the [[Netherlands Forensic Institute]].&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-11-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DutchNews 2010-11-16" /&gt; On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, and it was not possible to determine whether it had come from a man or woman.&lt;ref name="CNN 2010-11-23" /&gt;

In 2016 Natalee's father, Dave Holloway, hired a private investigator, T.J. Ward, to go through all evidence and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant, Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends, American John Ludwick, in 2005. Gabriel claims Ludwick was told what happened to Natalee.&lt;ref name="USAToday Remains Found"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/17/natalee-holloways-dad-having-human-remains-found-aruba-dna-tested/575345001/|title=Natalee Holloway's dad having human remains found in Aruba DNA tested|date=August 17, 2017|work=USA Today|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxygen Remains Found"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oxygen.com/the-disappearance-of-natalee-holloway/blogs/4-crucial-details-to-know-about-the-new-lead-in-the|title=4 Crucial Details To Know About The New Lead In The Natalee Holloway Case|date=August 21, 2017|work=Oxygen Media|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee's disappearance in an interview with the [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance which aired on August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but did not belong to Natalee.&lt;ref name=oct2017&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/03/skeletal-fragments-discovered-in-aruba-are-not-natalee-holloway-remains.html |title=Skeletal fragments discovered in Aruba are not Natalee Holloway remains |work=Fox News |date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the show, Ludwick claimed to have helped Van der Sloot dig up, smash and cremate Holloway's bones in 2010. In February 2018, Elizabeth Holloway sued the producers, alleging this and other claims are fictional and harmfully lurid, and that she was misled into providing a DNA sample for comparison without being made aware of plans for a show. In March 2018, Ludwick was stabbed to death by a woman he tried to kidnap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/natalee-holloway-story-update-missing-teenager-disappearance-dug-up-john-ludwick-killed-kidnap-woman-a8257886.html "Natalee Holloway: Man who claimed he dug up missing teenager's body killed in 'attempted kidnap of young woman'", by Adam Lusher, ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation criticism ==
[[File:NataleeHollowayWall-female.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman leaves a message on a prayer wall erected in support of Holloway.]]

The Twittys and their supporters criticized a perceived lack of progress by Aruban police.&lt;ref name="Geiss 2005-10-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDNNCott" /&gt; The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push their own version of events. The Twittys denied this.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

Beth Twitty has alleged in televised interviews and a book that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers know more about Holloway's disappearance than they have told authorities, and that at least one of them [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] or [[rape]]d her daughter.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2005-10-06" /&gt; On July 5, 2005, following the initial release of the Kalpoes, Twitty alleged, "Two suspects were released yesterday who were involved in a violent crime against my daughter,"&lt;ref name="demonstration" /&gt; and referred to the Kalpoes as "criminals".&lt;ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /&gt; A demonstration involving about two hundred Arubans took place that evening outside the courthouse in Oranjestad in anger over Twitty's remarks, with signs reading "Innocent until proven guilty" and "Respect our Dutch laws or go home."&lt;ref name="AP 2005-07-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MomApologizes" /&gt; Satish Kalpoe's attorney threatened legal action over Twitty's allegations, which he described as "prejudicial, inflammatory, [[libel]]ous, and totally outrageous." On July 8, 2005, Twitty read a statement that said her remarks were fuelled by "despair and frustration" and that she "apologize{{bracket|d}} to the Aruban people and to the Aruban authorities if I or my family offended you in any way."&lt;ref name="MomApologizes" /&gt;

In her 2007 book ''[[Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith]]'',&lt;ref name="BethBook" /&gt; Beth Holloway wrote that,

{{quote
| What we want is, we want justice. And you know—and we have to recognize the fact that, you know, this crime has been committed on the island of Aruba, and we know the perpetrators. We know it's these suspects, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe and Joran Van Der Sloot. And you know, we just have to, though, keep going, Nancy, because the only way we will get justice for Natalee is if we do keep going. I mean, if we give up, absolutely nothing will happen. Nothing.
| Beth Holloway&lt;ref name="bethquote" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BethBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC 2007_" /&gt;
}}

Following the airing of the De Vries programme on Dutch television, Beth Twitty adhered to the position that the tapes represented the way events transpired and told the ''[[New York Post]]'' that she believed her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help. She contended that Van der Sloot had dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Fox News 2008-02-05" /&gt; Twitty also alleged that the person Van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Holloway, "orchestrated what to do next."&lt;ref name="Deadlineclose" /&gt; She and Dave Holloway alleged that Van der Sloot was receiving "special legal favors."&lt;ref name="Deadlineclose" /&gt; After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, "I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell,"&lt;ref name="NBC 13 2008-02-15" /&gt; later adding, "I'd be good with a ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' prison anywhere for Joran."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2008-11-19" /&gt;

In response to her daughter's disappearance, Twitty founded the International Safe Travels Foundation,&lt;ref name="Fox News 2007-01-05" /&gt; a [[non-profit organization]] designed "to inform and educate the public to help them travel more safely as they travel internationally."&lt;ref name="ISTF Mission" /&gt; In May 2010, she announced that the Natalee Holloway Resource Center would open at the [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]]. Located in [[Washington, D.C.]], the center opened on June 8 to aid families of missing people.&lt;ref name="AP 2010-05-28" /&gt;

While Holloway's family initially discouraged a travel boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005.  Twitty urged that people not travel to Aruba and other Dutch territories because of what she stated were tourist safety issues. In a November 8, 2005, news conference, [[Governor]] [[Bob Riley (Alabama)|Bob Riley]] and the Holloways urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /&gt; Riley also wrote to other [[Governor (United States)|United States governors]] seeking their support—the governors of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Arkansas]] eventually joined in the call for boycott. [[Philadelphia]]'s [[city council]] voted to ask the [[Pennsylvania]] [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Ed Rendell]] to call for a boycott.&lt;ref name="Jamaica Observer 2005-11-11" /&gt; Rendell did not do so, and no federal support was given.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2005-11-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatSupport" /&gt;

The boycott was supported by some of Alabama's [[United States Congress|Congressional]] delegation, including both senators and [[United States Representative|Representative]] [[Spencer Bachus]] (R-AL), who represents Mountain Brook.  [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Richard Shelby]] (R-AL) voiced his support for the boycott in a letter to the [[American Society of Travel Agents]].&lt;ref name="RitaTranCott" /&gt;  Shelby stated, "For the safety, security and well-being of our citizens, I do not believe that we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba."&lt;ref name="RitaTranCott" /&gt;  Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the case, and responded to the call for boycott, "This is a preposterous and irresponsible act.  We are not guerillas.  We are not terrorists.  We don't pose a threat to the United States, nor to Alabama."&lt;ref name="Oduber" /&gt;

Members of the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association, the Aruba Tourism Authority, the Aruba Hospitality and Security Foundation, the Aruban Chamber of Commerce and government figures, including Public Relations Representative Ruben Trapenberg, formed an "Aruba Strategic Communications Task Force" to respond collectively to what they perceived to be unfounded and/or negative portrayals of the island.&lt;ref name="Aruba.com taskforce" /&gt; The group issued press releases and sent representatives to appear in news media. They joined the Aruban government in opposing the calls for a boycott of the island.&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

=== Skeeters tape and Dr. Phil; lawsuits ===
On September 15, 2005, the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' television show showed parts of a hidden camera interview with Deepak Kalpoe in which he seemingly affirmed a suggestion that Holloway had sex with all three men.&lt;ref name="CBS News 2005-10-06" /&gt;  The taping had been instigated by Jamie Skeeters, a [[private investigator]].  When the tape was broadcast, news reports indicated an expectation of a rearrest, which Dompig termed a "strong possibility" if the tapes were legitimate.&lt;ref name="dompigreaction" /&gt;

Aruban police subsequently provided a fuller version of the relevant part of the tape in which Kalpoe's response differed from the ''Dr. Phil'' version, apparently due to editing that may have altered the meaning of what was said.&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-12-01" /&gt; An unofficial Aruban-affiliated spokesperson and commentator on the case said that the uncut videotape showed that Kalpoe had shaken his head and said "No, she didn't.", thereby denying that Holloway had sex with him and the other two men.  According to an [[MSNBC]] report, the crucial words are inaudible, and presenter [[Rita Cosby]] questioned if it could be substantiated that Kalpoe had ever made the statements attributed to him in the ''Dr. Phil'' version of the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Rita Cosby Live &amp; Direct|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10281941/ns/msnbc-rita_cosby_specials/t/rita-cosby-live-direct-nov-th/|date = November 30, 2005|publisher = MSNBC|quote = You know, Clint, are we ever going to know sort of what those words are?  And do you think it's something that the FBI—my understanding is—when Jamie was on this show, he did say that the FBI had just picked up the tape.  I think that was about a week or two ago.  Why don't we hear from the FBI to sort of settle this out?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a [[slander]] and libel suit against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and ''Dr. Phil''.&lt;ref name="LA Times 2007-06-04" /&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="lawsuit" /&gt;  Holloway's parents responded by filing a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against the Kalpoes in the same venue.  The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007;&lt;ref name="lawsuit" /&gt; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011&lt;ref name="SFGate 2011-05-05" /&gt; but was later set for April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dr-phil-cbs-gain-advantage-688038 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912073059/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/dr-phil-cbs-gain-advantage-688038 |archivedate=September 12, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier suit had been filed in [[New York City]] by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them on a visit to New York.  The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.&lt;ref name="lawsuit2" /&gt;

On November 10, 2005, Paulus van der Sloot won an unjust detention action against the Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract.&lt;ref name="timeline1" /&gt;  The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages for himself and his family because of his false arrest.&lt;ref name="UPI 2006-08-04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 2006-08-08" /&gt;  The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.&lt;ref name="Expatica 2007-02-15" /&gt;

=== ''Amigoe'' article ===
The ''Amigoe'' newspaper reported on interviews with Julia Renfro and Dompig in which they said that Aruban authorities had been systematically obstructed in their investigation by U.S. officials. They also said that within a day of Holloway's being reported missing, a [[Air medical services|medjet]], unauthorized by Aruban authorities, had arrived on Aruba and had remained for several days for the purpose of covertly taking Holloway off the island without notifying local authorities.&lt;ref name="Amigoe" /&gt; Renfro, an American-born editor of an English-language daily, ''Aruba Today,'' who at the time of Holloway's disappearance had become close friends with Beth Twitty, also said she and Twitty received a phone call from an unknown woman on June 2, 2005, asking for money in return for information about Holloway's location, and asserting that Holloway was unwilling to return to her mother. According to Renfro, she and another American went to a drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money, but found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading "a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity," and nothing could be accomplished.&lt;ref name="Amigoe" /&gt; The Twittys disputed Renfro's accounts, with Beth Twitty describing Renfro as "a witch."&lt;ref name="Vanity" /&gt;

=== Film adaptations ===
{{main|Natalee Holloway (film)}}
*On April 19, 2009, [[LMN (TV channel)|LMN]] aired ''[[Natalee Holloway (film)|Natalee Holloway]]'', a [[television film]] based on Twitty's book ''Loving Natalee''.&lt;ref name="UPI 2008-10-07" /&gt; Starring [[Tracy Pollan]] as Beth Twitty, [[Grant Show]] as Jug Twitty, [[Amy Gumenick]] as Natalee Holloway, and Jacques Strydom as Van der Sloot, the film retells events leading up to the night of Holloway's disappearance in 2005 and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It was shot in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-03-12-pollan-natalee-holloway_N.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316165545/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-03-12-pollan-natalee-holloway_N.htm |archivedate=March 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie stages re-creations of various scenarios based on the testimony of key players and suspects, including Van der Sloot. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] in the network's 11-year history.&lt;ref name="Variety/Kissel 2009-04-20" /&gt; Although it set ratings records for [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]], the movie received mixed reviews from critics. Alec Harvey of ''[[The Birmingham News]]'' called the movie "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months."&lt;ref name="Harvey 2009-04-17" /&gt; However, Jake Meaney of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found the film  surprisingly "calm and levelheaded", and praised Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother.&lt;ref name="PopMatters-review" /&gt;

*A follow-up film, ''[[Justice for Natalee Holloway]]'', aired in mid-2011 on LMN. This film picks up in 2010, on the 5-year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance. It continues to center on the investigation and what exactly happened to Holloway.

===TV adaptations===
In an episode of ''Vanished with Beth Holloway'', Beth recounts the story of Natalee's disappearance which is reenacted for the show.

== Media coverage ==

[[File:NataleeHollowayWall-NewsCrews.jpg|thumb|[[News crew]]s covering the Holloway disappearance, June 10, 2005]]

[[List of United States over-the-air television networks|U.S. television networks]] devoted substantial air time to the search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. [[Greta Van Susteren]], host of Fox News' ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'', and Nancy Grace, on her eponymous [[Headline News]] program, were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story garnered ''On the Record'' its best ratings to date,&lt;ref name="SPTimes 2005-08-22" /&gt; while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new "Headline Prime" block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during primetime. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to [[Beth Twitty]] and her statements.&lt;ref name="NBC/Kosinski 2005-08-24" /&gt; Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, "The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching."&lt;ref name="lighton" /&gt;

The saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who argued that such extensive media attention validated the "[[missing white woman syndrome]]" theory, which argues that [[missing person]] cases involving [[White people|white]] women and girls receive disproportionately more attention in the media compared with cases involving white males or people of color. [[CNN]] ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they characterized as a lack of new items to report, with CNN news anchor [[Anderson Cooper]] calling the coverage "downright ridiculous".&lt;ref name="CNN 2005-08-11" /&gt;

Early in the case, political commentator and columnist [[Arianna Huffington]] wrote, "If you were to get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, [[Michael Jackson]], when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do."&lt;ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" /&gt; In March 2008, ''El Diario'' commented, "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing [[Latino]]s, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and [[African-American]] women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered."&lt;ref name="Latin" /&gt;

CBS senior journalist Danna Walker stated, "There is criticism that it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white&lt;!-- punctuation of verbal quote corrected, original transcription is " ... because she is a pretty, blonde, and white&amp;nbsp;... --&gt;—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with."&lt;ref name="BBC News 2005-06-25" /&gt; ''[[Good Morning America]]'' anchor [[Chris Cuomo]] was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case, stating: "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch&amp;nbsp;… If they say, 'I want to know what happened to this girl'&amp;nbsp;… I want to help them find out."&lt;ref name="Cuomo" /&gt;

Holloway's family, however, took the opposite approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance due to a shift in news priority when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane.&lt;ref name="KatrinaCloak" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DHolloway 2006, p. 124" /&gt; Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba took advantage of the extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects,&lt;ref name="KatrinaCloak" /&gt; however the deadline for judicial review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.&lt;ref name="timeline1" /&gt;

Dave Holloway lamented in his book:

{{quote
| Hurricane Katrina had left the door open for the boys to be sent on their way with little publicity and few restrictions because it took the world's focus off of Natalee, but only for a brief time. The huge amount of publicity had waned and, during that time of quiet for us, Joran and the Kalpoe brothers were sent home&amp;nbsp;... All of the news shows that had followed our every move only a day before had now become fixated on the next big ratings grabber: the victims of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name="DHolloway 2006, p. 124" /&gt;

'''Edward James Bossward''' (1825–1883) was an organ builder based in [[Birmingham]], England.

==Life==

He was born in [[Hayes, Bromley|Hayes]] in 1825 and baptised on 22 May 1825, the son of Thomas Bossward and Jane Collinridge. He married Eliza Gisborne in 1848 in [[King’s Norton]], and they had the following children:
*Ann M Bossward (b. 1851)
*Agnes Bossward (b. 1852)
*Frances Bossward (b 1852)
*John T. Bossward (b. 1855)
*George A.J. Bossward (b. 1858)
*Charles Bossward (b. 1860)
*Genevieve M. Bossward (b. 1865)
*Eliza A. Bossward 9b. 1868)
*Catherine Bossward (b.1870)
*Edward James Leonard Bossward (1871 - 1938)

He trained as an organ builder with J.C. Bishop and then worked for [[William Hill &amp; Sons|William Hill]]. He came to Birmingham with Hill to work on the organ in [[Birmingham Town Hall]], and to care for it after completion. 

In 1847 he set up business on his own, first at 30 Oliver Road, and later at 80 Alston Street, [[Ladywood]]. In 1869 he was declared bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23486 |date=9 April 1869 |page=2221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his pupils [[Walter James Bird]] continued the business after he died in 1883.

It was the fourth manned [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] flight, the twelfth manned American flight and the twentieth manned spaceflight including Soviet flights and [[North American X-15|X-15]] flights above the [[Kármán line]]. The crew of Frank Borman and Jim Lovell spent nearly 14 days in space, making a total of 206 orbits. Their spacecraft was the passive target for the first manned [[space rendezvous]] performed by the crew of [[Gemini 6A]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Lovell pre-launch gemini 7.jpg|thumb|right|Lovell before the launch, in the special [[Gemini space suit#G5C suits|G5C space suit]], which had a zippered hood with a visor instead of a solid helmet.]]
Gemini 7 was originally intended to fly after [[Gemini 6]], but the original Gemini 6 mission was cancelled after the failure during launch of the [[Agena Target Vehicle]] with which it was meant to rendezvous and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]]. The objective of rendezvous was so important, that it was decided to fly the alternate Gemini 6A mission concurrently with Gemini 7, using the latter as the rendezvous target.

The original mission of Gemini 7 changed little with these new plans. It was always planned to be a long duration flight, investigating the effects of fourteen days in space on the [[human body]]. This doubled the length of time that anyone had been in space and stood as the longest spaceflight duration record for five years.

This 14-day mission required NASA to solve some of the problems of long-duration space flight, such as stowage of waste (the crew had practiced stuffing waste paper behind their seats before the flight). Timing their workday to match that of the prime shift ground crews, both men worked and slept at the same time. Gemini 7 conducted twenty experiments, the most of any Gemini mission, including studies of nutrition in space. The astronauts also evaluated a lightweight spacesuit, the [[Gemini space suit#G5C suits|G5C]], which proved uncomfortable when worn for a long time in the Gemini spacecraft's hot, cramped quarters. The high point of the mission came on the eleventh day with the rendezvous with Gemini 6A. Both astronauts, heeding the advice of [[Pete Conrad]] who had flown for eight days on [[Gemini 5]], took books along to read. Gemini 7 was the longest manned space flight in U.S. history until the [[Skylab]] missions of the 1970s, and held the record for the longest space flight until [[Soyuz 9]] in June 1970.

==Flight==
[[File:S65-61650.jpg|thumb|left|Gemini 7 heads into space]]
Launch went without any problems and all systems on the Titan II performed nominally. Some slight [[Pogo oscillation|pogo vibrations]] were detected starting at T+110 seconds into launch, but unlike with Gemini 5 where the astronauts experienced momentary vision and speech problems, Borman reported only feeling a very light shaking sensation and Lovell nothing. After separating from the spent rocket stage, they turned the spacecraft around and proceeded to [[Orbital stationkeeping|station keep]] with the rocket stage, a maneuver first tried on [[Gemini 4]]. The Gemini 4 attempt was unsuccessful, due to the limited knowledge at the time of the complex orbital mechanics involved. Gemini 7 flew in formation with its upper stage for fifteen minutes, at which time Borman stopped because he felt too much fuel was being consumed, and the stage was moving erratically as it vented its own remaining fuel.&lt;ref name="titans1"/&gt;

They spent the rest of their first day in space doing some experiments and eating their first meal. Their sleep periods were scheduled at the same time unlike previous missions and they were able to get some sleep. The next morning they were awoken at 9:06 am [[Time zone#UTC-5 (EST - Eastern Standard Time)|EST]] and given the morning's news, which included the [[1965 Carmel mid-air collision|collision of two airliners over New York]]. For the first time during a flight, one of the crew was allowed to take off his suit. Borman and Lovell had planned to both take them off two days into the mission, when they were satisfied that the environmental system was working properly. The NASA managers did not like this idea, and said that at least one crew member had to be wearing a suit at all times. Borman wore his suit and sweated profusely, but agreed to let Lovell stay out of his suit, as Lovell was the larger of the two, and it required a lot of effort to get in and out of a suit in little more space than the front seat of a car.

[[Image:Pacific Ocean seen from Gemini 7.jpg|thumb|Moon and clouds over the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] as seen from Gemini 7]]

Later, the flight controllers ordered Lovell to don his suit, and Borman to get out of his. This was because the doctors wanted to see the effects of being suited and unsuited on the astronauts. At 148 hours into the flight, Borman got his chance to cool down. Finally, the NASA managers decided that there was little benefit in having the crew members suited, and so relented after a couple of days. Going suitless greatly improved the astronauts' comfort and mobility inside the cramped spacecraft.

The lessons learned from Gemini 5 allowed Lovell and Borman to have improved personal hygiene during their mission. They showered with an anti-dandruff shampoo for two weeks prior to the flight to curb the problems their predecessors had experienced with skin flakes accumulating inside the spacecraft and removal of the pressure suits in-flight also helped keep their skin more moist and less prone to drying out. They were also supplied with sanitation wipes which proved highly beneficial in keeping clean. Odors were not a problem except when they opened the storage bins where waste was stowed.

In their postflight debriefing, Borman and Lovell noted that the food rations had been generally of good quality, but they strongly disliked the freeze-dried protein bites and advised against them being included on future missions. They also suggested that more breakfast items would have been nice, to avoid including bite-sized food that could easily produce crumbs that get loose in the cabin, and improving the packaging of some items. Because of the lengthy mission, Gemini 7 had a significantly larger supply of food than previous flights, and the astronauts often found it difficult to remove the tightly-packed food containers, some of which had also not been stowed in the correct order for the day of the flight they were intended to be eaten.

As part of the in-flight medical experiments, the crew were required to collect and save some of their bodily wastes for post-flight analysis, a task they described as less-than-enjoyable. The urine collection device proved particularly difficult and unpleasant to use, especially because of its habit of leaking urine, which happened several times during the flight. Borman suggested afterwards that a tube and valve mechanism be added to the spacecraft to simply release urine into space, an idea that would be realized on the Apollo command module.

The crew also strongly objected to the requirement that they record every use of drinking water and argued instead that they could simply use the meter on the water hose to gauge the amount consumed.

After five days, they had performed four orbital adjustment burns that put them in a circular {{convert|162|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit. This orbit would last for at least 100 days without [[Orbital decay|decay]]ing, more than stable enough for the passive target during a [[space rendezvous]].

On their 31st orbit, Gemini 7 observed the underwater launch and exhaust trail of a [[Polaris missile]] from the submarine {{USS|Benjamin Franklin|SSBN-640|6}} off Florida.

===Rendezvous===
[[File:S65-63197.jpg|thumb|Gemini 7 as seen by Gemini 6, December 1965]]
[[Gemini 6A]] was launched on December 15, after a three-day-long delay due to a malfunction and engine shutdown immediately after ignition. It entered into an {{convert|87|by|140|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit, and was briefly visible from Gemini 7 just after launch. Borman and Lovell were also able to see the [[contrail]] from the launch.

The plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of Gemini 6A. Their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their velocity by {{convert|16.5|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Due to their lower orbit they were gaining on Gemini 7 and were {{convert|634|nmi|km}} behind. The next burn was at 2 hours and 18 minutes when Gemini 6A made a phase adjustment to put them on the same [[orbit]]al inclination as Gemini 7. They now only trailed by {{convert|261|nmi|km}}.

The [[radar]] on Gemini 6A first made contact with Gemini 7 at 3 hours and 15 minutes when they were {{convert|234|nmi|km}} away. A third burn put them into a {{convert|146|by|148|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit. As they slowly gained, [[Walter Schirra]] put Gemini 6A's computer in charge of the rendezvous, and at five hours and four minutes, he saw a bright object that he at first thought was the star [[Sirius]], but was in fact Gemini 7.

After several more burns the two spacecraft were only {{convert|130|ft|m}} apart. The burns had only used {{convert|110|lb}} of fuel on Gemini 6A, leaving plenty of fuel. During the next 270 minutes the crews moved as close as {{convert|1|ft|cm}}, talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were station-keeping so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.

As the sleep periods approached, Gemini 6A made a separation burn and slowly drifted out to 16 kilometers, to prevent an accidental collision in the night. Gemini 6A reentered the next day, landing within {{convert|9.7|nmi|km}} of the planned site, the first truly accurate [[atmospheric reentry]].

===Last few days===
By this time, the novelty of spaceflight had worn off for the crew of Gemini 7. They had spent 11 days in space and had three more to go. They were doing little more than drifting around the Earth and the incentive of the rendezvous was over. Borman read ''[[Roughing It]]'' by [[Mark Twain]] and Lovell ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk (novel)|Drums along the Mohawk]]'' by [[Walter D. Edmonds]].&lt;ref name="titans1" /&gt;

In the [[Discovery Channel]] 2008 documentary ''[[When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions]]'' second episode titled "Friends and Rivals", Borman states the last three days of the mission were "bad".

Malfunctions began: in a repeat of Gemini 5, some of the thrusters stopped working. After the flight this was traced to the fact that they had an old type of laminate in the thrust chamber. Also on the 12th day, the [[fuel cell]]s started to give only a partial amount of power. The ship's batteries were enough to sustain it for the remainder of the flight.

Finally the last day of the mission arrived and the crew stored everything for reentry. The [[retrorocket|retro-rockets]] worked perfectly after 14 days in space. They landed within {{convert|6.4|nmi|km}} of the targeted landing point.

The crewmen were somewhat weakened by their time in space, but both were in good health and were up and about after a good night's sleep on the recovery ship {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|6}}.  They were also in good spirits: during recovery, they joked to Mission Control about getting married after having spent so long together in space.

The Gemini 7 and 6A missions were supported by the following [[U.S. Department of Defense]] resources: 10,125 personnel, 125 aircraft and 16 ships.

The patch features an [[Olympic torch]], symbolizing the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]]-like length of the mission.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=145}} There is a small stylized image of a Gemini spacecraft and the [[Roman numerals]] VII for seven. The crew did not put its names on the patch, although souvenir versions did include the flight and crew names. The crew patch was designed by Houston artist and animator Bill Bradley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=William|title=History of Bradley's Art and Frame Shop, Houston, TX|url=http://bradleysartandframe.com/who-we-are/history-of-bradleys/|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bradley's Art &amp; Frame shop newsletter|url=http://bradleysartandframe.com/newsletters/nl-sum05.pdf|work=NASA Patches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with a few other missions, the backup crew produced a spoof of the insignia, featuring an unlit torch, a lighter and the words "NEED A LIGHT - FRANK? JIM?"

A '''gravitational binding energy''' is the minimum energy that must be added to a system for the system to cease being in a gravitationally [[bound state]]. A gravitationally [[bound state|bound system]] has a lower (''i.e.'', more negative) [[gravitational potential]] energy than the sum of its parts — this is what keeps the system [[Wiktionary:aggregation|aggregated]] in accordance with the [[minimum total potential energy principle]].

For a spherical [[mass]] of uniform [[density]], the gravitational binding energy ''U'' is given by the formula&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1939"&gt;[[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] 1939, ''An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure'' (Chicago: U. of Chicago; reprinted in New York: Dover), section 9, eqs. 90-92, p. 51 (Dover edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang 1980"&gt;Lang, K. R. 1980, ''Astrophysical Formulae'' (Berlin: Springer Verlag), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{3GM^2}{5R}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], ''M'' is the mass of the sphere, and ''R'' is its radius.

Assuming that the [[Earth]] is a uniform sphere (which is not correct, but is close enough to get an [[order-of-magnitude]] estimate) with ''M'' = 5.97&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg and ''r'' = 6.37&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m, ''U'' is 2.24&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; J. This is roughly equal to one week of the [[Sun]]'s total energy output. It is 37.5 MJ/kg, 60% of the absolute value of the potential energy per kilogram at the surface.

The actual depth-dependence of density, inferred from seismic travel times (see [[Adams–Williamson equation]]), is given in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM).&lt;ref name=PREM&gt;{{cite journal

According to the [[virial theorem]], the gravitational binding energy of a [[star]] is about two times its internal [[heat|thermal energy]] in order for [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] to be maintained.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1939"/&gt;  As the gas in a star becomes more [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]], the gravitational binding energy required for hydrostatic equilibrium approaches zero and the star becomes unstable (highly sensitive to perturbations), which may lead to a [[supernova]] in high-mass stars due to strong [[radiation pressure]] or [[black hole]]s in [[neutron star]]s.

==Derivation for a uniform sphere==
The gravitational binding energy of a sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is found by imagining that it is pulled apart by successively moving spherical shells to infinity, the outermost first, and finding the total energy needed for that.

Assuming a constant density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the masses of a shell and the sphere inside it are:
:&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{shell}=4\pi r^{2}\rho\,dr&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{interior}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho&lt;/math&gt;

The required energy for a shell is the negative of the gravitational potential energy:

:&lt;math&gt;{\it dU}=-G\frac{m_\mathrm{shell} m_\mathrm{interior}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating over all shells yields:

:&lt;math&gt;U = -G\int_0^R {\frac{(4\pi r^2\rho)(\tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho)}{r}} dr = -G{\frac{16}{3}}\pi^2 \rho^2 \int_0^R {r^4} dr = -G{\frac{16}{15}}{\pi}^2{\rho}^2 R^5&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is simply equal to the mass of the whole divided by its volume for objects with uniform density, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}&lt;/math&gt;

And finally, plugging this into our result leads to

:&lt;math&gt;U=-G\frac{16}{15} \pi^2 R^5 \left(\frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3}\right)^2= -\frac{3GM^2}{5R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Negative mass component==
Two bodies, placed at the distance ''R'' from each other, exert a gravitational force on a third body slightly smaller when ''R'' is small. This can be seen as a [[negative mass]] component of the system, equal, for uniformly spherical solutions, to:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{binding}=-\frac{3GM^2}{5Rc^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be easily demonstrated that this negative component can never exceed the positive component of a system. A negative binding energy greater than the mass of the system itself would indeed require that the radius of the system be smaller than:

:&lt;math&gt;R\leq\frac{3GM}{5c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{10}&lt;/math&gt; smaller than its [[Schwarzschild radius]]:

:&lt;math&gt;R\leq\frac{3}{10} r_\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore never visible to an external observer.

==Non-uniform spheres==
Planets and stars have radial density gradients from their lower density surfaces to their much larger density compressed cores. Degenerate matter objects (white dwarfs; neutron star pulsars) have radial density gradients plus relativistic corrections.

Neutron star relativistic equations of state provided by Jim Lattimer include a graph of radius vs. mass for various models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ns-grb.com/PPT/Lattimer.pdf Neutron Star Masses and Radii], p. 9/20, bottom&lt;/ref&gt; The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius). BE is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to observed neutron star gravitational mass of "M" kilograms with radius "R" meters, 

:&lt;math&gt;BE = \frac{0.60\,\beta}{1 - \frac{\beta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\beta \ = G\,M/R\,{c}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Given current values

:&lt;math&gt;G = 6.6742\times10^{-11}\, m^3kg^{-1}sec^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/publications/pdf/prl85-2869.pdf Measurement of Newton's Constant Using a Torsion Balance with Angular Acceleration Feedback ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419012251/http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/publications/pdf/prl85-2869.pdf |date=2011-04-19 }}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85(14) 2869 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c^2 = 8.98755\times10^{16}\, m^2sec^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{solar} = 1.98844\times10^{30}\, kg&lt;/math&gt;

and star masses "M" commonly reported as multiples of one solar mass,

:&lt;math&gt;M_x = \frac{M}{M_\odot}&lt;/math&gt;

then the relativistic fractional binding energy of a neutron star is

:&lt;math&gt;BE = \frac{885.975\,M_x}{R - 738.313\,M_x}&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Hostage''''' is a 2005 American [[action film|action]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced by and starring [[Bruce Willis]] and directed by [[Florent Emilio Siri]]. The film was based on the [[Hostage (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Crais]], and was adapted for the screen by [[Doug Richardson]].

The film earned mixed to negative reviews and was not a financial success on its original release, earning only slightly more than its production costs.

==Plot==
Former [[LAPD SWAT|L.A. SWAT]] officer Jeff Talley is a [[hostage negotiator]] in [[Los Angeles]]. One day, Talley negotiates with a man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him. Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander's request to give snipers the order to open fire, the despondent man kills his wife, son, and himself. Traumatized, Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino, a fictional suburban hamlet in nearby [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].

A year later, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation. Two troubled teenaged brothers, Dennis and Kevin Kelly, and a sociopathic accomplice, Marshall "Mars" Krupcheck, all very well-armed, take Walter Smith and his two children, Jennifer and Tommy, hostage in the Smith home after a failed robbery attempt. Dennis had told his younger brother to wait in the car, not anticipating the siege to come, but Kevin refused.

A female police officer, Carol Flores, responds after Tommy turns on the silent alarm. She is shot twice by Mars just before Talley arrives. She dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy, Talley hands authority over to the [[Ventura County Sheriff's Department|county sheriff]] and leaves.

Smith had been [[Money laundering|laundering money]] for a mysterious [[right-wing]] [[militia]] and criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important [[Encryption|encrypted]] files recorded on a [[DVD]] when he was taken hostage. To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered, the syndicate orders a ruthless operative, known as "the Watchman", to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter. Talley is instructed by "the Watchman", to return to the hostage scene, regain authority, and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith's house. Otherwise, Talley's wife and daughter will be murdered.

Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children, while he knocks out Smith and finds a small fortune in cash, money which the syndicate had paid Smith. In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself, Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money. 

When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer, with whom he has become infatuated. Talley says the helicopter will only carry three passengers and insists Jennifer stay behind, but the deal breaks down and the boys and Jennifer return to the house. Talley learns that Mars is a sociopath who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Kevin, just as Kevin is about to release the children. Mars then kills Dennis.

The syndicate sends fake [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house; Talley is instructed to not go near the house. Jennifer manages to stab Mars, but not fatally, and locks herself and Tommy in the [[panic room]]. 

Hearing their screams, Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars, who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple homemade [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children, and demands the encrypted DVD. When Talley asks that the children be allowed to leave, the fake agent shoots Talley, but it is not a fatal wound. After Talley gives him the DVD, Mars reappears, carrying two homemade Molotov cocktails, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley. Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov, but collapses to his knees, weakened by his injuries. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, then drops the Molotov and [[Self-immolation|immolates himself]].

Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall, which extinguishes the fire caused by Mars' first Molotov. He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley's wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew. 

Smith, feigning hatred for Talley, is freed in exchange for the family. While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley, Smith shoots the Watchman in the head. This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen in similar fashion and rescue his own family.

==Production==
The film's plot is roughly the same as Crais's novel. The main difference is that the novel's complicated subplot involving powerful [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[American Mafia|Mafia]] crime lord Sonny Benza was removed, with the film giving little explanation of Walter Smith's criminal associates. The film also makes the first group of hostage-takers somewhat younger in age than depicted in the novel.    In addition, the criminal syndicate in the film were portrayed as domestic [[right-wing extremists]] rather than a Mafia.

Filming took place in the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] area (in western [[Los Angeles County]]). The exterior views of Smith's lavishly appointed house were filmed at a real house in the unincorporated [[Topanga Canyon]] area, between Malibu and Los Angeles; the interior scenes were done on sound stages in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=Locations/&gt;

The character Mars, played by Ben Foster, was modeled after [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] [[rap]] artist [[Mars (rapper)|Mars]] by Robert Crais after a friend Dennis Bsharah urged him to look into the [[horrorcore]] genre. In the movie adaptation, Foster strongly resembles the rapper.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Foster - HOSTAGE Interview|url=http://www.tribute.ca/interviews/ben-foster-hostage/star/18312/|website=Tribute.ca|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=17 February 2015|date=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jonathan Tucker]]'s name was later changed to Dennis.

The movie's opening scenes were filmed in the [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, California|Boyle Heights]] neighborhood of East Los Angeles, just east of downtown.&lt;ref name=Locations&gt;{{cite web|title=Hostage-Film Locations|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Hostage.shtml|website=Seeing Stars.com/Locations|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional city of Bristo Camino was possibly intended to be a representation of [[Ojai, California|Ojai]] or [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]]. Bristo Bay is the name of Bristo Camino in the 2001 [[Robert Crais]] ''[[Hostage (novel)|novel]]''.&lt;ref name=PUNKS_NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Not-Half-Bad Punks And a World-Weary Cop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/20/books/books-of-the-times-not-half-bad-punks-and-a-world-weary-cop.html|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=BOOK OF THE TIMES|publisher=The New York Times|date=20 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service in Pakistan==

===Diplomacy and governorships===

After the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[India]] by the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|act]] of the [[British Empire]] that laid the [[Independence of Pakistan|establishment]] of [[Pakistan]], Chundrigar endorsed [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s bid for the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Premiership]] and was retained as the [[Commerce Minister of Pakistan|Commerce Minister]] in the administration of [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] on 15 August 1947.{{rp|612}}&lt;ref name="Routledge, Lentz, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lentz|first1=Harris M.|title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134264902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6HKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA612&amp;dq=Chundrigar+commerce+minister+1947&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6ruzwlvDYAhWBvlMKHd_uDgcQuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chundrigar%20commerce%20minister%201947&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/leader15.htm The Leader] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090404180949/http://pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/leader15.htm |date=4 April 2009}} at pakistan.gov.pk&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1948, Chundrigar was relieved his [[Ministry of Commerce and Textile Industry|Commerce ministry]] and was appointed as the [[:Category:Ambassadors of Pakistan to Afghanistan|Pakistan Ambassador to Afghanistan]], presenting his credentials to [[King of Afghanistan|Afghan King]] [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] in [[Kabul]].{{rp|88}}&lt;ref name="Sang-e-Meel Publications, Pāshā, 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pāshā|first1=Aḥmad Shujāʻ|title=Pakistan: a political profile, 1947 to 1988|date=1991|publisher=[[Sang-e-Meel Publications]]|pages=335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_1tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=i.i.+chundrigar+appointed+ambassador+1948&amp;dq=i.i.+chundrigar+appointed+ambassador+1948&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixjsOB2vHYAhUSzWMKHZg1CZkQ6AEILTAB|accessdate=24 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref name="Quaid-i-Azam University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dani|first1=Ahmad Hasan|title=World Scholars on Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah|date=1979|publisher=Quaid-i-Azam University Press|pages=436 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, his appointment was met with favorable views in Afghanistan, Chundrigar was at odd with the [[Government of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] of supporting the issue of [[Pashtunistan|separating the country's]] [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|north-west frontier]], with [[Government of India|Indian involvement]] as early as 1949.{{rp|220–221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yunas|first1=S.

His tenureship remained for a short brief of time when he was recalled to Pakistan due to [[Foreign Office of Pakistan|Foreign Office]]'s objections, which viewed Chundrigar's inability to understand the [[Pashtun culture]] may have factor in fracturing [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations|relations between]] [[Afghanistan-Pakistan|two nations]].{{rp|487}}&lt;ref name="Pakistan, Ministry of Foreign Affai"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Foreign Affairs Pakistan|journal=Foreign Affairs Pakistan|date=July 2008|volume=35|issue=7-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aU0PsDV0Aa8C&amp;dq=i.i.+chundrigar++ambassador+replaced&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=lacked+knowledge|accessdate=24 January 2018|publisher=Pakistan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Chundrigar was appointed [[Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Governor]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], which he tenured until 1951.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al., 2003 (Biography)" /&gt; A [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Cabinet]] reshuffle in 1951 allowed him to be appointed as the [[Governor of Punjab, Pakistan|Governor of Punjab]] but was removed amid differences developed in 1953 with [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|M.G.

===Law ministry in Coalition administration===

In 1955, Chundrigar returned to [[Pakistan]] from his [[ambassadorship]] from Turkey when he was invited to join the [[Government of Pakistan|central government]] of three-party coalition: the [[Awami League]], [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]] and the [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]].{{rp|136}}&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Burki, 2015" /&gt; He was appointed as [[Law Minister of Pakistan|Minister of Law and Justice]].{{rp|19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constituent Assembly (Legislature) of Pakistan Debates: Official Report|date=1956|publisher=Manager of Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3UzBPjJAbQC&amp;dq=I+I+chundrigar+minister+for+law&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=I+I+chundrigar+|accessdate=25 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he also acted as a [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]], opposing the mainstream agenda presented by the [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]].{{rp|149}}&lt;ref name="Mittal Publications, Akbar, 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akbar|first1=M.

At the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], he established his reputation as more of constitutional lawyer than a politician and gained a lot of prominence in public for his arguments in favour of [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliamentarianism]] when he pleaded the case of [[Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan|"''Maulvi Tamizuddin vs. Federation of Pakistan''"]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al., 2003 (Biography)" /&gt;

==Prime Minister of Pakistan (1957)==

===Shortest tenure as Prime Minister===

After the resignation of [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Prime Minister Suhrawardy]] in 1956, Chudrigar was nominated as the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and was supported by Awami League, [[Krishak Sramik Party]], [[Jamaat-e-Islami|Nizem-i-Islam Party]], and the Republican Party.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (II Becomes PM)"&gt;{{cite web |title=I.

Munir]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (II Becomes PM)"/&gt;

At the first session of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], Chundrigar presented his plans to reform the [[Electoral College (Pakistan)|Electoral College]] which was met with great parliamentary opposition even by his Cabinet ministers from the Republican Party and the Awami League.{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="New Publishers, Zakaria, 1958"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zakaria|first1=Nasim|title=Parliamentary Government in Pakistan|date=1958|publisher=New Publishers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Be4DAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=I+I+chundrigar+vote+of+no+confidence+resigned&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Chundrigar+resigned+|accessdate=25 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (II Becomes PM)"/&gt; With [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Iskandar Mirza|Iskander Mirza]] and his Republican Party exploiting and manipulating the opponents of [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]], a successful [[vote of no-confidence]] movement in the [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]] by Republicans and Awami Party effectively ended Chundrigar's term when he was forced to resign from his office on 11 December 1957.{{rp|62}}{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="New Publishers, Zakaria, 1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (II Becomes PM)"/&gt;

==Death and reputation==

In 1958, Chudrigar was appointed as president of the [[Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan|Supreme Court Bar Association]] which he remained until his death.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, 1960" /&gt; In 1960, Chundrigar traveled to [[Hamburg]] where he addressed at the International Law Conference and suffered a [[haemorrhage]] while visiting in [[London]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, 1960" /&gt; For treatment, he was taken to the [[Royal Northern Hospital]] and suddenly passed away.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, 1960" /&gt; His body was brought back to [[Karachi]] in [[Pakistan]], where he was buried in a [[List of cemeteries in Karachi|local cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers, 1960" /&gt;

In his honour, the [[Government of Pakistan]] renamed the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road|McLeod Road]] in [[Karachi]] after his namesake.&lt;ref name="The Friday Times, A. Chundrigar, 2012" /&gt;

'''Jono Carroll''' (born 12 April 1992) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] from [[Dublin]]. He competes at [[Super-Featherweight]].

==Professional career==
Carroll began his pro career while in [[Australia]] in 2012. He eventually returned home to Dublin where he began fighting under Paschal "Packie" Collins, out of Celtic Warrior Gym, [[Blanchardstown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2015/03/03/jono-carroll/ |publisher=Boxing News and Views |date= 3 Mar 2015 |title=Sky the limit? Exclusive interview with Prizefighter Champion Jono Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Irish debut===
Carroll made his Irish professional debut in November 2014, when he faced Declan Geraghty at the [[3Arena]]. On the undercard of [[Matthew Macklin]] vs [[Jorge Sebastian Heiland]], [[Eddie Hearn]] confirmed that the winner would earn a slot at the following month's [[Prizefighter]] tournament in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-boxing.com/geraghty-carroll-fighting-prizefighter-slot/|publisher=Irish Boxing |date=12 Nov 2014 |title=Geraghty and Carroll fighting for Prizefighter slot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll and Geraghty went on to produce 'Fight of the Night', in a bout which ended in the fourth round when Geraghty was disqualified for persistent use of the head, that same fight would go on to win Irish fight of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-boxing.com/carroll-wins-dublin-derby-fight-night-geraghty-disqualified/|publisher=Irish Boxing |date=15 Nov 2014 |title=Carroll wins Dublin derby and fight of the night as Geraghty is disqualified}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-boxing.com/carroll-geraghty-would-be-a-leap-back-he-doesnt-want-the-rematch-anyway/|publisher=Irish Boxing |date=24 Mar 2015 |title=Carroll: Geraghty would be a leap back- he doesn’t want the rematch anyway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prizefighter champion===
Carroll really stepped into the limelight when he accepted the invitation and became [[Prizefighter series|Prizefighter]] champion in December. The Dubliner was a relative unknown to British audiences when he defied the odds to defeat [[Stephen Foster (boxer)|Stephen Foster]], [[Gary Buckland]], and Michael Devine to take the [[Lightweight]] title. Carroll received high acclaim for his performances and subsequently signed a promotional deal with Eddie Hearn and [[Matchroom Sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12040/9700756/matchroom-sign-prizefighter-winner-jono-carroll-and-welterweight-prospect-jeff-saunders |publisher=Sky Sports |date= 5 Feb 2015 |title=Matchroom sign Prizefighter winner Jono Carroll and welterweight prospect Jeff Saunders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following Prizefighter===
Despite being booked to appear on the undercard of teammate Spike O'Sullivan vs [[Chris Eubank, Jr.|Chris Eubank Jr]], Carroll accepted a different fight at just a week's notice. On the [[Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury]] card in [[Düsseldorf]], Carroll agreed to the longest bout of his career so far - ten rounds with Miguel Gonzalez. Despite the timing, Carroll outclassed the Honduran from start to finish, winning every round on the way to a Unanimous Decision victory. "I just went out there and enjoyed myself," he told [[Sky Sports]] Box Office afterwards. "Because I never fought 10 rounds, I wanted to see what it was all about. I wanted to get through without any injuries. I'm pretty proud of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10083474/klitschko-vs-fury-jono-carroll-beat-miguel-gonzalez-over-10-rounds |publisher=Sky Sports |date= 28 November 2015 |title=Klitschko vs Fury: Jono Carroll beats Miguel Gonzalez over 10 rounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyndon Baines Johnson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|d|ə|n|_|ˈ|b|eɪ|n|z}}; August 27, 1908{{snds}}January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials '''LBJ''', was an American politician who served as the 36th [[President of the United States]] from 1963 to 1969. Formerly the 37th [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1961 to 1963, he assumed the presidency following the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Texas]], Johnson also served as a [[United States Representative]] and as the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions.{{efn|The other three who have served as President, Vice President and who have held office in the House and Senate are [[John Tyler]], [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]].}}

Born in a farmhouse in [[Stonewall, Texas]], Johnson was a high school teacher and worked as a congressional aide before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1937. He won election to the Senate in 1948 and was appointed to the position of [[Senate Majority Whip]] in 1951. He became the Senate Minority Leader in 1953 and the Senate Majority Leader in 1955. He became known for his domineering personality and the "Johnson treatment", his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians to advance legislation.

Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]]. Although unsuccessful, he accepted the invitation of then-Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] to be his running mate. They went on to win a close election over the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket of [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] and Johnson [[United States presidential line of succession|succeeded]] him as president. The following year, Johnson won [[United States presidential election, 1964|a landslide in 1964]], defeating [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] of [[Arizona]]. With 61.1% of the popular vote, Johnson won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|largest share]] of the popular vote of any candidate since the largely uncontested [[United States presidential election, 1820|1820 election]].

In domestic policy, Johnson designed the "[[Great Society]]" legislation to expand [[civil rights]], [[public broadcasting]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], aid to education, the arts, urban and rural development, public services and his "[[War on Poverty]]". Assisted in part by a growing economy, the War on Poverty helped millions of Americans rise above the poverty line during his administration.&lt;ref name="Califano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |title=What Was Really Great About The Great Society: The truth behind the conservative myths |first=Joseph A. |last=Califano Jr. |work=[[Washington Monthly]] |date=October 1999 |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326175845/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/1999/9910.califano.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil-rights bills that he signed into law banned racial discrimination in public facilities, interstate commerce, the workplace and housing; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]] prohibited certain requirements in southern states used to disenfranchise African Americans. With the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the country's immigration system was reformed, encouraging greater emigration from regions other than Europe. Johnson's presidency marked the peak of [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] after the [[New Deal]] era.

In foreign policy, Johnson escalated American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1964, Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], which granted Johnson the power to use military force in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process stagnated. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war movement]] based chiefly among [[Conscription|draft]]-age students on university campuses.

Johnson faced further troubles when summer riots began in major cities in 1965 and crime rates soared, as his opponents raised demands for [[Law and order (politics)|"law and order"]] policies. While Johnson began his presidency with widespread approval, support for him declined as the public became frustrated with both the war and the growing violence at home. In 1968, the Democratic Party [[Political faction|factionalized]] as anti-war elements denounced Johnson; he ended his bid for renomination after a [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|disappointing finish]] in the New Hampshire primary. Nixon was elected to succeed him, as the [[New Deal coalition]] that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years collapsed. After he left office in January 1969, Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, where he died of a heart attack at age 64 on January 22, 1973.

Johnson is [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] favorably by many historians because of his domestic policies and the passage of many major laws that affected civil rights, [[gun control]], [[Wilderness Act|wilderness preservation]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], although he has also drawn substantial criticism for his escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="histeval"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dallek |first=Robert |url=http://hnn.us/articles/439.html |title=Presidency: How Do Historians Evaluate the Administration of Lyndon Johnson? |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/president/Lyndon_Johnson.aspx |title=Survey of Presidential Leadership&amp;nbsp;– Lyndon Johnson |publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |accessdate=June 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209101510/http://legacy.c-span.org/PresidentialSurvey/president/Lyndon_Johnson.aspx|archive-date=February 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baines, the grandfather of Johnson's mother, was also the president of [[Baylor University]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baylor.edu/lib/index.php?id=78056|title=George Washington Baines|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Baylor University]]|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's grandfather, [[Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr.]], was raised as a Baptist and for a time was a member of the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. In his later years the grandfather became a [[Christadelphians|Christadelphian]]; Johnson's father also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/Religion/religion_hm.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001205141900/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/Religion/religion_hm.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 5, 2000 |title=Religion and President Johnson |publisher=[[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a politician, Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather, had shared with him (see [[Operation Texas]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banta |first=Joseph |title=President Lyndon B. Johnson |journal=The Christadelphian |volume=101 |page=26 |date=January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's favorite Bible verse came from the King James Version of Isaiah 1:18. "Come now, and let us reason together..."&lt;ref&gt;"Page 149 of "Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot" by Bill O'Reilly &amp; Martin Dugard&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LBJ Boyhood Home Johnson City Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's boyhood home in Johnson City, Texas]]
In school, Johnson was an awkward, talkative youth who was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from [[Lyndon B. Johnson High School (Johnson City, Texas)|Johnson City High School]], where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yearbook |editors=Patty Greenbaum, Lisa Lewis, Anne Drake, Zazel Loven |year=1990 |publisher=Dolphin |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-385-41625-2 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caro 1982"&gt;Caro 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 15, Johnson was the youngest member of his class. Pressured by his parents to attend college, he enrolled at a "subcollege" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. He left the school just weeks after his arrival and decided to move to [[southern California]]. He worked at his cousin's legal practice and in various odd jobs before returning to Texas, where he worked as a day laborer.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 44–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Johnson managed to enroll at SWTSTC (now [[Texas State University]]). He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, [[University Star|''The College Star'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Student Editorials of Lyndon Baines Johnson |date=1968|publisher=LBJ Common Experience, Paper 1|url= http://ecommons.txstate.edu/lbjcomex/1|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican-American children at the segregated Welhausen School in [[Cotulla, Texas|Cotulla]], some {{convert|90|mi}} south of [[San Antonio]] in [[La Salle County, Texas|La Salle County]]. The job helped him to save money to complete his education and he graduated in 1930. He briefly taught at [[Pearsall, Texas|Pearsall]] High School before taking a position as teacher of public speaking at [[Sam Houston High School (Houston, Texas)|Sam Houston High School]] in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/biographys.hom/lbj_bio.asp |title=President Lyndon B.

When he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], Johnson reminisced:

{{quote|I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Remarks at Southwest Texas State College Upon Signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 |publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum |accessdate=April 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714005531/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |archivedate=July 14, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Entry into politics==

Johnson later used an edited version of this photo, with Allred airbrushed out, in his 1941 senatorial campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caro|first=Robert|title=The Path to Power|at=Location 15443 (Kindle edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After [[Richard M. Kleberg]] won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the [[United States House of Representatives]], he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. Johnson got the position on the recommendation of his own father and that of State Senator Welly Hopkins, who Johnson had campaigned for in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 69, 73–75&lt;/ref&gt; Kleberg had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating them to Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 76–80&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]], Johnson became a staunch supporter of Roosevelt's [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was elected speaker of the "Little Congress," a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Congressman [[Sam Rayburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson married [[Lady Bird Johnson|Claudia Alta Taylor]], also known as "Lady Bird", of [[Karnack, Texas]] on November 17, 1934, after he attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]] for several months. The wedding was officiated by Rev. [[Arthur R. McKinstry]] at [[St. Mark's Episcopal Church (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Mark's Episcopal Church]] in [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/29/obituaries/a-r-mckinstry-97-ex-episcopal-bishop.html |title=A.

Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials; his dog was Little Beagle Johnson. His home was the [[LBJ Ranch]]; his initials were on his cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes.&lt;ref name="Inc1956"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steele |first=John |title=A Kingmaker or a Dark Horse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=70gEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA121 |date=June 25, 1956 |journal=Life |pages=111–124 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, he was appointed head of the Texas [[National Youth Administration]], which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss throughout his career, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2006, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by friends, fellow politicians and historians as motivated by an exceptional lust for power and control. As Johnson's biographer [[Robert Caro]] observes, "Johnson's ambition was uncommon—in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Caro 1982, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in U.S. House of Representatives (1937–1949)==

In 1937, Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for [[Texas's 10th congressional district]], that covered [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and the surrounding hill country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served in the House from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000160|title=JOHNSON, Lyndon Baines&amp;nbsp;– Biographical Information|publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information, particularly with regard to issues concerning internal politics in Texas ([[Operation Texas]]) and the machinations of Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Sam Rayburn]]. Johnson was immediately appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Naval Affairs|Naval Affairs Committee]]. He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district. Johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew, such as the [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|Brown]] Brothers, Herman and George, who would finance much of Johnson's future career.&lt;ref name="Caro 1982"/&gt; In 1941, he ran for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination in a special election; his main opponent was the sitting [[Governor of Texas]], businessman and radio personality [[W. Lee O'Daniel]]; Johnson narrowly lost the Democratic primary, which was then [[tantamount to election]], with O'Daniel receiving 175,590 votes (30.49%), and Johnson 174,279 (30.26%).

===Active military duty (1941–1942)===

[[File:Portrait of Lyndon B. Johnson in Navy Uniform - 42-3-7 - 03-1942.jpg|thumb|upright|LCDR Johnson, March 1942]]

Johnson was appointed a [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] on June 21, 1940. While serving as a U.S. Representative, he was called to active duty three days after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941. His orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C. for instruction and training.&lt;ref name="military"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/military/military.asp | title=PRESIDENT LYNDON B.

He was sent instead to inspect shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt decided he needed better information on conditions in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], and to send a highly trusted political ally to get it. From a suggestion by Forrestal, Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team of the Southwest Pacific.&lt;ref name="Dallek, Robert pp. 235"&gt;Dallek 1991, pp. 235–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson reported to General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers went to the [[22nd Bomb Group (Red Raiders) 5th Army Air Force|22nd Bomb Group]] base, which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at [[Lae]] in [[New Guinea]]. Johnson's roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber pilot. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on New Guinea by eleven [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bombers that included his roommate in another plane. While on the mission, his roommate and his crew's B-26 bomber was shot down with none of the eight men surviving the crash into the water. Reports vary on what happened to the B-26 bomber carrying Johnson during that mission. Johnson's biographer [[Robert Caro]] accepts Johnson's account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft was attacked, disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective, though remaining under heavy fire. Others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire. This is supported by official flight records.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |title= In-Depth Specials&amp;nbsp;– The story behind Johnson's Silver Star |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613123509/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html |archivedate = June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/06/internationaleducationnews.humanities  LBJ's medal for valour 'was sham'] ''The Guardian'', 6 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Other airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target at about the same time that Johnson's plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase. MacArthur recommended Johnson for the [[Silver Star]] for gallantry in action: the only member of the crew to receive a decoration.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; After it was approved by the Army, he personally presented the medal to Johnson, with the following citation:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

{{quote|For gallantry in action in the vicinity of Port Moresby and Salamaua, New Guinea, on June 9, 1942. While on a mission of obtaining information in the Southwest Pacific area, Lieutenant Commander Johnson, in order to obtain personal knowledge of combat conditions, volunteered as an observer on a hazardous aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea. As our planes neared the target area they were intercepted by eight hostile fighters. When, at this time, the plane in which Lieutenant Commander Johnson was an observer, developed mechanical trouble and was forced to turn back alone, presenting a favorable target to the enemy fighters, he evidenced marked coolness in spite of the hazards involved. His gallant actions enabled him to obtain and return with valuable information.}}

Johnson, who had used a movie camera to record conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/war-and-forgiveness-437c52499d02|title=War and Forgiveness|author=Steve Weintz|date=Dec 24, 2013|work=War Is Boring|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported to Roosevelt, to Navy leaders, and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable: some historians have suggested this was in exchange for MacArthur's recommendation to award the Silver Star.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; He argued that the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were "far inferior" to Japanese planes; and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a "critical" need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing "greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters". Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee,&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; with a mission similar to that of the [[Truman Committee]] in the Senate. He probed the peacetime "business as usual" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer, [[Robert Dallek]] concludes, "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men."&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Silver Star, Johnson received the [[American Campaign Medal]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], and the [[World War II Victory Medal]]. He was released from active duty on July 17, 1942 and remained in the Navy Reserve, later promoted to [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] on October 19, 1949 (effective June 2, 1948). He resigned from the Navy Reserve effective January 18, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/health/newsfeatures/2015/february/list-of-presidents-who-were-veterans.asp|title=List of Presidents who were Veterans|author=Veterans Health Administration|date=|work=va.gov|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in U.S. Senate (1949–1961)==

===Contested 1948 election===
[[File:Senator Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson, pictured as a U.S. Senator from Texas]]
In the [[U.S. Senate election, 1948|1948 elections]], Johnson again ran for the Senate and won in a highly controversial result in a three-way Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]]. Johnson faced a well-known former governor, [[Coke Stevenson]] and [[George Peddy]] (a former state representative of District 8 in Shelby County). Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter dubbed "The Johnson City Windmill". He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by voting for the [[Taft-Hartley]] act (curbing union power) as well as by criticizing unions. Stevenson came in first but lacked a majority, so a runoff was held; Johnson campaigned even harder, while Stevenson's efforts slumped.

The runoff count took a week, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee, because this was a party primary. Johnson was finally announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295 cast. The Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination by a majority of one (29–28), with the last vote cast on Johnson's behalf by [[Temple, Texas]], publisher [[Frank W. Mayborn]]. There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor [[John B. Connally]], was connected with 202 ballots in [[Box 13 scandal|Precinct 13]] in [[Jim Wells County, Texas|Jim Wells County]] where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting, just at the close of polling. Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day.&lt;ref&gt;Caro 1990, pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Caro]] argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County and that 10,000 ballots were also rigged in [[Bexar County]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2006, p. 217; Caro 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.&lt;ref name="'70s"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-465-04195-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court but Johnson prevailed, with timely help from his friend [[Abe Fortas]]. He soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed "Landslide Lyndon." Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshman senator to majority whip===

Once in the Senate, Johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful "courtships" of older senators, especially Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.|Richard Russell]], Democrat from Georgia, the leader of the [[Conservative coalition]] and arguably the most powerful man in the Senate. Johnson proceeded to gain Russell's favor in the same way that he had "courted" Speaker Sam Rayburn and gained his crucial support in the House.

Johnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee and in 1950, he helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. Johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. These investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration, although it can be said that the committee's investigations reinforced the need for changes. Johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press, the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee. Johnson used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in his wife's name.&lt;ref name="'70s"/&gt;&lt;ref name="new yorker"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Johnson Years: Buying And Selling|last=Caro|first=Robert A.|authorlink=Robert Caro|date=December 18, 1989|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1989/12/18/1989_12_18_043_TNY_CARDS_000356927}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1950 general elections, Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader, [[Ernest McFarland]] of [[Arizona]], and served from 1951 to 1953.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Senate Democratic leader===

[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Richard Russell.jpg|thumb|President Johnson endeavors to give "The Treatment" to Senator [[Richard Russell Jr.|Richard Russell]] in 1963]]

In the [[United States Senate election, 1952|1952 general election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] won a majority in both the House and Senate. Among defeated Democrats that year was McFarland, who lost to upstart [[Barry Goldwater]]. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the minority leader; he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees, while retaining it for chairmanships. In the [[United States Senate election, 1954|1954 election]], Johnson was re-elected to the Senate and, since the Democrats won the majority in the Senate, then became majority leader. Former majority leader [[William Knowland]] became minority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

During the [[Suez Crisis]], Johnson tried to prevent the US government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula. Along with the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], which established the civilian space agency [[NASA]].

Historians Caro and Dallek consider Lyndon Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was "the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known", discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2006, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/lbj_05.html#v230|title=LBJ|work=American Experience|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to Johnson's control was "The Treatment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterimagegallery.com/nytjohnson.htm |title=New York Times, The Johnson Treatment: Lyndon B. Johnson and Theodore F. Green |publisher=Afterimagegallery.com |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; described by two journalists:

{{quote|The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself—wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.

Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Rowland Evans|first=Rowland|last=Evans|authorlink2=Robert Novak|first2=Robert|last2=Novak|title=Lyndon B. Johnson: The Exercise of Power|year=1966|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, Johnson suffered a near-fatal heart attack on July 2, 1955. He abruptly gave up smoking as a result and, with only a couple of exceptions, did not resume the habit until he left the White House on January 20, 1969. Johnson announced he would remain as his party's leader in the Senate on New Year's Eve 1955, his doctors reporting he had made "a most satisfactory recovery" since his heart attack five months prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=A7-hzOuI2KQC&amp;dat=19560101&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=Lyndon Johnson To Retain Post|date=January 1, 1956|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=ie8Y0QrpMWAC&amp;dat=19560101&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=Johnson To Continue As Demo Leader|date=January 1, 1956|publisher=Times Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigns of 1960==
{{See also|United States presidential election, 1960}}

Johnson's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; he had been the "[[favorite son]]" candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956 and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. [[James H. Rowe|Jim Rowe]] repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it better to wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move which Johnson thought played into his own strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, pp. 544–545.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidacy for president===
Johnson made a late entry into the campaign in July 1960 which, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing "Landslide Lyndon".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure.&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2012, Part I (passim).&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure to take a position regarding Joseph McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; He had formed a "Stop Kennedy" coalition with [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], [[Stuart Symington]], and [[Hubert Humphrey]], but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy's 806, and so the convention nominated Kennedy. [[Tip O'Neill]] was a representative from Kennedy's home state of [[Massachusetts]] at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, "Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot." O'Neill replied, "Senator, there's not going to be any second ballot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Century: A Biography|author=John A. Farrell|year=2001|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-26049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice-presidential nomination===
According to Kennedy's Special Counsel [[Myer Feldman]] and to Kennedy himself, it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place. Kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. AFL-CIO President [[George Meany]] called Johnson "the arch foe of labor," while Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben G. Soderstrom|Reuben Soderstrom]] asserted Kennedy had "made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement."&lt;ref&gt;Caro, Robert (2012). ''The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson''. New York: Vintage Books. p. 406. {{ISBN|978-0-375-71325-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018). [http://www.fortygavels.com/ ''Forty Gavels: The Life of Reuben Soderstrom and the Illinois AFL-CIO''.] '''3'''. Peoria, IL: CWS Publishing. pp. 175-176. {{ISBN|978-0998257532}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter, Kennedy did offer Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&amp;nbsp;am on July 14, the morning after he was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, the facts are in dispute in many respects. (Convention chairman [[LeRoy Collins]]' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed.)&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1991, pp. 578–582.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seymour Hersh stated that [[Robert F. Kennedy]] (known as Bobby) hated Johnson for his personal attacks on the Kennedy family, and later maintained that his brother offered the position to Johnson merely as a courtesy, expecting him to decline. [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] concurred with Robert Kennedy's version of events, and put forth that John Kennedy would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]], alleging that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] and pressured Kennedy to favor Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour M. Hersh, ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kennedy wanted his brother to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960|last=Cosgrave|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2014|website=Time Magazine|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Robert Caro offered a different perspective; he wrote that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|election]] against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry Texas and the [[Southern United States|Southern states]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, John Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&amp;nbsp;am, John Kennedy asked Robert Kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes "including Texas".&lt;ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."&gt;Caro 2012, pp. 121–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Salinger realized the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, and asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied "yes".&lt;ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/&gt; Caro contends that it was then that John Kennedy called Johnson to arrange a meeting; he also called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that he nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role. According to Caro, Kennedy and Johnson met and Johnson said that Kennedy would have trouble with Kennedy supporters who were anti–Johnson. Kennedy returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters, including northern political bosses. O'Donnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and, after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, Robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson—apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization.&lt;ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/&gt;

Caro continues in his analysis that Robert Kennedy tried to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate; he met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say that Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought "it was a stroke of genius".&lt;ref name="Caro 2012, pp. 121–135."/&gt; When John and Robert Kennedy next saw their father [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr|Joe Kennedy]], he told them that signing Johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done.&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2012, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-election to U.S. Senate===
At the same time as his vice presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro, "On November 8, 1960, Lyndon Johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961."&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2002, p. 1035.&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1988, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], the vice presidential running mate of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Michael Dukakis]], and a [[United States Senate|Senator]] from Texas, took advantage of "Lyndon's law," and was able to retain his seat in the Senate despite Dukakis' loss to [[George H. W. Bush]].)

Johnson was re-elected Senator with 1,306,605 votes (58&amp;nbsp;percent) to Republican [[John Tower|John Tower's]] 927,653 (41.1&amp;nbsp;percent). Fellow Democrat [[William A. Blakley]] was appointed to replace Johnson as Senator, but Blakley lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.

==Vice Presidency (1961–1963)==
After the election, Johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office, and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom he had counted as his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/lyndon_johnson.pdf|title=Vice Presidents of the United States – Lyndon B. Johnson (1963)|format=PDF|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|[[President Kennedy]] and Vice President Johnson stroll outside the [[White House]] prior to a ceremony]]

Johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson "general supervision" over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to "cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments." Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to "review" national security policies instead.&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2012, pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office, and to employ a full-time Vice Presidential staff within the White House.&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2012, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend [[Sarah T. Hughes]] to a federal judgeship, whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency. [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.

Moreover, many members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of Johnson, including the president's brother, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque, crude manner. Congressman [[Tip O'Neill]] recalled that the Kennedy men "had a disdain for Johnson that they didn't even try to hide....They actually took pride in snubbing him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Neill |first1=Tip |last2=Novak |first2=William |title=Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill |date=1987 |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=182 |isbn=978-0-394-55201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy, however, made efforts to keep Johnson busy, informed, and at the White House often, telling aides, "I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy."&lt;ref&gt;Caro 2012, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the President's Committee on [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment Opportunities]], through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position, but [[Taylor Branch]] in ''Pillar of Fire'' contends that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go. Branch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for [[civil rights]], when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters. In particular, he notes Johnson's [[Memorial Day]] 1963 speech at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] as being a catalyst that led to more action.

President Kennedy throws out the first ball at [[Griffith Stadium]], the home field of the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]], as LBJ and [[Hubert Humphrey]] look on.]]

Johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions, which gave him limited insights into global issues, as well as opportunities at self-promotion in the name of showing the country's flag. He attended Cabinet and [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics Space Council]]. The Soviets beat the US with [[Vostok 1|the first manned spaceflight]] in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the state of the US space program and recommending a project that would allow the US to catch up or beat the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy to Johnson, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo1.pdf "Memorandum for Vice President,"] April 20, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson responded with a recommendation that the US gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a [[Apollo program|project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s]].&lt;ref name="lbjmemo"&gt;Johnson to Kennedy, [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf "Evaluation of Space Program,"] April 28, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Evans, ''Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies'' (2010) p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when [[Bobby Baker]], the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protégé of Johnson's, came under investigation by the [[Senate Rules Committee]] for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year. Kennedy replied, "Yes to both those questions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0811F93A541A7B93C1AB178AD95F478685F9 "Kennedy Denied Talk of Dropping Johnson"]. ''The New York Times'', November 23, 1963, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other,&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Shesol, ''Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy and the Feud that Defined a Decade'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South in the 1964 election, and they agreed that Johnson would stay on the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean J. Savage, ''JFK, LBJ, and the Democratic Party'' (2012) pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency (1963–1969)==
{{Main|Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson}}
Johnson's presidency took place during a healthy economy, with steady growth and low unemployment. Regarding the rest of the world, there were no serious controversies with major countries. Attention therefore focused on domestic policy, and, after 1966, on the Vietnam War.

Johnson was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock. He and the Secret Service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy, and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington. This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the assassination, Lyndon B. Johnson made an address to Congress saying that "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/|title=1963 Year in Review – Transition to Johnson |publisher=UPI |date=November 19, 1966 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda.

On November 29, 1963, just one week after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center|Apollo Launch Operations Center]] and the NASA/Air Force [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral launch facilities]] as the John F. Kennedy Space Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The National Archives, Lyndon B.

Also on November 29, Johnson established a panel headed by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], known as the [[Warren Commission]], through [[executive order]] to investigate Kennedy's assassination and surrounding conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] acted alone in the assassination. However, the report remains controversial among some [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theorists]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Chapman, "The Kennedy Assassination 50 Years Later." ''International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence'' (2014) 27#3 pp. 615–619.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson retained senior Kennedy appointees, some for the full term of his presidency. He even retained Robert Kennedy as Attorney General, with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship. Robert Kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, [[Walter Jenkins]] was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. [[George Reedy]], who was Johnson's second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace Busby was another "triple-threat man," as Johnson referred to his aides. He served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Moyers]] was the youngest member of Johnson's staff. He handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative initiatives===
The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals—a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with [[Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his [[War on Poverty]], recruiting Kennedy relative [[Sargent Shriver]], then head of the [[Peace Corps]], to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, LBJ sent to Congress the [[Economic Opportunity Act]], which created the [[Job Corps]] and the [[Community Action Program]], designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created [[Americorps VISTA|VISTA]], Volunteers in Service to America, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 76–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
[[File:Lyndon Johnson meeting with civil rights leaders.jpg|thumb|Meeting with civil rights leaders Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (left), [[Whitney Young]], and [[James Farmer]] in the [[Oval Office]] in 1964]]

President Kennedy had submitted a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which was met with strong opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves 1993, pp. 521–523&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|origyear=1965|year=2002|title=A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House|page=973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Robert Caro]] notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p459"&gt;Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/&gt;

Johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/&gt; In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil-rights bill was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p459"/&gt; Believing that the current course meant that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p460"&gt;Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a [[discharge petition]] to force it onto the House floor.&lt;ref name="Caro, Robert p462"&gt;Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the [[filibuster]] as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader [[Everett Dirksen]] to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71–29.&lt;ref&gt;Caro, Robert. "The Passage of Power". p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur Jr.|origyear=1978|year=2002|title=Robert Kennedy And His Times|pages=644–645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson signed the fortified [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law on July 2.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger-Pages644-645"/&gt; Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, "I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Randall B. Woods has argued that Johnson effectively used appeals to [[Judeo-Christian ethics]] to garner support for the civil rights law. Woods writes that Johnson undermined the Southern filibuster against the bill:

{{quote|LBJ wrapped white America in a moral straight jacket. How could individuals who fervently, continuously, and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just God continue to condone racial discrimination, police brutality, and segregation? Where in the Judeo-Christian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in Alabama, denying an equal education to black children, barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families? Was Jim Crow to be America's response to "Godless Communism"? &lt;ref&gt;Randall B. Woods, "The Politics of Idealism: Lyndon Johnson, Civil Rights, and Vietnam." ''Diplomatic History'' 31#1 (2007): 1-18, quote p 5; The same text appears in Woods, ''Prisoners of Hope: Lyndon B. Johnson, the Great Society, and the Limits of Liberalism'' (2016) p 89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Woods states that Johnson's religiosity ran deep: "At 15 he joined the Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate."&lt;ref&gt;Woods, "The Politics of Idealism" p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor, FDR, in that he paired liberal values to religious values, believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, ''Prisoners of Hope'' p 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Great Society===

Johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965. Eric Goldman, who joined the White House in December of that year, thought Johnson's domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman's book, ''The Good Society''. Richard Goodwin tweaked it—to "[[Great Society|The Great Society]]"—and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the [[University of Michigan]]. It encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964 presidential election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1964}}

In Spring 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of [[featherbedding]]. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence as well as his image.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyndon Johnson at the 1964 Illinois AFL-CIO Convention.jpg|left|thumb|President Lyndon Johnson (left), alongside Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben G. Soderstrom|Reuben Soderstrom]] (center) and Vice President Stanley Johnson (right), speaks to the delegates of the 1964 Illinois AFL-CIO convention.]]

That same year, Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy however had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion, and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 157–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send a squad of 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities on the floor. The squad's focus narrowed upon the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad's activities also included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 161–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1964.svg|thumb|1964 presidential election results]]

In fact, Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to "bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color."&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] would call it a "turning point in the civil rights movement."&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=John |last2=D'Orso |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Mike D'Orso |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |date=1998 |title=Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement |isbn=978-0156007085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=3|left|Full "Daisy" advertisement]]

Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the "[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy ad]]". It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a [[Common Daisy|daisy]], counting up to ten. Then a baritone voice took over, counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming "In your heart, you know he's right.". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said "In your heart, you know he might" and "In your gut, you know he's nuts".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote, making it the highest ever [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|share of the popular vote]].&lt;ref&gt;Leip, David. ''[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 15.95&amp;nbsp;million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936—a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a house with a 295–140 Democratic margin.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting Rights Act===
Johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office, ready to "carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1964/New-Moscow-Khrushchev-Fired/|title=1964 Year in Review – New Moscow: Khrushchev Fired|publisher=UPI|date=November 19, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyndon Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr. - Voting Rights Act.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|President Lyndon B. Johnson, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Rosa Parks]] at the signing of the [[Voting Rights Act]] on August 6, 1965]]

Johnson gave a congressional speech—Dallek considers it his greatest—in which he said "rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself ... rarely are we met with the challenge ... to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation."&lt;ref name="Dallek 1998, p.218"&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the [[Voting Rights Act]], which outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. In accordance with the act, several states—"seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy" (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia)—were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965, while Texas, then home to the largest African American population of any state, followed in 1975.&lt;ref name="Davidson, C. 1994 p. 3"&gt;Davidson, C. &amp; Grofman, B. (1994). ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact Of The Voting Right Act, 1965–1990''. p. 3, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77–19 after 2 1/2 months, and it won passage in the house in July, 333–85. The results were significant: between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally; a few hundred black office-holders in 1965 mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.&lt;ref name="Dallek 1998, p.218"/&gt;

After the murder of civil rights worker [[Viola Liuzzo]], Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a "hooded society of bigots," and warned them to "return to a decent society before it's too late." Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] about 93 years earlier.{{efn|President Grant, on October 17, 1871 suspended [[habeas corpus]] in nine [[South Carolina]] counties, sent in troops, and prosecuted the Klan in the federal district court.}}&lt;ref&gt;McFeely (2002), ''Grant: A Biography'', pp. 369–371.&lt;/ref&gt; He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, thereby mobilizing support from churches North and South.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2006, pp. 759–787.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Howard University]] commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals: "To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice, but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong—great wrong—to the children of God..."&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1965.'' Volume II, entry 301, pp. 635–640 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Johnson nominated civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to be the first African-American [[list of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] of the Supreme Court. To head the new [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]], Johnson appointed [[Robert C. Weaver]], the first African-American cabinet secretary in any U.S. presidential administration. In 1968 Johnson signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 [[Chicago Freedom Movement|Chicago Open Housing Movement]], the April 4, 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], and the [[King assassination riots|civil unrest]] across the country following King's death.&lt;ref name=Kotz2005P417&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days : Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King,&amp;nbsp;Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-618-08825-6|page=417|chapter=14.

===Immigration===
[[File:Immigration Bill Signing - A1421-33a - 10-03-1965.jpg|thumb|President Johnson signs the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] as Sen. Edward Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy, and others look on]]

With the passage of the sweeping [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], the country's immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed. The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Mexico.&lt;ref name="'70s"/&gt; Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarren-Walters Act]] of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Mitchell B.|title=A Companion to Lyndon B.

===Federal funding for education===

Johnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty, and was an essential component of the [[American dream]], especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted budgets from local taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein 1996, pp. 183–213.&lt;/ref&gt; He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, LBJ launched a legislative effort which took the name of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion;&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1988, pp. 195–198.&lt;/ref&gt; with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26, and then it remarkably passed without change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was an historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1988, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, large amounts of federal money went to public schools. In practice ESEA meant helping all public school districts, with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families (which included all the big cities).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein 1996, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time private schools (most of them Catholic schools in the inner cities) received services, such as library funding, comprising about 12&amp;nbsp;percent of the ESEA budget. Though federal funds were involved, they were administered by local officials, and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line. Dallek further reports that researchers cited by [[Hugh Davis Graham]] soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received. Early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by ESEA reading and math programs, but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes. Johnson's second major education program was the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], which focused on funding for lower income students, including grants, work-study money, and government loans.

Although ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2006, pp. 563–68; Dallek 1988, pp. 196–202.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Johnson signed the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|Public Broadcasting Act]] to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks.

In 1965, Johnson also set up the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], to support academic subjects such as literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture (as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] once did).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=US Code|first1=§ 952|title=National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/952|website=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="War on Poverty" and healthcare reform===

In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1964]] and the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|Economic Opportunity Act]], as part of the [[war on poverty]]. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]], [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[Federal Work-Study Program|Work Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/751/769950/Documents_Library/eoa1964.htm|title=Economic Opportunity Act of 1964|first=G. David|last=Garson|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent.&lt;ref name="histeval"/&gt;

Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the "Demonstration Cities Program". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to "arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city." Johnson requested an investment of $400 million per year totaling $2.4 billion. In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900 million, which Johnson later called the [[Model Cities Program]]. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 320–322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation's deaths in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered down version.

As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The key player in initiating this program, named [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], was [[Wilbur Mills]], Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2000pres/20000712.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714214416/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2000pres/20000712.html|archivedate=July 14, 2008|title=Medicare Celebrates 35 Years of Keeping Americans Healthy|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President [[Harry S Truman]] and his wife [[Bess Truman|Bess]] after signing the Medicare bill at the [[Truman Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia P.

===Transportation===

In March 1965, Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, which would include the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the house, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun control===

On October 22, 1968, Lyndon Johnson signed the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], one of the largest and farthest reaching federal gun control laws in American history. Much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

===Space program===
During Johnson's administration, [[NASA]] conducted the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] manned space program, developed the [[Saturn V]] rocket and [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|its launch facility]], and prepared to make the first manned [[Apollo program]] flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]] was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator [[James E. Webb|James E. Webb's]] request for NASA to do its own investigation, holding itself accountable to Congress and the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James E. Webb – NASA Administrator, February 14, 1961 – October 7, 1968 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html| publisher= NASA| work=History.NASA.gov|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425115407/https://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html|archivedate=April 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two manned missions, [[Apollo 7]] and the first manned flight to the Moon, [[Apollo 8]], were completed by the end of Johnson's term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, "You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/lj36.html|title=Lyndon B.

===Urban riots===
[[File:Leffler - 1968 Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. riots.jpg|thumb|Aftermath from a race riot in Washington D.C., April 1968]]

Major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of "long hot summers." They started with a violent disturbance in the [[Harlem Riot of 1964|Harlem riots]] in 1964, and the [[Watts Riots|Watts district]] of Los Angeles in 1965, and extended to 1971. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965, with the riots in Watts. After 34 people were killed and $35 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|35|1965|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in LBJ's agenda was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1967 Newark riots|Newark burned]] in 1967, where six days of rioting left 26 dead, 1500 injured, and the inner city a burned out shell. In [[1967 Detroit riot|Detroit in 1967]], Governor [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] sent in 7400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and on police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead, 2250 were injured, 4000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The [[King assassination riots|biggest wave of riots]] came in April 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this fell on deaf ears. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Randall (2006), pp. 790–795; Michael W. Flamm. ''Law And Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson created the [[Kerner Commission]] to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor [[Otto Kerner Jr.|Otto Kerner]].&lt;ref name="'70s"/&gt; According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: "What did you expect? I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off."&lt;ref name=Kotz2005P418&gt;{{cite book|last=Kotz|first=Nick|title=Judgment days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and the laws that changed America|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-618-08825-6|page=418|chapter=14.

===Backlash against Johnson: 1966–1967===
[[File:Marcos visit Johnson 1966.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Bird Johnson]] (left) and LBJ with [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand]] and [[Imelda Marcos]] on September 12, 1966]]
In 1966 the press sensed a "[[credibility gap]]" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.&lt;ref name="american chronicle"&gt;{{cite news

By year's end, the Democratic governor of [[Missouri]], [[Warren E. Hearnes]], warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a 500,000 margin in 1964. "Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs" had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in [[interest rate]]s. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in [[income tax]]es to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16%, from 25 percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] in trial matchups that spring. Asked to explain why he was unpopular, Johnson responded, "I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people." Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed "complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to." He also blamed "the preachers, liberals and professors" who had turned against him.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 391–396; quotes on pp. 391 and 396.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[United States House election, 1966|congressional elections of 1966]], the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the [[conservative coalition]] and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass any additional Great Society legislation. However, in the end Congress passed almost 96 percent of the administration's Great Society programs, which Johnson then signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideainfanttoddler.org/pdf/AppA.pdf|title=The Impact of the Great Society Upon The Lives of Families and Young Children|publisher=Infant &amp; Toddler Coordinators Association|date=August 2005|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam War===
{{see also|Vietnam War}}

At Kennedy's death, there were 16,000 American military personnel stationed in [[Vietnam]] supporting [[South Vietnam]] in the war against [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Vietnam War"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |title=Brief Overview of Vietnam War |publisher=Swarthmore College Peace Collection |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124531/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm |archivedate=August 3, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] into two countries, with North Vietnam led by a Communist government. Johnson subscribed to the [[Domino Theory]] in Vietnam and to a [[containment]] policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion.&lt;ref name="scholastic"&gt;{{cite news

Taylor]], declared his readiness "to do more when we had a base" or when Saigon was politically more stable.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].

====1964====
[[File:Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi and Lyndon B Johnson Souvenir Poster.jpg|thumb|Shah of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and Queen [[Farah Pahlavi]] with the Johnsons on their visit to the United States]]

In August 1964, allegations arose from the military that two US destroyers had been attacked by some North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters {{convert|40|mi|km}} from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin; naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory. Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the Vietnamese, so he sought and obtained from the Congress the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] on August 7. Johnson was determined to embolden his image on foreign policy, and also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action. Responding to the purported attack would also blunt presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp. The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of [[SEATO]] requesting assistance. Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary US goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any US offensive posture.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 144–155&lt;/ref&gt; The public's reaction to the resolution at the time was positive—48 percent favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14 percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he had a sense of foreboding about Vietnam—a feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly. Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional [[Viet Minh]] attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on [[Bien Hoa Air Base]] in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs, and also after public pollster [[Louis Harris|Lou Harris]] confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam; U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.&lt;ref name="Vietnam War"/&gt;

In the winter of 1964–65 Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists, with only 26 to 30 percent opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with [[McGeorge Bundy|Mac Bundy]] and McNamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, "Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General [[Nguyễn Khánh]] (head of the new government) is our boy".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1965====
[[File:Robert S. McNamara and General Westmoreland in Vietnam 1965.png|thumb|Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] and [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland]] in Vietnam 1965]]

Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate US action to avoid defeat; also, the [[Viet Cong]] had just killed eight US advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at [[Pleiku Air Base]]. The eight-week bombing campaign became known as [[Operation Rolling Thunder]]. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear: there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public, and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces—air operations alone, he counseled, would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South. Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000 and the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions. More significantly, he also authorized a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; he nevertheless continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of June, the total US ground forces in Vietnam were increased to 82,000 or by 150 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Gen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the center of her forehead, you don't keep her in the living room".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 272–277.&lt;/ref&gt; By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1966====
[[File:Visit of President Johnson in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Awarding a medal to a US soldier during a visit to Vietnam in 1966]]

Public and political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966, and Johnson's approval ratings reached a new low of 41 percent. [[Richard Russell Jr.|Sen. Richard Russell]], Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, reflected the national mood in June 1966 when he declared it was time to "get it over or get out".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson responded by saying to the press, "we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost."&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort, Johnson raised suspicions of communist subversion in the country, and press relations became strained.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's primary war policy opponent in Congress was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, [[James William Fulbright]],&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; who convened a series of public hearings in February to question a range of experts on the progress of war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-09-28/1966-fulbright-hearings-vietnam-parted-curtains-president-johnsons-conduct-war "The 1966 Fulbright hearings on Vietnam parted the curtains on President Johnson's conduct of the war"], September 28, 2017, PRI.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The persistent Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 372–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey, Rusk and McNamara all agreed, and the bombing began at the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt; In July polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a 5 to 1 margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Marcos and US President Johnson at the SEATO Conference at Malacañang Palace in 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Philippines President [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] hosting the leaders of [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] nations during the Manila Conference on the Vietnam War]]

In the fall of 1966, multiple sources began to report that progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as "a barbaric aggressive war of conquest", and in June he initiated the [[Russell Tribunal|International War Crimes Tribunal]] as a means to condemn the American effort.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed [[Averell Harriman]] "Ambassador for Peace" to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians and New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in December Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; In a discussion about the war with former President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was "trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how" and later stated that he needed "all the help I can get."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |title=LBJ Library releases telephone conversation recordings |publisher=Lbjlib.utexas.edu |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611221222/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/Press.hom/tape_release_11_2006.shtm |archivedate = June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By year's end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual, as had been the air campaign. Johnson then agreed to McNamara's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed. While McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing, Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 386–388.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi and Warsaw. While the bombing ended the talks, North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1967====
[[File:LBJ-and-McNamara.jpg|thumb|Johnson talking with his Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], 1967]]

In January and February 1967, probes were made to assess North Vietnamese willingness to discuss peace, but they fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 445–447.&lt;/ref&gt; A Gallup poll taken in July 1967 showed 52 percent of the country disapproving of the president's handling of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, "I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months", he shouted. "You'll be dead politically in six months".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports, again of questionable reliability, which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement. The CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 463–464.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war. In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a "stalemate". Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that "we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 470–471.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi; this was met with dissatisfaction. In a Texas speech Johnson agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt; this was named the "San Antonio" formula. There was no response, but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 482–484.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vietnam War protestors march at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 1967. Support for the war was dropping and [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|the anti-Vietnam War movement]] strengthened.]]

With the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group called the "Wise Men" for a fresh, in-depth look at the war—Dean Acheson, Gen. Omar Bradley, George Ball, Mac Bundy, Arthur Dean, Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Murphy and Max Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time McNamara, reversing his position on the war, recommended that a cap of 525,000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted, since he could see no success. Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara's resignation soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of George Ball, the "Wise Men" all agreed the administration should "press forward".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 US election results before deciding to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 1967, Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protesters]] tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking. The march was led by a coalition of peace protestors. However, a small group of [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]] and [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and, when they reached the hotel, staged a sit-down. Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd. The [[Riot Act]] was read and 51 protestors arrested.&lt;ref name="NYT62467"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gladwin Hill|title=51 Protesters Arrested|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=June 24, 1967|url=http://nyti.ms/2heLqF0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marxist5R"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jim Dann and Hari Dillon|title=The Five Retreats: A History of the Failure of the Progressive Labor Party  CHAPTER 2: THE RETREAT FROM THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT 1967-1968|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/1960-1970/5retreats/chapter2.htm#bk15|website=Marxist.org|publisher=Marxist.org|accessdate=December 12, 2016|quote=On June 23, 1967 President Johnson came to Century City, Los Angeles to speak.

A 4 hour bloody battle ensued after the police attacked the march, with injuries on both sides and -a partial victory for the anti-war movement because LBJ never dared speak in public again.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles. Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed.&lt;ref name = LATretro &gt;"Crowd Battles LAPD as War Protest Turns Violent", http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2009/05/crowd-battles-lapd-as-war-protest-turns-violent-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size and violence of this event, Johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases.&lt;ref name = LATretro /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marxist5R"/&gt;

With the ever-increasing public protests against the war, in October Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor and undermine anti-war activists.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 486–487.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, which was refuted by CIA findings.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1968====
[[File:L B Johnson Model Khe Sanh.jpeg|thumb|[[Walt Whitman Rostow]] shows President Lyndon B. Johnson a model of the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]] area in February 1968]]

As casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] cards, and chanted, "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"&lt;ref name="scholastic"/&gt; Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], where thousands of [[hippies]], [[yippies]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and other opponents of Johnson's policies both in Vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kusch, Battleground Chicago: The Police and the 1968 Democratic National Convention (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the "hawks" rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the "doves" rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well known quotes was "the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best".&lt;ref&gt;Gould 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30 the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese launched the [[Tet Offensive]] against South Vietnam's five largest cities, including Saigon and the US embassy there and other government installations. While the Tet offensive failed militarily, it was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort. Iconically, Walter Cronkite of CBS news, voted the nation's "most trusted person" in February, expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing. Johnson reacted, saying "If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 505–506.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, demoralization about the war was everywhere; 26% then approved of Johnson's handling of Vietnam; 63% disapproved. Johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22,000, despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1968 Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war. Clark Clifford, the new Defense Secretary, described the war as "a loser" and proposed to "cut losses and get out".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31 Johnson spoke to the nation of "Steps to Limit the War in Vietnam". He then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time. At the close of his speech [[Shermanesque statement|he also announced]], "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President".&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing B-52 dropping bombs.jpg|thumb|Tens of thousands of civilians were killed during the American bombing of North Vietnam in [[Operation Rolling Thunder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/timeline/index2.html |title=Battlefield:Vietnam Timeline |publisher=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 90 percent of North Vietnam's population and 75 percent of its territory was off-limits to bombing. In April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks, and after extensive negotiations over the site, Paris was agreed to and talks began in May. When the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 538–541.&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite recommendations in August from Harriman, Vance, Clifford and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks, Johnson refused.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; In October when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, making promises of better terms, so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 584–585.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Johnson's primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks. Ironically, only after Nixon added his urging did they do so. Even then they argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Six-Day War and Israel===
[[File:Glassboro-meeting1967.jpg|thumb|Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] (left) next to Johnson during the [[Glassboro Summit Conference]]]]

In a 1993 interview for the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|Johnson Presidential Library]] oral history archives, Johnson's Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that a [[carrier battle group]], the [[U.S. 6th Fleet]], sent on a training exercise toward [[Gibraltar]], was re-positioned back towards the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to be able to assist Israel during the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967. Given the rapid Israeli advances following their strike on Egypt, the administration "thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians, fearing Israel would attack them, or the Soviets supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel". The Soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move. In a [[Moscow–Washington hotline|hotline]] message from Moscow, Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] said, "If you want war you're going to get war."&lt;ref name="oralhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/McNamaraR/McNamara-SP1.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010707072726/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/oralhistory.hom/McNamaraR/McNamara-SP1.PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 7, 2001|title=LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON LIBRARY ORAL HISTORY COLLECTION|publisher=Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum|format=PDF|accessdate=October 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union supported its Arab allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/agency/mf-med.htm |title=Mediterranean Eskadra |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1967, the Soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the East Mediterranean. Early in the crisis they began to shadow the US and British carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels. The Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John B. | last = Hattendorf | authorlink = John Hattendorf | title= Naval Strategy and Power in the Mediterranean: Past, Present and Future |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7146-8054-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1983 interview with ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', McNamara claimed that "We damn near had war".

===International trips===

[[File:US President Lyndon Johnson Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Countries visited by Johnson during his presidency]]
Johnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/johnson-lyndon-b|title= Travels of President Lyndon B. Johnson|publisher= U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew 523,000 miles aboard [[Air Force One]] while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/lbj-came-all-the-way--but-few-followed-20111111-1nbrg.html |title=LBJ came all the way - but few followed|last1=Humphries |first1=David |date=November 12, 2011 |website=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas in 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial service for Australian Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]], who had disappeared in [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|a swimming accident]] and was presumed drowned. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was 26,959 miles completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped in Travis Air Force Base, Calif., then Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi and Rome.

===1968 presidential election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1968}}
[[File:Lyndon Johnson Richard Nixon 1968.jpg|thumb|President Johnson meets with Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]], July 1968]]
As he had served less than 24 months of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under the provisions of the [[22nd Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially, no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the Democratic Party. Only Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]] challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire]] [[primary election|primary]], hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42&amp;nbsp;percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49{{nbsp}}percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Sen. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in [[Wisconsin]], the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.

By this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party, which was splitting into four factions, each of which generally disliked the other three. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses (led by Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]). The second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group were Catholics, Hispanics and African Americans, who rallied behind Robert Kennedy. The fourth group were traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind [[George C. Wallace]] and the [[American Independent Party]]. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson could see no way to win the war&lt;ref name="scholastic"/&gt; and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Gould 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, although it was not made public at the time, Johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four-year term. In 1967, he secretly commissioned an actuarial study that predicted he would die at 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janos|first1=Leo|title=The Last Days of the President|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1973/07/the-last-days-of-the-president/376281/|accessdate=February 16, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, at the end of a speech on March 31, 1968, he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: "I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-31-1968-remarks-decision-not-seek-re-election|title=Remarks on Decision not to Seek Re-Election (March 31, 1968)|publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36% to 49%.&lt;ref name=Updegrove12&gt;{{cite book|last=Updegrove|first=Mark K.|title=Indomitable will : LBJ in the presidency|year=2012|publisher=Crown|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-88771-9|edition=1st|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have debated the factors that led to Johnson's surprise decision. Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Shesol|title=Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud that Defined a Decade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVrRvYV7i78C&amp;pg=PA545|year=1998|publisher=W W Norton |pages=545–47 |accessdate=October 25, 2015|isbn=9780393318555}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gould says that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the very last minute, when it was too late for Johnson to recover.&lt;ref&gt;Gould 2010, pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal.&lt;ref&gt;Woods 2007, pp. 834–35&lt;/ref&gt; Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 518–525.&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett, however, says Johnson "had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony J. Bennett|title=The Race for the White House from Reagan to Clinton: Reforming Old Systems, Building New Coalitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XH4Os4Cjr-cC&amp;pg=PT160|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|page=160|accessdate=October 25, 2015|isbn=9781137268600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Robert Kennedy's assassination]], Johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give Humphrey the nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Personal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson Rockefeller's]] campaign. He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee, he would not campaign against him (and would not campaign for Humphrey).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perlstein|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Perlstein|title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America|year=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4302-5|title-link=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In what was termed the [[October surprise]], Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of "all air, naval and artillery bombardment of [[North Vietnam]]", effective November 1, should the [[Hanoi]] Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. In the end, Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey, enabling Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]] to win the election.

===Judicial appointments===
{{see also|Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointments|Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointment controversies}}
[[File:Thurgood-marshall-2.jpg|thumb|upright|With the appointment of [[Thurgood Marshall]], Johnson placed the first African American on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].]]

Johnson appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]:
* [[Abe Fortas]]{{snds}}1965
* [[Thurgood Marshall]]{{snds}}1967 (the first African-American)

Johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965, and thought it advantageous to have a "mole" in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's objection that it was too early in his career. Mrs. Fortas expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, pp. 233–235.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Earl Warren]] announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as [[Chief Justice of the United States]], and nominated [[Homer Thornberry]] to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.

{{quote|On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), Johnson saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, Johnson pulled out a cigarette—his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said, "Daddy, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself." He took it back and said, "I've now raised you girls. I've now been President. ''Now it's '''my''' time!''" From that point on, he went into a very self-destructive spiral.|Historian [[Michael Beschloss]]&lt;ref&gt;''Decisions That Shook the World'', vol. 1, 38:18–47. Dir. Gerald Rafshoon. Camera Planet/Discovery Productions, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter [[Harry J. Middleton]], who would draft Johnson's first book, ''The Choices We Face,'' and work with him on his memoirs entitled ''The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969,'' published in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry J. Middleton Curriculum Vitae|date=February 25, 1971|agency=LBJ Presidential Library Reading Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] opened on the campus of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park]], with the provision that the ranch "remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marvin |last=Harris |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/parksci/vol19/vol19(2)/08–1harris.htm |title=Taming the wild pecan at Lyndon B.

Johnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy, but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces too quickly from South Vietnam, before the South Vietnamese were really able to defend themselves. "If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home," he warned.&lt;ref name="theatlantic1973"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/73jul/janos.htm|date=July 1973|title=The Last Days of the President|last=Janos|first=Leo|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], Johnson endorsed Democratic presidential nominee [[George S. McGovern]], a senator from [[South Dakota]], although McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. The McGovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated "if only the Democrats don't go too far left," he had insisted. Johnson had felt [[Edmund Muskie]] would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson's protégé [[John Connally]] had served as President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head "[[Democrats for Nixon]]", a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashman|first=Charles R.|title=Connally: The Adventures of Big Bad John|year=1974|publisher=Morrow|location=New York|isbn=978-0688002220|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heart issues ===
[[File:LBJ At Ranch 1972.jpg|thumb|Wearing a [[ten gallon hat]] at his ranch in Texas, 1972]]

In March 1970, Johnson suffered an attack of [[angina]] and was taken to [[San Antonio Military Medical Center|Brooke Army General Hospital]] on [[Fort Sam Houston]] in [[San Antonio]]. He was urged to lose a considerable amount of weight. Johnson had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the White House, gaining more than {{convert|25|lb}} and weighing around {{convert|235|lb}}. He had also resumed smoking after nearly 15 years without having done so, which contributed further to his health problems. The following summer, again gripped by chest pains, he embarked on a crash water diet, shedding about {{convert|15|lb}} in less than a month. In April 1972, Johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Charlottesville, Virginia. "I'm hurting real bad," he confided to friends. The chest pains hit him nearly every afternoon—a series of sharp, jolting pains that left him scared and breathless. A portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air. He continued to smoke heavily, and, although placed on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only in fits and starts. Meanwhile, he began experiencing severe abdominal pains. Doctors diagnosed this problem through X-rays as [[diverticulosis]]—pouches of tissue forming on the intestine. His condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended, so Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Dr. [[Michael DeBakey]]. DeBakey discovered that even though two of the former President's coronary arteries were critically damaged, the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications.&lt;ref name="theatlantic1973"/&gt;

==Death and funeral==
With Johnson's heart condition now diagnosed as terminal, he returned home to his ranch outside San Antonio. At approximately 3:39{{nbsp}}pm Central Time on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered a massive heart attack. After he had placed a call to the Secret Service agents on the ranch, they rushed to the former President's bedroom. There, they found Johnson still holding the telephone receiver in his hand, unconscious and not breathing. Johnson was airlifted in one of his own airplanes to San Antonio and taken to Brooke Army General, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at the facility by cardiologist and Army colonel Dr. George McGranahan. He was 64 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Age]]'', January 23, 1973, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyndon Baines Johnson grave cropped.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|A memorial wreath at his grave in Texas]]

Shortly after Johnson's death, his press secretary [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]] (no relation) telephoned [[Walter Cronkite]] at CBS; Cronkite was live on the air with the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' at the time, and a report on Vietnam was cut abruptly while Cronkite was still on the line, so he could break the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=j9mCcfN9iRk|title=Death of LBJ as it broke }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's death came two days after [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's second inauguration]], which followed Nixon's landslide victory in the 1972 election. His death meant that for the first time since 1933, when [[Calvin Coolidge]] died during [[Herbert Hoover]]'s final months in office, that there were no former Presidents still living; Johnson had been the only living ex-President since December 26, 1972, following the death of [[Harry S. Truman]]. {{as of|2018}}, Johnson remains the most recent former [[:Category:Democratic Party Presidents of the United States|Democratic President]] to die.

The funeral was held at the [[National City Christian Church]] in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by former Japanese prime minister [[Eisaku Satō]], who served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LBJ buried near his Texas birthplace |date=January 26, 1973|author=United Press International|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=1 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/1976432632.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+26%2C+1973&amp;author=United+Press+International&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(1960-1979)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=LBJ+buried+near+his+Texas+birthplace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eulogies were given by the Rev. Dr. George Davis, the church's pastor, and [[W. Marvin Watson]], former postmaster general.&lt;ref name="Funeral"/&gt; Nixon did not speak, though he attended, as is customary for presidents during state funerals, but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes,&lt;ref name="Funeral"&gt;{{cite news|title=LBJ Buried in Beloved Texas Hills|date=January 26, 1973|first=Haynes|last=Johnson|first2=Jules|last2=Witcover|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=A1|authorlink=Haynes Johnson|authorlink2=Jules Witcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Rusk did the day before, as Nixon mentioned Johnson's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnson lies in state at Capitol; burial is today at Texas ranch|first=Charles|last=Claffey|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 25, 1973|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was buried in his family cemetery (which, although it is part of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park]] in Stonewall, Texas, is still privately owned by the Johnson family, who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery), a few yards from the house in which he was born. Eulogies were given by former Texas governor [[John Connally]] and the Rev. [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last for a president until [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's]] in 2004, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, as the [[United States Army Military District of Washington|Military District of Washington]] (MDW) dealt with its second major task in less than a week, beginning with [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|Nixon's second inauguration]].&lt;ref name="MDW"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elsen|first=William A.|title=Ceremonial Group Had Busy 5 Weeks|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 25, 1973|page=D3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways, because Johnson died only two days after the inauguration.&lt;ref name="Capitol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MDW"/&gt; The MDW and the [[Joint Task Force-Armed Forces Inaugural Committee|Armed Forces Inaugural Committee]] canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration, to allow for a full state funeral,&lt;ref name="MDW"/&gt; and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral.&lt;ref name="MDW"/&gt; It also meant Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.&lt;ref name="Capitol"/&gt;

==Personality and public image==
[[File:LBJ National Portrait Gallery.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Johnson's image as it appears in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C.]]
According to biographer Randall Woods, Johnson posed in many different roles. Depending on the circumstances, he could be:

{{quote|Johnson the Son of the Tenant Farmer, Johnson the Great Compromiser, Johnson the All-Knowing, Johnson the Humble, Johnson the Warrior, Johnson the Dove, Johnson the Romantic, Johnson the Hard-Headed Pragmatist, Johnson the Preserver of Traditions, Johnson the Crusader for Social Justice, Johnson the Magnanimous, Johnson the Vindictive or Johnson the Uncouth, LBJ the Hick, Lyndon the Satyr, and Johnson the Usurper&lt;ref&gt;Woods, ''LBJ,'' pp. 639, 644, 645, quoted in Germany, "Historians and the Many Lyndon Johnsons." p. 1007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other historians have noted how he played additional roles, as Kent Germany reports:

{{quote|the big daddy, the southerner-westerner-Texan, the American dreamer, the politician, the father's son, the rising star, the flawed giant, the Periclean paradox (domestic dreams undone by war), the very human, the tragedy, the pathbreaker, the ascender, and the master.&lt;ref&gt;Germany, "Historians and the Many Lyndon Johnsons." p. 1007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." At {{convert|6|ft|3.5|in|m}} tall,&lt;ref&gt;Caro 1982, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dallek 1998, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dallek|first=Robert|title=An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy|year=2003|publisher=Little, Brown, and Co.|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as "The Johnson Treatment".&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/presidents/lyndon-b-johnson-the-uncivil-rights-reformer-1451816.html|title=Lyndon B Johnson: The uncivil rights reformer – US Presidents' Lives, News |work=The Independent |date= January 21, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2010 | location=London | first=Lisa | last=Jardine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary writes, "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you."&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

Johnson's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country. From {{convert|250|acre}} of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a {{convert|2700|acre|adj=on}} working ranch with 400 head of registered Hereford cattle. The [[National Park Service]] keeps a herd of Hereford cattle descended from Johnson's registered herd and maintains the ranch property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranching the LBJ Way|url=http://www.nps.gov/lyjo/planyourvisit/lbjranching.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Randall Woods argues that [[Social Gospel]] themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the [[Great Society]] and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding "It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Randall B. Woods, ''LBJ: Architect of American Ambition'' (2006) pp. 27, 430, 465–66, 486–87&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LBJ Library and Museum front view with fountain.png|thumb|right|Front view of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library located in Austin, Texas]]
History has viewed Johnson both through the lens of his historic legislative achievements, and his lack of success in the Vietnam War. His overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady over the past 35 years, and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents that followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siena College presidential surveys|url=https://www.siena.edu/centers-institutes/siena-research-institute/social-cultural-polls/us-presidents-study/|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac]] was dedicated on April 6, 1976.

The [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] was named in his honor, as is the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland]]. Also named for him are [[Lyndon B. Johnson High School (Austin, Texas)|Lyndon B. Johnson High School]] in Austin, Lyndon B. Johnson High School in Laredo, Lyndon B. Johnson Middle School in [[Melbourne, Florida]], and Lyndon B. Johnson Elementary School in [[Jackson, Kentucky]]. [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway.

'''''Mene maculata''''', the '''Moonfish''', is the only extant member of the [[genus]] ''[[Mene]]'' and of the [[Family (biology)|family]] Menidae. The body is highly compressed laterally and very deep vertically. The ventral profile is steep, with a sharp ventral edge. The caudal (tail) fin is deeply forked. The mouth is small and protrusible. The body is silvery below and blue-green on the back, with three to four rows of dark gray spots on the upper side. The first two rays of the pelvic fin are greatly elongated, forming a prominent backward-pointing process on the underside of the fish.

The Moonfish is native to the Indian Ocean, including the [[Red Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]], and in the western Pacific where they can be found near the bottom in brackish and marine waters in the vicinity of [[reefs]].  They occur at depths of from {{convert|50|to|200|m|ft}}.  This species can reach a length of {{convert|30|cm|in}} [[fish measurement|TL]].  It is a [[commercial fisheries|commercially]] important species, being easy to dry without having to be salted.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase |genus= Mene|species= maculata| month = December | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meropeidae''' is a family of tiny scorpionflies within the order [[Mecoptera]] with only three living species, commonly referred to as "'''earwigflies'''" (or sometimes "'''forcepflies'''").  These include the [[North America]]n ''[[Merope tuber]]'', the [[Western Australia]]n ''[[Austromerope poultoni]]'', and the newly discovered [[South America]]n ''[[Austromerope brasiliensis|A. brasiliensis]]''.&lt;ref name="Machado2013"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Machado |first1=R.

There are two extinct genera, ''[[Boreomerope|Boreomerope antiqua]]'' Novokschonov from the [[Middle Jurassic]] of [[Siberia]] and ''[[Thaumatomerope]]'' with four described species all from the Madygen Formation in [[Kyrgyzstan]]; as such, the extant members of this family can be considered [[living fossil]]s. These insects are also of interest due to their presumed basal position in the order Mecoptera.  ''Thaumatomerope'' is sometimes excluded from Meropeidae, and instead, is placed within [[Eomeropidae]], or its own monotypic family, "Thaumatomeropidae."* &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

The family name was spelt "Meropidae" in old literature but this clashes with the homonymous family name in birds for [[bee-eaters]]. The spelling of Meropeidae was adopted for the insect family by the ICZN in Opinion 140 of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletinofzoolog36inte#page/154/mode/2up/| title=Meropidae (Aves): Proposed amendment of entry in official list of family-group names in Zoology.

[[Midwifery]] is a women's profession that assists women from [[pregnancy]] to newborn care. Midwifery also has the [[religion|religious role]]. Midwives are believed in [[Maya society]] to be assigned their profession from [[God]] through [[Astrological sign|signs]] and [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]].

In ancient myths Maya [[goddess]] of midwifery is called [[Ixchel]].

==Maya midwives==
[[Childbirth]] is the final rite of passage amongst the Maya that completes a [[girl]]ʻs transition to [[Adult|womanhood]]. 

Many of the women who give birth in [[rural area]]s are treated by midwives who do not have any formal training but who are believed in the [[Maya religion]] to have received training in [[dream]]s. The traditional birth attendants are known as ''comadronas'' or ''iyom kʻexelom'', and receive prestige for their practice.

Midwives in Maya societies are responsible for the ''ajtuj'' ("pregnant [[woman]]") and [[Fetus|her unborn child]] throughout the pregnancy as well as the week of bed rest following the birth. Unlike other societies in which individuals choose their occupational fields, the [[Maya civilization|Maya people]] believe that they receive a sacred calling from [[God the Father|God]] through dreams which allows them to practice their [[destiny|destined occupation]]. The calling is divine and the midwife can communicate with the supernatural world.&lt;ref name="Paul_707"&gt;{{harvp|Paul|Paul|1975|p=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though midwives are held at high prestige for their sacred position in society, these women are often also subject to resentments from their [[family|husbands and children]] as they must spend a great deal of time away from them in order to act as midwives. Midwives must abstain from [[Intimate relationship|sex]], which sometimes creates difficulties with their [[husband]]s. 

==Sacred calling==
[[File:Veljusa Monastery St. Ana.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Saint Anne]] is considered to be a patron of midwives.]]
In Maya society, it is believed that midwives receive their calling from God in a series of dreams. These visions are believed to often include subtle hints that a woman is destined to become a midwife and can include visions of [[Saint Anne]] who is the saint of all midwives.&lt;ref name="Walsh_151"&gt;{{harvp|Walsh|2006|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mayan [[religion]], in addition to receiving dreams and visions, women also tend to find small items in paths that are symbols and objects related to midwifery. The objects are often small unusual stones that resemble the shape of a [[face]], shells, [[marble]]s or broken fragments of archaeological figurines.&lt;ref name="Tedlock_456"&gt;{{harvp|Tedlock|1992|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stones are often given sacred powers in the [[Maya religion]] and are believed to be sent from the [[Spirituality|spiritual world]] as a sign of one’s calling to midwifery.&lt;ref name="Walsh_151"/&gt; It is also believed that some objects left in a midwife’s path may also be the tools they need to perform parts of the [[birth]]ing, i.e. a [[penknife]] that is used to cut the [[umbilical cord]]. Women often consult shamans who explain their calling to them, and after the women accept that they are to become midwives, they are believed to receive another series of dreams and visions regarding the birthing practices they must follow. In addition to these special objects, and the repetitious dreams, it is believed that they may also be summoned to [[mountain]]s or other [[Shrine|sacred places]] where they may encounter supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Tedlock_456"/&gt; Mayans believe that women who ignore their calling often fall [[Illness|ill]], and if doctors are unable to determine a [[diagnosis]] for their ailments, they may even face death. They also believe that they are told in their dreams by supernatural beings that they will receive gifts from the families of the children they deliver and that they must not be greedy because many will give what they have it must be accepted with a goodness of heart.&lt;ref name="Tedlock_457"&gt;{{harvp|Tedlock|1992|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Maya civilization}}

==Responsibilities==
Midwives are responsible for the pregnant women during their pregnancies without any formal training or learning except for what they believe they receive from their dreams. These dreams are believed to contain visions from the [[spirit]]s on how to properly examine women, [[massage]] a woman, feel for the position of the fetus, measure dilation, cut the umbilical cord, how to pray and how to foretell a child's future by the markings on its umbilical cord.&lt;ref name="Tedlock_457"/&gt;
Midwives believe that in these visions they also learn to identify problems that can pose a threat for a healthy delivery and transport those women to nearby clinics and hospitals. Midwives are summoned around the third to fifth month of pregnancy and visit at monthly intervals for prenatal care, until the final month of pregnancy when they begin visiting on a weekly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Paul|Paul|1975|p=713}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prenatal care provided by midwives includes periodic massages, examinations, attending the delivery and tending to both new mother and child following the birth in the week of bed rest.&lt;ref name="Paul_707"/&gt;

==Signs at birth==
There are many things that the Mayans believe can be interpreted when a child is born. The [[Maya calendar]] for [[divination]], or the "Sacred [[calendar]]", is believed to foretell a childʻs [[future]], as some days are more auspicious than others.&lt;ref name="Paul_708"&gt;{{harvp|Paul|Paul|1975|p=708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar is important in Maya society for interpreting and shaping childrenʻs futures. However, Mayans also believe that midwives are able to foretell the life of a child based on the interpretations they can make from the markings on the umbilical cord and the [[amniotic sac]]. They believe that based on the markings from the first born, the [[sex]], number and interval of future births can also be foretold.&lt;ref name="Paul_708"/&gt; The most important markings are that of a [[Shamanism|future shaman]] ([[worm]]s or flies clutched in the fist of a newborn), midwife (white mantle over the head, which comes from the amniotic membrane) and a baby that will endanger the survival of future [[sibling]]s (born with a [[Whorl (biology)|double whorl]] in its crown).&lt;ref name="Paul_708"/&gt;

==Rituals==
The midwife is the first to see the [[infant]] and before a mother can bond with her baby, the midwife is expected to carefully interpret the signs that the child bears, and she alone will interpret what profession the child is destined for.&lt;ref name="Paul_708"/&gt; She must then carefully remove, dry and preserve the signs which will be protected by the [[Grandparent|maternal grandmother]]. Praying is considered key in the delivery of a child, and as soon as the midwife is informed of a birth she begins praying. She is also expected to pray before entering the house and before touching the pregnant woman. She must also pray to each of the four corners of the room which is said to house invisible guardians. One ritual must be performed when subsequent children die, since it is believed that the first-born child (often born with a double whorl on the umbilical cord) chases and eats the spirit of the newborn. In an effort to save the newborn's life, the midwife wraps a live [[chicken]] in a cloth and tours the room with the eldest child praying to each of the four corners. The chicken is then beaten to death on the back of the eldest child (behind closed doors and away from the newborn). She then makes a [[soup]] with the chicken and the eldest child is forced to eat it in its entirety, even if it takes several meals to do so. At the end of the bed rest week the midwife must perform her final cleansing rituals, thus signaling the end of her services. The baby is bathed and new dress is placed on the naval, and the hammock which the baby is to sleep is prayed over. She asks that the baby be protected. The mother also receives purification in a semi-public [[hair washing]] ceremony. The final [[ritual]] that must be performed is the sweeping and cleaning of the room before she leaves. She then prays one last time, thanking the spirits for a successful delivery.

'''''My Horse &amp; Me''''' is a [[show jumping]] video game{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} published by [[Atari]] for the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It is the first game released by Atari under their exclusive partnership with the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Horse and Me|url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/sports/myhorseandme/index.html?tag=tabs;summary|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Development ===
Dane Cypel, the assistant producer, explained that the team was running out of ideas, and taht horses seemed to be the most interesting project that they could create within the family friendly animal themed genre they were aiming to target. The team liked how horses were both graceful and powerful. In doing research on horses and discovering their different personalities, Cypel deemed it an "educational" experience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/1742/My-Horse-and-Me-Interview|title=My Horse and Me Interview - Gaming Nexus|work=Gaming Nexus|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cypel acknowledges that while the game was targeted towards girls, he felt that girls like boys would switch off if there wasn't good gameplay underneath the title, and so put a lot of effort into making he title appealing to young female players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Release ===
The Wii and Microsoft Windows versions were developed by [[W!Games]]. The Wii version was released in the United States on  February 5, 2008 and in Europe on November 23, 2007.

'''Nathaniel Godolphin Burslem''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]] (2 February 1837 – 14 July 1865), born in [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]]; was by birth both [[Ireland|Irish]] and by descent [[English people|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

Burslem was born 2 February 1836 in [[County Limerick, Ireland]], the son of George James Burslem of the [[94th Regiment of Foot]] and Susan (née Vokes), of Limerick (married [[Dublin]] 15 March 1836). His father was English, and traced his family back to the town of [[Burslem]] in Staffordshire. His grandfather was Colonel Nathaniel Godolphin Burslem who was awarded the Gold Medal - the forerunner of the VC Medal. {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On 21 August 1860 at the [[Taku Forts]], [[China]], during the [[Second Opium War|Second China War]] Lieutenant Burslem, then aged 24 and serving in the [[67th Regiment of Foot]], [[British Army]], and Private [[Thomas Lane (VC)|Thomas Lane]] of his regiment displayed great gallantry for which they were both awarded the VC. They swam the ditches of the North Taku Fort and attempted, during the assault and before an entrance had been effected by anyone, to enlarge an opening in the wall, through which they eventually entered. In doing so, they were both severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22538|page=3363|date=13 August 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His Victoria Cross is displayed at [[The Royal Hampshire Regiment|The Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum &amp; Memorial Garden, Winchester, England]]. He later achieved the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] before selling his commission and sailing, along with his brother John Godolphin Burslem, to [[New Zealand]]. He arrived in 1865 and bought land in the [[North Island]] and was planning to grow flax, but he and an acquaintance capsized their canoe on the [[Waihou River|Thames River]], both drowning on 14 July 1865. His body was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kauaeranga |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DSC18650726.2.15 |accessdate=24 January 2016 |work=[[Daily Southern Cross]] |volume=XXI |issue=2501 |date=26 July 1865 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gustave Moreau 003.jpg|thumb|''[[Heracles]] and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]'' by [[Gustave Moreau]]: The Hydra is perhaps the best known mythological multi-headed animal, also popularised in many [[fantasy]] settings.]]

'''Polycephaly''' is the condition of having more than one [[head]]. The term is derived from the Greek [[word stem|stems]] ''poly'' (Greek: "πολύ") meaning "many" and ''kephalē'' (Greek: "κεφάλη") meaning "head". A polycephalic organism may be thought of as one being with a [[supernumerary body part]], or as two or more beings with a shared body.

Two-headed animals (called bicephalic or dicephalic) and three-headed (tricephalic) animals are the only type of multi-headed creatures seen in the real world, and form by the same process as [[conjoined twins]] from [[monozygotic]] twin embryos.

In humans, there are two forms of twinning that can lead to two heads being supported by a single torso. In [[dicephalus parapagus dipus]], the two heads are side by side. In [[craniopagus parasiticus]], the two heads are joined directly to each other, but only one head has a functional torso. Survival to adulthood is rare, but does occur in some forms of dicephalus parapagus dipus.

There are many occurrences of multi-headed animals in  [[mythology]]. In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], the [[double-headed eagle]] is a common symbol, though no such animal is known to have ever existed.

==Occurrences==
[[File:Tocci-Zwillinge_1881-2-MJ.jpg|thumb|The Tocci brothers as young boys in 1881.]]

Two-headed people and animals, though rare, have long been known to exist and documented.

===Occurrence in humans===
[[File:Two-headed girl.jpg|thumb|Two-headed girl]]
In humans, as in other animals, partial twinning can result in formation of two heads supported by a single torso. Two ways this can happen are dicephalus parapagus, where there are two heads side by side, and [[craniopagus parasiticus]], where the heads are joined directly.

====Dicephalus parapagus dipus====
In dicephalus parapagus dipus, the two heads are side by side, on a torso with two legs, with varying levels of twinning of organs and structures within the torso. The shared body may have four arms altogether, or three arms, or two arms only. There are Greek-based medical terms for the variations, e.g. dibrachius means two-armed, tribrachius means three-armed. Both heads may contain a fully formed brain, or one may be [[anencephalic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci]] (born between 1875 and 1877), were dicephalus parapagus dipus twins who survived to adulthood. Each had his own pair of arms. They learned to speak several languages, but never learned to walk. [[Abigail and Brittany Hensel]], born in 1990, are another instance of dicephalus parapagus dipus twins who grew up. They were born with two functional arms, plus a vestigial third arm, which was surgically removed. Each twin has her own complete head, heart and spine, and controls one arm and one leg. They developed good [[motor skill]]s, and completed courses at school and university.&lt;ref name="hensel" /&gt;

====Craniopagus parasiticus====
[[File:TwoHeadedBoyofBengal.jpeg|thumb|left|Drawing of the eighteenth century Boy of Bengal,  affected by craniopagus parasiticus.]]
[[Craniopagus parasiticus]] is an extremely rare condition in which the two heads are joined directly together, and one twin (known as the autosite) has a functioning torso, while the other (known as the parasite) has only a vestigial torso. The parasite is supported by blood supplied from the autosite head. This threatens the life of the autosite by placing an additional burden on the autosite's vital organs. Operations to separate the two heads have been performed in the hope of saving the autosite.

===Occurrence in animals===

Polycephalic animals often make local news headlines when found. The most commonly observed two-headed animals are [[turtle]]s and [[snake]]s.&lt;ref name="pravda"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/11400_anomaly.html |title=Two-Headed Creatures |publisher=Pravda.ru |first=Svetlana |last=Anina |date=November 29, 2003 |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125233002/http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/11400_anomaly.html |archive-date=January 25, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species with known two-headed occurrences include cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and [[fish]]. In 1894, a two-headed [[partridge]] was reported in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/279028602.html?dids=279028602:279028602&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=MAY+06%2C+1894&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=A+TWO-HEADED+PARTRIDGE. |title=A two-headed partridge |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 6, 1894 |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was notable as a dicephalic animal for surviving into adulthood with two perfect heads. Scientists have published in modern journals about dissecting such animals since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="pravda" /&gt; A 1929 paper studied the anatomy of a two-headed kitten.&lt;ref name="pravda" /&gt;

Polycephalic animals, due to their rarity, are a subject of novelty. "We", a two-headed albino rat snake born in captivity in 2000 with both female and male genitalia, was scheduled to be auctioned on [[eBay]] with an expected price tag of $150,000 (£87,000), though their policy of not trading in live animals prevented the sale.&lt;ref name="bbcsnake1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4577258.stm |title=Two-headed snake 'up for auction' |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=March 10, 2006 |date=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wemsnbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19334041 |title='We' the 2-headed snake's long odd life ends |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2006, the World Aquarium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldaquarium.org |title=World Aquarium |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that "We" was adopted by Nutra Pharma Corporation, a biotechnology company developing treatments using modified cobra venom and cobratoxin.&lt;ref name="nutrapharma-we1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nutrapharma.com/display.php?newsid=91 |title=Nutra Pharma Adopts Famous 2-Headed Snake of St. Louis' World Aquarium |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119130815/http://www.nutrapharma.com/display.php?newsid=91 |archivedate=November 19, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "We" died of [[natural causes]] at age eight in June 2007, not long after being acquired by Nutra Pharma.&lt;ref name="wemsnbc"/&gt;

Two-headed farm animals sometimes travel with [[freak show|animal side shows]] to county fairs. Most notably, The Venice Beach Freakshow supposedly houses the largest collection of two-headed specimens in the world, including over 20 two-headed animals that are alive. Many museums of natural history contain preserved two-headed animals. The Museum of Lausanne&lt;ref name="lausanne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-sst.unil.ch/Musee/default_e.htm |title=Le Musée cantonal de Géologie (The Museum of Lausanne) |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108110210/http://www-sst.unil.ch/Musee/default_e.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, and the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]] museum in [[Gatlinburg]], [[Tennessee]], have collections of preserved two-headed animals. A very well preserved 2-headed lamb is on display in [[Llanidloes]] museum in Wales. A live two-headed turtle named Janus can be seen at the Natural History Museum in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref name="janus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euphoria-magazine.com/nature/37-nature/129-turtle-janus |title=Janus, live two-headed turtle |work=Euphoia Magazine |accessdate=May 13, 2011 |date=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="janus-NHMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/plan_galeries.php |title=Plan des galeries publiques |language=French|trans-title=Plan of the public galleries |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatomy and fitness====

In cases where multiple heads are fully developed and non-parasitic, they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains "arguing" with each other; some animals simply [[zig-zag]] without getting anywhere.&lt;ref name="annexedturtle" /&gt; Snake heads may attack and even attempt to swallow each other. Thus, polycephalic animals survive poorly in the wild compared to normal monocephalic animals.

Most two-headed snakes only live for a few months, though some have been reported to live a full life and even reproduced, with the offspring born normal. A two-headed black [[rat snake]] with separate throats and stomachs survived for 20 years. A two-headed albino rat snake named "We" survived in captivity for 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19334041/ |title='We' the 2-headed snake's long life ends}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some speculation that the [[inbreeding]] of snakes in captivity increases the chances of a two-headed birth.&lt;ref name="mayell2002"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/03/0318_0319_twoheadsnake.html |title=Life Is Confusing For Two-Headed Snakes |first=Hillary |last=Mayell |publisher=National Geographic News |date=March 22, 2002 |accessdate=March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One or two beings?===

It is difficult to draw the line between what is considered "one animal with two heads" or "two animals that share a body".

[[Abigail and Brittany Hensel]] were given two distinct names at birth. They identify as two people, and are recognised as two people legally and socially.&lt;ref name="time-hensel1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,984307,00.html |title=The most intimate bond: Conjoined for life, the Hensel twins are a medical mystery and a lesson in cooperation for us all |first=Claudia |last=Wallis |work=Time magazine |date=March 25, 1996 |accessdate=December 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930062929/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,984307,00.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Syafitri]], born 2006 in [[Indonesia]], were given one name by their parents because they only had one heart.&lt;ref name="jakarta-syafitri" /&gt; In early Germany, conjoined twins that could not be separated were legally considered a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bondeson |first=Jan |year=2004 |title=The Two-headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0801489587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some questions that can arise when considering the legal, moral, and ethical implications of polycephaly in humans are: If one twin commits a crime, should the innocent half be sent to prison along with the guilty half? What if the twins possess different tastes? Is it a crime if one objects to romantic advances? If one twin commits suicide, how can it be determined to not be murder? What if one twin is asleep and the other is awake? Is it academic dishonesty if one tells the other answers to a test? 
With other animals, polycephaly is usually described as "one animal with two heads".&lt;ref name="bbcsnake1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeotortoise1" /&gt; One of the heads, especially in three-headed animals, may be poorly developed and malformed, and not "participate" much.&lt;ref name="annexedturtle" /&gt;

===Two faces on one head===

Where twinning of the head itself is only partial, it can result in the condition known as [[diprosopus]] — one head with two faces.

==Earliest known occurrence==

The February 22, 2007, issue of the journal [[Biology Letters]] detailed the discovery of a 122 million-year-old fossil of a two-headed ''[[Hyphalosaurus lingyuanensis]]'', marking the earliest known occurrence of axial bifurcation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.livescience.com/1234-ancient-reptile-heads.html |title=Ancient Reptile Has Two Heads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Monstre-img 0569.jpg|thumb|Two-faced kitten, Lausanne]]

There have been numerous reports of two-faced cats; most die soon after birth. Reports of two-headed kittens are common, relative to other animals, because of their status as household pets.
Recent two-headed kittens include:

[[Image:Monstre-img 0573.jpg|thumb|Two-headed calf, Lausanne]]
A full body taxidermy of a two-headed calf is on display at the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah. "The Dancing Calves" were born by natural delivery with considerable assistance from S. T. Nelson of Cedar City, Utah on Mother's Day, May 8, 1949, to a crossbred cow owned by Willard Lund of [[Paragonah, Utah]]. The "Father Bull" is unknown but must have been an outstanding Hereford. The double calf was alive and healthy but died during birth. This calf, or calves, joined together from the beginning of the neck as far as the belly, with two complete, almost perfect body frames, had but one system of vital organs. Each of the two normal heads had a food channel to one stomach and a breathing channel, or windpipe, to the one set of lungs. The two briskets, or breasts, shared on each side by these calves, contained the one set of lungs on one side and the one heart on the other side. Branching off from the one stomach and digestive system were two channels of elimination. This calf weighed approximately 85 pounds at birth. The over-all measurements as it stands mounted are: 42.5 inches high, 20 inches from tail to tail, and 18 inches from side to side including the front legs. The "Mother Cow" lived and was sold as a "fat cow" in July 1949. This calf was stuffed by Mr. C. J. Sanders, taxidermist, 2631 South State Street, Salt Lake City 5, Utah, who stated that it is the most unusual monstrosity he has ever worked with. Dr. A. C. Johnson, of Cedar City, Utah, stated that this is the best specimen of monstrosity in animal life that he has ever seen or heard of in his 47 years of practice as a veterinarian. "The Dancing Calves" were owned by West and Gail Seegmiller who displayed them for many years at their Desert Pearl Cafe (no longer in existence), in Cedar City, Utah. Dr. A. C. Johnson, Dr. T. Donald Bell, William H. Lund, Dr. R. G. Williams, Dr. J. S. Prestwich, Dr. A. L. Graff, S. T. Nelson, and James Hoyle, Jr. all signed as witnesses that they saw the calf in the flesh soon after birth and knew it to be authentic. The calves and original document were donated to the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah, where they are now on display.

* [[Humbaba]], the guardian of the Cedar Forest, where the gods lived. A description from Georg Burckhardt translation of Gilgamesh says, "he had the paws of a lion and a body covered in thorny scales; his feet had the claws of a vulture, and on his head were the horns of a wild bull; his tail and phallus each ended in a snake's head."

===Greek mythology===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
[[Greek mythology]] contains a number of multi-headed creatures. [[Typhon]], a vast grisly monster with many snake heads, is often described as having several offspring with [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], a creature with the lower body of a serpent but the upper body of a beautiful woman. Their offspring, by one source or another, account for many of the major monsters of Greek mythos, including:
* [[Cerberus]]&amp;nbsp;– a monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gate to [[Hades]].
* [[Dragons in Greek mythology|Ladon]]&amp;nbsp;– a sometimes hundred-headed serpent-like [[dragon]] that guards the garden of the [[Hesperides]] and is overcome by [[Heracles]].
* [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]&amp;nbsp;– sometimes depicted with the heads of a [[goat]] and a lion.
* The [[Lernaean Hydra]]&amp;nbsp;– an ancient nameless serpent-like [[chthonic]] water beast that possessed numerous heads.
* [[Orthrus]]&amp;nbsp;– a two-headed dog owned by [[Geryon]].
* [[Scylla]]&amp;nbsp;– sometimes described as a six-headed sea monster.

Other multi-headed creatures in Greek mythology include:
* The [[Hecatonchires]]&amp;nbsp;– giants with fifty heads and one hundred arms. The word "Hecatonchire" means "hundred arms". They were the sons of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]].
* [[Hecate]]&amp;nbsp;– Greek goddess of witches, nightmares, crossroads, and one of the Moon deities; sometimes represented with three heads.

===Iranian mythology===
[[Zahhak]], an evil figure in [[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]] - also evident in ancient Iranian [[folklore]] as '''Aži Dahāka''' (Azh dahak) - is the most significant and long-lasting of the ''aži''s of the [[Avesta]], the earliest religious texts of [[Zoroastrianism]]. He is described as a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads (presumably meaning three heads with one mouth and two eyes each), cunning, strong and demonic.  But in other respects Aži Dahāka has human qualities, and is never a mere animal.

===Hinduism===

[[File:Sheshashayi Vishnu.jpg|thumb|[[Vishnu]] reclines on the multi-hooded serpent [[Shesha]], while the four-headed [[Brahma]] sits on a lotus, rising from Vishnu's navel.]]

* The goddess [[Gayatri]]: five
* The war-god [[Kartikeya]]: six
Though usually depicted with one head, some deities like [[Ganesha]] (in [[Heramba]] form) and [[Shiva]] (Sadashiva) have aspects where they are depicted with multiple heads; five in this case. The [[Vishvarupa]] form of [[Vishnu]] is described as having infinite heads.

Besides deities, demons ([[asura]] and [[rakshasa]]) may be depicted with multiple heads. The demon-king [[Ravana]] is depicted with ten heads; while his son [[Trishira]] with three heads.

Animal races in Hindu mythology like [[Nāga]]s (serpents) may have multiple heads. The Naga [[Shesha]] is depicted with five or seven hoods, but said to have infinite hoods. [[Uchchaihshravas]] is a celestial seven-headed horse. The divine white elephant [[Airavata]] is depicted with multiple heads, trunks and tusks.

'''Robot ethics''', sometimes known by the short expression "'''roboethics'''", concerns ethical problems that occur with robots, such as whether robots pose a threat to humans in the long or short run, whether some ''uses'' of robots are problematic (such as in healthcare or as '[[Lethal autonomous weapon|killer robots]]' in war), and how robots should be designed such as they act 'ethically' (this last concern is also called [[machine ethics]]). Robot ethics is a sub-field of ethics of technology, specifically information technology, and it has close links to legal as well as socio-economic concerns.  Researchers from diverse areas are beginning to tackle ethical questions about creating robotic technology and implementing it in societies, in a way that will still ensure the safety of the human race. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/robot-ethics|title=Robot Ethics|last=|first=|date=|website=IEEE Robotics and Automation Society|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the issues are as old as the word ''robot'', serious academic discussions started around the year 2000. Robot ethics requires the combined commitment of experts of several disciplines, who have to adjust laws and regulations to the problems resulting from the scientific and technological achievements in Robotics and AI. The main fields involved in robot ethics are: [[robotics]], [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]]s, [[law]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[industrial design]].

==History and events==
{{See also|History of robots}}
{{Robotic laws}}
Since antiquity, the discussion of ethics in relation to the treatment of non-human and even non-living things and their potential "spirituality" have been discussed. With the development of machinery and eventually robots, this philosophy was also applied to robotics. The first publication directly addressing and setting the foundation for robot ethics was [[Runaround (story)]], a science fiction short story written by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1942 which featured his well known [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. These three laws were continuously altered by Asimov, and a fourth, or zeroth law, was eventually added to precede the first three.  in the context of his [[science fiction]] works. The short term "roboethics" was probably coined by Gianmarco Veruggio.&lt;ref name=Tzafestas-2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tzafestas |first1=Spyros G. |title=Roboethics A Navigating Overview |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |location=Cham |isbn=978-3-319-21713-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important event that propelled the concern of roboethics was the First International Symposium on Roboethics in 2004 by the collaborative effort of Scuola di Robotica, the Arts Lab of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, and the Theological Institute of Pontificia Accademia della Santa Croce, Rome. "After two days of intense debating, anthropologist Daniela Cerqui identified three main ethical positions emerging from two days of intense debate:
#Those who are not interested in ethics. They consider that their actions are strictly technical, and do not think they have a social or a moral responsibility in their work.
#Those who are interested in short-term ethical questions. According to this profile, questions are expressed in terms of “good” or “bad,” and refer to some cultural values. For instance, they feel that robots have to adhere to social conventions. This will include “respecting” and helping humans in diverse areas such as implementing laws or in helping elderly people. (Such considerations are important, but we have to remember that the values used to define the “bad” and the “good” are relative. They are the contemporary values of the industrialized countries).
#Those who think in terms of long-term ethical questions, about, for example, the “Digital divide” between South and North, or young and elderly. They are aware of the gap between industrialized and poor countries, and wonder whether the former should not change their way of developing robotics in order to be more useful to the South. They do not formulate explicitly the question what for, but we can consider that it is implicit".&lt;ref&gt; http://www.roboethics.org/icra2005/veruggio.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
Roboethics as a science or philosophical topic has not made any strong cultural impact,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} but is a common theme in science fiction literature and films. One of the most popular films depicting the potential misuse of robotic and AI technology is ''[[The Matrix]]'', depicting a future where the lack of roboethics brought about the destruction of the human race. An animated film based on ''The Matrix'', the ''[[Animatrix]]'', focused heavily on the potential ethical issues between humans and robots. Many of the Animatrix's animated shorts are also named after Isaac Asimov's fictional stories. 

Although not a part of roboethics ''per se'', the ethical behavior of robots themselves has also been a joining issue in roboethics in popular culture. The ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'' series focuses on robots run by an uncontrolled AI program with no restraint on the termination of its enemies. This series too has the same futuristic plot as ''The Matrix'' series, where robots have taken control. The most famous case of robots or computers without programmed ethics is [[HAL 9000]] in the ''[[Space Odyssey]]'' series, where HAL (a computer with advance AI capabilities who monitors and assists humans on a space station) kills all the humans on board to ensure the success of the assigned mission after his own life is threatened.

'''''Saved by the Light''''' is a 1995 American biographical television film directed by [[Lewis Teague]] and written by John Mandel.  It stars [[Eric Roberts]] as [[Dannion Brinkley]], a former bully who turns his life around after having a [[near-death experience]].  It is based on Brinkley's [[Saved by the Light|book of the same name]].  It aired on Fox on December 12.

== Plot ==
The movie begins in Aiken, South Carolina in 1975. Dannion Brinkley is a Vietnam veteran who works as a deliveryman in his parents store. A young man with a dark side, he is unfaithful to his loving wife Casey and bullies everyone else around him, even the residents of a retirement home. His mother expresses disgust with him after he beats up a poor man who shoplifted some items from their store. She tells him she thought she raised him with a heart and that his rage is like a terrible sickness. The angry young man's life takes a dramatic turn when he is struck by lightning while talking on the phone . Pronounced dead at the hospital, he miraculously revives and takes an amazing trip to the other side between life and death. A being of light tells him that love makes a difference and shows Dannion the effects that his rage has had on those he hurt from those he bullied on the playground to those he fought in Vietnam. The voice tells him to look at a future without hope and Dannion is shown a collage of images involving natural disasters, famine, poverty and war (footage from the Gulf War is incorporated). The voice tells him this bleak future need not be. The near death experience has a transformative effect on Dannion and he tries to make amends with his parents, wife and the others he has made suffer. He treats the man he had previously beaten up for shoplifting to dinner. Brinkley strikes up a friendship with "near death" expert Doctor Raymond Moody who tries to help him understand his experience. While helping a woman escape her abusive husband, Dannion injures his hand resulting in a catastrophic infection that damages his heart. The doctors tell him it is a matter of life and death but he has no fear of returning. Doctor Moody convinces him he is still needed on earth and Dannion agrees to the operation. He has another near death experience on the table and sees how he has loved and helped others in his new life. He has a beautiful vision of seeing his dead mother reunited in Heaven with her little sister. In the end Brinkley is shown speaking his message to others and admitting that he is a most unlikely messenger.

{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}
'''Simulated reality''' is the [[hypothesis]] that [[reality]] could be simulated—for example by [[quantum computer]]  [[computer simulation|simulation]]—to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation. This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of [[virtual reality]]. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from "true" reality. There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in [[computing]].

==Arguments==

===Simulation argument===

{{Main|Simulation hypothesis}}

A version of the simulation hypothesis was first theorised as a part of a philosophical argument on the part of [[René Descartes]], and later by [[Hans Moravec]].&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"&gt;Moravec, Hans, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html Simulation, Consciousness, Existence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans, Platt, Charles [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.10/moravec.html?pg=6&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Superhumanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1992/CyberPigs.html Pigs in Cyberspace]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] developed an expanded argument examining the probability of our reality being a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243-255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:

:1. Human civilization or a comparable civilization is unlikely to reach a level of [[transhumanism|technological maturity]] capable of producing simulated realities or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:2. A comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of "real" entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:3. Any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:4. We are living in a reality in which posthumans have not developed yet and we are actually living in reality.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to [[digital physics]]; that the [[qualia]] experienced by a [[simulated consciousness]] are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

[[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could ''pop up'' saying: "You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information." However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

===Computationalism===
{{Main|Computationalism|Mathematical universe hypothesis}}
[[Computationalism]] is a [[philosophy of mind]] theory stating that [[cognition]] is a form of [[computation]]. It is relevant to the [[Simulation hypothesis]] in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a "[[Simulated reality#Virtual people|virtual people]]" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no [[hard problem of consciousness|problem]] in generating [[artificial consciousness]] or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal [[qualia]] of consciousness is [[chinese room|disputed]]. It is possible that [[consciousness]] requires a [[vitalism|vital substrate]] that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be [[philosophical zombie]]s. This would undermine [[Nick Bostrom]]'s simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be [[brain in a vat|envatted brain]]s, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Some theorists&lt;ref&gt;[http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/ Bruno Marchal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html Russel Standish]&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that if the "consciousness-is-computation" version of [[computationalism]] and [[mathematical realism]] (or radical [[mathematical Platonism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hut |first1=P. |last2=Alford |first2=M. |last3=Tegmark |first3=M. |year=2006 |title=On Math, Matter and Mind |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=765–794 |arxiv=physics/0510188 |bibcode=2006FoPh...36..765H |doi=10.1007/s10701-006-9048-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; are true then consciousnesses is computation, which in principle is [[universal Turing machine|platform independent]] and thus admits of simulation. This argument states that a "Platonic realm" or [[ultimate ensemble]] would contain every algorithm, including those which implement consciousness. [[Hans Moravec]] has explored the simulation hypothesis and has argued for a kind of mathematical Platonism according to which every object (including, for example, a stone) can be regarded as implementing every possible computation.&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"/&gt;

===Dreaming===
{{Further|Dream argument}}

A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result, the "dream hypothesis" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that [[common sense]] and considerations of [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] rule against it.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no logical impossibility in the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we ourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action on us causes our sensations." [[Bertrand Russell]], ''The Problems of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between [[reality]] and [[dream]]s was [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], a [[China|Chinese]] philosopher from the 4th century BC.  He phrased the problem as the well-known "Butterfly Dream," which went as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be ''some'' distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by [[Descartes]], who was one of the first [[Western World|Western]] philosophers to do so. In ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', he states "... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep",&lt;ref name="Des"&gt;René Descartes, Meditations on the First Philosophy, from Descartes, The Philosophical Works of Descartes, trans. Elizabeth S. Haldane and G.R.T. Ross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911 – reprinted with corrections 1931), Volume I, 145-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to conclude that "It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false".&lt;ref name="Des"/&gt;

Chalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:
* that he is ''currently'' dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;
* that he has ''always'' been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, J., [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics], Department of Philosophy, University of Arizona&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[dream argument]] and the [[simulation hypothesis]] can be regarded as [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]]; however in raising these doubts, just as [[Descartes]] noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called [[psychosis]] though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested simulations===
The existence of simulated reality is unprovable in any concrete sense: any "evidence" that is directly observed could be another simulation itself. In other words, there is an [[infinite regress]] problem with the argument. Even if we are a simulated reality, there is no way to be sure the beings running the simulation are not themselves a simulation and the operators of ''that'' simulation are not a simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Simulation Argument: Some Explanations |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |year=2009 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/brueckner.pdf |quote=If each first-level ancestor-simulation run by the non-Sims requires more resources (because they contain within themselves additional second-level ancestor-simulations run by the Sims), the non-Sims might well respond by producing fewer first-level ancestor-simulations. Conversely, the cheaper it is for the non-Sims to run a simulation, the more simulations they may run. It is therefore unclear whether the total number of ancestor-simulations would be greater if Sims run ancestor-simulations than if they do not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"{{vanchor|Recursive simulation}} involves a simulation or an entity in the simulation, creating another instance of the same simulation, running it and using its results" (Pooch and Sullivan 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=U.W. |last=Pooch |first2=F.J. |last2=Sullivan |year=2000 |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/WSC.2000.899898 |journal=Simulation Conference |volume=1 |pages=958 |edition=Winter |title=Recursive simulation to aid models of decisionmaking |isbn=0-7803-6579-8 |doi=10.1109/WSC.2000.899898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy===

Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it. (This is not the kind of simulated reality that is the topic of this article, but we will get to such a simulated reality in the next step of the argument.) The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.) That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves. But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching. For this to be the case, the simulation needs to have an exceptionally high fidelity, bringing us into the territory of simulated reality.  (This situation also resembles the one in the [[dream argument]] discussed above.) In this case, could she not still reach the same conclusion that the facts about the physics (of the simulated reality, though she does not realize it is simulated) do not fully determine her experience by themselves? And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45743">'''Societal collapse''' is the fall of a complex human [[society]]. Such a disintegration may be relatively abrupt, as in the case of [[Classic Maya collapse|Maya civilization]], or gradual, as in the case of the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. 

The subject of societal collapse is of interest in such fields as [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and, more recently,  [[complex systems|complex-systems]] science.

== Causes of collapse ==
Common factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others.  In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse.  Significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures.  [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through deforestation, loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared "Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign invasions===
The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.

[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brutal pillaging that followed [[Mongol invasions]], the invaders decimated the populations of China, Russia, the Middle East, and [[Islam in Central Asia|Islamic Central Asia]]. Later Mongol leaders, such as [[Timur]], though he himself became a Muslim, destroyed many cities, slaughtered thousands of people and did irreparable damage to the ancient irrigation systems of [[Mesopotamia]]. These invasions transformed a settled society to a [[nomad]]ic one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html Ibn Battuta's Trip: Part Three - Persia and Iraq (1326 - 1327)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] of extraordinary virulence. [[Smallpox]] ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of...

Societal collapse of many indigenous cultures has occurred as a result of European [[imperialism]] in various parts of the globe, particularly in areas where European settler communities took possession of land once held by native peoples, in Latin America and North America, and in [[Australasia]].  The effects of this dispossession are still evident in many of the problems confronting indigenous cultures, including [[alcoholism]], high rates of [[incarceration]], [[suicide]] rates and fraternal violence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Sub-replacement fertility ===

The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]], writing in [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polybius,  Histories, book 37, Depopulation of Greece|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9|website = www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes occurring with collapse==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There are three main types of collapse:

'''Reversion/Simplification''': A society's [[adaptive capacity]] may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity, destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics.  In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology.  These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]].  Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].

'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure.  This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.

'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.
* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of job specialization. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.
* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.
* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.
* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]].  In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands.  In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]].  A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.

==Population dynamics==
In the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes.  Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.

Several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The coupled breakdown of economic, cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse]  TED talk, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] idea that "they find problems they can't solve".

===Linking social and environmental dynamics===
Modern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another—leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.

What produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.

As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.

For the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]].  It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.

[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===
[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:
* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy on Earth.
* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.
Taken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.

Georgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168–171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546–549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–145}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;

=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===
A related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon&lt;ref&gt;Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), "The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization" (Knopf, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles 2009 "What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]).  This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.

There would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves.  An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.

The EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for sustainable food production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget. In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture. Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.

===Models of societal response===
According to [[Joseph Tainter]]&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1990), ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press) pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

# The '''Dinosaur''', a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate and yet nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources' reduced availability:  In this type of society, rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action.  They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.
# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]):  This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely.  The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.
#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]).  Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.
# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse.  This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).
#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions:  They provide a "safety valve" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.

====Tainter's critique====
Tainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.

[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]

For example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above.  The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them.  Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production.  Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate ("House of Cards"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting.  Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional "Runaway Train" iteration).  Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.

Mainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors (see [[Easter Island History#Destruction of society and population]].) Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.

Tainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms.  In his own words (p.&amp;nbsp;194):

# human societies are problem-solving organizations;
# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

With these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.

===Toynbee’s theory of decay===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his "The Evolution of Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Toynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.

The fixation on the old methods of the "Creative Minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a "[[dominant minority]]" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their "former self", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.

He argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:

{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession.  Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration.  The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}

He argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat." The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a "schism in the body social", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.

He argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet).  He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.

Toynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].

The great irony expressed by these and others like them is that civilizations that seem ideally designed to creatively solve problems, find themselves doing so self-destructively. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Systems science===
Researchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem.  Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist.  However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience&lt;/ref&gt; using [[systems thinking]] for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change.

History includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation.  The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.

Although a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture.  [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens.  Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.

'''Statistical finance''',&lt;ref&gt;J-P Bouchaud, An introduction to Statistical Finance, Physica A 313 (2002) 238&amp;ndash;251&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of [[econophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Perou, E. Gopikrishnan, L A Amaral, M. Meyer, H. E. Stanley, Phys. Rev. E 60 6519 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[financial market]]s. Instead of the [[Normative economics|normative]] roots of much of the field of [[finance]], it uses a [[positivist]] framework including exemplars from [[statistical physics]] with an emphasis on emergent or collective properties of financial markets. The starting point for this approach to understanding financial markets are the empirically observed [[stylized fact]]s.

==Stylized facts ==

# Stock markets are characterised by bursts of price volatility.
# Price changes are less volatile in bull markets and more volatile in bear markets.
# Price change correlations are stronger with higher volatility, and their auto-correlations die out quickly.
# Almost all real data have more extreme events than suspected.
# Volatility correlations decay slowly.
# Trading volumes have memory the same way that volatilities do.
# Past price changes are negatively correlated with future volatilities.

== Research objectives ==

Statistical finance is focused on three areas:

# Empirical studies focused on the discovery of interesting statistical features of financial time-series data aimed at extending and consolidating the known [[stylized fact]]s.
# The use of these discoveries to build and implement models that better price derivatives and anticipate stock price movement with an emphasis on [[non-Gaussian]] methods and models.
# The study of collective and emergent behaviour in simulated and real markets to uncover the mechanisms responsible for the observed stylized facts with an emphasis on [[agent-based model]]s.

It is noteworthy that [[financial econometrics]] also has a focus on the first two of these three areas. However, there is almost no overlap or interaction between the community of statistical finance researchers (who typically publish in physics journals) and the community of financial econometrics researchers (who typically publish in economics journals).

== Behavioral finance and statistical finance ==

Behavioural finance attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the biased behaviour of individuals, mostly concerned with the agents themselves and to a lesser degree aggregation of agent behaviour. Statistical finance is concerned with emergent properties arising from systems with many interacting agents and as such attempts to explain price anomalies in terms of the collective behaviour. Emergent properties are largely independent of the uniqueness of individual agents because they are dependent on the nature of the interactions of the agents rather than the agents themselves. This approach has drawn strongly on ideas arising from [[complex systems]], [[phase transitions]],  [[Critical phenomena|criticality]], [[self-organized criticality]], non-extensivity (see [[Tsallis entropy]]), q-Gaussian models,  and agents based models (see [[agent based model]]); as these are known to be able to recover some of phenomenology of financial market data, the [[stylized fact]]s, in particular the [[long-range memory]] and scaling due to long-range interactions.

== Criticism ==

Within the subject the description of financial markets blindly in terms of models of statistical physics has been argued as flawed because it has transpired these do not fully correspond to what we now know about real finance markets. First, traders create largely noise, not long range correlations among themselves, except when they all buy or all sell, such as during a popular IPO or during a crash.  A market is not at an equilibrium critical point, the resulting non-equilibrium market must reflect details of traders' interactions (universality applies only to a limited very class of bifurcations, and the market does not sit at a bifurcation). Even if the notion of a thermodynamics equilibrium is considered not at the level of the agents but in terms of collections of instruments stable configurations are not observed. The market does not 'self-organize' into a stable statistical equilibrium, rather, markets are unstable. Although markets could be 'self-organizing' in the sense used by [[finite-time singularity]] models these models are difficult to falsify. Although Complex systems have never been defined in a broad sense financial markets do satisfy reasonable criterion of being considered complex adaptive systems.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Market Complexity, Johnson, Jefferies and Hui, Oxford 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Tallis doctrine has been put into question as it is apparently a special case of markov dynamics so questioning the very notion of a "non-linear Fokker-Plank equation". In addition, the standard 'stylized facts' of financial markets, fat tails, scaling, and universality are not observed in real FX markets even if they are observed in equity markets.

From outside the subject the approach has been considered by many as a dangerous view of finance which has drawn criticism from some [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] because of:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Thomas Lux]] and [[Paul Ormerod]], ''Worrying Trends in Econophysics'', [[Physica A]] '''370''', 1-6 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 
# "A lack of awareness of work which has been done within economics itself."
# "Resistance to more rigorous and robust statistical methodology."
# "The belief that universal empirical regularities can be found in many areas of economic activity."
# "The theoretical models which are being used to explain empirical phenomena."
In response to these criticism there are claims of a general maturing of these non-traditional empirical approaches to Finance.&lt;ref&gt;"Response to worrying trends in econophysics", McCauley, J. L. Physica A 2.371(2006): pp. 601&amp;ndash;609 http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/2129/1/MPRA_paper_2129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This defense of the subject does not flatter the use of physics metaphors but does defend the alternative empirical approach of "econophysics" itself.

Some of the key data claims have been questioned in terms of methods of data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin E. Bassler, Joseph L. McCauley, and Gemunu H. Gunaratne, Nonstationary increments, scaling distributions, and variable diffusion processes in financial markets, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 104, 17287-17290 (2007). http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0708664104&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the ideas arising from nonlinear sciences and statistical physics have been helpful in shifting our understanding financial markets, and may yet be found useful, but the particular requirements of stochastic analysis to the specific models useful in finance is apparently unique to finance as a subject. There is much lacking in this approach to finance yet it would appear that the canonical approach to finance based optimization of individual behaviour given information and preferences with assumptions to allow aggregation in equilibrium are even more problematic.

It has been suggested that what is required is a change in mindset within finance and economics that moves the field towards methods of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;J-P. Bouchaud, Economics needs a scientific revolution https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5306v1&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps finance needs to be thought of more as an observational science where markets are observed in the same way as the observable universe in cosmology, or the observable ecosystems in the environmental sciences. Here local principles can be uncovered by local experiments but meaningful global experiments are difficult to envision as feasible without reproducing the system being observed. The required science becomes that based largely on pluralism (see [[scientific pluralism]] the view that some phenomena observed in science require multiple explanations to account for their nature), as in most sciences that deal with complexity, rather than a singled unified mathematical framework that is to be verified by experiment.

'''Stepan Andriyovych Bandera''' ({{lang-uk|Степан Андрійович Бандера}}, {{lang-pl|Stepan Andrijowycz Bandera}}; 1 January 1909 – 15 October 1959) was a head of a militant wing of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian independence movement]]&lt;ref name="marples"&gt;David R.

As the head of terrorist activities in the recent past, he was considered the natural choice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

"Bandera was, according to his handlers, “a professional underground worker with a terrorist background and ruthless notions about the rules of the game.... A bandit type if you like, with a burning patriotism, which provides an ethical background and a justification for his banditry. No better and no worse than others of his kind....”"&lt;/ref&gt; and a leader of the terrorist activity of Ukrainian nationalists.&lt;ref name="marples"/&gt;

Born in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]], into the family of a [[Greek-Catholic]] priest, he became nationalistic from an early age. After the [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]] Galicia became a short-lived [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], but [[Polish–Ukrainian War|was quickly annexed by Poland]] and was [[Polonization#West Ukraine|subjected to an extensive campaigns of Polonization]] and [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia|Pacification]]. He became radicalised during this time, and after Polish authorities refused his request to leave for Czechoslovakia for studying, he enrolled in [[Lviv Polytechnic]] where he organized several nationalistic organizations. He was imprisoned in 1934 and was sentenced to death, but his sentence was quickly commuted to life imprisonment. He escaped prison in 1939 when the [[Second Polish Republic]] collapsed after [[Invasion of Poland|the joint Nazi-Soviet invasion]] and moved to the [[General Government|German-occupied zone]].

When [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] he allied himself with them, but after he [[Declaration of Ukrainian State Act|attempted to proclaim an independent Ukrainian state]], the [[Gestapo]] put him under [[house arrest]] on 5 of July 1941&lt;ref&gt;''Киричук Юрій.''

==Early life==
Bandera was born in Uhryniv Staryi, Galicia, Austria-Hungary. He attended the Fourth Form Grammar School in [[Stryi]].&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from high school in 1927, he planned to attend the Ukrainian College of Technology and Economics in [[Podebrady]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], but the Polish authorities did not grant him travel papers.&lt;ref&gt;Ukrainian College of Technology and Economics in Podebrady&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Bandera enrolled in the agronomy program at the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] (then Politechnika Lwowska).&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/B/A/BanderaStepan.htm |title=Bandera, Stepan |website=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the few programs open to Ukrainians at the time.&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"/&gt; This was due to restrictions placed on minority enrollment—aimed primarily at Jews and Ukrainians—in both secondary schools (''gymnasia'') and university level institutions by the Polish government.&lt;ref name="The Lemberg Mosaic"&gt;{{citation |title=The Lemberg Mosaic (by Jakob Weiss) |publisher=Alderbrook Press New York}} | date=2011-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-WWII activity==

===Early activities===
Stepan Bandera had met and associated himself with members of a variety of Ukrainian nationalist organizations throughout his schooling—from [[Plast]], to the [[Union for the Liberation of Ukraine]] ({{lang-ua|Українська Визвольна Організація}}) and also the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) ({{lang-ua|Організація Українських Націоналістів}}). The most active of these organizations was the OUN, and the leader of the OUN was [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]].&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"/&gt;

Because of his determined personality, Stepan Bandera quickly rose through the ranks of these organizations, becoming the chief propaganda officer of the OUN in 1931, the second in command of OUN in Galicia in 1932–33, and the head of the National Executive or the OUN in 1933.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt;

For Bandera, an inclusive policy of nation building was important and therefore, he focused on growing support amongst all classes of Ukrainians in Western parts of Ukraine. In the early 1930s, Bandera was very active in finding and developing groups of Ukrainian nationalists in both Western and Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name="exlibris.org.ua"/&gt;

===OUN===
Stepan Bandera became head of the OUN national executive in Galicia in June 1933. He expanded the OUN's network in the [[Kresy]], directing it against both Poland and the Soviet Union. To stop expropriations, Bandera turned OUN against the Polish officials who were directly responsible for [[Polonization|anti-Ukrainian policies]]. Activities included mass campaigns against Polish tobacco and alcohol monopolies and against the denationalization of Ukrainian youth. He was arrested in Lviv in 1934, and tried twice: first, concerning involvement in a plot to assassinate the minister of internal affairs, [[Bronisław Pieracki]], and second at a general trial of OUN executives. He was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt;

The death sentence was commuted to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/&gt; He was held in [[Wronki Prison]]; in 1938 some of his followers tried unsuccessfully to break him out of the jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Janusz Marciszewski, [http://wielkopolska.naszemiasto.pl/turystyka/specjalna_artykul/15004.html Uwolnić Banderę] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703045814/http://wielkopolska.naszemiasto.pl/turystyka/specjalna_artykul/15004.html |date=3 July 2009 }}, NaszeMiasto.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various sources, Bandera was freed in September 1939, either by Ukrainian jailers after Polish jail administration left the jail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kray.ridne.net/bandera|title="Мої життєписні дані" (автобіографія Степана Бандери) - Наші Герої - архів матеріалів і фотографій ОУН-УПА|website=Kray.ridne.net|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Poles&lt;ref&gt;T. Snyder, Causes of Ukrainian Polish ethnic cleansing, Past&amp;Present, nr 179, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; or by the Nazis soon after the German invasion of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;The Lemberg Mosaic, Jakob Weiss, Alderbrook Press NY (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Reid, Borderland: a journey through the history of Ukraine, Phoenix, 2002, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Karnautska, Portret bez retushi, L'vovs'kaya pravda, 8 May 1991, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter Eastern Poland fell under Soviet occupation. Upon release from prison, Bandera moved to Kraków, the capital of Germany's occupational [[General Government]]. There, he came in contact with the leader of the OUN, [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]]. In 1940, the political differences between the two leaders caused the OUN to split into two factions—the [[OUN-M|Melnyk]] faction led by [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], which preached a more conservative approach to nation-building, (also known as the OUN-M), and the [[OUN-B|Bandera]] faction led by S. Bandera, which supported a revolutionary approach, (also known as the OUN-B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/30082/World-War-II-and-its-aftermath#ref=ref404610 |title=Ukraine :: World War II and its aftermath – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |website=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of Mobile Groups===
Before the independence proclamation of 30 June 1941, Bandera oversaw the formation of so-called "Mobile Groups" ({{lang-ua|мобільні групи}}) which were small (5–15 members) groups of OUN-B members who would travel from [[General Government]] to Western Ukraine and after German advance to Eastern Ukraine to encourage support for the OUN-B and establishing the local authorities ruled by OUN-B activists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ОУН в 1941 році: документи: В 2-х ч Ін-т історії України НАН України К. 2006 {{ISBN|966-02-2535-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, approximately 7,000 people participated in these mobile groups, and they found followers among a wide circle of intellectuals, such as [[Ivan Bahriany]], [[Vasyl Barka]], [[Hryhorii Vashchenko]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= By Sviatoslav LYPOVETSKY |url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/264657/ |title=Eight decades of struggle /ДЕНЬ/ |website=Day.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the UPA===
{{Further|Ukrainian Insurgent Army}}

==World War II==
OUN leaders [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]] and Bandera were recruited before World War II into the Nazi Germany military intelligence [[Abwehr]] for espionage, counter-espionage and sabotage. Their goal was to run diversion activities after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. Melnyk was given code name 'Consul I'. This information is part of the testimony that Abwehr Colonel Erwin Stolze gave on 25 December 1945 and submitted to the Nuremberg trials, with a request to be admitted as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-06/tgmwc-06-56-12.html|title=Nuremberg - The Trial of German Major War Criminals (Volume VI)|website=Nizkor.org|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WGAexVXyHwC&amp;pg=PA322|title=Canaris: The Life and Death of Hitler's Spymaster|first=Michael|last=Mueller|date=18 August 2018|publisher=Naval Institute Press|accessdate=18 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1941, Bandera held meetings with the heads of Germany's intelligence, regarding the formation of "[[Nachtigall Battalion|Nachtigall]]" and "[[Roland Battalion|Roland]]" Battalions. In spring of that year the OUN received 2.5&amp;nbsp;million marks for subversive activities inside the USSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history.org.ua"&gt;Організація українських націоналістів і Українська повстанська армія.

On 30 June 1941, with the arrival of Nazi troops in Ukraine, Bandera and the OUN-B declared an independent Ukrainian State ("Act of Renewal of Ukrainian Statehood").&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; This declaration was accompanied by violent porgoms.&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; Some of the published proclamations of the formation of this state say that it would "work closely with the [[Nazi Germany|National-Socialist Greater Germany]], under the leadership of its leader [[Adolf Hitler]] which is forming a [[New Order (political system)|new order in Europe and the world]] and is helping the Ukrainian People to free itself from [[Soviet Union|Moscovite occupation]]." – as stated in the text of the "[[Declaration of Ukrainian Independence, 1941|Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian Statehood]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1940"/&gt;

Bandera's expectation that Nazi regime would ''post factum'' recognize an independent fascist Ukraine as the Axis ally proved to be wrong.&lt;ref name="RudlingMyth"/&gt; In 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B had soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that "... the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the Reichskommissariat which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated...".&lt;ref name="InfoUkes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/history/ww2/page-08.html |title=Ukrainian History – World War II in Ukraine |publisher=InfoUkes |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, Bandera was transferred to Berlin. On 12 July, the prime minister of the newly formed [[Ukrainian national government (1941)|Ukrainian National Government]], [[Yaroslav Stetsko]], was also arrested and taken to Berlin. Although released from custody on 14 July, both were required to stay in Berlin. On 15 September 1941 Bandera and leading OUN members were arrested by the Gestapo.

In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]'s special barrack for high-profile political prisoners Zellenbau.&lt;ref name="Berkhoff, K.C. 1999 pp. 149"&gt;[[Karel C.

==Postwar activity==
According to [[Stephen Dorril]], author of ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', OUN-B was re-formed in 1946 under the sponsorship of [[MI6]]. The organization had been receiving some support from MI6 since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Dorril, Stephen, ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', Simon and Schuster, 2002, pp. 224, 233&lt;/ref&gt; One faction of Bandera's organization, associated with [[Mykola Lebed]], became more closely associated with the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorril, Stephen, ''MI6: Inside the Covert World of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service'', Simon and Schuster, 2002, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Bandera himself was the target of an extensive and aggressive search carried out by [[Counterintelligence Corps|CIC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/iwg/reports/hitlers-shadow.pdf Richard Breitman, Norman J.W.

After the Bavarian state government initiated a crackdown on it, Bandera agreed with the [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]] offering them his service, despite CIA warning the West Germans against cooperating with him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/iwg/reports/hitlers-shadow.pdf Richard Breitman, Norman J.W.

In May 1941 at a meeting in [[Kraków]] the leadership of Bandera's OUN faction adopted the program "Struggle and action for OUN during the war" ({{lang-uk|"Боротьба й діяльність ОУН під час війни"}}) which outlined the plans for activities at the onset of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the western territories of the Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;І.К.

In late 1942, when Bandera was in a German concentration camp, his organization, the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]], was involved in a [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], and in early 1944, ethnic cleansings also spread to Eastern Galicia. It is estimated that more than 35,000 and up to 60,000&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorz Motyka, ''Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji "Wisła'', Kraków 2011, {{ISBN|978-83-08-04576-3}}, s.447, Ewa Siemaszko estimates victims to be 133,000 in ''Stan badań nad ludobójstwem dokonanym na ludności polskiej przez Organizację Ukraińskich Nacjonalistów i Ukraińską Powstańczą Armię'', Bogusław Paź (red.), ''Ludobójstwo na Kresach południowo-wschodniej Polski w latach 1939–1946'', Wrocław 2011, {{ISBN|978-83-229-3185-1}}, s.341.&lt;/ref&gt; Poles, mostly women and children along with unarmed men, were killed during the spring and summer campaign of 1943 in Volhynia, and up to 100,000 if other regions (Eastern Galicia) are included.&lt;ref name="SNYDER2"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/cis/www/migration/pubs/rrwp/9_resolve.html To Resolve the Ukrainian Question Once and For All: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ukrainians in Poland, 1943–1947], Timothy Snyder, Working Paper, Yale University, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji "Wisła", 2011, pages 447–448&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central role played by Bandera's followers in the massacre of Poles in western Ukraine, Bandera himself was interned in a German concentration camp when the concrete decision to massacre the Poles was made and when the Poles were killed.  According to [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]], during his internment, from the summer of 1941, he was not completely aware of events in Ukraine and moreover had serious differences of opinion with [[Mykola Lebed]], the OUN-B leader who remained in Ukraine and who was one of the chief architects of the massacres of Poles.&lt;ref name = "hrycak1"&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/magazyn/1,136498,15363017,Romantyczny_terrorysta.html Bandera – romantyczny terrorysta] "Bandera – Romantic Terrorist, interview with Jaroslaw Hrycak.

===Jews===
Unlike competing Polish, Russian, Hungarian or Romanian nationalisms in late [[Austrian Empire|imperial Austria]], [[Russian Empire|imperial Russia]], [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]] and Romania, [[Ukrainian nationalism]] did not include antisemitism as a core aspect of its program and saw Russians as well as Poles as the chief enemy with Jews playing a secondary role.&lt;ref name="himka"&gt;[http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje16/text11.htm Ukrainian Collaboration in the Extermination of the Jews during the Second World War: Sorting Out the Long-Term and Conjunctural Factors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106044835/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje16/text11.htm |date=6 January 2012 }} by John-Paul Himka, University of Alberta.

Jonathan Frankel (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), Studies in Contemporary Jewry 13 (1997): 170–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ukrainian nationalism was not immune to the influence of the antisemitic climate in the Eastern and Central Europe,&lt;ref name="himka"/&gt; that had already become highly racialized in the late 19th century, and had developed an elaborate anti-Jewish discourse.&lt;ref&gt;p.16 [https://archive.org/details/warCriminalityABlankSpotInTheCollectiveMemoryOfTheUkrainian "War Criminality: A Blank Spot in the Collective Memory of the Ukrainian Diaspora."] ''Spaces of Identity'' 5, no. 1 (April 2005) by [[John-Paul Himka]], [[University of Alberta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostility to both the Soviet central government and the Jewish minority were highlighted at the OUN-B's Conference in [[Kraków]] in May 1941, at which the leadership of Bandera's OUN faction adopted the program "Struggle and action of OUN during the war" ({{lang-uk|"Боротьба й діяльність ОУН під час війни"}}) which outlined the plans for activities at the onset of the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] and the western territories of the Ukrainian SSR.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The program declared that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews in the USSR constitute the most faithful support of the ruling Bolshevik regime, and the vanguard of Muscovite imperialism in Ukraine. The Muscovite-Bolshevik government exploits the anti-Jewish sentiments of the Ukrainian masses to divert their attention from the true cause of their misfortune and to channel them in a time of frustration into pogroms on Jews. The OUN combats the Jews as the prop of the Muscovite-Bolshevik regime and simultaneously it renders the masses conscious of the fact that the principal foe is Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Filip Friedman|Philip Friedman]].  "Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Nazi Occupation," in Philip Friedman and Ada June Friedman (eds.), ''Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust'' (New York: Conference on Jewish Social Studies, [[Jewish Publication Society of America]], 1980). pp.179–180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section G of the program – "Directives for organizing the life of the state during the first days" ({{lang-uk|"Вказівки на перші дні організації державного життя"}}) outlined activity of the Bandera followers during mid-1941.&lt;ref name="autogenerated56"/&gt; In a subsection on "Minority Policy", the leaders of OUN-B ordered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Moskal]]i [i.e. ethnic Russians], Poles, and Jews that are hostile to us are to be destroyed in struggle, particularly those opposing the regime, by means of: deporting them to their own lands, eradicating their intelligentsia, which is not to be admitted to any governmental positions, and overall preventing any creation of this intelligentsia (e.g. access to education etc)...  Jews are to be isolated, removed from governmental positions in order to prevent sabotage... Those who are deemed necessary may only work under strict supervision and removed from their positions for slightest misconduct... Jewish assimilation is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Меншинева політика.

а) приязні нам, себто членів досі поневолених народів;
б) ворожі нам, москалі, поляки, жиди.
а) Мають однакові права з українцями, уможливлюємо їм поворот в їхню батьківщину.
б) Винищування в боротьбі, зокрема тих, що боронитимуть режиму: переселювання в їх землі, винищувати головно інтелігенцію, якої не вільно допускати до ніяких урядів, і взагалі унеможливлюємо продуку-
вання інтелігенції, себто доступ до шкіл і т.д. Наприклад, так званих польських селян треба асимілювати, усвідомлюючи з місця їм, тим більше в цей гарячий, повний фанатизму час, що вони українці, тільки
латинського обряду, насильно асимільовані. Проводирів нищити. Жидів ізолювати, поусувати з урядів, щоб уникнути саботажу, тим більше москалів і поляків. Коли б була непоборна потреба оставити, приміром, в
господарськім апараті жида, поставити йому нашого міліціянта над головою і ліквідувати за найменші провини. Керівники поодиноких галузей життя можуть бути лише українці, а не чужині – вороги.

Another notable Jewish UPA member was Leyba-Itzik "Valeriy" Dombrovsky. (While two [[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]]s from Galicia, Anna-Amelia Leonowicz (1925–1949) and her mother, Helena (Ruhama) Leonowicz (1890–1967), are reported to have become members of OUN, oral accounts suggest that both women collaborated not of their own free will, but following threats from nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Kizilov, ''The Karaites of Galicia: An Ethnoreligious Minority Among the Ashkenazim, the Turks, and the Slavs, 1772–1945'', page 334&lt;/ref&gt;) By 1942, Nazi officials had concluded that Ukrainian nationalists were largely indifferent to Jews and were willing to both help them or kill them, if either better served the nationalist cause.

==Death==
[[File:Stepan Bandera’s grave.jpg|thumb|Bandera's grave in Munich, April 2014]]
On 15 October 1959, Stepan Bandera collapsed outside of Kreittmayrstrasse 7 in [[Munich]] and died shortly thereafter.  A medical examination established that the cause of his death was poison by [[cyanide]] gas.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892820,00.html The Partisan], [[Time (magazine)|Time]] (2 November 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1959, Stepan Bandera was buried in the [[Waldfriedhof Cemetery]] in Munich. His grave was desecrated on 17 August 2014 by unknown vandals, who toppled the 1.8 m cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ria.ru/world/20140817/1020356348.html|title = Неизвестные опрокинули крест на могиле Степана Бандеры в Мюнхене|date = 17 August 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Ria Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after his death, on 17 November 1961, the German judicial bodies announced that Bandera's murderer had been a KGB defector named [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] who acted on the orders of Soviet [[KGB]] head [[Alexander Shelepin]] and Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938806,00.html The Poison Pistol], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 1 December 1961&lt;/ref&gt; After a detailed investigation against Stashynsky, a trial took place from 8 to 15 October 1962. Stashynsky was convicted, and on 19 October he was sentenced to eight years in prison.

==Family==
Bandera's brother Aleksandr (who had a PhD in Political Economy from the University of Rome) and brother Vasyl (a graduate in Philosophy, Lviv University) were arrested by Germans and interned in [[Auschwitz]], where they were allegedly killed by Polish inmates in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;p.190 The Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, 1963–1965: genocide, history, and the limits Devin Owen Pendas Cambridge University Press [https://books.google.com/books?id=BUKGSlqKUkMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Franziska+Bruder:+%3E%3EDer+Gerechtigkeit+zu+dienen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IjzdAnwGyy&amp;sig=HxfJIwGaFPlU3fFB9k8N-RSNNP8&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=IydnS-bvD5CImAOpgJ0m&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Franziska%20Bruder%3A%20%3E%3EDer%20Gerechtigkeit%20zu%20dienen&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriy Bandera, Stepan's father, was arrested by Soviets in late May 1941 for harboring an OUN member and transferred to [[Kiev]]. On 8 July he was sentenced to death and executed on the 10th. His sisters Oksana and Marta–Maria were arrested by the [[NKVD]] in 1941 and sent to a [[GULAG]] in Siberia. Both were released in 1960 without the right to return to Ukraine. Marta–Maria died in [[Siberia]] in 1982, and Oksana returned to Ukraine in 1989 where she died in 2004. Another sister, Volodymyra, was sentenced to a term in Soviet labor camps from 1946–1956. She returned to Ukraine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gk-press.if.ua/node/512|title=Бандерштадт: місто Бандер - Галицький Кореспондент|date=22 January 2009|website=Gk-press.if.ua|accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Russian newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in 2005, former KGB Chief [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] claimed that "the murder of Stepan Bandera was one of the last cases when the KGB disposed of undesired people by means of violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosnews.com/interview/2005/12/06/kgbchief.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205191647/http://www.mosnews.com/interview/2005/12/06/kgbchief.shtml |date=5 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006 the [[Lviv]] city administration announced the future transference of the tombs of Stepan Bandera, [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], [[Yevhen Konovalets]] and other key leaders of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]/[[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]] to a new area of [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] specifically dedicated to victims of the repressions of the Ukrainian national liberation struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1161553853 |title=Information website of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group |website=Khpg.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes in Ukraine towards Bandera===
[[File:Бандера - наш герой.jpg|thumb|Lviv soccer fans at a game against Donetsk. The banner reads in Ukrainian, "Bandera – our hero"]]
Bandera continues to be a divisive figure in Ukraine. Although Bandera is venerated in certain parts of western Ukraine, and 33% of [[Lviv]]'s residents consider themselves to be followers of Bandera,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasiareview.com/201009128124/in-western-ukraine-even-ethnic-russians-vote-for-pro-ukrainian-parties.html In Western Ukraine, Even Ethnic Russians Vote for Pro-Ukrainian Parties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913150701/http://www.eurasiareview.com/201009128124/in-western-ukraine-even-ethnic-russians-vote-for-pro-ukrainian-parties.html |date=13 September 2010 }} by Paul Goble, Eurasia Review. 12 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in surveys of Ukraine as a whole he, along with [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], is considered among the three historical figures who produce the most negative attitudes.&lt;ref name = "Hrytsak"&gt;[[Yaroslav Hrytsak]].

It produced the following results: In Galicia (provinces of [[Lviv]], [[Ternopil]], and [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]) 37% had a "very positive" opinion of Bandera, 26% a "mostly positive" opinion, 20% were "neutral", 5% "mostly negative", 6% "very negative", and 6% "unsure". In [[Volhynia]], 5% had a very positive opinion, 20% a mostly positive opinion, 57% were neutral, 7% were mostly negative, 5% very negative and 6% were unsure. In [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]] 4% of the respondents had a very positive opinion, 32% a mostly positive opinion, 50% were neutral, none had a mostly negative opinion, 7% had a very negative opinion and 7% were unsure. In contrast, in central Ukraine (comprising the capital [[Kiev]], as well as the provinces of [[Zhytomyr]], [[Cherkasy]], [[Chernihiv]], [[Poltava]], [[Sumy]], [[Vinnytsia]], and [[Kirovohrad]]) attitudes towards Bandera's faction of the OUN were 3% very positive, 10% mostly positive, 24% neutral, 17% mostly negative, 21% very negative and 25% unsure. In Eastern Ukraine (the provinces of [[Donetsk]], [[Luhansk]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Zaporizhia]]) 1% each had very positive or mostly positive attitudes towards Bandera's OUN, 19% were neutral, 13% mostly negative, 26% very negative and 20% unsure. In Ukraine's south (the [[Odessa]], [[Mykolaiv]] and [[Kherson]] regions plus [[Crimea]]) 1% each were very or mostly positive, 13% were neutral, 31% mostly negative, 48% very negative and 25% were unsure. In Ukraine as a whole, 6% of Ukrainians had a very positive opinion, 8% a mostly positive opinion, 23% were neutral, 15% had a mostly negative opinion, 30% had a very negative opinion, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Katchanovski.

===Hero of Ukraine award ===

On 22 January 2010, on the ''[[Day of Unity of Ukraine]]'', the then-[[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] awarded to Bandera the title of [[Hero of Ukraine]] (posthumously) for "defending national ideas and battling for an independent Ukrainian state."&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/57781/ Stepan Bandera becomes Ukrainian hero], [[Kyiv Post]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; A grandson of Bandera, also named Stepan, accepted the award that day from the Ukrainian President during the state ceremony to commemorate the ''Day of Unity of Ukraine'' at the [[National Opera House of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="kyivpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=109625 President Viktor Yushchenko awarded title Hero of Ukraine to OUN Head Stepan Bandera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206131125/http://nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&amp;listid=109625 |date=6 December 2010 }}, [[Radio Ukraine]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/16236 Events by themes: {{sic|9|1th|nolink=y}} anniversary of Collegiality of Ukraine], [[UNIAN]] (22 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarussia.com/posts/778 Ukraine.

On 9 February 2010, the Poland's [[Senate Marshal]] [[Bogdan Borusewicz]] said at a meeting with the head of [[Federation Council of Russia|Russia's Federation Council]] [[Sergei Mironov]], that adaptation of the Hero title of Ukraine to Bandera is an internal matter of the Ukrainian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrpohliad.org/news.php/news/2331 Ukrainsky pohliad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024057/http://www.ukrpohliad.org/news.php/news/2331 |date=27 July 2011 }} (Ukrainian view) 9 February 2010 {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taras Kuzio]], a senior fellow in the chair of [[Ukrainian studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]], has suggested Yushchenko awarded Bandera the award in order to frustrate [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]'s chances to get elected President during the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|Ukrainian Presidential elections 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/62040/ Gender bias, anti-Semitism contributed to Yanukovych's victory], [[Kyiv Post]] (18 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10455">{{Suicide sidebar}}
'''Suicidology''' is the scientific study of [[suicidal behaviour]], the causes of suicidalness and [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maris, Berman, Silverman|first=Ronald, Alan, Mortan|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology|year=2000|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=72 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different fields and disciplines involved with suicidology, the two primary ones being psychology and sociology. Every year, about one million people die by suicide, which is a mortality rate of sixteen per 100,000 or one death every forty seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE)|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is largely preventable with the right actions, knowledge about suicide, and a change in society's view of suicide to make it more acceptable to talk about suicide.

==Short history==
Most suicidologists think about the history of suicide in terms of courts, church, press, morals, and society. In Ancient Greece, there were several opinions about suicide. It was tolerated and even lauded when committed by patricians (generals and philosophers) but condemned if committed by  [[plebeians]] (common people) or slaves. In Rome, suicide was viewed rather neutrally, even positively because life was held cheaply. During early Christianity, excessive martyrdom and a penchant toward suicide frightened church elders sufficiently for them to introduce a serious deterrent. Suicide was thought of as a crime because it precluded possibility of repentance, and it violated the sixth commandment which is ''Thou shall not kill''. During this time, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] emphasized that suicide was a mortal sin because it disrupted God's power over man's life and death. However, nowhere in the Judeo-Christian Bible is there a directive forbidding suicide. This belief took hold and for hundreds of years thereafter played an important part in the Western view of suicide. Over the last 200 years, the main focus of suicide has moved from accusations that it is a sin to effort at compassion, understanding, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shneidman|first=Edwin|title=Comprehending Suicide Landmarks in 20th-Century Suicidology|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=750 First Street, NE Washingtion DC 20002|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of study==
There are many points of study within suicidology. Suicidology studies not only death by suicide and attempted suicide but also partial self-destruction, [[suicidal ideation]], [[parasuicide]], and self-destructive behaviors and attitudes.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Suicidal ideation is when someone is having thoughts or showing gestures of suicide. For example, it could be as simple as someone saying that "life is not worth living any more" or it can be extreme as "I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge." Parasuicide is when someone causes deliberate harm to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;   By way of a [[suicide note]] the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note.

==Contributors==
One of the first to contribute to the study of suicidology is Edwin S. Shneidman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Shneidman]]&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Shneidman is considered to be the father of suicidology. Shneidman's definition of suicide is a conscious act of self-induced annihilation, best understood as a multidimensional malaise in a needful individual who defines an issue for which suicide is perceived as the best solution.  He thought of suicide as psychache or intolerable psychological pain. Another notable person in the field of suicidology is [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emile Durkheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;  To Durkheim the word suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result. Basically he saw suicide as an external and constraining social fact independent of individual psychopathology.  In David J. Mayo's definition there were four elements to suicide. The first element: A suicide has taken place only if a death has occurred. The second element: The death must be of one's own doing. The third element: The agency of suicide can be active or passive and, lastly, it implies intentionally ending one's own life.  [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Menninger]] had similar views on suicide. Their definition of suicide had three different aspects. One was a murder involving hatred or the wish to kill. The second one was a murder by the self often involving guilt or the wish to be killed. The last one is the wish to die. They thought of suicide being a murderous death wish that was turned back upon one's own self. Sigmund Freud also believed that we had two opposing basic instincts—life (eros) and death (thanatos)—and all instincts sought tension reduction. He also believed that suicide is more likely in advanced civilizations requiring greater repression of sexual and aggressive energy. Jean Baechler's definition of suicide was that suicide denotes all behavior that seeks and finds the solution to an existential problem by making an attempt on the life of the subject. Another worker in the field of suicidology was Joseph H. Davis. The definition he gave for suicide was a suicide is a fatal willful self-inflicted life-threatening act without apparent desire to live; implicit are two basic components lethality and intent. [[Albert Camus]] also did some work in this field. He believed that whether one can live or chooses to live is the only truly serious philosophical problem. He also claimed that man created a god in order to be able to live without a wish to kill himself and that the only human liberty is to come to terms with death. He introduced Darwinian thought into his teachings.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

! Myths !! Truths
|-
| People who die by suicide always leave notes. || Most people don't leave notes. Only a small percentage leave any type of explanations about why they've chosen to kill themselves.
|-
| People who die by suicide don't warn others. || Out of ten people who kill themselves, eight have given definite clues to their intentions. They leave numerous clues and warnings to others, although some of their clues may be non-verbal or difficult to detect.
|-
| People who talk about suicide are only trying to get attention. || Few die by suicide without first letting someone else know how they feel. People thinking about suicide give clues and warnings as cries for help. Over 70% who do threaten to kill themselves either make an attempt or die by suicide. 
|-
| Once someone has already decided to die by suicide, nothing is going to stop them. || Most of the time suicidal people are ambivalent about suicide. Most individuals don't want to die; they just want the pain they are feeling to stop. 
|-
| Once the emotional state improves, the risk of suicide is over. || The highest rates of suicide occur within about three months of an apparent improvement in a severely depressed state. Energy level is the important factor in someone who's improving having the energy to act on a suicidal impulse, if they perceive a stumbling block to recovery. 
|-
| After a person has attempted suicide, it is unlikely they will try again. || People who have attempted suicide are very likely to try again. 80% of people who die by suicide have made at least one previous attempt. 
|-
| Don't mention suicide to someone who's showing signs of severe depression; it will plant the idea in their mind and they will act on it. || Many depressed people have already considered suicide as an option. Talking about suicide generally provides a sense of relief and understanding to the person. Talking about suicide is one of the most helpful things you can do. 
|-
| A non-fatal attempt means that the person wasn't serious about ending their life. || Some people are naive about how to kill themselves. The attempt in and of itself is the most important factor, not the method.

'''Taejo of Goryeo''' (31 January 877 – 4 July 943), also known as '''Taejo Wang Geon (Wang Kǒn, 왕건)''', was the founder of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, which ruled [[Korea]] from the 10th to the 14th century. Taejo ruled from 918 to 943, achieving unification of the [[Later Three Kingdoms]] in 936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=왕건(王建)|url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div=CP_THE&amp;search_div_id=CP_THE009&amp;cp_code=cp0208&amp;index_id=cp02081539&amp;content_id=cp020815390001&amp;search_left_menu=|website=문화콘텐츠닷컴|publisher=Korea Creative Content Agency|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Wang Geon was born in 877 to a powerful maritime merchant family based in Songak (modern [[Kaesong]]) as the eldest son of [[Sejo of Goryeo|Wang Ryung]] ({{Korean|hangul=왕륭|hanja=王隆}}). He traced his ancestry to a noble [[Goguryeo]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=박|first1=종기|title=고려사의 재발견: 한반도 역사상 가장 개방적이고 역동적인 500년 고려 역사를 만나다|publisher=휴머니스트|isbn=9788958629023|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qn6TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 October 2016|language=ko|date=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors were Goguryeo refugees who settled around Songak, accumulating great wealth through maritime trade and gaining control of the region, including the [[Ryesong River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=장덕호|title=한반도 중심에 터 닦으니 화합·통합의 새시대 '활짝'|url=http://news.joins.com/article/17253437|website=중앙일보|publisher=JoongAng Ilbo|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko-KR|date=1 March 2015|quote=왕건의 가문은 고구려의 유민으로서 대대로 개성지방을 중심으로 해상무역을 통해 막대한 부(富)를 이룩했고, 축적된 부를 기반으로 송악일대를 장악했을 뿐 아니라, 예성강 일대에서 강화도에 이르는 지역에 튼튼한 세력기반을 구축하고 있었다.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Later Silla]] period, the northern regions, including Songak, were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=이상각|title=고려사 - 열정과 자존의 오백년|date=2014|publisher=들녘|isbn=9791159250248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LonnCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(2) 건국―호족들과의 제휴|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/nh/view.do?levelId=nh_011_0040_0030_0020_0020|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wang Geon's hometown of Songak would become the original capital of [[Taebong|Later Goguryeo]] in 901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=성기환|title=생각하는 한국사 2: 고려시대부터 조선·일제강점까지|date=2008|publisher=버들미디어|isbn=9788986982923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQ3-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
Taejo began his career in the turbulent [[Later Three Kingdoms]] ({{hanja|後三國時代}}). In the later years of [[Silla]], many local leaders and bandits rebelled against the rule of [[Jinseong of Silla|Queen Jinseong]], who did not have strong enough leadership or policies to improve the condition of the people. Among those rebels, [[Gung Ye]] (궁예; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;弓裔&lt;/span&gt;) of the northwestern region and [[Gyeon Hwon]] (견훤; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;甄萱&lt;/span&gt;) of the southwest gained more power. They defeated and absorbed many of the other rebel groups as their troops marched against local Silla officials and bandits. In 895, Gung Ye led his forces into the far northwestern part of Silla, where Songdo was located. Taejo's father, Wang Yung (later [[Sejo of Goryeo]]), along with many local clans, quickly surrendered to Gung Ye. Wang Geon followed his father into service under [[Gung Ye]], the future leader of [[Taebong]], and he began his service under Gungye's command.

Wang Geon's ability as a military commander was soon recognized by Gung Ye, who promoted him to general and even regarded him as his brother. In 900, he led a successful campaign against local clans and the army of [[Later Baekje]] in the [[Chungju]] area, gaining more fame and recognition from the king. In 903, he led a famous naval campaign against the southwestern coastline of Hubaekje (Keumsung, later Naju), while Gyeon Hwon was at war against Silla. He led several more military campaigns, and also helped conquered people who lived  in poverty under Silla rule. The public favored him due to his leadership and generosity.

In 913, he was appointed as prime minister of the newly renamed Taebong. Its king, Gung Ye, whose leadership helped found the kingdom but who began to refer to himself as the Buddha, began to persecute people who expressed their opposition against his religious arguments. He executed many monks, then later even his own wife and two sons, and the public began to turn away from him. His costly rituals and harsh rule caused even more opposition.

==Rise to the throne and founding of Goryeo==
{{Goryeo monarchs}}
In 918, four top-ranked generals of Taebong—[[Hong Yu (Goryeo)|Hong Yu]] (홍유; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;洪儒&lt;/span&gt;), [[Bae Hyeongyeong]] (배현경; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;裵玄慶&lt;/span&gt;), [[Shin Sung-gyeom]] (신숭겸; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;申崇謙&lt;/span&gt;) and [[Bok Jigyeom]] (복지겸; &lt;span lang="KO"&gt;卜智謙&lt;/span&gt;)—met secretly and agreed to overthrow Gung Ye's rule and crown Wang Geon as their new king. Wang Geon first opposed the idea but later agreed to their plan. The same year Gung Ye was overthrown and killed near the capital, [[Cheorwon]]. The generals installed Wang Geon as the new king of this short-lived state. He renamed the kingdom [[Goryeo]], thus beginning the Goryeo Dynasty. The next year he moved the capital back to his hometown, Gaegyeong.

He promoted Buddhism as Goryeo's national religion, and laid claim to the northern parts of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria, which he considered his rightful legacy as the successor of Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="Rossabi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossabi|first1=Morris|title=China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th Centuries|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520045620|page=323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNpD5UKmkswC&amp;q=%22As+the+self-proclaimed+successor+to+Koguryo+and+the+protector+of+Parhae+refugees%2C+many+of+them+of+Koguryo+origin%2C+Koryo+considered+the+northern+territories+in+Manchuria+its+rightful+legacy.%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22As%20the%20self-proclaimed%20successor%20to%20Koguryo%20and%20the%20protector%20of%20Parhae%20refugees%2C%20many%20of%20them%20of%20Koguryo%20origin%2C%20Koryo%20considered%20the%20northern%20territories%20in%20Manchuria%20its%20rightful%20legacy.%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|language=en|date=1983-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Goryeosa]], in 918, the ancient capital of [[Pyongyang]] had been in ruins for a long time and foreign barbarians were using the surrounding lands as hunting grounds and occasionally raiding the borders of Goryeo; therefore, in his first year as king, Wang Geon ordered his subjects to repopulate the ancient capital,&lt;ref&gt;"丙申谕群臣曰:“平壤古都荒废虽久,基址尙存,而荆棘滋茂,蕃人游猎於其间,因而侵掠边邑,为害 大矣。 宜徙民实之以固藩屏为百世之利"(高丽史)&lt;/ref&gt; and soon sent his cousin Wang Sik-ryeom to defend it. Afterward, he decreed Pyongyang as the Western Capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=서경|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/tg/view.do?treeId=0210&amp;levelId=tg_002_1100&amp;ganada=&amp;pageUnit=10|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sought alliances and cooperation with local clans rather than trying to conquer and bring them under his direct control.

==The War of the Later Three Kingdoms==
In 927, Gyeon Hwon of Hubaekje led forces into Silla's capital, [[Gyeongju]], capturing and executing its king, [[Gyeongae of Silla|King Gyeongae]]. Then he established King Gyeongsun as his puppet monarch before he turned his army toward Goryeo. Hearing of the news, Taejo planned a strike with 5000 cavalrymen to attack Gyeon's troops on the way back home at Gongsan near [[Daegu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Il-yeon]]: ''Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea'', translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 128. Silk Pagoda (2006). {{ISBN|1-59654-348-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met Hubaekje forces and suffered disastrous defeat, losing most of his army including his generals [[Kim Nak]] and [[Shin Sung-gyeom]], the very same man who crowned Wang as a king. However, Goryeo quickly recovered from defeat and successfully defended Hubaekje's attack on its front.

In 935, the last king of Silla, King Gyeongsun, felt there was no way to revive his kingdom and surrendered his entire land to Taejo. Taejo gladly accepted his surrender and gave him the title of prince, and accepted his daughter as one of his wives (Wang had six queens, and many more wives as he married daughters of every single local leader). It caused much disgust to Gyeon Hwon. Gyeon's father, who held his own claim to the [[Sangju]] region, also defected and surrendered to Goryeo and was received as the father of a king.

In the same year, Gyeon Hwon's oldest son, [[Gyeon Singeom]] ({{hanja|甄神劍}}), led a coup with his brothers Yanggeom and Yonggeom, against their father, who favored their half-brother, Geumgang, as his successor to the throne. Gyeon Hwon was sent into exile and imprisoned in [[Geumsansa]], but escaped to Goryeo and was treated like Taejo's father, who died just before his surrender.

==Goryeo victory and unification==
In 936, Wang led his final campaign against Singeom of Later Baekje. Singeom fought against Taejo, but facing much disadvantage and inner conflict, he surrendered to Taejo. Wang finally occupied Hubaekje formally, and unified the nation for the second time since [[Unified Silla]]; he ruled until 943, and died from disease.

Taejo sought to bring even his enemies into his ruling coalition. He gave titles and land to rulers and nobles from the various countries he had defeated: Later Baekje, Silla, and also [[Balhae]], which disintegrated around the same time. Thus he sought to secure stability and unity for his kingdom which had been lacking in the later years of Silla.

After the destruction of Balhae by the Khitans in 926, Balhae's [[Dae Gwang-hyeon|last crown prince]] and much of its ruling class sought refuge in Goryeo, where they were warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus uniting the two successor nations of [[Goguryeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ki-Baik|title=A New History of Korea|date=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674615762|page=103}} "When Parhae perished at the hands of the Khitan around this same time, much of its ruling class, who were of Koguryŏ descent, fled to Koryŏ. Wang Kŏn warmly welcomed them and generously gave them land. Along with bestowing the name Wang Kye ("Successor of the Royal Wang") on the Parhae crown prince, Tae Kwang-hyŏn, Wang Kŏn entered his name in the royal household register, thus clearly conveying the idea that they belonged to the same lineage, and also had rituals performed in honor of his progenitor. Thus Koryŏ achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Koguryŏ lineage from the Parhae kingdom."&lt;/ref&gt; Taejo felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, calling it his "Relative Country" and "Married Country",&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{cite book|last1=박종기|title=고려사의 재발견: 한반도 역사상 가장 개방적이고 역동적인 500년 고려 역사를 만나다|date=2015|publisher=휴머니스트|isbn=9788958629023|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qn6TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=박용운|title=‘고구려’와 ‘고려’는 같은 나라였다|url=http://www.chosun.com/culture/news/200606/200606160471.html|website=조선닷컴|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622072057/http://www.chosun.com/culture/news/200606/200606160471.html|archive-date=2017-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protected Balhae refugees, many of whom were also of Goguryeo origin.&lt;ref name="Rossabi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt; This was in strong contrast to Later Silla, which had endured a hostile relationship with Balhae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parhae {{!}} historical state, China and Korea|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Parhae|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taejo displayed strong animosity toward the Khitans who had destroyed Balhae. The Liao dynasty sent 30 envoys with 50 camels as a gift in 942, but Wang Geon exiled the envoys and starved the camels under a bridge in retribution for Balhae, despite the major diplomatic repercussions.&lt;ref name="Yi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=이기환|title=[여적]태조 왕건이 낙타를 굶겨죽인 까닭|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201506221730411|website=경향신문|publisher=Kyunghyang Shinmun|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taejo proposed to Gaozu of [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jìn]] that they attack the Khitans as revenge for the destruction of Balhae, according to the [[Zizhi Tongjian]].&lt;ref name="Park" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=왕건의 할아버지는 사생아였다?|url=http://mzine.mk.co.kr/v2/index.php?TM=M3&amp;RC=3652|website=M매거진|publisher=매경닷컴|accessdate=23 March 2018|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in his Ten Mandates to his descendants, he stated that the Khitans are no different than beasts and should be guarded against.&lt;ref name="Yi" /&gt;

The unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936 was very important in Korean history; the unification of 668 CE by Silla was only a unification of approximately half of the peoples of the [[Korean Peninsula]] and its vicinity (who at the time largely considered themselves one people divided among many states), since the northern part was ruled by Balhae, which asserted itself as a reincarnation of Goguryeo. However, Wang Geon's unification in 936 was a more complete unification (in which only a single state emerged among the people, as opposed to the 7th century, when two, [[Later Silla]] and [[Balhae]], emerged); the people of the [[Korean Peninsula]] thereafter remained under a single, unified state until 1948, when Korea was divided into [[North Korea|north]] and [[South Korea|south]] by Russian and U.S occupation forces.

As noted elsewhere in this article, the modern name of "Korea" is derived from the name "Goryeo," which itself is derived from "Goguryeo," to whose heritage (and by extension, territory) Wang Geon and his new kingdom laid claim.&lt;ref name="Rossabi" /&gt; As the first ruler to more fully unite the people of the Korean Peninsula under a single state, many modern-day [[Korean people|Koreans]] look to his example for applicability to the current state of division on the Korean Peninsula.

During the early Goryeo dynasty, the title of [[crown prince]] ({{hanja|太子}}) was only a peerage title for sons of the king; a separate title existed for the [[heir apparent]] ({{hanja|正尹}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29689">'''Task allocation and partitioning''' refers to the way that tasks are chosen, assigned, subdivided, and coordinated (here, within a single colony of social insects). Closely associated are issues of [[communication]] that enable these actions to occur.
This entry focuses exclusively on [[social insects]]. For information on human task allocation and partitioning, see [[division of labour]], [[task analysis]], and [[workflow]].

==Definitions==
*'''Task allocation''' "... is the process that results in specific workers being engaged in specific tasks, in numbers appropriate to the current situation. [It] operates without any central or hierarchical control..."&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deborah M. Gordon |year=1996 |title=The organization of work in social insect colonies |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=380 |pages=121–124 |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |format=PDF |pmid= |doi=10.1038/380121a0 |issue=6570 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729191717/http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/Gordon1996_Nature.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of task allocation is individual-centric. It focuses on decisions by individuals about what task to perform. However, different biomathematical models give different weights to inter-individual interactions vs. environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;
*'''Task partitioning''' refers to the division of one task into sequential actions done by more than one individual.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Francis L. W. Ratnieks  |author2=Carl Anderson  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999 |title=Task partitioning in insect societies |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=95–108 |doi=10.1007/s000400050119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus here is on the task, and its division, rather than on the individuals performing it.  For example, "hygienic behavior" is a task in which worker bees uncap and remove diseased brood cells that may be affected by American foulbrood (Paenibacillus larvae) or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H.

Therefore, the task is partitioned, and performed by multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arathi | first1 = H. S. | last2 = Spivak | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Influence of colony genotypic composition on the performance of hygienic behaviour in the honeybee, Apis mellifera L | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 57–66 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Social living provides a multitude of advantages to its practitioners, including predation risk reduction, environmental buffering, food procurement, and possible mating advantages. The most advanced form of sociality is [[eusociality]], characterized by overlapping generations, cooperative care of the young, and reproductive division of labor, which includes sterility or near-sterility of the overwhelming majority of colony members. With few exceptions, all the practitioners of eusociality are insects of the orders Hymenoptera ([[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s), Isoptera ([[termite]]s), Thysanoptera ([[thrips]]), and Hemiptera ([[aphid]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=John R. Krebs  |author2=Nicholas B. Davies  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1987 |title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology |edition=2nd |publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications |page=291 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ross H. Crozier  |author2=Pekka Pamilo  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1996 |title=Evolution of Social Insect Colonies.

Social insects have been extraordinarily successful ecologically and evolutionarily. This success has at its most pronounced produced colonies 1) having a persistence many times the lifespan of most individuals of the colony, and 2) numbering thousands or even millions of individuals.
Social insects can exhibit division of labor with respect to non-reproductive tasks, in addition to the aforementioned reproductive one. In some cases this takes the form of markedly different, alternative morphological development ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]), as in the case of soldier castes in ants, termites, thrips, and aphids, while in other cases it is age-based (temporal polyethism), as with [[honey bee]] foragers, who are the oldest members of the colony (with the exception of the queen).  Evolutionary biologists are still debating the fitness-advantage gained by social insects due to their advanced division of labor and task allocation, but hypotheses include: increased resilience against a fluctuating environment, reduced energy costs of continuously switching tasks, increased longevity of the colony as a whole, or reduced rate of pathogen transmission.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duarte | first1 = A. | last2 = Pen | first2 = I. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | last4 = Weissing | first4 = F.

Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and the value of adaptability and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carl Anderson  |author2=Daniel W.

==Worker Polymorphism==
One of the most well known mechanisms of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size is determined by the amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (allometry).  An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (''Bombus'' spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvillon|first=MJ|author2=Jandt JM |author3=Duong NHI |author4=A Dornhaus |title=Ontogeny of worker body size distribution in bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies|journal=Ecological Entomology|year=2010|volume=35|pages=424–435|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01198.x |pmc=4444232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become.  For instance, larger workers in ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]'' (a North America species of honeypot ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage for the rest of the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rissing | first1 = Steven W | year = 1984 | title = Replete Caste Production and Allometry of Workers in the Honey Ant, ''Myrmecocystus mexicanus'' Wesmael (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) | url = | journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society | volume = 57 | issue = 2| pages = 347–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ants and termites, on the other hand, workers vary in both size and bodily proportions, which have a bimodal distribution. This is present in approximately one in six ant genera. In most of these there are two developmentally distinct pathways, or castes, into which workers can develop. Typically members of the smaller caste are called minors and members of the larger caste are called majors or soldiers. There is often variation in size within each caste. The term soldiers may be apt, as in ''Cephalotes'', but in many species members of the larger caste act primarily as foragers or food processors. In a few ant species, such as certain ''Pheidole'' species, there is a third caste, called supersoldiers.

==Temporal polyethism==
Temporal polyethism is a mechanism of task allocation, and is ubiquitous among eusocial insect colonies. Tasks in a colony are allocated among workers based on their age. Newly emerged workers perform tasks within the nest, such as brood care and nest maintenance, and progress to tasks outside the nest, such as foraging, nest defense, and corpse removal as they age. In honeybees, the youngest workers exclusively clean cells, which is then followed by tasks related to brood care and nest maintenance from about 2–11 days of age. From 11– 20 days, they transition to receiving and storing food from foragers, and at about 20 days workers begin to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas D. Seeley |year=1982 |title=Adaptive significance of the age polyethism schedule in honeybee colonies |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=287–293 |jstor=4599548 |doi=10.1007/BF00299306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar temporal polyethism patterns can be seen in primitive species of wasps, such as ''Ropalidia marginata'' as well as the eusocial wasp [[Vespula germanica]]. Young workers feed larvae, and then transition to nest building tasks, followed by foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dhruba Naug  |author2=Raghavendra Gadagkar  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=The role of age in temporal polyethism in a primitively eusocial wasp |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |jstor=4601416 |doi=10.1007/s002650050409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of ants also display this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=[[Bert Hölldobler]] &amp; [[E. O. Wilson]] |year=1990 |title=[[The Ants]] |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=0-674-04075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern is not rigid, though. Workers of certain ages have strong tendencies to perform certain tasks, but may perform other tasks if there is enough need. For instance, removing young workers from the nest will cause foragers, especially younger foragers, to revert to tasks such as caring for brood.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muscedere|first=ML|author2=Willey TA |author3=Traniello JFA |title=Age and task efficiency in the ant Pheidole dentata: young minor workers are not specialist nurses|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2009|volume=77|pages=911–918|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.12.018|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes in task preference are caused by epigenetic changes over the life of the individual. Honeybee workers of different ages show substantial differences in DNA methylation, which causes differences in gene expression. Reverting foragers to nurses by removing younger workers causes changes in DNA methylation similar to younger workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herb|first=BR|author2=Wolschin F |author3=Hansen K |author4=Aryee MJ |author5=Langmead B |author6=Irizarry R |author7=Amdam GV |author8=AP Feinbert |title=Reversible switching between epigenetic states in honeybee behavioral subcastes|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2012|volume=15|pages=1371–1375|doi=10.1038/nn.3218|issue=10 |pmid=22983211 |pmc=3518384}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Temporal polyethism is not adaptive because of maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at brood care than younger workers in some ant species.&lt;ref name="Muscedere 2009 911–918"/&gt; Rather it allows workers with the lowest remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as brood care. If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuszewska|first=K|author2=Woyciechowski M |title=Reversion in honeybee, Apis mellifera, workers with different life expectancies|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2012|volume=85|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response-Threshold Model==
A dominant theory of explaining the self-organized division of labor in social insect societies such as honey bee colonies is the Response-Threshold Model.  It predicts that individual worker bees have inherent thresholds to stimuli associated with different tasks.  Individuals with the lowest thresholds will preferentially perform that task.&lt;ref name="Duarte, A. 2012"/&gt;  Stimuli could include the “search time” that elapses while a foraging bee waits to unload her nectar and pollen to a receiver bee at the hive, the smell of diseased brood cells, or any other combination of environmental inputs that an individual worker bee encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thenius | first1 = R. | last2 = Schmickl | first2 = T. | last3 = Crailsheim | first3 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Optimisation of a honeybee-colony's energetics via social learning based on queuing delays | url = | journal = Connection Science | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 193–210 | doi=10.1080/09540090802091982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Response-Threshold Model only provides for effective task allocation in the honey bee colony if thresholds are varied among individual workers.  This variation originates from the considerable genetic diversity among worker daughters of a colony due to the queen’s multiple matings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tarapore | first1 = D. | last2 = Floreano | first2 = D. | last3 = Keller | first3 = L. | year = 2010 | title = Task-dependent influence of genetic architecture and mating frequency on division of labour in social insect societies | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1007/s00265-009-0885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network representation of information flow and task allocation==
To explain how colony-level complexity arises from the interactions of several autonomous individuals, a [[Biological network|network]]-based approach has emerged as a promising area of social insect research. Social insect colonies can be viewed as a self-organized network, in which interacting elements (i.e. [[Node (networking)|nodes]]) communicate with each other. As decentralized networks, colonies are capable of distributing information rapidly which facilitates robust responsiveness to their dynamic environments.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer H. Fewell |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5641/1867.short |title=Social Insect Networks |publisher=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |date=2003-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficiency of information flow is critical for colony-level flexibility because worker behavior is not controlled by a centralized leader but rather is based on local information.

Social insect networks are often non-randomly distributed, wherein a few individuals act as ‘hubs,’ having disproportionately more connections to other nestmates than other workers in the colony.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; In harvester ants, the total interactions per ant during recruitment for outside work is right-skewed, meaning that some ants are more highly connected than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://171.66.127.193/content/8/64/1562.full.pdf+html |title=The effect of individual variation on the structure and function of interaction networks in harvester ants |publisher=171.66.127.193 |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer simulations of this particular interaction network demonstrated that inter-individual variation in connectivity patterns expedites information flow among nestmates.

Task allocation within a social insect colony can be modeled using a network-based approach, in which workers are represented by nodes, which are connected by edges that signify inter-node interactions.  Workers performing a common task form highly connected clusters, with weaker links across tasks. These weaker, cross-task connections are important for allowing task-switching to occur between clusters.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt; This approach is potentially problematic because connections between workers are not permanent, and some information is broadcast globally, e.g. through pheromones, and therefore does not rely on interaction networks. One alternative approach to avoid this pitfall is to treat tasks as nodes and workers as fluid connections.

To demonstrate how time and space constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, social insect network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics. These effects can impose upper bounds to information flow rate in the network. For example, the rate of information flow through '' [http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus] '' ant colonies is slower than would be predicted if time spent traveling and location within the nest were not considered.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0020298 |title=Time-Ordered Networks Reveal Limitations to Information Flow in Ant Colonies |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-11-26 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020298 |volume=6 |pages=e20298 |pmid=21625450 |pmc=3098866 | last1 = Blonder | first1 = B | last2 = Dornhaus | first2 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In  ''Formica fusca'' L. ant colonies, a network analysis of spatial effects on feeding and the regulation of food storage revealed that food is distributed heterogeneously within colony, wherein heavily loaded workers are located centrally within the nest and those storing less food were located at the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/26/7/2725.full.pdf+html |title=Collective regulatory stock management and spatiotemporal dynamics of the food flow in ants |publisher=[[The FASEB Journal]] |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of inter-nest pheromone trail networks maintained by super-colonies of Argentine ants (''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Linepithema_humile Linepithema humile]'') have shown that different colonies establish networks with very similar topologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/62/1298.full.pdf+html |title=Structure and formation of ant transportation networks |publisher=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insights from these analyses revealed that these networks – which are used to guide workers transporting brood, workers and food between nests – are formed through a pruning process, in which individual ants initially create a complex network of trails, which are then refined to eliminate extraneous edges, resulting in a shorter, more efficient inter-nest network.

Long-term stability of interaction networks has been demonstrated in ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Odontomachus_hastatus Odontomachus hastatus]'' ants, in which initially highly connected ants remain highly connected over an extended time period.&lt;ref name="Jeanson"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeanson, R |year=2012 |title=Long-term dynamics in proximity networks in ants |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=83 |pages=915–923 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Temnothorax_rugatulus Temnothorax rugatulus]'' ant workers are not persistent in their interactive role, which might suggest that social organization is regulated differently among different eusocial species.&lt;ref name="plosone" /&gt;

A network is pictorially represented as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], but can equivalently be represented as an [[adjacency list]] or [[adjacency matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Goodrich &amp; [[Roberto Tamassia]] |year=2002 |title=Algorithm Design |publisher=Wiley |page=296 |isbn=978-0-471-38365-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, workers are the nodes of the graph, but Fewell prefers to make the tasks the nodes, with workers as the links.&lt;ref name="Fewell J 1870"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jennifer H. Fewell |year=2003 |title=Social insect networks |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=301 |issue=5461 |pages=1867–1870 |doi=10.1126/science.1088945 |pmid=14512616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. O'Donnell  |author2=S. J. Bulova  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Worker connectivity: a review of the design of worker communication systems and their effects on task performance in insect societies |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1007/s00040-007-0945-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell has coined the term "worker connectivity" to stand for "communicative interactions that link a colony's workers in a social network and affect task performance".&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; He has pointed out that connectivity provides three adaptive advantages compared to individual direct perception of needs:&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt;
# It increases both the physical and temporal reach of information. With connectivity, information can travel farther and faster, and additionally can persist longer, including both direct persistence (i.e. through pheromones), memory effects, and by initiating a sequence of events.
# It can help overcome task inertia and burnout, and push workers into performing hazardous tasks. For reasons of indirect fitness, this latter stimulus should not be necessary if all workers in the colony are highly related genetically, but that is not always the case.
# Key individuals may possess superior knowledge, or have catalytic roles. Examples, respectively, are a sentry who has detected an intruder, or the colony queen.
O'Donnell provides a comprehensive survey, with examples, of factors that have a large bearing on worker connectivity.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"/&gt; They include:
* [[Degree (graph theory)|graph degree]]
* size of the interacting group, especially if the network has a modular structure
* sender distribution (i.e. a small number of controllers vs. numerous senders)
* strength of the interaction effect, which includes strength of the signal sent, recipient sensitivity, and signal persistence (i.e. pheromone signal vs. sound waves)
* recipient memory, and its decay function
* socially-transmitted inhibitory signals, as not all interactions provide positive stimulus
* specificity of both the signal and recipient response
* signal and sensory modalities, and activity and interaction rates

==Task taxonomy and complexity==
Anderson, Franks, and McShea have broken down insect tasks (and subtasks) into a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; their focus is on task partitioning and its complexity implications. They classify tasks as individual, group, team, or partitioned; classification of a task depends on whether there are multiple vs. individual workers, whether there is division of labor, and whether subtasks are done concurrently or sequentially. Note that in their classification, in order for an action to be considered a task, it must contribute positively to inclusive fitness; if it must be combined with other actions to achieve that goal, it is considered to be a subtask. In their simple model, they award 1, 2, or 3 points to the different tasks and subtasks, depending on its above classification. Summing all tasks and subtasks point values down through all levels of nesting allows any task to be given a score that roughly ranks relative complexity of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carl Anderson, Nigel R. Franks &amp; Daniel W. McShea |year=2001 |title=The complexity and hierarchical structure of tasks in insect societies |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=643–651 |doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1795}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also the review of task partitioning by Ratnieks and Anderson.&lt;ref name="Ratnieks"/&gt;

==Note: model-building==
All models are simplified abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed amount of information collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result in at least some of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stephen P. Ellner  |author2=John Guckenheimer  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Dynamic Models in Biology |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |pages=289–290 |isbn=978-0-691-12589-3 |chapter=Building dynamic models}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. Therefore, we generally should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human [[workflow]] ones, for example.

==Metrics for division of labor==
With increased data, more elaborate metrics for division of labor within the colony become possible. Gorelick and Bertram survey the applicability of metrics taken from a wide range of other fields. They argue that a single output statistic is desirable, to permit comparisons across different population sizes and different numbers of tasks. But they also argue that the input to the function should be a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation (of time spent by each individual on each task), in order to provide the function with better data. They conclude that "... normalized matrix-input generalizations of [[Shannon index|Shannon's]] and [[Simpson index|Simpson's index]] ... should be the indices of choice when one wants to simultaneously examine division of labor amongst all individuals in a population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Gorelick  |author2=S. M. Bertram  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=Quantifying division of labor: borrowing tools from sociology, sociobiology, information theory, landscape ecology, and biogeography |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=105–112 |doi=10.1007/s00040-007-0923-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Note that these indexes, used as metrics of [[biodiversity]], now find a place measuring division of labor.

In 1971, Ali was head of the Ministry of Information. He visited [[Washington, D.C.]], that year during preparations for planning the [[World Festival of Black Arts and Culture]], to be held in [[Lagos]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Ali was elected in 1979 at the start of the [[Nigerian Second Republic]] on the platform of the [[National Party of Nigeria]] (NPN). His government was active in constructing roads, housing projects and industries, and opened 16 model farms across the state. He initiated and constructed the five-star Zarand Hotel. He created 43 local governments in the state, which were later abolished after the coup of 31 December 1993 that brought in a new military government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Ali attempted to revive the Bauchi Meat Factory, establishing complementary outfits like the Gubi Dairy Farm, Madangala Sheep Ranch, Galambi Cattle Ranch and Gombe and Takko poultry farms. These enterprises, run by civil servants, were generally not profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''''The Secret of the Selenites''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le secret des sélénites'''}}) is a 1984 French animated comedy film directed by [[Jean Image]]. It is also known as '''''Moon Madness''''' in the United States and '''''Moontrek''''' in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planete-jeunesse.com/sources/show_fiche.php3%3Fcle%3D114%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dtranslate%26resnum%3D4%26ct%3Dresult%26prev%3D/search%3Fq%3Dsecret%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bselenites%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG |title=www.planete-jeunesse.com |access-date=2018-11-02 |df= }}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is loosely based on the novel ''[[Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia]]'' (1785) by [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]. [[Baron Munchausen]], the titular protagonist,  is a fictional [[German nobility|German nobleman]]. Raspe based the character on a real-life [[Freiherr]] (Baron), Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–1797). The fictional Baron of the novel is a retired soldier and world traveler, who narrates [[tall tale]]s about his past. In one of his best-known stories, the Baron [[Moon in fiction|travels to the Moon]].{{sfn|Olry|2002|p=54}}

==Plot==
In the year 1787, the astrologer Sirius seeks proof of the existence of the Selenites, a fabled race of [[moon]] dwellers said to possess the talisman of eternal life. He offers his entire fortune to his cousin, the [[Baron Munchausen]], if the Baron journeys to the moon and retrieves the talisman. Accompanying the Baron on this adventure are his friends Nimrod, who can see great distances; Earfull, whose huge ears grant him superhuman hearing; Hurricane, who can exhale great gusts of wind; the fleet-footed Cavallo; and Hercules, who is a strong as [[Hercules|his namesake]]. They board a tall-masted ship, the ''Clair de Lune'', and deliberately sail into a fierce storm. By inflating a trio of hot air balloons and riding a waterspout high into the air, the ship takes flight and leaves Earth.

Arriving at the moon, the ''Clair de Lune'' descends into a [[lunar crater]] where it becomes wedged. The adventurers fall into an underground lake and are attacked by swimming monsters, but are rescued by flying creatures and soon meet the Selenites, who are humanoid but have three legs and crescent-shaped heads that are detached from their bodies. They are given a tour of the Selenite kingdom, which includes many fantastic sights and creatures. The Selenite king informs the Earthlings that their coming was foretold, and that they are prophesied to free the Selenites from their enemies, the small, accordion-headed Green Means, who seek to steal the talisman of life. The Earthlings take part in friendly competitions against the Selenites: Nimrod defeats their [[jousting]] champion, Cavallo—with assistance from Hurricane—beats their fastest runner in a race, and Hercules defeats their wrestling champion.

The Green Means launch an attack from their nearby spacecraft, sending their [[flying saucer]]s to invade the Selenite kingdom. Armed with [[raygun]]s, they overwhelm the Selenite defenders. The Earthlings join the battle, driving back the Green Means, stopping their leader from stealing the talisman, and rescuing the Selenite king and queen. As reward for their heroics, the king presents each of them with a talisman of eternal life, making them immortal. With assistance from the Selenites, they free the ''Clair de Lune'' from the crater and fly the ship back to Earth.

In the year 1997, the Baron, Sirius, and their friends are still alive thanks to their talismans. Surrounded by skyscrapers and flying vehicles, the Baron and Sirius reminisce about their adventures.

'''Wadie Haddad''' ({{lang-ar|وديع حداد}};&amp;nbsp;1927 – 28 March 1978), also known as '''Abu Hani''', was a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] leader of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]'s armed wing. He was responsible for organizing several civilian airplane [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]s in support of the Palestinian cause in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wadie Haddad|url=http://www.sundance.tv/series/carlos/cast/wadie-haddad|website=www.sundance.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Haddad was born to [[Palestinian Christian]] ([[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]) parents in [[Safed]], Palestine, in 1927. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] his family's home was destroyed and his family fled to [[Lebanon]]. He studied medicine at the [[American University of Beirut]], where he met fellow [[Palestinian refugee]], [[George Habash]], who was also a medical student. Together they helped found the [[Arab Nationalist Movement]] (ANM), a [[pan-Arabist]] and [[Arab Socialism|Arab socialist]] group aiming to create the [[State of Palestine]] and unite the Arab countries.

After graduating, he relocated with Habash (a [[pediatrics|pediatrician]]) to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], where they established a clinic. He worked with the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees]] (UNRWA) in 1956, but due to his Palestinian [[nationalist]] activism he was arrested by the Jordanian authorities in 1957. In 1961, he managed to escape to [[Syria]]. Haddad argued for armed struggle against Israel from 1963 onwards, and succeeded in militarizing the ANM.

==Role in PFLP==
After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the Palestinian wing of the ANM transformed into a socialist [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), under the leadership of Habash. Haddad became the leader of the military wing of the group, involved in organizing attacks on Israeli targets. He helped plan the first PFLP [[aircraft hijacking]] in 1968, when an Israeli [[El Al]] plane was hijacked. He argued for and organized hijackings, despite criticism against the PFLP from within the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO).

The [[Dawson's Field hijackings]] of 1970, when PFLP members including [[Leila Khaled]] brought three passenger jets to Jordan, helped provoke the bloody fighting of [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. After the expulsion of the PLO factions from Jordan, Haddad was subjected to harsh criticism from the PFLP, which was in turn under pressure from the rest of the PLO. Haddad was ordered not to attack targets outside of Israel, but he continued operations under the name of [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations]] (PFLP-EO). Haddad was expelled from the organization PFLP in 1973.

He also employed the services of Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, better known as "[[Carlos the Jackal]]", whom he had met in 1970 and trained in guerrilla warfare techniques. Haddad decided to expel Sánchez from his team after he had been accused of refusing to kill two [[hostage]]s, and possibly stealing ransom money, following the [[OPEC siege|1975 assault]] on the [[OPEC]] conference in [[Vienna]]. Haddad organized the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe hijacking]] in June 1976.

==Death==
Haddad died on 28 March 1978, in the [[German Democratic Republic]] supposedly from leukemia. According to the book ''Striking Back'', published by [[Aaron J. Klein]] in 2006, Haddad was eliminated by the [[Mossad]], which had sent the [[chocolate]]-loving Haddad [[Belgian chocolate]]s coated with a slow-acting and undetectable poison which caused him to die several months later.&lt;ref name=smh8may&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel used chocs to poison Palestinian|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Israel-used-chocs-to-poison-Palestinian/2006/05/08/1146940441701.html|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=SMH|date=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 book by [[Ronen Bergman]], Mossad killed Haddad by poisoning his toothpaste.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/mossad-chose-not-to-nab-mengele-didnt-hunt-down-munich-terrorists-book-claims/&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of the PFLP-EO dissolved after his death, but in the process augured the [[15 May Organization]] and the [[PFLP-SC]].

==KGB agent==
According to [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], a senior [[KGB]] archivist who defected to the [[UK]] in 1992, in early 1970 Haddad was recruited by the KGB as an agent, codenamed NATIONALIST. Thereafter, in deep secrecy the Soviets helped to fund and arm the PFLP. The KGB had warning of its major operations and almost certainly sanctioned the most significant, such as the September 1970 hijackings. Haddad remained a highly valued agent till his death in 1978.

A letter by [[Yuri Andropov]] allegedly confirming Haddad's role as an agent was independently discovered in Soviet archives by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] and has since been published.&lt;ref&gt;http://bukovsky-archives.net/pdfs/terr-wd/plo75c.pdf Andropov's letter. January 10, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
