'''Asian philately''', or Far-Eastern philately, is a specialized area of [[philately]] which focuses on the stamps of China, Japan, Hong Kong and neighboring countries. [[Stamp collecting|Stamp collectors]] and [[stamp dealer]]s often specialize in a particular aspect of Asian philately, and many [[Philatelic auction|stamp auction]]s are devoted to this area of interest. Hong Kong is a major center for Asian philately with Chinese collectors and [[Philatelic investment|investors]] some of the biggest buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zurich Asia Hosts a Buoyant Stamp Auction in Hong Kong|author=Liu Yang|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/35769/zurich-asia-hosts-a-buoyant-stamp-auction-in-hong-kong/|newspaper=ARTINFO China|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125369338938433437?mod=slideshow_overlay_mod "Philatelic Fever"] ''Wall Street Journal''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2605">'''Bulgarisation''' (also known as '''Bulgarianisation'''; {{lang-bg|българизация}} or побългаряване) is the spread of Bulgarian culture within various areas in the Balkans.

A number of government policies are considered to be examples of Bulgarisation, including the attempt of the former communist leadership in the 1980s to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] a [[Turks in Bulgaria|Turkish]] minority living in [[Bulgaria]].
==Turks==
During the Communist period of Bulgarian history, the [[Turks in Bulgaria|Turkish minority]] (mainly across Bulgaria's east) of the country were forced to change their names from Turkish or Arabic to Bulgarian in 1984, during [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s rule. Back then, as well as nowadays, the supporters of this policy refer to it as the "[[Revival Process]]", while critics call it "the so-called Vǎzroditelen process". Turkish culture and language as well as Islamic beliefs were also suppressed. The argument was that the Turkish population of Bulgaria were allegedly Bulgarians [[forced to convert to Islam]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]].&lt;ref name="IHRC"&gt;[http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=684 Briefing: Bulgaria’s Muslims: From Communist assimilation to tentative recognition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819122625/http://www.ihrc.org.uk/show.php?id=684# |date=19 August 2006 }}, ''[[Islamic Human Rights Commission]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

This project met forceful resistance in the form of large-scale protests, international pressure and cases of terrorism. After the end of Communist rule, people were free to revert to previous names or adopt the names they wished, Arabic/Turkish or other. Some people continued using both names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/dvoinata-samolichnost-na-feim-petar-chaushev-e-prestaplenie-news137240.html Legal Problems Arising of Using Both the Turkish and Bulgarian Name]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] claimed that religious discrimination remained a major problem, but this has not been noted by other human rights organizations.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:H Hoffmann Struwwel 08.jpg|thumb|275px|Stories about playing with matches do not have [[happy ending]]s.  An illustration from "The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches" from ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffman]], 1858.]]
A '''cautionary tale''' is a tale told in [[folklore]], to warn its listener of a [[Risk|danger]]. There are three essential parts to a cautionary tale, though they can be introduced in a large variety of ways.  First, a [[taboo]] or prohibition is stated: some act, location, or thing is said to be dangerous. Then, the narrative itself is told: someone disregarded the warning and performed the forbidden act. Finally, the violator comes to an unpleasant fate, which is frequently related in expansive and grisly detail.  

==Cautionary tales and conformity==
Cautionary tales are [[ubiquitous]] in [[popular culture]]; many [[urban legend]]s are framed as cautionary tales: from the lover's lane haunted by a hook-handed [[murder]]er to the tale of a man who shot a [[cactus]] for fun only to die when the plant toppled onto him. Like [[horror fiction]], generally the cautionary tale exhibits an ambivalent attitude towards social taboos.  The narrator of a cautionary tale is momentarily excused from the ordinary demands of [[etiquette]] that discourages the use of gruesome or disgusting imagery because the tale serves to reinforce some other social taboo.  

Cautionary tales are also frequently utilised to spread awareness of [[morality|moral]] issues, and for this reason are often told to children to make them conform to rules that either protect them or are for their own safety.

Those whose job it is to enforce [[conformity]] therefore frequently resort to cautionary tales. The [[German language]] anthology, ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', contains tales such as "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches); it is fairly easy to deduce the ending from the title.  [[Social guidance film]]s such as ''[[Boys Beware]]'' or ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' are deliberately patterned after traditional cautionary tales, as were the notorious [[driver's education]] films (''[[Red Asphalt]]'', ''[[Signal 30]]'') of the 1960s, or military films about [[syphilis]] and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  The framework of the cautionary tale became a [[cliché]] in the [[slasher film]]s of the 1980s, in which [[adolescent]]s who had [[sexual intercourse|sex]], drank [[alcoholic beverage]]s, or smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] inevitably ended up as the victims of the [[serial killer]] [[villain]].  

On the other hand, in the adolescent culture of the [[United States]], for more than a hundred years the traditional cautionary tale gave rise to the phenomenon of [[legend tripping]], in which a cautionary tale is turned into the basis of a dare that invites the hearer to test the taboo by breaking it.

==Reactions to cautionary tales==
The genre of the cautionary tale has been satirized by several writers. [[Hilaire Belloc]] in his ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'' presented such moral examples as "Jim, Who ran away from his Nurse, and was eaten by a Lion", and "Matilda, Who told lies, and was Burned to Death". [[Lewis Carroll]], in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', says that Alice:

{{blockquote|"had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they ''would'' not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger ''very'' deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later."}}

In ''[[The Complete Tribune Printer]]'', [[Eugene Field]] gave cautionary tales an ironic inversion, as in ''The Gun:''
{{blockquote|This is a gun. Is the Gun loaded? Really, I do not know. Let us Find out. Put the Gun on the table, and you, Susie, blow down one barrel while you, Charlie, blow down the other. Bang! Yes, it was loaded. Run quick, Jennie, and pick up Susie's head and Charlie's lower Jaw before the Nasty Blood gets over the New carpet.}}

Some films, such as ''[[Gremlins]]'', satirized this framework by imposing very arbitrary rules whose violation results in horrendous consequences for the community by not taking responsibility.

Cautionary tales are sometimes heavily criticized for their ham-fisted approach to [[ethics]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} ''[[The Cold Equations]]'' is a well-known example. In the story, a man has to eject a young woman out of the airlock, otherwise his rocket will not have enough fuel to deliver some badly needed serum, without which everyone at a small outpost would perish. Her death is justified because she ignored a 'no entry' sign, "when the laws of physics say no, they don't mean maybe", and no other solution would reduce the weight of the ship enough to complete the trip safely.

Since the spread of Christianity from the [[Levant]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] during the early [[Roman Empire]], Christendom has been divided in the pre-existing [[Greek East and Latin West]]. Consequently, different versions of the Christian religion arose with their own beliefs and practices, centred around the cities of [[Rome]] ([[Western Christianity]], whose community was called Western or Latin Christendom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chazan |first=Robert |date=2006 |title=The Jews of Medieval Western Christendom: 1000-1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxJQ_98I3R0C |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=xi |isbn=9780521616645 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Constantinople]] ([[Eastern Christianity]], whose community was called Eastern Christendom&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "christendom. §1.3 Scheidingen". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;). From the 11th to 13th centuries, Latin Christendom rose to the central role of the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;Chazan, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its historical sense, the term usually refers to the [[Middle Ages]] and to the [[Early Modern period]] during which the Christian world represented a [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] power that was juxtaposed with both the [[paganism|pagan]] and especially the [[Muslim world]]. In the traditional Roman Catholic sense of the word, it refers to the sum total of nations in which the [[Catholic Church]] is the established religion of the state or to those with ecclesiastical [[concordat]]s with the [[Holy See]].

== Terminology ==
=== Etymology ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
The [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] term ''cristendom'' appears to have been invented in the 9th century by a scribe somewhere in southern England, possibly at the court of king [[Alfred the Great]] of [[Wessex]].

"Christendom" has referred to the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] notion of the ''Christian world'' as a [[sociopolitical]] [[polity]]. In essence, the earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian [[theocracy]], a [[Forms of government|government]] founded upon and upholding [[Christian values]], whose institutions are spread through and over with [[Christian doctrine]]. In this period, members of the Christian [[clergy]] wield [[political authority]]. The specific relationship between the [[political leader]]s and the clergy varied but, in theory, the national and political divisions were at times subsumed under the leadership of the [[Christian Church|church as an institution]]. This [[Church and state in medieval Europe|model of church-state relations]] was accepted by various [[Church hierarchy|Church leader]]s and political leaders in European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Chisholm| first = Hugh| title = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information| url = https://books.google.com/?id=xTcNxHKO59MC&amp;pg=PA700| year = 1911| publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Company| page = 700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The classical heritage flourished throughout the Middle Ages in both the Byzantine Greek East and the Latin West. In the Greek philosopher Plato's ideal state there are three major classes, which was representative of the idea of the “tripartite soul”, which is expressive of three functions or capacities of the human soul: “reason”, “the spirited element”, and “appetites” (or “passions”). [[Will Durant]]  made a convincing case that certain prominent features of Plato's [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal community]] where discernible in the organization, dogma and effectiveness of "the" Medieval Church in Europe:&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book |first=Will |last=Durant |year=2005 |title=Story of Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suLI7RoaBEEC&amp;pg=PA34 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-69500-2 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... For a thousand years Europe was ruled by an order of guardians considerably like that which was visioned by our philosopher. During the Middle Ages it was customary to classify the population of Christendom into laboratores (workers), bellatores (soldiers), and oratores (clergy). The last group, though small in number, monopolized the instruments and opportunities of culture, and ruled with almost unlimited sway half of the most powerful continent on the globe. The clergy, like Plato's guardians, were placed in authority... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and church. In the latter half of the period in which they ruled [800 AD onwards], the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire [for such guardians]... [Clerical] Celibacy was part of the psychological structure of the power of the clergy; for on the one hand they were unimpeded by the narrowing egoism of the family, and on the other their apparent superiority to the call of the flesh added to the awe in which lay sinners held them....''&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt; ''In the latter half of the period in which they ruled, the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire.&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the [[collapse of Charlemagne's empire]], the southern remnants of the Holy Roman Empire became a collection of [[papal states|states loosely connected]] to the [[Holy See|Holy See of Rome]]. Tensions between [[Pope Innocent III]] and secular rulers ran high, as the pontiff exerted control over their temporal counterparts in the west and vice versa. The pontificate of Innocent III is considered the height of temporal power of the papacy. The ''Corpus Christianum'' described the then-current notion of the [[community]] of all [[Christian]]s united under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The community was to be guided by Christian values in its politics, economics and social life.&lt;ref&gt;Shaping a global theological mind By Darren C. Marks.

In the East, Christendom became more defined as the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s gradual loss of territory to an [[Muslim conquests|expanding Islam]] and the [[muslim conquest of Persia]]. This caused Christianity to become important to the Byzantine identity. Before the [[East–West Schism]] which divided the Church religiously, there had been the notion of a ''universal Christendom'' that included the East and the West. After the East–West Schism, hopes of regaining religious unity with the West were ended by the [[Fourth Crusade]], when [[Crusades|Crusaders]] [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|conquered the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] and hastened the [[decline of the Byzantine Empire]] on the [[Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|path to its destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Mango, C.

The [[Catholic Church]]'s peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community — for example, the [[Crusades]], the fight against the [[Moors]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and against the [[Ottomans]] in the [[Balkans]] — helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe's deep political divisions. The popes, formally just the bishops of Rome, claimed to be the focus of all Christendom, which was largely recognised in Western Christendom from the 11th century until the Reformation, but not in Eastern Christendom.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2010), p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this authority was also sometimes abused, and fostered the [[Inquisition]] and [[Anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]], to root out divergent elements and create a religiously uniform community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ultimately, the Inquisition was done away with by order of Pope Innocent III.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christendom ultimately was led into specific crisis in the [[late Middle Ages]], when the [[monarch|kings]] of France managed to establish a French national church during the 14th century and the papacy became ever more aligned with the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. Known as the [[Western Schism]], western Christendom was a split between three men, who were driven by politics rather than any real theological disagreement for simultaneously claiming to be the true pope. The [[Avignon Papacy]] developed a reputation of corruption that estranged major parts of Western Christendom. The Avignon schism was ended by the [[Council of Constance]].&lt;ref&gt;Stump, P. H. (1994). The reforms of the Council of Constance, 1414-1418. Leiden: E.J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the modern period, Christendom was in a general crisis at the time of the [[Renaissance Papacy|Renaissance Popes]] because of the moral laxity of these pontiffs and their willingness to seek and rely on temporal power as secular rulers did.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Many in the Catholic Church's hierarchy in the Renaissance became increasingly entangled with insatiable greed for material wealth and temporal power, which led to many reform movements, some merely wanting a moral reformation of the Church's clergy, while others repudiated the Church and separated from it in order to form new sects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Italian Renaissance]] produced ideas or institutions by which men living in society could be held together in harmony. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (The [[Book of the Courtier]]) laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady, while [[Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "la verità effetuale delle cose" — the actual truth of things — in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, humanist style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Some Protestant movements grew up along lines of [[mysticism]] or [[renaissance humanism]] ([[cf.]] [[Erasmus]]). The Catholic Church fell partly into general neglect under the Renaissance Popes, whose inability to govern the Church by showing personal example of high moral standards set the climate for what would ultimately become the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Modern History. Vol 2: [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=62407231 The Reformation (1903)].&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance the papacy was mainly run by the wealthy families and also had strong secular interests. To safeguard Rome and the connected Papal States the popes became necessarily involved in temporal matters, even leading armies, as the great patron of arts [[Pope Julius II]] did. It during these intermediate times popes strove to make Rome the capital of Christendom while projecting it, through art, architecture, and literature, as the center of a Golden Age of unity, order, and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pape/hd_pape.htm|title = The Papacy during the Renaissance|last = Norris |first =  Michael|date = August 2007|website = The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate= 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Frederick J. McGinness described Rome as essential in understanding the legacy the Church and its representatives encapsulated best by [[Rome|The Eternal City]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;No other city in Europe matches Rome in its traditions, history, legacies, and influence in the Western world. Rome in the Renaissance under the papacy not only acted as guardian and transmitter of these elements stemming from the Roman Empire but also assumed the role as artificer and interpreter of its myths and meanings for the peoples of Europe from the Middle Ages to modern times... Under the patronage of the popes, whose wealth and income were exceeded only by their ambitions, the city became a cultural center for master architects, sculptors, musicians, painters, and artisans of every kind...In its myth and message, Rome had become the sacred city of the popes, the prime symbol of a triumphant Catholicism, the center of orthodox Christianity, a new Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0053.xml|title = Papal Rome|last = McGinness|first =  Frederick|date = 26 August 2011|website = Oxford Bibliographies|accessdate= 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clearly noticeable that the popes of the Italian Renaissance have been subjected by many writers with an overly harsh tone. Pope Julius II for example was not only an effective secular leader in military affairs, a deviously effective politician but foremost one of the [[Art patronage of Julius II|greatest patron of the Renaissance period]] and person who also encouraged open criticism from noted humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://faculty.uml.edu/CulturalStudies/Italian_Renaissance/5.htm|title = Background for Italian Renaissance|last = Cheney|first = Liana|date = 26 August 2011|website = University of Massachusetts Lowell|accessdate= 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blossoming of renaissance humanism was made very much possible due to the universality of the institutions of Catholic Church and represented by personalities such as [[Pope Pius II]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]],  Desiderius Erasmus, sir [[Thomas More]], [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Teresa of Ávila]]. [[George Santayana]] in his work ''[[The Life of Reason]]'' postulated the tenets of the all encompassing order the Church had brought and as the repository of the legacy of [[classical antiquity]]:&lt;ref name="Santayana"&gt;{{cite book |last= Santayana |first= George |year= 1982 |title= The Life of Reason|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15000/15000-h/vol5.html|location=New York |publisher= Dover Publications |accessdate= 10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The enterprise of individuals or of small aristocratic bodies has meantime sown the world which we call civilised with some seeds and nuclei of order. There are scattered about a variety of churches, industries, academies, and governments. But the universal order once dreamt of and nominally almost established, the empire of universal peace, all-permeating rational art, and philosophical worship, is mentioned no more. An unformulated conception, the prerational ethics of private privilege and national unity, fills the background of men's minds. It represents feudal traditions rather than the tendency really involved in contemporary industry, science, or philanthropy. Those dark ages, from which our political practice is derived, had a political theory which we should do well to study; for their theory about a universal empire and a catholic church was in turn the echo of a former age of reason, when a few men conscious of ruling the world had for a moment sought to survey it as a whole and to rule it justly.&lt;ref name="Santayana"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Developments in western philosophy and European events brought change to the notion of the ''Corpus Christianum''. The [[Hundred Years' War]] accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralized state. The rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|strong, centralized monarchies]]&lt;ref&gt;This was presaging the modern [[nation-state]]&lt;/ref&gt; denoted the European transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]]. By the end of the Hundred Years' War, both France and England were able to raise enough money through taxation to create independent standing armies. In the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] took the crown of England. His heir, the [[Absolutism (European history)|absolute]] king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] establishing the [[Church of England|English church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglican.org/church/ChurchHistory.html The Anglican Domain: Church History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[modern history]], [[the Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed a change in the ''Corpus Christianum''. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555 officially ended the idea among secular leaders that all Christians must be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian hegemony in the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, despite the Catholic Church's doctrine that it alone is the one true Church founded by Christ.
Subsequently, each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established one were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The [[European wars of religion]] are usually taken to have ended with the Treaty of Westphalia (1648),&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{aut|Uwe Becker}}, [https://books.google.nl/books?id=hKqN5FPL6-cC&amp;pg=PA54 ''Europese democratieën: vrijheid, gelijkheid, solidariteit en soevereiniteit in praktijk'']&lt;/ref&gt; or arguably, including the [[Nine Years' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in this period, with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In the 18th century, the focus shifts away from religious conflicts, either between Christian factions or against the external threat of Islamic factions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== End of Christendom ===
The [[European Miracle]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the formation of the great [[colonial empire]]s together with the beginning [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] mark the end of the geopolitical "history of Christendom".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Instead, the focus of Western history shifts to the development of the [[nation-state]], accompanied by increasing [[History of atheism|atheism]] and [[secularism]], culminating with the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Writing in 1997, Canadian theology professor [[Douglas John Hall]] argued that Christendom had either fallen already or was in its death throes; although its end was gradual and not as clear to pin down as its 4th-century establishment, the "transition to the post-Constantinian, or post-Christendom, situation (...) has already been in process for a century or two," beginning with the 18th-century rationalist Enlightenment and the French Revolution (the first attempt to topple the Christian establishment).&lt;ref name="1–9Hall"/&gt; American Catholic bishop [[Thomas John Curry]] stated (2001) that the end of Christendom came about because modern governments refused to "uphold the teachings, customs, ethos, and practice of Christianity."&lt;ref name="Curry12"/&gt; He argued the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1791) and the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s [[Dignitatis humanae|Declaration on Religious Freedom]] (1965) are two of the most important documents setting the stage for its end.&lt;ref name="Curry12"/&gt; According to British historian Diarmaid MacCulloch (2010), Christendom was 'killed' by the [[First World War]] (1914–18), which led to the fall of the three main Christian empires ([[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]]) of Europe, as well as the Ottoman Empire, rupturing the Eastern Christian communities that had existed on its territory. The Christian empires were replaced by secular, even anti-clerical republics seeking to definitively keep the churches out of politics. The only surviving monarchy with an established church, Britain, was severely damaged by the war, lost [[Irish Free State|most of Ireland]] due to Catholic–Protestant infighting, and was starting to lose grip on its colonies.&lt;ref name="MacCulloch1024"&gt;MacCulloch (2010), p. 1024–1030.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical culture==
{{Further|Middle Ages|Renaissance|Theological aesthetics|Role of the Catholic Church in Western civilization|Christian culture}}
[[File:Wien - Stephansdom (1).JPG|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]].]]
[[Western culture]], throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as [[cultural Christian]]s. The notion of "[[Europe]]" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "Christianity and Christendom"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref name="Dawson 1961 108"/&gt; Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire]]s, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=The Age of Enlightenment|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|first2=Glenn |last2=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into [[Christian philosophy]], [[Christian art]], [[Christian music]], [[Christian literature]] etc. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss.

===Art and literature===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
====Writings and poetry====
{{Main|Christian literature|Christian poetry}}
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any [[poetry]] that contains [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the [[Bible]], while others provide [[allegory]].

====Supplemental arts====
{{Main|Christian art}}
[[Christian art]] is art produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity. Virtually all Christian groupings use or have used art to some extent. The prominence of art and the media, style, and representations change; however, the unifying theme is ultimately the representation of the life and times of [[Jesus]] and in some cases the [[Old Testament]]. Depictions of saints are also common, especially in [[Anglicanism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

====Illumination====
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|Picture of [[Christ in Majesty]] contained in an illuminated manuscript.]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

====Iconography====
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}
[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], [[Bulgaria]]).]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Eastern Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. [[Christianity]] has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]]. They were particularly

====Architecture====
{{Main|Church architecture}}

[[File:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|The structure of a typical Gothic cathedral.]]
[[Christian architecture]] encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Christianity to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in Christian culture.

Buildings were at first adapted from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as concrete, as well as simpler styles has had its effect upon the design of churches and arguably the flow of influence has been reversed. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant period of transformation for Christian architecture in the west was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedral]]. In the east, [[Byzantine architecture]] was a continuation of [[Roman architecture]].

=== Philosophy ===
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}

[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of [[philosophy]] with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval [[university|universities]] c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|[[Science]], and particularly [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], was linked directly to the divine for most medieval scholars. Since these Christians believed God imbued the universe with regular geometric and harmonic principles, to seek these principles was therefore to seek and worship God.]]

=== Medieval conditions ===
{{Main|Medieval science|Medieval technology|List of Christian thinkers in science}}
The [[Byzantine Empire]], which was the most sophisticated culture during antiquity, suffered under [[Muslim conquests]] limiting its scientific prowess during the Medieval period. Christian [[Western Europe]] had suffered a catastrophic loss of knowledge following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. But thanks to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] scholars such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Buridan]], the West carried on at least the spirit of scientific inquiry which would later lead to Europe's taking the lead in science during the [[Scientific Revolution]] using [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations of medieval works]].

[[Medieval technology]] refers to the technology used in medieval Europe under Christian rule. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250–1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]] and the [[astrolabe]], the invention of [[spectacles]], and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques, [[agriculture]] in general, [[clock]]s, and [[ship]]s. The latter advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Exploration]]. The development of water mills was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone, probably derived from [[Roman technology]]. By the time of the [[Domesday Book]], most large villages in [[Great Britain|Britain]] had mills. They also were widely used in [[mining]], as described by [[Georg Agricola]] in [[De Re Metallica]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

Significant in this respect were advances within the fields of [[navigation]]. The [[compass]] and [[astrolabe]] along with advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the [[Ocean|World Oceans]] and thus domination of the worlds economic trade. [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s [[printing press]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience.

===Renaissance innovations===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}
During the [[Renaissance]], great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, math, manufacturing, and engineering. The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the Fall of Constantinople, and the invention of [[printing]] which would democratize learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. ''[[Renaissance technology]]'' is the set of artifacts and customs, spanning roughly the 14th through the 16th century. The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspectivity]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Draw-books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement. The ''Scientific Renaissance'' was the early phase of the Scientific Revolution. In the two-phase model of [[early modern]] science: a ''Scientific Renaissance'' of the 15th and 16th centuries, focused on the restoration of the natural knowledge of the ancients; and a ''Scientific Revolution'' of the 17th century, when scientists shifted from recovery to innovation.

===Notable Christian organizations===
A [[religious order]] is a lineage of communities and organizations of people who live in some way set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion, usually characterized by the principles of its founder's religious practice. In contrast, the term [[Holy Orders]] is used by many Christian churches to refer to ordination or to a group of individuals who are set apart for a special role or ministry. Historically, the word "order" designated an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ordinatio meant legal incorporation into an ordo. The word "holy" refers to the Church. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry in the Church. Religious orders are composed of initiates (laity) and, in some traditions, ordained clergies.

Various organizations include:
* In the Roman Catholic Church, [[religious institute]]s and [[secular institute]]s are the major forms of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]], similar to which are [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]]. They are organisations of laity and/or clergy who live a common life under the guidance of a fixed rule and the leadership of a superior. (ed., see [[:Category:Catholic orders and societies]] for a particular listing.)
* [[Anglican religious order]]s are communities of laity and/or clergy in the Anglican churches who live under a common rule of life. (ed., see [[:Category:Anglican organizations]] for a particular listing)

==Christianity law and ethics==

===Church and state framing===
{{Main|Canon law|Christian ethics}}
Within the framework of Christianity, there are at least three possible definitions for Church law. One is the Torah/Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the [[Old Testament]]) also called [[Divine Law]] or [[Biblical law]]. Another is the instructions of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] in the [[Gospel]] (sometimes referred to as [[the Law of Christ]] or the [[New Commandment]] or the [[New Covenant]]). A third is [[canon law]] which is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]] of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Canon law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]] (From Greek ''kanon'' / κανών, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

[[Christian ethics]] in general has tended to stress the need for [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of human weakness and developed while [[Early Christians]] were subjects of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the time Nero blamed Christians for setting Rome ablaze (64 AD) until Galarius (311 AD), persecutions against Christians erupted periodically. Consequently, Early Christian ethics included discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire.

Under the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] (312-337), Christianity became a legal religion. While some scholars debate whether Constantine's conversion to Christianity was authentic or simply matter of political expediency, [[Edict of Milan|Constantine's decree]] made the empire safe for Christian practice and belief. Consequently, issues of Christian doctrine, ethics and church practice were debated openly, see for example the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]]. By the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395), Christianity had become the [[state religion]] of the empire. With Christianity in power, ethical concerns broaden and included discussions of the proper role of the state.

[[Render unto Caesar…]] is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the [[synoptic gospel]]s which reads in full, "''Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s''". This phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity and secular authority. The gospels say that when Jesus gave his response, his interrogators "marvelled, and left him, and went their way." Time has not resolved an ambiguity in this phrase, and people continue to interpret this passage to support various positions that are poles apart. The traditional division, carefully determined, in Christian thought is the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[Christian Church|church]] have separate [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] thoroughly discussed that ''human law'' is [[positive law]] which means that it is [[natural law]] applied by governments to societies. All human laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law was in a sense no law at all. At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what the law said in the first place. This could result in some tension.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, "Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Late ecclesiastical writers followed in his footsteps.

====Democratic ideology====
{{Main|Christian democracy}}
[[Christian democracy]] is a political ideology that seeks to apply Christian principles to public policy. It emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]. In a number of countries, the democracy's Christian ethos has been diluted by [[secularisation]]. In practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[social conservatism|conservative]] on cultural, social and moral issues and [[progressivism|progressive]] on fiscal and economic issues. In places, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist [[socialism|socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], Christian democratic parties are moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], whereas in other cultural and political environments they can lean to the left.

===Women's roles===
{{Main|Women in Christianity}}
Attitudes and beliefs about the roles and responsibilities of [[women in Christianity]] vary considerably today as they have throughout the last two millennia — evolving along with or counter to the societies in which Christians have lived. The Bible and Christianity historically have been interpreted as excluding women from church leadership and placing them in submissive roles in marriage. Male leadership has been assumed in the church and within marriage, society and government.&lt;ref name="Blevins"&gt;Blevins, Carolyn DeArmond, ''Women in Christian History: A Bibliography.'' Macon, Georgia: Mercer Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-86554-493-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary writers describe the role of women in the life of the church as having been downplayed, overlooked, or denied throughout much of Christian history. [[Paradigm shift]]s in gender roles in society and also many churches has inspired reevaluation by many Christians of some long-held attitudes to the contrary. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarians]] have increasingly argued for equal roles for men and women in [[Christian views of marriage|marriage]], as well as for the [[ordination of women]] to the [[clergy]]. Contemporary conservatives meanwhile have reasserted what has been termed a "[[Complementarianism|complementarian]]" position, promoting the traditional belief that the [[Bible]] ordains different roles and responsibilities for women and men in the Church and family.

The different width of the lines (thickest for "Protestantism" and thinnest for "Oriental Orthodox" and "Nestorians") is without objective significance.

Both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches would consider themselves in unbroken continuity with the "early Christianity" line.]]
|-
|[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|Major branches and movements within Protestantism]]
|}
A [[Christian denomination]] is a distinct [[religion|religious]] body within [[Christianity]], identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Worldwide, Christians are divided, often along ethnic and linguistic lines, into separate churches and traditions. Technically, divisions between one group and another are defined by [[Ecclesiology|church doctrine]] and [[church authority]]. Centering on language of ''professed Christianity'' and ''true Christianity'', issues that separate one group of followers of [[Jesus]] from another include:
* [[Apostolic succession]],
* [[Biblical authority]],
* [[Biblical criticism]],
* [[Biblical inerrancy]],
* [[Biblical infallibility]],
* [[Biblical inspiration]],
* [[Biblical interpretation]],
* [[Papal primacy]], and
* [[christian views of Jesus|Views of Jesus]] ([[Christology]]).

Christianity is composed of, but not limited to, five major branches of Churches: [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox]]y, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Protestantism]]. Some listings include Anglicans among Protestants while others list the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox together as one group, thus the number of distinct major branches can vary between three and five depending on the listing. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (Nestorians) and the Old Catholic churches are also distinct Christian bodies of historic importance, but much smaller in adherents and geographic scope. Each of the branches has important subdivisions. Because the Protestant subdivisions do not maintain a common theology or earthly leadership, they are far more distinct than the subdivisions of the other four groupings. ''Denomination'' typically refers to one of the many Christian groupings including each of the multitude of Protestant subdivisions.

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard.

'''The Copenhagen Opera House''' (in [[Danish language|Danish]] usually called '''Operaen''', literally ''The opera'') is the national opera house of [[Denmark]], and among the most modern [[opera house]]s in the world. It is also one of the most expensive opera houses ever built with construction costs well over [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ing.dk/artikel/71630| title=Nordmændenes kompromisløse opera| work=[[Ingeniøren]]| date=2 June 2006| last=Hansen| first=Søren Bjørn|trans-title=Norwegians uncompromising opera| accessdate=2015-08-18| language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the island of [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]] in central [[Copenhagen]].

== History ==
The [[A.P. Møller and Chastine Mc-Kinney Møller Foundation]] donated the Opera House to the Danish state in August 2000 ([[Arnold Peter Møller|A.P. Møller]] was a co-founder of the company now known as [[Mærsk]]). Some [[politician]]s were offended by the private donation, in part because the full cost of the project would be tax deductible, thus virtually forcing the government to buy the building; but the [[Folketing]] and the [[government]] accepted it in the [[autumn]] of 2000.  Architect [[Henning Larsen]] and engineers [[Ramboll]] and [[Buro Happold]] and Theatre Consultant [[Theatreplan]] designed the facility. The acoustics were designed by Arup Acoustics and [[Speirs and Major Associates]] designed the architectural lighting.  A.P. Møller had the final say in the design of the building, however, adding steel to the glass front, among other things. Construction began in June 2001 and was completed on October 1, 2004. It opened on January 15, 2005, in the presence of [[Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller]], Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], and Queen [[Margrethe II]].

The [[tenor]] [[Plácido Domingo]] made a gala guest appearance as [[Sigmund]] in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Die Walküre]]'' on April 7, 2006, in a production by [[Kasper Bech Holten]]) and attended by The Queen.

The Denmark leg of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series takes place here.

== Location ==
[[Image:Copenhagen Opera side 1.jpg|thumb|The Opera House looking north. [[Amalienborg]] and the dome of [[The Marble Church]] are visible in the background.]]

The Opera is located in [[Copenhagen]] just opposite the main castle [[Amalienborg]] at the shore of the harbour. The opera house is built in alignment with Amalienborg and [[The Marble Church]], so that if one stands in the main entrance of the Opera, one can see the Marble Church over the water along the road through Amalienborg.

The specific part of the island where the Opera was built is named Dokøen, which means the ''Dock Island''. Just a few meters west of the opera, one can still see an old dock and a pumping station.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Copenhagen Opera House - front view.jpg|thumb|The front façade]]
The house is administered by the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] and is one of the best-equipped in the world.  It has a main stage with five other stages directly connected, where large setups can be moved easily in and out.

The theatre can seat between 1492 and 1703, depending on the size of the orchestra. The 1492 seats are all individually angled in order to provide the best experience.

The orchestra pit is one of the largest in any opera house, with room for 110 musicians; the structure provides excellent sound quality for the orchestra. If the pit is filled, some musicians are located just below the front of the stage, which has become controversial among some members of the orchestra (according to tour guides in 2005), because this increases the sound levels, beyond those acceptable in Denmark. However, the overhang is very slight and the authorities have permitted this to happen.

During construction of the theatre, some acoustic tests were carried out with the [[safety curtain|fire curtain]] in place while technical work was carried out on stage, but great consideration was given to balance between pit and stage.  If the orchestra is small or absent, the pit can be covered and additional seats can be added to the auditorium.
[[File:Copenhagen Opera House - entrance.jpg|thumb|Opera House entrance]]

Just like the old [[Royal Danish Theatre]] in Copenhagen, The Queen has her own box on the left side of the auditorium, closest to the stage. According to the tour guide{{who|date=August 2015}}, she decided that she preferred this arrangement rather than the more conventional central placement because she loves to be close to the stage to see the artists preparing in the wings before entering the stage.

The foyer has been designed for comfort, based on behavioural research on operagoers maximizing the wall area for standing against, while still providing views across the entire foyer and one of the best views on Copenhagen.

Guided tours cover most of the building, including both the auditorium and backstage areas.

== Takkelloftet ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Besides the main stage, the building also includes a small stage for experimental theatre, a so-called "black box" theatre called '''Takkelloftet'''. It was named after the original ''Takkelloftet'', a building just south of the Opera 280 meters long and built between 1767 and 1772 for storing ropes for the navy. Thus the opera maintains a connection to the marine history of its location.

Everything on the stage and in the audience area is totally black, and the audience seats can easily be removed in order to make the room much easier to configure for alternative setups. There are up to approximately 200 seats for this stage.

Takkelloftet has its own foyer. In this room, some of the walls are decorated using the same Jura Gelb limestone as outdoor. These stones are mounted on the wall in a way that makes it possible to use the stone plates as a kind of music instrument just by knocking on them with bare hands.

== Backstage ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The Opera has 6 main stages: 1 visible for the audience, and 5 for rehearsals and set preparation. It has almost everything needed for opera, ballet etc., including stage elevators, movable balletfloors, etc. The building totals 41,000 m² and has 14 floors, of which 5 are below ground. It contains more than 1000 rooms, including a large [[orchestra]]l rehearsal room. Despite its luxurious equipment, there are only approximately 1500 seats because a larger number of seats would hamper the quality of sound.

Unlike the old opera in Copenhagen, the artists are allowed to take the elevator from their dressing room to the stage, because of their reliability. However, the dressing rooms are farther from the stage, making it almost impossible to return for quick costume changes.  Designers did not account for this, but stagehands have solved this problem by constructing temporary dressing rooms near the main stage for quick changes of clothes or makeup.

The building makes it possible to go outside on the top floor, but it is only possible to walk comfortably at the south side of the building (opposite to the entrance). The employee canteen is located in this area, isolated from public view.

== Architecture, art and decoration ==
[[Image:Copenhagen new operahouse interior.jpg|thumb|upright|The foyer]]
The building was designed by architect [[Henning Larsen]] in close and often problematic collaboration with [[Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller]]. Mærsk wanted the building to have several features in its design: it would not become obsolete in function and appearance due to any fiscal compromise. He personally tested seats and materials, he visited many places in the world to see how opera buildings were constructed and how the building materials were looking after having been exposed over time to weather. Henning Larsen, on the other hand, was trying to make sure that the original architectural ideas were carried through the construction process, especially concerning the large glass surface front, which became a matter of great controversy and subsequent compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Henning| last=Larsen| title=De skal sige tak! Kulturhistorisk testamente om Operaen|trans-title=You ought to be thankful! A historical document about the Opera| publisher=People's Press| date=27 November 2009| isbn=978-87-7055-783-2| language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building exterior is faced with [[Jura Gelb]] [[limestone]] and situated on ground that is surrounded by [[canal]]s that are designed to give the impression the structure is on an island. The bridges constructed to access the building were made from [[oak]] trees originally planted in the 19th century for use in replacing the national [[Naval fleet|fleet]] that was lost with the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|bombardment of Copenhagen]] in September 1807. The front of the building was originally designed with large glazing panels in order to see the shell of the auditorium from the harbor side. However, Mærsk emphasized that glass does not age well, so the façade was changed to a metal grid.

The [[foyer]] floor is [[Sicily|Sicilian]] Perlatino [[marble]]. The central foyer holds three spherical chandeliers created by the [[Iceland]]ic artist [[Olafur Eliasson]]. Each chandelier consists of several pieces of glass, which are semipermeable allowing some light to pass, and some to reflect.  The patterns change when viewed from different angles. [[Per Arnoldi]] designed the logo for the opera, visible in the marble floor just inside the entrance, and [[Per Kirkeby]] created four bronze reliefs for the wall to the auditorium, just below the maple wood part. Per Arnoldi also designed the [[Front curtain]] for the main stage, made of multiple color threads creating a three-dimensional effect, that does not reproduce well in photographs.

The rear wall of the foyer and [[balcony]] faces are [[maple]]. The architects' original intention was to make the wood look like that from an old violin.  However using the same technique would have been far too expensive. Instead, they have tried to imitate the color using more traditional staining techniques, and the result is very close (the official homepage says differently, but the guides in the Opera tell this story). Due to the orange color and its form, it is suitably known by locals as the ''pumpkin''.

The auditorium [[ceiling]] is gilded with about 105,000 sheets of almost pure [[Carat (purity)|carat (100%)]] [[gold]] leaf; 24 carat (100%) would not stay applied sufficiently.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The floor in the main auditorium is [[smoked oak]]. The balcony faces have been designed with openings in a special pattern to improve sound quality, and [[LED]]-based lighting that can be illuminated in a variety of patterns.

== Transport ==
[[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#903|Route 903]] of the [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses]] shuttles between [[Nyhavn]] and the Opera from 7-23 from Monday-Friday and from 10-23 on weekends. The opera is also served by Harbour Buses [[Copenhagen Harbour Buses#901 &amp; 902|Routes 901 &amp; 902]], connecting it to various other points along the harbourfront.  Route 66 connects the Opera House to the [[Copenhagen Central Station|Central Station]]. As of 2015, the end station of bus 9A is Operaen as well.

A '''crematory''' (also known as a '''crematorium''', '''cremator''' or '''retort''') is a machine in which bodies are burned down to the bones, eliminating all soft tissue. Crematories are usually found in funeral homes, [[chapel]]s, [[cemeteries]], veterinary hospitals, or in stand-alone facilities.

==History==
Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], any [[cremation]] which took place was on an outdoor, open pyre. With firewood, and to a lesser extent, coal being the only available fuel options and the low energy efficiency inherent in such a configuration, it is no surprise that cremation enjoyed minimal popularity in densely populated areas up until furnace technology developed during the Industrial Revolution could be applied to cremation to make it more practical in an urbanizing world.

===The first modern crematory===
[[File:Siemensmartin12nb.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] regenerative furnace made cremation a technical possibility]]
The organized movement to instate cremation as a viable method for body disposal began in the 1870s. In 1869 the idea was presented to the Medical International Congress of Florence by Professors Coletti and Castiglioni "in the name of public health and civilization". In 1873, Professor [[Paolo Gorini]] of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] and Professor Lodovico Brunetti of [[Padua]] published reports or practical work they had conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2kPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA150 |title=A Quartercentury of Cremation in North America |first=John Storer |last=Cobb |publisher=Knight and Millet |year=1901 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lodovico-brunetti_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ "Brunetti, Lodovico"] by Giovanni Cagnetto, ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]'' (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; A model of Brunetti's cremating apparatus, together with the resulting ashes, was exhibited at the [[Vienna Exposition]] in 1873 and attracted great attention, including that of [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet]], a surgeon and [[Physician to the Queen]] [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], who returned home to become the first and chief promoter of cremation in England.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#introduction|title= Introduction|work= Internet |publisher= The Cremation Society of Great Britain|accessdate=2 December 2010

Meanwhile, Sir [[Charles William Siemens]] had developed his [[open hearth furnace|regenerative furnace]] in the 1850s. His furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in [[Dresden]]. The radical politician, Sir [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]], took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMOuJm345vsC|title=Between Mass Death And Individual Loss: The Place of the Dead in Twentieth-Century Germany|author1=Alon Confino |author2=Paul Betts |author3=Dirk Schumann |year=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Henry Thompson's main reason for supporting cremation was that "it was becoming a necessary sanitary precaution against the propagation of disease among a population daily growing larger in relation to the area it occupied". In addition, he believed, cremation would prevent premature burial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first duty of the Cremation Society was to ascertain whether cremation could be legally performed in the country, and then to construct a first crematorium.&lt;ref name=introduction /&gt; In 1878, a piece of land in [[Woking]] on which the crematorium was to be established was bought by Sir Henry Thompson.&lt;ref name=Directorys&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remembranceonline.co.uk/mtree/burial-and-cremation/crematoria/woking-crematorium|title= Woking Crematorium |work= Internet |publisher= remembranceonline |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Gorini was invited to visit Woking and supervise the erection of [[Woking Crematorium|his cremation apparatus there]].

Pickersgill]], a well-known figure in literary and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/this_day_in_history/this_day_March_26.php| author = The History Channel| title = 26 March – This day in history| accessdate = 2007-02-20| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230204229/http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/this_day_in_history/this_day_March_26.php| archivedate = 30 December 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the year, the Cremation Society of Great Britain had overseen two more cremations, a total of 3 out of 597,357 deaths in the UK that year.&lt;ref name="Directorys"/&gt; In 1886 ten bodies were cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]]. During 1888, in which 28 cremations took place, the Cremation Society planned to provide a chapel, waiting rooms and other amenities there. In 1892 a crematorium opened in [[Manchester]], followed by one in [[Glasgow]] in 1895, [[Liverpool]] in 1896 and [[Birmingham Crematorium]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc/History/HistSocy.html#legal|title=srgw.demon.co.uk|website=www.srgw.demon.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crematoria in Europe were built in 1878 in the town of [[Gotha]] in Germany and later in [[Heidelberg]] in 1891. The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by [[Francis Julius LeMoyne]] after hearing about its use in Europe. During that time it was thought that people were getting sick by attending funerals of those recently deceased and that decomposing bodies were leaking into the water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The LeMoyne Crematory |url=http://www.acremation.com/First_Crematory_Built_in_the_United_States |accessdate=2014-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= An Unceremonious Rite; Cremation of Mrs. Ben Pitman |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1878/02/16/80675922.pdf |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher= |date= 1879-02-16|accessdate=7 March 2009 | format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; LeMoyne built the crematory to cremate bodies in a controlled environment primarily for sanitary reasons. Cremation was used to destroy any organic matter that could cause illness and give families a better way to preserve ashes. Before LeMoyne’s crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations.&lt;ref name="Sanburn, Josh 2013"&gt;Sanburn, Josh. "The New American Way Of Death." Time 181.24 (2013): 30. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the various Protestant churches came to accept cremation, with the rationale being, "God can resurrect a bowl of ashes just as conveniently as he can resurrect a bowl of dust." The 1908 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' was critical about these efforts, referring to them as a "sinister movement" and associating them with [[Freemasonry]], although it said that "there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia| title = Cremation| publisher = The Encyclopedia Press| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04481c.htm| quote = In conclusion, it must be remembered that there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation, and that, if ever the leaders of this sinister movement so far control the governments of the world as to make this custom universal, it would not be a lapse in the faith confided to her were she obliged to conform.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1963, [[Pope Paul VI]] lifted the ban on cremation,&lt;ref name="kohmescher"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kohmescher| first = Matthew F.| title = Catholicism Today: A Survey of Catholic Belief and Practice| year = 1999| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 0-8091-3873-5| pages = 178–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies.

In the U.S. only about one crematory per year was built in the late 19th century. As embalming became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge. To not be left behind, crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful. They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls. By 2008, the cremation rate was 36.2% and was growing about 1 percentage point a year, according to CANA. CANA is the largest organization representing crematories and funeral homes in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref name="Sanburn, Josh 2013"/&gt;

Australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies. Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the [[West Terrace Cemetery]] in the South Australian capital of [[Adelaide]] in 1901. This small building, resembling the buildings at Woking, remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s. The oldest operating crematorium in Australia is at [[Rookwood Cemetery]], in Sydney. It opened in 1925.

In the [[Netherlands]], the foundation of the Association for Optional Cremation&lt;ref&gt;Dutch, ''Vereniging voor Facultatieve Lijkverbranding''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation. Laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 (two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the Netherlands), though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Groenendijk| first = Paul|author2=Vollaard, Piet| title = Architectuurgids Nederland| year = 2006| publisher = 010 Publishers| isbn = 90-6450-573-X| pages = 213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While open outdoor pyres were used in the past and are often still used in many areas of the world today, notably India, most cremation in industrialized nations takes place within enclosed furnaces designed to maximize utilization of the thermal energy consumed while minimizing the emission of smoke and odors.

===Thermodynamics===

A human body usually contains a negative caloric value, meaning that energy is ''required'' to combust it. This is a result of the high water content; all water must be [[Latent heat|vaporized]] which requires a very large amount of thermal energy.

A 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lbs) body which contains 65% water will require 100 MJ of thermal energy before any combustion will take place. 100 MJ
is approximately equivalent to 32 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (105&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of natural gas, or 3 liters of [[fuel oil]] (0.8 US gallons). Additional energy is necessary to make up for the [[heat capacity]] ("preheating") of the furnace, fuel burned for emissions control, and heat losses through the insulation and in the flue gases.

As a result, crematories are most often heated by burners fueled by natural gas. [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] (propane/butane) or fuel oil may be used where natural gas is not available. These burners can range in power from 150&amp;nbsp;kW (0.5 MMBTU/h) to over 400&amp;nbsp;kW (1.5 MMBTU/h).

Crematories heated by electricity also exist in India, where electric heating elements bring about cremation without the direct application of flame to the body.

Coal, coke, and wood were used in the past, heating the chambers from below (like a cooking pot). This resulted in an indirect heat and prevented mixing of ash from the fuel with ash from the body. The term ''[[retort]]'' when applied to cremation furnaces originally referred to this design.

There has been interest, mainly in developing nations, to develop a crematory heated by [[Concentrated solar power|concentrated solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solare-bruecke.org/infoartikel/Papers_%20from_SCI_Conference_2006/22_wolfgang_scheffler.pdf|title=Development of a Solar Crematorium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another new design starting to find use in India, where wood is traditionally used for cremation, is a crematory based around a wood gas fired process. Due to the manner in which the wood gas is produced, such crematories use only a fraction of the required wood; and according to multiple sources, have far less impact on the environment than traditional natural gas or fuel oil processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gasifiers.co.in/gasifier-based-crematorium.htm|title=Gasifier Based Crematorium,Wood Gasifier Based Crematorium,Biomass Gasifier Crematorium Exporters|author=|date=|website=www.gasifiers.co.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion system===

A typical unit contains a primary and secondary combustion chamber. These chambers are lined with a [[refractory]] brick designed to withstand the high temperatures.

The primary chamber contains the body – one at a time usually contained in some type of combustible casket or container. This chamber has at least one burner to provide the heat which vaporizes the water content of the body and aids in combustion of the organic portion. A large door exists to load the body container. Temperature in the primary chamber is typically between 760 and 1150 [[Celsius|°C]] (1400 to 2100 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]). Higher temperatures speed cremation but consume more energy, generate more [[nitric oxide]], and accelerate [[wikt:spall|spalling]] of the furnace's refractory lining.

The secondary chamber may be at the rear or above the primary chamber. A secondary burner(s) fires into this chamber, oxidizing any organic material which passes from the primary chamber. This acts as a method of pollution control to eliminate the emission of odors and smoke. The secondary chamber typically operates at a temperature greater than 900&amp;nbsp;°C (1650&amp;nbsp;°F).

===Air pollution control and energy recovery===

The flue gases from the secondary chamber are usually vented to the atmosphere through a refractory-lined flue. They are at a very high temperature, and interest in recovering this thermal energy e.g. for space heating of the funeral chapel, or other facilities or for distribution into local [[district heating]] networks has arisen in recent years. Such heat recovery efforts have been viewed in both a positive and negative light by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/environment/new-life-for-crematories-waste-heat-31501/|title=New Life for Crematories’ Waste Heat|last=Nobel|first=Justin|date=24 May 2011|publisher=Miller-McCune|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829145954/http://www.miller-mccune.com/environment/new-life-for-crematories-waste-heat-31501/|archivedate=29 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, filtration systems ([[Dust collector|baghouses]]) are being applied to crematories in many countries. [[Activated carbon]] adsorption is being considered for [[mercury (element)|mercury]] abatement (as a result of [[dental amalgam]]). Much of this technology is borrowed from the waste incineration industry on a scaled-down basis. With the rise in the use of cremation in Western nations where amalgam has been used liberally in dental restorations, mercury has been a growing concern.

===Automation===

The application of computer control has allowed the crematory to be more automated, in that temperature and oxygen sensors within the unit along with pre-programmed algorithms based upon the weight of the deceased allow the unit to operate with less user intervention. Such computer systems may also streamline recordkeeping requirements for tracking, environmental, and maintenance purposes.

===Additional aspects===

The time to carry out a cremation can vary from 70 minutes to 210 minutes. Crematories used to run on timers (some still do) and one would have to determine the weight of the body therefore calculating how long the body has to be cremated for and set the timers accordingly. Other types of crematories merely have a start and a stop function for the cremation displayed on the user interface. The end of the cremation must be judged by the operator who in turn stops the cremation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cremationprocess.co.uk/cremation_process.html Cremationprocess.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725153407/http://www.cremationprocess.co.uk/cremation_process.html |date=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everlifememorials.com/v/urns/cremation-process.htm|title=Ashes to Ashes: The Cremation Process Explained|website=www.everlifememorials.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cultural impact of the [[Falklands War]]''' spanned several media in both Britain and [[Argentina]]. A number of films and television productions emerged from the conflict.  The first Argentine film about the war was ''Los chicos de la guerra'' (''The Boys of the War'') in 1984. The BBC drama ''[[Tumbledown]]'' (1988)  told the story of a British officer who got paralysed due to a bullet wound. The computer game ''[[Harrier Attack]]'' (1983) and the naval strategy game ''[[Strike Fleet]]'' (1987) are two examples of Falklands-related games. A number of fictional works were set during the Falklands War, including in [[Stephen King]]'s novella ''[[The Langoliers]]'' (1990), in which the character Nick Hopewell is a Falklands veteran. The war provided a wealth of material for non-fiction writers; in the United Kingdom (UK) an important account became [[Max Hastings]] and [[Simon Jenkins]]' ''The Battle for the Falklands''.

The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a short poem, called ''Juan López y John Ward'' (1985), about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to "islands that were too famous". Another Argentine example is "Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic" by Salvador Oria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/background/argentine82.html|title=Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic|author=Oria,  Salvador|website=Falklands.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108210317/http://www.falklands.info/background/argentine82.html|archivedate=8 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music referencing the war includes songs by [[Captain Sensible]], the Argentine punk-rock band [[Los Violadores]]' song "Comunicado #166", and British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]]'s song called "Como Estais Amigos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Paterson|first1 = Lawrence|title = Blaze Bayley: At the End of the Day|publisher = Blaze Bayley Recordings Ltd.|year = 2009|page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simon Weston cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Simon Weston]], British war veteran.]]

A number of films and television productions emerged from the conflict. Notable examples include:

*[[Simon Weston]], a [[Welsh Guards]]man who had suffered serious burns during the bombing of ''Sir Galahad'', became a popular figure due to British media coverage. A series of television documentaries followed the progress of rehabilitation and eventual recovery from his injuries, the first being ''[[Simon's War]]'' (6 April 1983) in [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|QED]]'' series.
*The 1983 British film ''[[The Ploughman's Lunch]]'' is set in the media and political world at the time of the war, which it compares to the 1956 [[Suez War]]. 
*The first Argentine film about the war was ''Los chicos de la guerra'' (''The Boys of the War''), directed by Bebe Kamin in 1984.
*The film version of ''[[Whoops Apocalypse (film)|Whoops Apocalypse]]'' (1986) features a conflict very similar to the Falklands War between the United Kingdom and the fictional [[Caribbean]] country of Maguadora over the equally fictional Santa Maya.
*The BBC drama ''[[Tumbledown]]'' (31 May 1988)  told the story of [[Robert Lawrence (British Army officer)|Robert Lawrence]] [[Military Cross|MC]], a [[junior officer]] in the [[Scots Guards]] ([[Colin Firth]]) left paralysed down his left side by a gunshot wound to the head inflicted by an Argentine soldier on Mount Tumbledown, during the final push for Stanley, and his adjustment to disabled life after the war.
*[[Harley Cokeliss]]' [[horror film]] ''[[Dream Demon]]'' (1988) depicts a planned marriage between the main character and a Falklands War veteran.
*The [[1989 in film|1989 British film]] ''[[Resurrected (film)|Resurrected]]'', directed by [[Paul Greengrass]], had [[David Thewlis]] as a British soldier previously presumed dead in the war reappearing alive weeks after the end of the conflict.
*In the American/British film ''[[For Queen and Country]]'' (1989) starring [[Denzel Washington]], Reuben is a St. Lucia-born British ex-para finding it difficult to adjust to civilian life some years after the war. The film deals with the poverty and crime that Reuben encounters back home and how he is ignored by both society and government despite his service.
*The BBC film ''[[An Ungentlemanly Act]]'' (13 June 1992) depicts the events leading up to and during the initial occupation of the Islands by the Argentine Army. Based on true events, the film was produced to mark the 10th anniversary of the conflict and starred actors [[Ian Richardson]] as Governor [[Rex Hunt (governor)|Rex Hunt]] and [[Bob Peck]] as Major Mike Norman.
* The ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' episode "Brotherly Love" (1995) features a psychologically damaged veteran from the Falklands War, Barney ([[Ron Donachie]]), who gets into a brief argument with DS Jimmy Beck ([[Lorcan Cranitch]]) and flies into an insane rage, when Beck shows no interest in Barney's exploits in the war.
*Although the drama by [[Ian Curteis]] that became known simply as ''[[The Falklands Play]]'' was originally commissioned by the [[BBC]] in 1983, it was then temporarily set aside until 1985. The Corporation subsequently gave a number of reasons why it could not be made, including that it would have been broadcast too close to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 General Election]]. Curteis maintained that the generally sympathetic portrayal of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and his refusal to include material that was contrary to both the official record and what his interviews with the major protagonists had revealed, went against a perceived BBC anti-government bias, citing the fact that ''[[Tumbledown]]'' - which he and others claimed was more "[[anti-establishment]]" - '''was''' made and broadcast. Curteis' play was eventually recorded in a truncated form and screened by the digital satellite channel [[BBC Four]] in 2002.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
*The [[2005 in film|2005 Argentine film]] ''[[Iluminados por el fuego]]'' (literally "Lit by Fire", released in English speaking countries as ''Blessed by Fire''), directed by [[Tristán Bauer]] and starring [[Gastón Pauls]], is a [[docudrama]] based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Argentine Falklands veteran Edgardo Esteban, who fought in the conflict as an 18-year-old [[conscript]]. It received a [[Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival|San Sebastián Festival]] special award. The film tells about a veteran's memories, re-awakened after he learns of the suicide of a former soldier comrade. The movie gave a realistic portrait of the extreme weather and psychologically stressful conditions the Argentine soldiers faced in the field, the brutality and indifference to the suffering of the soldiers by their leaders, and the horrors of modern conflict. The movie won several awards, including a [[Goya Awards|Goya]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
*The [[2006 in film|2006 British film]] ''[[This Is England]]'', directed by [[Shane Meadows]], is set in July 1983 in a small town in England and includes documentary footage and extracts from radio broadcasts about the Falklands War. The main character of the film is 12-year-old Shaun, whose father was killed fighting in the war.
*The British science fiction series ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' uses the Falklands War as a backdrop during its second series.
*BBC motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' visited Argentina in 2014 for filming a Christmas Special. However, the presenters' cars' number plates were seen as references to Falklands War. Presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s [[Porsche 928]]'s original number plate "H982 FKL" was seen as a direct reference to the conflict. Upon reaching [[Ushuaia]], from where the [[ARA General Belgrano|''General Belgrano'']] departed on its final voyage, an angry mob confronted them. The three presenters were forced to abandon their cars, which were pelted with rocks from demonstrators, and catch the last plane to Buenos Aires and flee to Chile. A filming crew of 30, who was left behind, was escorted to the Chilean border by local police overland.
*The Falklands War is a significant episode of the [[2011 in film|2011 biographical film]] ''[[The Iron Lady (film)|The Iron Lady]]'', depicting the life and career of former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].
*In the 2015 TV show ''[[Blunt Talk]]'' protagonist, Walter Blunt (Played by [[Patrick Stewart]]) is a former [[Royal Marines]] [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and veteran of the [[Falklands War]] along with his [[valet]] Harry Chandler (Played by [[Adrian Scarborough]]), a former Royal Marines [[Lance corporal#British Army and Royal Marines|lance corporal]].

The war provided a wealth of material for writers, and many dozens of books came from it; in the United Kingdom (UK) an account was [[Max Hastings]] and [[Simon Jenkins]]' ''[[The Battle for the Falklands]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Major General [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]], of the Royal Marines, wrote his own account as commander in his 1985 book ''No Picnic: 3 Commando Brigade in the South Atlantic''. Other titles focused on the Sea Harrier (Sharkey Ward's ''[[Sea Harrier over the Falklands]]''), the land battles leading up to the Argentine surrender (Christian Jennings and [[Adrian Weale]]'s ''[[Green Eyed Boys]]''), and the general experience of battle and life in the surrounding area ([[Ken Lukowiak]]'s ''A Soldier's Song'' and ''Marijuana Time''). Vincent Bramley's "[[Forward into Hell]]" offers a less apologetic account of the War. In Argentina, one of the best-known is Commodore [[Pablo Carballo]]'s ''[[Halcones de Malvinas]]'', a collection of personal experiences of fighter pilots and many others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/bookrev/halcones.html |title=Book Review|work=Air &amp; Space Power Journal |date=Winter 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mandatory reading for admission to the [[Argentine Air Force|FAA]]'s ''Escuela de Aviación Militar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ediciones.argentinidad.com/|website= Ediciones Argentinidad|author=Escuela de Aviación Militar, FAA|title=Bibliografía de consulta obligatoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====
The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], himself partly of British descent and raised bilingually in Spanish and English, wrote a short poem, called ''Juan López y John Ward'' (1985), about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to "islands that were too famous". He also said about the war: "The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A large amount of poetry has been written on both sides, regarding the war. An Argentine example is "Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic" by Salvador Oria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/background/argentine82.html|title=Elegy for the Argentine Dead Boys, in the South Atlantic|author=Oria,  Salvador|website=Falklands.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108210317/http://www.falklands.info/background/argentine82.html|archivedate=8 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comics====
* The comic book ''[[Hellblazer]]'', which is unique in that unlike other comics, it takes place in real time and shows present day crisis and social commentary about Britain. The Falklands War is one of those themes that were portrayed and mentioned upon in various issues and story arcs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequart.org/magazine/53324/analyzing-hellblazer-part-11/ Sifting Through the Ashes: Analyzing Hellblazer, Part 11]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mini-series "Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker," later collected as Volume 10 of ''[[The Boys (comics)|The Boys]]'' features the central character, Billy Butcher, as an enlisted man in the Falklands War. Butcher frequently refers to the other side as "Argeys."&lt;ref&gt; The Boys: Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker: Issue 1 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Music referencing the war includes:
* The song "Glad It's All Over" by [[Captain Sensible]], is about the Falklands War.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bobUGEliic&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Argentine punk-rock band [[Los Violadores]] wrote the song "Comunicado #166" at their album ''[[Y ahora qué pasa ¿eh?]]''. The song is critical of the military Junta, and the role of the United States. [[Pil Trafa]], the lead singer, commented in 2001 that Argentina should not try to annex the islands, but rather improve as a country, so that the Falklanders themselves would emigrate to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=37707&amp;lang=it |title=Comunicado #166|website=antiwarsongs.org|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Falklands War provided much of the subject matter for [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983), written by [[Roger Waters]]. The lyrics are highly critical of perceived British [[jingoism]] and of the Thatcher government's actions. A specific lyric (from the song "Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert") protesting the sinking of ARA ''General Belgrano'' reads: "...Galtieri took the Union Jack. And Maggie, over lunch one day, took a cruiser with all hands... apparently to make him give it back."
* Pop musician [[Elvis Costello]] wrote the song "[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]" (1983) with [[Clive Langer]] in response to the Falklands War. The song was originally written for [[Robert Wyatt]], whose version was released as a single in August 1982, a couple of months after the war had ended: Wyatt's recording was a Top 40 hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/jun/14/songsfromapointlesswar1 |title=Songs from a pointless war |last=Smith |first=Richard |date=14 June 2007 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3664240/The-lasting-legacy-of-Shipbuilding.html |title=The lasting legacy of Shipbuilding |last=Sandall |first=Robert|author-link=Robert Sandall |date=5 April 2007 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written from the point of view of workers in a depressed shipbuilding town, it points out that their jobs only come at the expense of the lives lost in the war. 1984's "Peace in Our Time" (released under Costello's alias The Imposter) also references the "tiny island invaded".
* Argentine rock musician [[Charly García]] recorded the song "No Bombardeen Buenos Aires" during the war and released it in his album ''Yendo De La Cama Al Living''. The song is about the socio-political climate in Argentina during the war.
* Much material produced around this time by the [[anarchist]] [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Crass]] was extremely critical of the war and its aftermath, in particular the album ''[[Yes Sir, I Will]]'' (1983) and the singles "Sheep Farming in the Falklands" and "How Does it Feel to be the Mother of 1,000 Dead?" The latter, intended as a statement directed at Mrs. Thatcher, led to questions in Parliament and a request for prosecution for [[Obscene Publications Act|obscenity]] from Conservative MP for [[Enfield North (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield North]], [[Timothy Eggar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Southern.com|url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09422b.html|title=Label|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811121623/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09422b.html|archivedate=11 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass were also responsible for [[Thatchergate]], a [[hoax]] tape, originally attributed to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]], on which the spliced voice of Margaret Thatcher appears to imply that the destroyer [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']] was deliberately sacrificed in order to escalate the conflict.
* The folk rock band [[The Levellers (band)|The Levellers]] wrote and produced the song "Another Man's Cause" featuring the lyrics "Your daddy well he died in the Falklands."
* Manchester group [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] released the single "Marquis Cha-Cha" (1983), which tells the story of a [[Lord Haw-Haw]] type figure who broadcasts from Argentina but meets a sticky end.
* British heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] recorded for their album ''[[Virtual XI]]'' (1998) a song called "Como Estais Amigos", about the Falklands War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Paterson|first1 = Lawrence|title = Blaze Bayley: At the End of the Day|publisher = Blaze Bayley Recordings Ltd.|year = 2009|page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Macclesfield-based punk band [[The Macc Lads]] penned a typically un-[[political correctness|PC]] song called "Buenos Aires (1982, Falklands War Mix)" which included lyrics such as "Costa Mendez lives in fear / Of real men who can hold their beer!" and "hey hey hey / The lads are on their way / With their bayonets and tommy guns / and their bellies full of Boddingtons."
* Scottish anarcho-punk band [[Oi Polloi]]'s song about one of the victims [[Simon Weston]] is also a clear condemnation of the war.
* [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]'s song "Tango Atlantico" (from the 1986 album ''[[Big World]]'') represents a look back at the Falklands War.
* The title track of [[The Exploited]]'s album ''[[Let's Start a War]]'' (1983) directly addresses the Falklands War, implying Margaret Thatcher started it almost on a whim, for her own benefit and to take the focus away from other problems Britain was facing at the time, such as unemployment.
* On their album ''[[From Here to Eternity: Live]]'' (1999), [[The Clash]] substitute a line in the song "[[Career Opportunities (song)|Career Opportunities]]" for "I don't wanna die, fighting in the Falkland Strait" which was a common [[ad-lib]] during their set at the time.
* Some people in Britain took the song "[[Six Months in a Leaky Boat]]" by the New Zealand pop group [[Split Enz]] to be a criticism of the war, and the song was banned by the [[BBC]]. The group denied that this was the song's intent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummocrats.com/archives/000809.php|website=dummocrats|title=000809}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly because the song was recorded earlier in 1982.
* "[[Fields of Fire (song)|Fields of Fire]]" by [[Big Country]], is about the Falklands War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Country|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/big-country-19850228|website = Rolling Stone|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish power metal band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]'s song 'Back in Control' from their 2006 album ''[[Attero Dominatus]]'' is a representation of the Falklands conflict.
* New York band [[Vampire Weekend]] allude to the Falklands Conflict on their first single "[[Mansard Roof (song)|Mansard Roof]]" (2007).
* The [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Brothers in Arms (song)|Brothers in Arms]]", written by [[Mark Knopfler]], is about the Falklands War.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;
* [[Billy Bragg]]'s song "Island of No Return", originally released on his 1984 album ''[[Brewing Up with Billy Bragg]]'', was written from the point of view of a young soldier serving in the Falklands.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;
* [[Super Furry Animals]]' song "The Piccolo Snare" from their 2004 album ''[[Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)|Phantom Power]]'' was partly inspired by frontman [[Gruff Rhys]]' childhood memories about the Falklands War, as well as contemporary observations of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;
* Los Angeles punk band [[NOFX]]'s song "Ronnie &amp; Mags" off of their 2012 album ''[[Self Entitled]]'' mentions the Falklands War multiple times, as it focuses on Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher's relations.
* [[Vin Garbutt]]'s song "[[Dark side of the Moon (Vin Garbutt song)|Dark side of the Moon]]" on the 1999 album ''[[Word of Mouth (Vin Garbutt album)|Word of Mouth]]''

===Theatre===
* British playwright [[Steven Berkoff]] wrote the highly critical satirical play ''[[Sink the Belgrano!]]'' (1986) about the British decision to go to war and the sinking of the Argentine cruiser [[ARA General Belgrano|''General Belgrano'']].

===Visual arts===
[[Linda Kitson]] was the official [[war artist]] accompanying British troops during the [[Falklands Conflict]]. She created over 400 drawings of the troops' daily life, many of which are now part of the [[Imperial War Museum]]’s art collection and were exhibited to the general public in November 1982. They were featured again in the Museum's exhibition ''Women War Artists'', in 2011-2012.&lt;ref name=IWM-2011-04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.7165 |title=Press Desk: Women War Artists |date=7 April 2011 |publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110606104058/http%3A//www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.7165 |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Kitson's drawings which were not retained by the Museum were sold.

==Sport==
[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s popular Argentine midfielder [[Ossie Ardiles]] had helped beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in an [[1981–82 FA Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final one day after the invasion: whilst Ardiles was booed by the Leicester fans, who chanted "England, England, England" whenever he touched the ball, the Tottenham supporters responded by chanting "Argentina, Argentina, Argentina" in support of Ardiles.&lt;ref name=marca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2017/10/31/59f791f846163f456c8b45d0.html |title=Osvaldo Ardiles, the Spurs legend tainted by the union of football and politics |last=Olmedo |first=Álvaro |date=31 October 2017 |website=[[marca.com]]|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later he left England to return to Argentina: according to him, this had already been arranged before the war so he could prepare with the [[Argentina national football team]] ahead of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]]. Whilst Tottenham's manager [[Keith Burkinshaw]] wanted Ardiles to return to the club for the next season, Ardiles felt unable to do this, and as a compromise it was agreed that he would instead go on loan to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/feb/25/falklands.world1|title=Famous then: Ossie Ardiles |last=Lennon |first=Peter|author-link=Peter Lennon |date=25 February 2002 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he would subsequently return to Tottenham, remaining with the club until 1988 and winning the [[UEFA Cup]] with them in 1984. His cousin José Ardiles, a fighter pilot, was killed during the early stages of the air campaign, becoming the first Argentine pilot to die in the war.&lt;ref name=marca /&gt; Ardiles' countryman and Tottenham team-mate, [[Ricardo Villa]], also chose to miss the [[1982 FA Cup Final]], and subsequently left the club in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/ricky-villa-i-recognise-i-am-a-little-part-of-english-football-history-480704.html|title=Ricky Villa: 'I recognise I am a little part of English football history' |last=Viner |first=Brian|author-link=Brian Viner|date=2 June 2006 |website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''White, Blue and White'', a documentary on Ardiles and Villa's experiences in England, including the period of the conflict, was produced for [[ESPN]]'s ''[[30 for 30]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=whiteblueandwhite |title=White, Blue and White - ESPN Films: 30 for 30 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=[[ESPN.com]]|access-date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] stopped using their blue-and-white kit inspired by the Argentine national team, stating that playing in it "hardly seems appropriate, given the current circumstances". The war also created heightened passions between [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[English national football team|England]] in the [[Football World Cup 1986|1986]], [[Football World Cup 1998|1998]], and [[Football World Cup 2002|2002]] FIFA World Cups, featuring play by [[Diego Maradona]], [[Peter Shilton]], and [[David Beckham]].

==State recognition==
[[File:Malvinaswarmemorialbbaa217.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Monumento a los caídos en Malvinas|Monument to the Fallen Soldiers]], [[Buenos Aires]].]][[File:The Falklands War Memorial in Stanley, Falkland Islands.jpg|thumb|250px|[[1982 Liberation Memorial|Liberation Memorial]], [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].]]

===Holidays===
The war is commemorated as ''Día del Veterano de Guerra y los Caídos en Malvinas'' (''Veterans and Fallen Soldiers of the Falklands Day''), a [[Public holidays in Argentina|public holiday in Argentina]], on 2 April. It is sometimes referred to as [[Malvinas Day]].

In Britain, those who lost their lives are remembered as part of [[Remembrance Sunday]].

In the Falkland Islands themselves, two holidays commemorate the war: Margaret Thatcher Day on 10 January and [[Liberation Day (Falklands)|Liberation Day]] on 14 June (or the first Monday afterward, if it falls on a weekend).

===Memorials===
In the United Kingdom, there is a national memorial at [[Pangbourne College]], a small co-educational public school in Berkshire; it is titled the Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel.

There are several memorials in the [[Falkland Islands]], the most predominate of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]] in Stanley which was unveiled on 14 June 1984 (the second anniversary of the end of the war and liberation of the Falkland Islanders).

When the war started a [[Buenos Aires]] street, "Calle Inglaterra" (England Street), was renamed "Calle 2 de Abril" (April 2 Street), after the start date of the war.  In November 2013, the street briefly reverted to its original name "Calle Inglaterra".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1636150-la-calle-2-de-abril-volvio-a-llamarse-inglaterra-y-se-desato-la-polemica La calle "2 de Abril" volvió a llamarse "Inglaterra" y se desató la polémica]&lt;/ref&gt; But due to the resulting denunciations and fierce protests caused by this name, the same street was finally renamed in March 2014 as the "Pasaje 2 de Abril" by the Buenos Aires government, also because another street named "Calle 2 de Abril" already exists in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlamentario.com/noticia-70606.html La calle “Inglaterra” se llamará “Pasaje 2 de abril”&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, after the Falklands War ended, the clock tower "Torre de los Ingleses" (Tower of the English), which was a gift from the local British community to the city of Buenos Aires in commemoration of the [[Argentina Centennial|centennial of the May Revolution]] of 1810, was renamed as the "[[Torre Monumental]]" (Monumental Tower). At the same time, the "Plaza Británica" (British Square), where the tower is situated, was renamed as the "Plaza Fuerza Aérea Argentina" (Argentine Air Force Square). The [[Monumento a los caídos en Malvinas|Monument to the Fallen Soldiers]] was built in this square.

==Terminology==
This war is occasionally written as ''The Falklands/Malvinas War'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=SocialistParty.org|url= http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/militant/mil2frame.htm?ch20.htm |title=The Falklands/Malvinas War}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=History.ac.uk|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/noakesL.html |title=Warrior Nation - Images of War in British Popular Culture 1850–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Cambridge.org|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521444620 |title=Justice and the Genesis of War}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising the international split over the Islands' name. Other constructs such as ''Falklands Conflict'' and ''Falklands Crisis'' have also been used. The term ''Guerra de las Malvinas'' or ''Malvinas War'' is the one normally used in Spanish-speaking countries and has also been used by some socialist groups in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=LRP-cofi.org|url=http://www.lrp-cofi.org/PR/MalvinasPR21.html |title=The Malvinas War Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jun2007/malv-j21.shtml |date=June 2007|title=The Malvinas War|website=World Socialist Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Guerra del Atlántico Sur", meaning "War of the South Atlantic" is also used in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anses.gov.ar/p-aaff/malvinas/montos_desde_marzo08.html Veteranos de Guerra del Atlántico Sur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223011145/http://www.anses.gov.ar/p-aaff/malvinas/montos_desde_marzo08.html |date=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmalibros.com/libros/9/950577102.html Roberto Russell, America Latina Y La Guerra Del Atlantico Sur] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20051211215215/http://www.paradigmalibros.com/libros/9/950577102.html |date=11 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the term "Falklands/Malvinas War", this reflects the fact that some of the conflict occurred in [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] (which at the time was a [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|dependency of the Falklands]]), and the deep ocean.

'''"Death of the Poet"''' ({{lang-ru|Смерть Поэта}}) is an 1837 poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], written in reaction to the death of [[Alexander Pushkin]].

Pushkin was mortally wounded in a duel on January 27, 1837, and died on the 29th. Lermontov began his first formulation of the poem (ending with the phrase "...his lips forever sealed") as soon as he heard of the event, and within a short time copies of the poem began to be circulated in [[St. Petersburg]].

Within days the doctor [[Nikolai Arendt]] visited Lermontov (who was ill) and told him the details of the death of Pushkin, whom Arendt had tried to save.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chmielewska |first1=E. M. |title=Лермонтовская энциклопедия |trans-title=Lermontov Encyclopedia |publisher=Soviet Encyclopedia |trans-chapter=Arendt, Nikolai Fedorovich |chapter=А́РЕНДТ Николай Федорович |chapterurl=http://feb-web.ru/feb/lermenc/lre-abc/lre/lre-0363.htm}} {{language icon|ru}} Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841)&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt's story likely influenced Lermontov's development of the poem.

[[Pyotr Vyazemsky]] described the reaction of Arendt to the death of Pushkin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Пушкин А. С. Сочинения |trans-title=Works of A. S. Pushkin |year=1999 |publisher=ИД Синергия |location=Moscow}} Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mikhail lermontov.jpg|thumb|upright|Mikhail Lermontov. 1837 portrait by Pyotr Zabolotsky.]]
On February 7, Lermontov added an acerbic final sixteen lines (beginning "And you, the arrogant descendants of infamous scoundrels...") to the poem. These lines called for divine justice upon the heads of the "greedy horde" of the court aristocracy, whom Lermontov condemned as executioners of freedom and the true culprits of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeenglish.ru/ArticlesLermontov.htm |title=Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov Biography |author= |year=2005 |work=Home English |accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-written copies of this version of the poem circulated among the Petersburg intelligentsia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS241/Notes/Lermontov.html |title=Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841) |author=C. T. Evans |year=2010 |work=Nova Online |accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the attention of the authorities. Those final sixteen lines were regarded by the authorities as seditious [[freethought|free thinking]], and Lermontov was arrested. After a brief investigation he was, on the orders of the Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], exiled to a regiment in the [[Caucasus Region|Caucasus]] on February 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rulex.ru/01120263.htm |title=Лермонтов Михаил Юрьевич |trans-title=Mikhail Lermontov |author= |date= |work=Russian Biographical Dictionary a|accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was only published long after Lermontov's death. The first publication (a German translation under the title "Lermontov's lament at the grave of Alexander Pushkin") was in 1852 in [[Friedrich von Bodenstedt]]'s ''Mikhail Lermontoff's Poetic Legacy''. The first published English translation (under the title "On the death of Pushkin") was in 1856, in [[Alexander Herzen]]'s London periodical ''Polar Star''.

'''Dianism''' is a 19th-century American spiritual sexual practice consisting of "sexual satisfaction from sexual contact" but without ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jxZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT292|title=Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult|first=Metzger|last=Richard|date=1 September 2014|publisher=Disinformation Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice was named for Diana, the Roman goddess of chastity, by American court reporter and astronomer [[Henry M.

While Parkhurst  drew inspiration from radical religious philosopher [[John Humphrey Noyes]],&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Dianism is "radically different" from Noyes's "male continence" or [[Alice Bunker Stockham|Stockham's]] "karezza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYM-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA212|title=Sex Secrets|first=Robert B.|last=Armitage|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Advanced Thought Publishing Company|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG5VCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140|title=The Sex Side of Life: You are the Society|first=Mary Ware|last=Dennett|date=7 January 2016|publisher=谷月社|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parkhurt later took credit for the pamphlet, authoring the 1887 work "Why I Wrote 'Diana'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rbYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316|title=Village Atheists: How America's Unbelievers Made Their Way in a Godly Nation|first=Leigh Eric|last=Schmidt|date=26 September 2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elmina Slenker==
[[File:Lucifer, The Light-Bearer.jpg|thumb|left|From 1895 to 1900, Slenker published at least six articles on  Dianism in the anarchist journal [[Lucifer the Lightbearer]].]]
[[File:Elmina D. Slenker.jpg|thumb|19th-century American Freethought leader and early sex reformer Elmina Drake Slenker was a regular contributor to [[Lucifer the Lightbearer]] and an early promoter of Dianism.]]
[[Elmina Slenker]] was a "prominent promoter of the 'Diana method' of continence and distributor of the pamphlet Diana which explained to readers how to practice sexual expression without fears of conception".&lt;ref&gt;https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/40123/research.pdf?sequence=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsddNlV-rGwC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Evolutionary Rhetoric: Sex, Science, and Free Love in Nineteenth-Century Feminism|first=Wendy|last=Hayden|date=14 February 2013|publisher=SIU Press|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ida Craddock==
[[File:IdaCraddock.jpg|thumb|right|Occultist and sex reformer [[Ida Craddock]]]]
Ida Craddock (August 1, 1857 – October 16, 1902) was a 19th-century American occultist, Theosophist, and  author, sex reformer and mystic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Chappell | first = Vere | title = Ida Craddock: Sexual Mystic and Martyr for Freedom | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | url = http://www.idacraddock.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddock developed an interest in the [[occult]] through her association with the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning around 1887.  She tried in her writings to synthesize translated mystic literature and traditions from many cultures into a scholarly, distilled whole. Craddock became a student of religious eroticism and declared herself a Priestess and Pastor of the Church of Yoga.  Never married, Craddock eventually claimed to have a blissful ongoing marital relationship with an [[angel]] named Soph.  Craddock even stated that her intercourse with Soph was so noisy as to draw complaints from her neighbors.&lt;ref name=Schaechterle&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = OhioLINK; Bowling Green State University | last = Schaechterle | first = Inez L | title = Speaking of Sex: The Rhetorical Strategies of Frances Willard, Victoria Woodhull, and Ida Craddock | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | year = 2005 | url = http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother responded by threatening to burn Craddock's papers and unsuccessfully tried to have her institutionalized.

In Chicago, Craddock opened an office offering "mystical" sexual counseling to married couples via both walk-in counseling and mail order.  She dedicated herself to “preventing sexual evils and sufferings” by educating adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Burton | first = Shirley J | title = Women Making a Difference: Ida Craddock, Adelaide Johnson, and Laura Dainty Pelham | accessdate = 2009-08-10 | url = http://www.lib.niu.edu/1997/iht419722.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Shirley J.

Michigan Historical Review 19: 1 (1993): 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Craddock authored "Heavenly Bridegrooms", in which she described her sexual relationship with a spiritual being she called Soph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/bridegrooms.html|title=Heavenly Bridegrooms|website=www.idacraddock.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, she authored "Psychic Wedlock", which provided further detail on her spiritual worldview and recommended training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/psychic.html|title=Psychic Wedlock|website=www.idacraddock.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craddock's three planes===
Craddock cites [[New Thought]] leader Alma Gillen, a London teacher of "Divine Healing"  (also called "Divine Science"), who divides the universe into three 'factors':  (1) The Thinker (that which thinks); (2) The mentality, "where thoughts are shaped"; and (3) "the body, the material life, where spirit finds expression as outward form."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/bridegrooms.html|title=Heavenly Bridegrooms|author=|date=|website=www.idacraddock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt51TBulIhwC&amp;pg=PA119|title=Heaven's Bride: The Unprintable Life of Ida C. Craddock, American Mystic, Scholar, Sexologist, Martyr, and Madwoman|first=Leigh Eric|last=Schmidt|date=7 December 2010|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Craddock explains that "it is incorrect to say 'I *have* spirit.' We should say 'I *am* a spirit'".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; 

Craddock argues that "every act ... consists of three stages." which she illustrates by stating:  "Let us suppose a man: 
:1.  conceives the idea of pushing a ball out of his path;
:2.  he determines how the ball shall be pushed aside, with hand or foot, gently or powerfully, etc.;
:3.  at the command of his mentality, his body performs the act of moving the ball."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idacraddock.com/psychic.html|title=Psychic Wedlock|author=|date=|website=www.idacraddock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Craddock's three degrees of training===
Craddock refers to the first degree, known as "Alpha-ism", which she defines as "No sex union except for the distinct purpose of begetting a child".  Craddock emphasized the importance of Alpha-ism during pregnancy, claiming that "Modern researchers have shown the impressionability of the embryo child during gestation" and that "Napoleon the Great owed his remarkable military genius to the fact that, prior to his birth, his mother accompanied her husband through a military campaign."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

After mastering Alpha-ism,  Craddock's suggests readers consult Parkhurt's pamphlet "Diana" as an introduction to the second degree, which is "the most difficult of the three degrees to acquire, physiologically speaking, inasmuch as it exacts supreme self-control at a crucial moment."&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; But Craddock promises that "as the power of self-control is developed, it becomes and more possible for a man to do here just what he wills. And no man who has once acquired this power will ever care to return to the old habit of abandonment to passion; for he will see that he was then a slave, whereas now he is a king".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

Craddock writes that: "There is a belief among some occultists that an earnest wish breathed at that time, when husband and wife are one, will not fail to be granted. This opens, it is said, the door to those who practice what is called 'black magic', and enables them to work harm upon other human beings." Craddock continues: "What foundation there is for this belief as applied to the magicians I do not see. If it really be that a wish is granted then more readily than when the seeker is in any other mood, it is probably because the occultist who attains the second degree has to exercise such supreme self-control at that moment that he is complete master of his sub-consciousness".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com"/&gt; 

According to Craddock the "Third and Highest Degree", involves "Communion with Deity as the third partner in marital union".&lt;ref name="idacraddock.com1"/&gt;

==Crowleyites== 
[[File:Aleister Crowley, Magus.png|thumb|right|Occultist Aleister Crowley in 1912]]
In 1915, American author [[Theodore Schroeder]] published Ida Craddock's ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'', along with a brief introduction, in the pages of the journal ''The Alienist and Neurologist''.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpvqhORGQe4C&amp;pg=PT178|title=Aleister Crowley and Western Esotericism|first1=Henrik|last1=Bogdan|first2=Martin P.|last2=Starr|date=5 September 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlEvfflQZbIC&amp;pg=PA282|title=Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley|first=Richard|last=Kaczynski|date=7 August 2017|publisher=North Atlantic Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schroeder was an associate of occultist Aleister Crowley, and introduced Craddock's work to Crowley.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoybRLX4jqIC&amp;pg=PA245|title=Sexual Outlaw, Erotic Mystic: The Essential Ida Craddock|first=Vere|last=Chappell|date=1 December 2010|publisher=Weiser Books|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919,  Crowley reviewed ''Heavenly Bridegrooms'' in the pages of the journal ''[[The Equinox]]'', stating that it was:

{{Quote |...one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous.

...This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters.

Schroeder was subsequently contacted by notable Crowley followers included British Columbia OTO founder [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and Crowley's New York based representative [[Karl Germer]].&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  

In 1932, Crowley-associate American [[C.F. Russell]] founded his own occult group, the GBG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MmAoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63|title=The Great Work of the Flesh: Sexual Magic East and West|first=Sarane|last=Alexandrian|date=30 January 2015|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell developed his own curriculum of [[sex magick]].&lt;ref name="CullingWeschcke2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis T.

In 1981, [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]], a student of Karl Germer who went on to become leader the OTO in Brazil, re-published Heavenly Bridegrooms and Psychic Wedlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpvqhORGQe4C&amp;pg=PT178|title=Aleister Crowley and Western Esotericism|first1=Henrik|last1=Bogdan|first2=Martin P.|last2=Starr|date=5 September 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 August 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A violent [[thunderstorm]] strands a couple and child in the [[gothic fiction|gothic]] English countryside: little Judy, who is traveling with her selfish, uncaring father, David and her rich, callous, arrogant stepmother Rosemary. David only has Judy due to a court order and barely tolerates her presence. After their car is stuck in mud and the rain begins, they find a mansion. After breaking in, they are found by the owners, a kindly older couple, Gabriel and Hilary Hartwicke. Rosemary threw Judy's beloved [[teddy bear]] into the bushes while out in the rain, so Gabriel gifts her a new doll, Mr. Punch. They are invited to stay and while eating, Isabel and Enid (two British punk rocker hitchhikers) barge in with the person who picked them up, Ralph. Gabriel reveals himself to be a talented toy maker; their house is filled with dolls, puppets, and many other beautifully detailed and handmade toys. The Hartwickes invite the stranded travelers to join them to stay as guests until the storm ends and show them to their rooms.

Isabel has thievery on her mind and before taking Ralph's wallet and car, she plans on stealing the Hartwickes' antiques. Enid just wants to get through the night. Isabel sneaks out and while casing a room, is brutally attacked and beaten by the dolls and thrown into the hallway in front of Judy. Unable to ask for help, she extends her hand and before Judy could assist, she is dragged to the attic. Judy goes to Ralph's room to tell him what happened and since she woke him up, he thinks she's dreaming. However as she turns to leave, he notices blood on her slippers so he agrees to accompany Judy. However on the way downstairs, some of the dolls trip Ralph and he falls down the stairs. He's fine when he gets up except for a bite that he believes is from a rat. They arrive at David and Rosemary's room and Judy tries to tell him what happened, but they along with Enid accuse him of attacking Isabel and being a pedophile. Upset at the treatment of her new friend, Judy runs off with her father behind her. While looking for Judy, Ralph runs into Gabriel who tells him that it's not blood but paint that he and Judy stepped in and Isabel probably got lost in one of the halls in the large house. Satisfied, he continues his search for Judy, finding her in the kitchen along with Punch. She continues to try to convince him, but he doesn't believe in the dolls until Punch himself speaks up. 

Rosemary is ambushed and attacked repeatedly by the toys before accidentally leaping to her death (thinking she was jumping over them) out of a window. Enid goes looking for Isabel and finds her-at the end of her doll transformation, but still able to attempt to warn her to "go back." She is then attacked by a legion of toys and eventually shot to death by toy soldiers. Rosemary's body has been taken to their bedroom, where, covered in a sheet, her death is not yet noticed by David. A locked room opens itself to Judy and Ralph. Ralph asks if they are Judy's little people and she informs him that they are. Encountering the dolls gathered together, Ralph ends up getting caught up in a trap the toys set for the other adults and is nearly hurt badly until Judy convinces them to save him since he is her friend. Afterwards, they are stuck until the dolls decide what to do with them. David, fresh out of the shower, tries to talk to his wife, but finally finds her dead. Believing Ralph murdered her, David prepares to kill him. Now safe, Judy and Ralph run into the workshop where an angry David finds them. Ralph attempts to tell him what is going on, but David has taken leave of his reason. Ralph has learned the truth about the dolls and refuses to use them to fight, but David doesn't believe even after being attacked by a Punch doll. During their fight, the other dolls drag the unconscious Ralph and Judy away to safety. Mr. Punch is destroyed by David with a mallet after a fierce struggle.

David is then confronted by Gabriel and Hilary. It is revealed that Gabriel and Hilary are actually a [[Wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] and [[witch]] couple who see toys as the heart and soul of childhood and believe toys will be around for as long as children (or even those with the hearts of children) want them. They also believe that the bitterness adults feel can turn to love if they surrender to the goodwill that toys provide. They explain that people come to their house every now and then and spend the night. When this happens, they test their visitors to see if they can change or were good from the start, giving them a sporting chance to save themselves. Some people like Ralph (people who are able to see the love and respect of childhood) and children (like Judy) are saved/spared and leave the house with a much better perspective of life. However, the ones like David, Rosemary, Isabel and Enid who refuse to change their ways can never leave, since they must play a new role in the world of children. It is shown that that new role is to become a child's toy when David is (apparently painfully) transformed into a doll to replace Mr. Punch.

The next morning, Ralph and Judy wake up and are convinced by Gabriel and Hilary that the night's events were all just a dream, and receive a letter saying that David is leaving Judy behind because he never was a good father to her and that she will be much happier living in [[Boston]] with her mother. The letter also states that her father and stepmother are moving to another country and changing their names, and have also taken the two girls with them, but have left enough money behind for Judy and Ralph to buy plane tickets back to Boston. Ralph and Judy then leave the house together after being bid farewell by Gabriel and Hilary, who invite them to come back whenever they want. As they get into Ralph's car, Judy is overjoyed to find her lost teddy sitting in the front seat, but then decides he would be happier living with the dolls and gives him to the old couple as a gift. As they drive off to the airport, Judy, who has grown quite fond of Ralph, tells him that he will really like her mother and hints to him that if he would like to stay with her and her mother, he could be Judy's new father. Though Ralph does not answer, he seems interested in the idea.

The film ends with Mr. and Mrs. Bowers and the punk girls sitting on a shelf as dolls. Just then, another car with [[Dysfunctional family|another family with a set of obnoxious parents]] suddenly arrives, and their car gets stuck in a mud hole yards from the mansion.

==Cancelled sequel==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
[[Stuart Gordon]] was, at one point, very interested in directing a sequel to this film. The initial storyline would have followed Judy and Ralph back to [[Boston]] in which Ralph would have indeed married Judy's mother and they would all become a family. Until, one day Judy would receive a box sent from England which would contain the toy makers, Gabriel and Hilary, as dolls. The said sequel never happened.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Dolls'' has been mixed to positive, and the film currently holds a 62% approval rating at review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Ain't It Cool News]] reviewed the DVD, calling it "a movie that really stands above the type of film you might expect from this era, with this subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/47172 A Movie A Day: DOLLS (1987) Toys are very loyal and that is a fact.] Ain't It Cool News&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the film was mostly negative, writing "At some point ''Dolls'' remains only an idea, a concept. It doesn't become an engine to shock and involve us," though he also conceded that the film "looks good" and "the haunted house looks magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870327/REVIEWS/703270303/1023 Dolls] Roger Ebert&lt;/ref&gt; HorrorNews.net's Jeff Colebank listed the toymaking couple as one of the "13 Best Horror Movie Couples", stating that Rolfe was "the creepiest toymaker of them all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://horrornews.net/30203/list-the-13-best-horror-movie-couples-serial-murder-edition/ The 13 Best Horror Movie Couples (serial murder edition)] HorrorNews.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllRovi|Allmovie]]'s review of the film was mildly favorable, calling it "a serious-minded, lovingly-crafted modern fairy tale that only misses classic status by a few clumsy, low-budget moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/dolls-v14236/review |title=Dolls (1987) |author=Robert Firsching |work=[[AllRovi|Allmovie]] |accessdate=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dramaturgy''' is the study of [[drama]]tic composition and the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work  ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'' (1767–69) by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dramatist]]s combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a [[dramaturge]], to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as "adapting a story to actable form." Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and [[Dramatic structure|structure]]. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current [[Zeitgeist]] through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'', and ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'') in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as "dramaturge". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘"dramatic judge" ("dramatischer Richter") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. &amp; BERGHAHN, K. L. 1981. Hamburgische Dramaturgie, Stuttgart, Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled ''Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).'' These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171026/dramaturgy?anchor=ref666078 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lessing's ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'' (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and ''Laokoon'' &lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. 1766. Laokoon, Berlin, C. F. Vosst&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel’s "Aesthetics" (written 1835–1838),&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL, G. W. F. &amp; KNOX, T. M. 1975. Aesthetics : lectures on fine art, Oxford, Clarendon Presst&lt;/ref&gt; many authors, including  Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 18. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschelverlag Berlin; 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 19. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschel Verlag; 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book ''The Technique of the Drama'',&lt;ref&gt;FREYTAG, G. Technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art; an authorized translation from the 6th German ed. by Elias J. MacEwan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the  first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. ''The Technique of Play Writing'' by Charlton Andrews, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, C. 1915. The Technique of Play Writing, Springfield, Mass. : The Home correspondence schoolt&lt;/ref&gt; refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

Another important work in the Western theatrical tradition is ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by [[Aristotle]] (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes [[tragedy]]. Aristotle considers ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among [[Character (arts)|character]], action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his "rules" are referred to today as "Aristotelian drama". In ''Poetics'', Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as [[anagnorisis]] and [[catharsis]].

''Poetics'' is the earliest surviving [[Western civilization|Western]] work of [[dramatic theory]]. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] work ''Natya Shastra'' (''The Art of Theatre''), written around [[Anno Dommini|500 BCE to 500 CE]], which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director''. University of Melbourne: Melbourne. p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry McCabe. ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument Against Contemporary Theatre''. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a  director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of [[Jonathan Larson]], the author of the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of ''Rent'' and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway hit]], the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of ''[[Angels in America]]'' go to playwright [[Tony Kushner]]'s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of ''Rent'' and that she was not entitled to royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in2/everythingisrent/articles/americantheatre5.html Scott. T. Cummings, ''American Theatre'', October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

==Plot==

Will Atenten returns home to his wife and daughters. His wife is increasingly uneasy due to a series of events, including their daughters seeing a strange man outside their home.

Will tries to enlist the help of the local police but they appear strangely unwilling to assist. He also approaches one of his neighbours who seems apprehensive. He decides to conduct his own investigations and in doing so finds out that he is a mental patient who recently left a psychiatric hospital and then a halfway house and his real name is Peter Ward. Five years earlier, his wife, Libby, (Rachel Weisz) and daughters Trish and Dee Dee were murdered at their home. During the attack, Peter was shot in the head, and so he has no memories of the murders. Instead, he has created a fantasy world in which his wife and daughters are fine. He created a new identity for himself in order to cope with the grief of his family's death. In his fantasy, he is a successful book publisher named Will Atenten based on his inpatient ID band W1ll 8-10-10.Peter moves back to his abandoned old house and lives inside. It is boarded up and unsafe and covered with graffiti, but in Peter's disturbed mind, the house is gorgeous and his wife and kids live there happily. 

The audience learns that everything that has occurred up to this point in the movie was just fantasy. He is informed by the doctors that he claimed he was innocent. He returns to his house, which is actually abandoned and decrepit, and converses with the projections of his wife and daughters, who claim that they believe in his innocence.

His neighbour Ann (Naomi Watts), reaches out to him. Ann believes in his innocence and encourages Peter to live a new life in order to heal himself. Peter eventually decides to return to his old house to confront his memories and, with Ann's help and support, realizes that he did not kill his family. It was a local man named Boyce (Elias Koteas), who broke into the house and shot Peter's family.

Peter and Ann are suddenly attacked by Boyce and Ann's ex, Jack, who reveals that he had hired Boyce to kill Ann so he could get revenge against her for divorcing him. Boyce got into the wrong house and accidentally killed Peter's family. Jack decides to kill Ann and set the house on fire, framing Peter for her murder, and shoots Boyce as punishment for his early failure. As they try to ignite a fire, Peter escapes, overpowers Jack and saves Ann. Boyce douses Jack in gasoline in revenge for being shot, but Jack shoots him in the head before being consumed by the flames.

While Ann and Chloe reunite, Peter confronts the ghosts of his wife and children, who forgive him and say goodbye. Peter escapes, having finally discovered the truth and gained inner peace.

One year later, Peter has returned to New York City and published a book called "Dream House," using his real name, Peter Ward, about his recent experiences.

==Production==
Director [[Jim Sheridan]] reportedly clashed with Morgan Creek’s [[James G.

The score to ''Dream House'' was composed by [[John Debney]] and conducted by Robert Ziegler.  Christian Clemmensen, reviewer of [[Filmtracks.com]], gave it four out of five stars, declaring it "among the biggest surprises of 2011" and stating, "It's not clear how badly Debney's work for ''Dream House'' was butchered by the studio's frantic last minute attempts to make the film presentable, but Debney's contribution does feature a cohesive flow of development that is, at least on album, a worthy souvenir from this otherwise messy situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christian |last=Clemmensen |title=''Dream House'' (John Debney) |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/dream_house.html |publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]] |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The soundtrack was released 11 October 2011 and features fifteen tracks of score at a running time of fifty-six minutes.

'''Education Otherwise''' (EO) is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1055120}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[England]] for families whose children are being educated otherwise than at school, and for those who wish to uphold the freedom of families to take responsibility for the education of their children. It provides support and information online, by telephone and through a [[bi-monthly]] newsletter to members throughout the [[UK]] and overseas.

Established in the mid-1970s, it took its name from the (then current) [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education Act]] (Section 36) which stated that parents are responsible for the education of their children, "either by regular attendance at school or '''otherwise'''". This clause has been retained in subsequent [[:Category:United Kingdom Education Acts|Education Acts]] (currently section 7 of the 1996 Education Act)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb3-l1g7 Education Act 1996 (Section 7)]&lt;/ref&gt; and remains an indication of the validity afforded to an education other than by schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar legislation. In Scotland the wording is "or by other means" rather than "otherwise"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In 1972, Royston Lambert, head of [[Dartington Hall#Dartington Hall School|Dartington Hall School]] asked Dick Kitto, who had been working there since 1955, to set up a project in conjunction with [[Northcliffe School (Conisbrough)|Northcliffe School]] to provide education for a group of non-academic students who would have to take another year in school due to the pending [[Raising of school leaving age in the UK#Leaving age raised to 16|raising of the school leaving age]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Duane (head teacher)|Duane, Michael]]. ''The Terrace: An Educational Experiment in a State School''. [[Freedom Press (UK)|Freedom Press]]. 1995. {{ISBN|0-900384-78-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kitto established a free school or [[democratic school]] model for the running of the project and was impressed by the qualities of the students even though they had effectively [[Unschooling|unschooled]] themselves within the school system, where they were perceived as trouble makers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Interview with Dick Kitto, ''Education Otherwise Newsletter'' (Number 61), August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitto's ''school'' caught the attention of Stan Windass, who had been working for a [[children's rights]] centre in [[London]], through which he had become aware of several families who were educating their own children. Windass had just taken the lease of [[Lower Shaw Farm]] and wanted to establish it as a centre to explore ideas for an alternative society. Windass asked Kitto to become the warden at Lower Shaw Farm after the Northcliffe School project ended.

Kitto was familiar with ideas about unschooled education through reading [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]] and Joy Baker's ''Children in Chancery''&lt;ref&gt;Published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] in 1964 - now out of print&lt;/ref&gt; along with his experiences at the Northcliffe School project. He and Windass were able to contact several families who were educating otherwise and arranged an informal network, and occasional meetings, between them throughout 1975 and 1976.

During 1976, [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] made a programme about the group which resulted in around 200 enquiries and expanded the membership to over 50.  The informal nature of the group could not handle such a level of interest and so, at a meeting in September 1976 which included five [[deschooling]] families, a more formal structure for the group was established with stated aims and a regular newsletter. In 1977, Kitto presented a [[BBC Television|BBC TV]] ''[[Open Door (BBC TV)|Open Door]]'' programme about the ideas behind the organisation. This resulted in over 2,000 enquiries and increased the membership to around 250.&lt;ref&gt;A tribute to Dick Kitto, ''Education Otherwise Newsletter'' (Number 130), October 1999 - citing obituaries from the ''Daily Telegraph'' and ''The Guardian'' newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oldeotriangle.png|left|thumb|Original EO logo]]
The original logo (based on a UK traffic sign) was intended to represent a child breaking-out of the confines of school, and pointing towards a different way. It was submitted to a printer with the request that, before printing, the 'foot' be made to look more as though it was kicking the triangle open; the originator of the drawing had always remained unhappy with that foot and at a later opportunity the logo was amended slightly to make it less like what the originator saw as a "goose-step".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Conflict and development==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eo newsletter 50 1986.jpg|right|thumb|EO Newsletter Cover Dec. 1986 - 10 Years issue]] --&gt;
With the steady growth in numbers of members, around 1,500 in 1986 (tenth anniversary) rising to 2,278 in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Chairpersons Report, ''EO Newsletter'' April/May 1992 (issue 85)&lt;/ref&gt; it was recognised that a trend away from the original [[ethos]] of EO was developing. There was much debate about its structure. The April/May 1993 newsletter (Issue 91) featured an EO Restructuring Supplement presenting various options for "the way forward". By the mid-1990s, it was being recognised that people were joining EO due to a "crisis" and wanted to get their child out of the school system, rather than coming to it with an interest in exploring alternative education provision.&lt;ref&gt;''The Changing Face of EO'' (''Newsletter'' 98, June 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; There was disaffection with the way the organisation was run via national gatherings which were seen as alienating the majority of members. The debate broadly split into those that wanted to follow a structured style of education with a "managed" organisation and those who valued an informal approach and rejecting the status of charitable trust and company limited by guarantee.

A short lived faction, Education Otherwise Unlimited, laid out the conflicting areas with the organisation's structure in a table:&lt;ref&gt;August/September 1994 ''Newsletter'' (Issue 99)&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Original EO Ethos
! Present Structure
|-
| Decisions reached by consensus, everyone had an equal voice. No exclusive meetings.
| Directors hold meetings, at which "non-directors should not really interrupt proceedings"&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of directors meeting 19 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| People got together from all over the country for discussion &amp; to share ideas, chance to examine lifestyle, outlook etc.
| Limited company status - said to be needed for protection against legal action.
|-
| Moral support was intrinsic. Children welcome and integral to meetings.
| Single day meetings. Adult only meetings.
|}

The original "ethos" grew out of the attitudes and aspirations of the original members. It was not laid down from the start. Kitto saw EO in broad [[human rights]] terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As far as I'm concerned, E.O. does not have a particular kind of education to which it is committed. It is committed to the right of families to do what they want to do. It is a humans ([[sic]]) rights organisation. I don't feel we must do this, or we must do that. It is up to the members. To me it is not a specific thing where children have to run wild in the country, or have to pay visits to [[Winchester Cathedral]], or anything else. There is this huge variation. Some people join EO in order to give their children a good classical education which they cannot get at school. I have a fundamental belief in the [[freedom of choice]]. We must all be allowed to make our own mistakes. We don't want to be dictated to by a [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|curriculum from central government]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parent's Charter==
In 1991, the government introduced a Parent's Charter (subtitled: "You and Your Child's Education") which promised parents reports about their children and their schools. In 1994, a revised version of the Parent's Charter (subtitled: Our Children's Education) was issued.  Page 9 included the sentence - "You have a duty to make sure that your child goes to school until he or she is 16." EO members were concerned that this [[misinformation]] should be corrected as it was being delivered to every household.

They appointed [[Solicitor#England and Wales|solicitor]] Peter Liell who sent "Letters Before Action" notices to the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)#History|Department for Education]] and to the [[Welsh Office]]. A reply by [[Eric Forth]] (9 July 1994) for the DfE claimed that the Parent's Charter could not be taken as a definitive guide to the law - the Charter "cannot take in every exception or reflect all points of detail". The department stated that there were no plans to issue a [[Erratum|corrigendum]]. The Welsh Office response was a confirmation that the Charter for Parents in Wales had been revised and would reflect the fact that not all children were educated in schools.

The matter was raised by [[Don Foster (politician)|Don Foster]] in a [[Parliamentary question#Question time in the UK|Parliamentary Question]] which was responded to by [[Robin Squire]] stating that [[John Patten, Baron Patten|John Patten]], the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education]], saw no need to issue a correction or to make a statement about the mistake.

As English and Welsh education law are identical there were no grounds for the variation in the responses of the two bodies. The solicitor notified the DfE that he had been instructed to prepare an application for leave to apply for [[Judicial review in English Law|judicial review]] of the decision as stated in Forth's letter. This threat caused an immediate response from the department that they "would want to find a different - in your eyes more satisfactory - wording for any further editions". The solicitor responded seeking confirmation, by 31 August 1994, that a future edition would include reference to the fact that children do not have to go to school. Forth once again responded accepting the need for a revised text: "I am, however, happy to confirm, in the light of your client's concerns, our intention that any future edition of the Parent's Charter in England will include a reference, be it explicit or implicit, to a parent's lawful right to ensure that his child is suitably educated otherwise than at school."

It was felt that this was as far as EO could go with the matter and the application for judicial review was withdrawn. The whole process had cost EO almost £4,000 but had generated a lot of publicity and raised awareness of the issue as many members had raised their concerns with their own [[Member of Parliament|MP]].

'''Europeana 1914–1918''' is a major project to digitise and publish primary and secondary historical sources on the [[World War I|First World War]]. It is coordinated by [[Europeana]], as part of a broader program to digitise European cultural heritage.

The collection is composed of three major elements. The first, also titled '''Europeana 1914–1918''', gathers digitised memorabilia and personal stories from individuals, including a series of public workshops where material can be scanned or photographed. The second, '''Europeana Collections 1914–1918''', is a coordinated digitisation program by ten major libraries across eight European countries. The third element, '''EFG1914''', is a project to digitise a substantial number of wartime silent films through the [[European Film Gateway]].

==Background==

The Europeana 1914–1918 project was publicly announced in 2011, as "Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Remembering the First World War", with the goal of digitising over 400,000 source items from thirteen institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/first-world-war-british-library|title=Europe's archived trove of rare Great War documents goes online|date=13 November 2011|work=Observer|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan called for around 425,000 digitised items from the partner institutions. This would sit alongside 27,000 items (mostly photographs from the UK and France) already in Europeana, and include around 75,000 items already digitised but not yet added to Europeana. The focus was to be on "special collections" – manuscripts, artwork, rare books, maps, music, etc. – with the goal that most material provided would be rare or unique. Material would be hosted by the institutions but accessible through an aggregated service, and where possible copyright issues would be resolved to ensure maximal reusability of material.&lt;ref name="dow-12"&gt;{{citation|title=Description of Work: Europeana Collections 1914–1918 (version 1.2)|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-collections-1914-1918/outcomes/-/document_library_display/fTO5/view/0/61602|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the project was anticipated to cost around 5.4 million euro, the bulk of which was due to 3.1 million euro in staffing costs at the partner institutions and 1 million in costs for sub-contracted digitisation. (The bulk of digitisation was carried out in-house.)

Material from "Collections" was released to the Europeana site as it was digitised and uploaded, with the first collections (newspapers from Austria and photographs/magazines from Italy) released in March 2012. The first public events to showcase these digitised collections began in 2013, continuing through release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/events/|title=Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Events|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public "Europeana 1914–18" project opened for online submissions and began the first public roadshow events in March 2011. These events invited members of the public to bring physical artefacts or documents to be digitised, and to record information or stories connected to them. 51 sessions were run across Europe up to December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-1914-1918|title=Europeana 1914–1918: Background|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public initiative used the Community Collection Model founded by Stuart Lee and Kate Lindsay at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Stuart|last2=Lindsay|first2=Kate|title=If You Build It, They Will Scan: Oxford University’s Exploration of Community Collections|journal=Educause Quarterly|date=30 July 2009|volume=32|issue=2|url=http://er.educause.edu/en/Articles/2009/7/If-You-Build-It-They-Will-Scan-Oxford-Universitys-Exploration-of-Community-Collections|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used for [http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/ The Great War Archive]. The University of Oxford was a partner in Europeana 1914–1918, providing support in the development of the online platform and training to all institutions running roadshow events.

==Release and reception==
[[File:Hitlertextcard.jpg|thumb|A postcard sent by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1916, digitised at a public roadshow in 2012.]]

The main public-facing portal for the overall project (&lt;tt&gt;europeana1914-18.eu&lt;/tt&gt;) was launched at the [[Berlin State Library]] on 29 January 2014 by [[Monika Grütters]], the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media. At the time of launch, the site had around 400,000 digitised items from the partner institutions, alongside 90,000 "personal" items and 660 hours of film.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Phil|url=http://www.infotoday.eu/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Europeana-1914-1918-the-untold-stories-and-offical-histories-94710.aspx |title=Europeana 1914–1918: the untold stories and official histories|work=Information Today|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction to the collections has often highlighted individual items or small collections. For example, digitised correspondence from the British Library's [[India Office]] collections has been used to highlight the involvement of Indian soldiers, particularly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/21/found-translation-indias-first-world-war|title=The last post: letters home to India during the first world war|first=Daljit|last=Nagra|date=21 February 2014|work=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/india/the-forgotten-indian-soldiers-of-wwis-european-battlefields|date=9 March 2014|title=The forgotten Indian soldiers of WWI's European battlefields|first=Samanth|last=Subramanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early find during the public digitisation project was a postcard (''right'') sent by [[Adolf Hitler]] to a fellow soldier while recuperating in hospital, which attracted a great deal of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News Online|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17908150|title=Hitler postcard found in World War I project|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Nations Endangered and Endangered Languages Program''' (FNEL, formerly known as the First Nations Languages Program, FNLG) was initiated in 1996 as part of [[University of British Columbia]]’s ongoing commitment to community-based collaboration with [[First Nations]] peoples, in recognition of the profound importance of First Nations languages, and the rich cultural traditions they represent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Academic Calendar 2017/18|url=http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,197,282,689|website=UBC Calendar|publisher=Student Services|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FNEL and UBC’s [[Vancouver]] Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the [[Halkomelem|hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓]]-speaking [[Musqueam]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhou|first1=Helen|title=Our Campus: Elder Larry Grant finds a voice for Indigenous languages|url=https://www.ubyssey.ca/features/larry-grant-finds-a-voice/|website=The Ubyssey U|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
In 1997, a partnership was initiated between the First Nations Languages Program and the [[Musqueam Indian Band]] to promote the development and use of hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓, Musqueam’s traditional language, through collaborative research initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origins of Our Program|url=http://fnel.arts.ubc.ca/origins/|website=First Nations and Endangered Languages Program|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Program==
The program regularly offers university-level language courses in hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. FNEL students have benefited from various other First Nations languages, including [[Cree]] (Plains Algonquian) [[Kwak'wala|Kwak̓wala]] (Northern Wakashan), Nɬe’kepmxcin (Northern Interior Salish), Dakelh Dene (Carrier Athapaskan), Dene Zāge’ (Kaska Athabaskan) and Nuu-chah-nulth (Southern Wakashan). FNEL methodology courses explore the processes and protocols for the documentation, conservation, revitalization, and reclamation of endangered languages, cultures, and Indigenous knowledge systems locally, regionally and internationally. 

The ''First Nations Unicode Font'' was developed by the UBC FNEL Program under the auspices of a UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF), and is accessible to anyone with the aim of promoting documentation and literacy in First Nations languages.

'''''Flores de otro mundo''''' ({{lang-en|'''Flowers from another world'''}})  is a 1999 Spanish film, written and directed by [[Icíar Bollaín]] and starring [[José Sancho]], [[Luis Tosar]] and Lisete Mejía.&lt;ref name = "Benavent 263"&gt;Benavent, ''Cine Español de los Noventa'' , p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The plot follows three women who arrive to a village in rural Spain looking for love and to start a new life.&lt;ref name = "Benavent 264"&gt;Benavent, ''Cine Español de los Noventa'' , p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Very well received, the film won the [[International Critics' Week]] Grand Prix  award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Benavent 264"/&gt;

== Plot ==
A group of women arrive by bus to a small town in the depopulated central [[Province of Guadalajara]], where there is a scarcity of single women and economic opportunities. The men have organized an annual party to get to know available ladies with the hopes of falling in love and finding a wife. Women hope to find stability, companionship, immigration papers or a combination of the three.

The group of women include: Marirrosi, a divorced nurse from [[Bilbao]] who is lonely and looking for love; Patricia, a young woman with two children from the [[Dominican Republic]] who has been in Spain illegally and having difficulties to find decent work; and (joining later) Milady, a young Cuban who wants to see the world at any cost. They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patricia, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in [[Havana]]. Carmelo tries to impress her with a big television and modern kitchen, but what she really wants to do is go to discos and have fun. She is in no way ready to settle down. Her dream of a life in Europe is very different from his fantasy of life with a gorgeous young wife. Milady is flirty and does not love Carmelo. Wanting to see the sea in Valencia, she takes a ride from a truck driver. When she comes back to town, the jealous Carmelo gives her a beating. Milady wishes she could leave him, but she has few friends and no real place to go.

Marirrosi, the oldest of the three women, has a grown up son and is tired of her job in Bilbao. She finds love with Alfonso, a gentle soft-spoken gardener. However, she is unwilling to give up city life for fields and cows, while he is unwilling to even consider living in a city. Unable to resolve their differences, she eventually breaks up with him.

At the farm, Patricia receives the visit of some of her friends and this creates confrontation with Gregoria, but Damian comes to Patricia’s defense and the relation between the two women improves. However the father of Patricia’s two children reappears in her life wanting to take advantage of her steadier situation. In a frank talk with Damian, Patricia admits that if she could have found work and been able to take care for herself either in the Dominican Republic or Spain, she probably wouldn't have married him. But now that she is there, she realizes that she wants to be his companion and stable love. Damian and Patricia have an argument after her honest revelation. He believes that she is taking advantage of him and he tells her to leave with her children. At the last minute, persuaded by his mother, Damian stops them from leaving and he and Patricia reconcile. Later on, we see Patricia’s daughter making her first communion in the local church.

Milady captures the attention of Oscar, a young man infatuated with her. He helps her escape the town but in a stop in a hotel she also leaves him, taking the road on her own. Carmelo deals alone with his disappointment of Milady’s sudden departure.

Alfonso is devastated when he receives Marirrosi’s letter breaking up with him. At the village’s bar Alfonso gives some advice to the local single men. Another bus, full of hopeful single women, is arriving in town.

==Influence==
The film was inspired by Spanish country bachelors, such as those from [[Plan (Spain)|Plan]], who organized parties to attract marriable women from cities, since rural women tended to [[rural exodus|emigrate to the cities]].
These "caravans of women" took inspiration from the Western ''[[Westward the Women]]''.

==DVD release==
''Flores de otro mundo'' (''flowers from another world'') was released on [[DVD]] in the United States on October 18, 2005. The film is in  Spanish  with English subtitles. There are no extras features.

'''Hope Cooke''' (born June 24, 1940) is an American who was the "Gyalmo"  ({{bo|t=རྒྱལ་མོ་|w=rgyal mo}}) ([[Monarch|Queen Consort]]) of the 12th [[Chogyal]] (King) of [[Sikkim]], [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html|title=The Fairy Tale That Turned Nightmare?|date=March 8, 1981|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wedding took place in March 1963. She was termed ''Her Highness The Crown Princess of Sikkim'' and became the ''Gyalmo of Sikkim'' at Palden Thondup Namgyal's coronation in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, H. (1980) Time Change. Simon &amp; Shuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palden Thondup Namgyal was to be the last king of Sikkim as a [[protectorate]] state under India. By 1973, both the country and their marriage were crumbling; soon Sikkim was annexed by India. Five months after the takeover of Sikkim had begun, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980; Namgyal died of cancer in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Palden Thondup Namgyal, Deposed Sikkim King, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/obituaries/palden-thondup-namgyal-deposed-sikkim-king-dies.html  |quote=The deposed King of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal, who had been undergoing treatment for cancer in New York, died last night from complications following an operation at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

Cooke wrote an autobiography, ''Time Change'' ([[Simon &amp; Schuster]] 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an [[urban historian]]. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published ''Seeing New York'' ([[Temple University Press]] 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''); and taught at [[Yale University]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], and [[Birch Wathen Lenox School|Birch Wathen]], a New York City private school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale Himalaya |url=http://himalaya.yale.edu/events/sikkim-film-and-discussion |accessdate=December 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016043327/http://himalaya.yale.edu/events/sikkim-film-and-discussion |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Cooke was born in San Francisco to an Irish-American father, John J. Cooke, a flight instructor, and Hope Noyes, an amateur pilot. She was raised in the [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1982"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/obituaries/palden-thondup-namgyal-deposed-sikkim-king-dies.html?pagewanted=all Palden Thondup Namgyal, Deposed Sikkim King, Dies - Nytimes.Com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Hope Noyes, died in January 1942 at age 25 when the plane she was flying solo crashed.&lt;ref name=po&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078770,00.html "Being a Queen Didn't Quite Work Out, but on This Cooke's Tour Hope Springs Eternal"], ''People'', March 9, 1981, Vol. 15, No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1513712/bio IMDb biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

After her mother's death, Cooke and her half-sister, Harriet Townsend, moved to a New York City apartment across the hall from their maternal grandparents, Helen (Humpstone) and Winchester Noyes, the president of J.{{nbsp}}H. Winchester &amp; Co., an international shipping brokerage firm. They were raised by a succession of governesses.&lt;ref name=po/&gt; Her grandfather died when she was 12, her grandmother, three years later. Cooke became the [[ward (law)|ward]] of her aunt and uncle, Mary Paul (Noyes) and [[Selden Chapin]], a former [[United States Ambassador to Iran|US Ambassador to Iran]] and [[United States Ambassador to Peru|Peru]]. She studied at the [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]] in New York and attended the [[Madeira School]] for three years before finishing high school in Iran.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

==Marriage to the Crown Prince of Sikkim==
[[File:Koning en koningin van Sikkim (1966).jpg|thumb|left|The King and Queen of Sikkim (1966)]]
In 1959 Cooke was a freshman majoring in [[Asian Studies]] at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and sharing an apartment with actress [[Jane Alexander]]. She went on a summer trip to India and met [[Palden Thondup Namgyal]], Crown Prince of [[Sikkim]], in the lounge&lt;ref&gt;Duff, A. (2015) Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom. Berlinn Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Windamere Hotel]] in [[Darjeeling]], India. He was a recent widower with two sons and a daughter and, at age 36, nearly twice her age. They were drawn to each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. Two years later, in 1961, their engagement was announced, but the wedding was put off for more than a year because astrologers in both Sikkim and India warned that 1962 was an inauspicious year for marriages.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

On March 20, 1963, Cooke married Namgyal in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery in a ceremony performed by fourteen [[lama]]s. Wedding guests included members of Indian royalty, Indian and Sikkimese generals, and the [[U.S. Ambassador to India]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Cooke [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced her United States citizenship]] as required by Sikkim's laws and also as a demonstration to the people of Sikkim that she was not an "American arm" in the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="ERG19760613"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19760613&amp;id=B6xVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6804,2964388|title=Hope Cooke seeks to regain U.S. citizenship |work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=June 13, 1976|accessdate=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was dropped from the [[Social Register]] but the marriage was reported in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' followed the royal couple on one of their yearly trips to America.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Although her husband was Buddhist, Cooke did not officially convert from Christianity to Buddhism though she had practiced Buddhism from an early age on (as Henry Kissinger once remarked "she has become more Buddhist than the population").&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, S.

At the same time, Sikkim was under strain due to annexation pressures from India. Crowds marched on the palace against the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Francine Du Plessix, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/08/books/the-fairy-tale-that-turned-nightmare.html The Fairy Tale That Turned Nightmare?], ''New York Times'', March 8, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke's husband was deposed on April{{nbsp}}10, 1975 and confined to his palace under house arrest.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;

==Later life==
With child support from Namgyal and an inheritance from her grandparents, she rented an apartment in [[Yorkville, Manhattan]]. This time around, she felt "profoundly displaced" in the city and started going on walking tours and then creating her own.&lt;ref name=nym&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7uQCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Hope+Cooke&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Hope%20Cooke&amp;f=false "Cooke's Tours"], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', p.{{nbsp}}31 (September 26, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; She studied Dutch journals, old church sermons, and newspaper articles to acquaint herself with the city and lectured on the [[social history]] of New York. She wrote a weekly column, "Undiscovered Manhattan", for ''[[Daily News (New York)|The Daily News]]''. Her books include an award-winning memoir of her life in Sikkim, ''Time Change: An Autobiography'' (1981), an off-the-beaten-path guide to New York, ''Seeing New York'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/784_reg.html&lt;/ref&gt; developed from her walking tours, and, with [[Jacques d'Amboise (dancer)|Jacques d'Amboise]], she published ''Teaching the Magic of Dance''.&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;

Cooke remarried in 1983 to [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Mike Wallace]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning historian and Distinguished Professor of History at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name=wa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100612094942/http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/history/facultyprofile/wallace.asp "Mike Wallace"], John Jay College of Criminal Justice website; accessed December 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They later divorced. Hope Cooke's son, Prince Palden, a New York banker and financial advisor, married Kesang Deki Tashi and has a son and three daughters. Cooke's daughter, Princess Hope, graduated from [[Milton Academy]] and [[Georgetown University]], and married (and later divorced) Thomas Gwyn Reich, Jr., a U.S. Foreign Service officer; she later remarried, to Yep Wangyal Tobden. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Interbay (Seattle)|Interbay]] [[P-Patch]], "The Garden Between The Bays", is one of [[Seattle, Washington]]'s largest{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} and most involved {{citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[community garden]]s, and is recognized as an {{citation needed|date=July 2008}} example of resourcefulness and sustainability.

== Overview ==

City residents may rent up to {{convert|400|sqft|m2|0}} of space in the garden from the city annually. Gardeners may grow whatever they wish except for trees or large bushes and the produce from each plot remains the property of the gardener. Over {{convert|4400|sqft|m2|-1}} of garden space along the fences are dedicated to [[food bank]] gardening, which traditionally furnishes about two tons of produce to community food banks each year. The east side of the garden features an [[orchard]] of [[plum]], [[pear]], and [[apple]] trees, many of which gardeners moved from the previous garden location. [[Honey bee]] [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hives]] are nestled in a secure enclosure near the back of the garden.

Gardeners originally established the garden in 1974 as one of the earliest [[P-Patch]] locations in the city. First located on [[landfill]] that is now the northwest corner of the Interbay Family Golf Center's [[driving range]], the garden has moved twice. Since the spring of 1997 it has been at its current site extending north of [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=15th+Ave.+W.+and+W.+Wheeler+St.,+Seattle,+WA+98119&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;ll=47.641104,-122.376194&amp;spn=0.013793,0.035148&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr Wheeler Street along 15th Avenue West].

Finding a permanent home for the Interbay P-Patch was a long and difficult process. In 1980 the [[Seattle City Council]] passed a resolution that guaranteed an [[Acre#United States survey acre|acre]] for community gardening on the [[Interbay, Seattle, Washington|Interbay]] landfill. In 1992, however, with gardens established for 18 years, Interbay P-Patch gardeners had to move the P-Patch to the northeast corner of the landfill to make way for a proposed [[golf course]]. The [[soil]] in the new location was heavy with [[clay]] and lacked [[humus]].  Gardeners labored to build the soil.  Garden volunteers used money from a Neighborhood Matching [[Grant (money)|Grant]] to build the first tool shed and [[compost]] bins.  Gardeners also added the food bank area, and built [[Raised bed gardening|raised beds]].

Four years later, in 1996, the city announced new plans for a golf course. Gardeners feared the Interbay P-Patch was doomed. But with the 1980 resolution still in force and broad public support, Interbay P-Patch survived. The City Council adopted a new resolution allocating funding to move the Interbay P-Patch and ensure garden plots equal to or better than the existing gardens.  The resolution guaranteed gardeners {{convert|18|in|mm}} of soil, and raised beds.

Because the new soil was without life, Interbay again began serious composting and soil building efforts.  In addition to recycling the garden's plant material, grass clippings from local [[Landscaping|landscapers]] who do not use [[pesticide]]s or [[herbicide]]s, and leaf deliveries from the city Street and Parks Departments are recycled to make tons of [[Organic gardening|organic]] compost.

[[Recycling]] is a part of the garden's culture. The main north-south walkway is made from recycled pavers from [[Alki Beach]], and the main walkway includes granite pavers from [[South Africa]] that did not meet the standards for [[Westlake Center|Westlake Mall]].

The Rowe family donated the [[greenhouse]] to the garden in 2000, and in 2003 the city donated the arbor entrances, which previously served as security enclosures for portable public toilets. Interbay gardeners donated a memorial bench at the north arbor entrance in honor of Claire "Pappy" Watkins, Interbay's late "King of Compost".

Ray Schutte designed and built the cobblestone entrance walkway and planter in 2006 from [[cobblestone]]s first used as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] in ships before their installation at Seattle's [[Occidental Park (Seattle)|Occidental Park]]. When the city redesigned the park, Interbay P-Patch was fortunate enough to receive these cobblestones.

The {{convert|30|ft|m|0|sing=on}} aluminum [[Flagpole (structure)#Flagpoles|flag pole]] was one of the original 50 poles placed in front of the 1962 [[Century 21 Exposition|World's Fair]] Flag Pavilion.

''CAST design/build'' designed Interbay's award-winning tool shed/library/kitchen, completed in 2002.  The shed and surrounding open space are the focal point for many community events, including Friday night [[potluck]]s, Saturday lunches, a New Year's Day celebration, and several garden fundraisers each year.  CAST design/build also designed the [[kiosk]], added in 2004. Lease Crutcher Lewis donated materials, and a grant from [[Starbucks]] helped pay for the kiosk.  Gardener and facilities Coordinator Bruce Swee designed the kiosk's [[water feature]] to honor long-time Interbay gardeners Anne and Mac Magruder, who planted the grape arbor.

The "Gathering Bell" at the edge of the garden's plaza was given to [[Airgas]] Nor Pac as thanks for its financial support of [[cystic fibrosis]] cure research. Airgas wished to share this with the community and decided to donate it to the Interbay P-Patch in 2006.

Bruce Swee designed the Interbay P-Patch flag donated to the garden by John and Vickie Bjorkman in 2005. Garden fundraising events also funded Bruce Swee's design and construction of the steel gates on the [[Woodchipper|chipper/shredder]] storage shed in 2007.

Volunteers who garden at Interbay built and maintain the structures and community areas at the garden. The gardening community welcomes visitors to enjoy their garden and social events.

'''Judeo-Marathi''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] spoken by the [[Bene Israel]], a [[Jewish ethnic group]] that developed a unique identity in [[India]] and in [[Pakistan]]. Judæo-Marathi is, like other Marathi, written in the [[Devanagari]] script. It may not be sufficiently different from [[Marathi language|Marathi]] as to constitute a distinct language, although it is characterized by a number of [[loanword]]s from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as a result of influence from the [[Cochin Jew]]ish community, [[Judæo-Malayalam]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and also some influence from the [[Urdu]] language.

The Judæo-Marathi community mainly resides in [[Raigad district|Raigad]] and [[Thane]] districts and the city of [[Mumbai]] in [[Maharashtra]]. The majority of its members have emigrated to [[Israel]], and most of the rest live in [[England]] and [[Canada]]. Recently, a rare Marathi-Hebrew text titled "Poona Haggadah", was found in [[Manchester]]. The 137-year-old book, which was used by the Bene-Israel community, was discovered by a [[University of Manchester]] historian, Yaakov Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5235189 MSN India News, 26/6/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Jurubaça|thumbnail]] --&gt;
'''Jurubaça''' was a term for [[interpreter]] in the [[Portuguese Empire#Southeast Asia and the spice trade|Portuguese colonies of Southeast Asian]] and the Far East, particularly in [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]].  The term is prevalent in mid-sixteenth through eighteenth-century documents. According to the ''Grande Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa'', a Jurubaça was an “Antigo intérprete da Malásia e do Extremo Oriente,” an ancient interpreter in Malaysia and the Far East.  The word derives from Malay jurubassa (juru bahasa) which translates as a person who is an interpreter.   The earliest document utilizing the word iurubaças dates from the sixteenth century.

{{human history}}
The '''Late Bronze Age collapse''' involved a [[Greek Dark Ages |dark-age]] transition period in the [[Near East]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Aegean Sea#History|Aegean region]], [[North Africa]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the Late [[Bronze Age]] to the Early [[Iron Age]], a transition which historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive. The [[palace economy]] of the Aegean region and [[Anatolia]] that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the [[Greek Dark Ages]]. The half-century between {{circa |1200}} and 1150 BC saw the cultural collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece| Mycenaean kingdoms]], of the [[Kassite dynasty]] of [[Babylonia]], of the [[Hittites |Hittite Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]], and of the [[Egyptian Empire]];&lt;ref&gt;For Syria, see M. Liverani, "The collapse of the Near Eastern regional system at the end of the Bronze Age: the case of Syria" in ''Centre and Periphery in the Ancient World'', M. Rowlands, M.T. Larsen, K. Kristiansen, eds. ([[Cambridge University Press]]) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; the destruction of [[Ugarit]] and the [[Amorite]] states in the [[Levant]],  the fragmentation of the [[Luwian]] states of western Asia Minor, and a period of chaos in [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Within a period of forty to fifty years at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the twelfth century almost every significant city in the eastern Mediterranean world was destroyed, many of them never to be occupied again.&lt;ref&gt;
Drews, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;4
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A very few powerful states, particularly [[Assyria]] and [[Elam]], survived the Bronze Age collapse – but by the end of the 12th century BC, Elam waned after its defeat by [[Nebuchadnezzar I]], who briefly revived Babylonian fortunes before suffering a series of defeats by the Assyrians. Upon the death of  [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a comparative decline for the next 100 or so years, its empire shrinking significantly.  By 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only the areas in its immediate vicinity; the well-defended Assyria itself was not threatened during the collapse. Gradually, by the end of the ensuing Dark Age, remnants of the Hittites coalesced into small [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Syro-Hittite states| Syro-Hittite]] states in [[Cilicia]] and the [[Levant]], the latter states being composed of mixed Hittite and [[Aramean]] polities.  Beginning in the mid-10th century BC, a series of small [[Aramaeans |Aramaean]] kingdoms formed in the [[Levant]] and the [[Philistines]] settled in southern [[Canaan]] where the Canaanite-speaking Semites had coalesced into a number of defined polities such as [[Israel]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and [[Ammon]]. From 935 BC Assyria began to reorganise and once more expand outwards, leading to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC), which came to control a vast area from the Caucasus to Egypt, and from Greek Cyprus to Persia. [[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Lydians]] arrived in Asia Minor, and a new Hurrian polity of [[Urartu]] formed in eastern Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus, where the [[Colchians]] ([[Georgian people|Georgians]]) also emerged. [[Iranian peoples]] such as the [[Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and Sargatians first appeared in [[Ancient Iran]] soon after 1000 BC, displacing earlier non-Indo-European [[Kassites]], [[Hurrians]] and [[Gutians]] in the northwest of the region, although the indigenous [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Elamites]] and [[Manneans]] continued to dominate the southwest and [[Caspian Sea]] regions respectively. After the [[Orientalizing period|Orientalising period]] in the [[Aegean region|Aegean]], [[Classical Greece]] emerged.

==Regional evidence==

===Evidence of destruction===

====Anatolia====
Before the Bronze Age collapse, [[Anatolia]] (Asia Minor) was dominated by a number of peoples of varying ethno-linguistic origins: including [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Amorites]], [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Hurrians]], [[Kaskians]] and [[Hattians]], and later-arriving [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] peoples such as [[Luwians]], [[Hittites]], [[Mitanni]], and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Greeks]]. From the 16th century BC, the Mitanni (a migratory minority speaking an [[Indo-Aryan language]]) formed a ruling class over the Hurrians, an ancient indigenous Caucasian people who spoke a [[Hurro-Urartian language]], a [[language isolate]]. Similarly, the [[Indo-Anatolian]]-speaking Hittites absorbed the [[Hattians]],&lt;ref&gt;Gurnet, Otto, (1982), ''The Hittites'' (Penguin) pp. 119–130.&lt;/ref&gt; a people speaking a language that may have been of the non–Indo-European [[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] language group or a [[language isolate]].

Every Anatolian site, apart from integral [[Assyria|Assyrian]] regions in the south east, and regions in eastern, central and southern Anatolia under the control of the powerful [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1050 BC) that was important during the preceding Late Bronze Age shows a [[destruction layer]], and it appears that in these regions civilization did not recover to the level of the Assyrians and Hittites for another thousand years or so. The Hittites, already weakened by a series of military defeats and annexations of their territory by the Middle Assyrian Empire (which had already destroyed the Hurrian-Mitanni Empire)  then suffered a [[coup de grâce]] when  [[Hattusa]]s, the Hittite capital, was burned, probably by the [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Kaskians]], long indigenous to the southern shores of the [[Black Sea]], and possibly aided by the incoming Indo-European–speaking [[Phrygians]]). The city was abandoned and never reoccupied.

Karaoğlan{{efn|The name Karaoglan is Turkish, the original Hittite name is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;}} (near present-day [[Ankara]]) was burned and the corpses left unburied.&lt;ref name="Drews1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Drews|title=The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA8|year=1995|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0691025916|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other sites that were not destroyed were abandoned.&lt;ref name="Robbins2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Robbins|title=Collapse of the Bronze Age: The Story of Greece, Troy, Israel, Egypt, and the Peoples of the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuczEUuOt6UC&amp;pg=PA170|year=2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0595136643|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Luwian]] city of [[Troy]] was destroyed at least twice, before being abandoned until Roman times. ([[Trojan War]])

The Phrygians had arrived (probably over the [[Bosphorus]] or [[Caucasus]]) in the 13th century BC&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites''. (Clarendon), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;, before being first checked by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and then conquered by them in the Early Iron Age of the 12th century BC. Other groups of Indo-European peoples followed the Phrygians into the region, most prominently the [[Doric Greeks]] and [[Lydians]], and in the centuries ''after'' the period of Bronze Age Collapse, the [[Cimmerians]], and [[Scythians]] also appeared. The [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Arameans]], [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]-speaking [[Colchians]] ([[Georgian people|Georgians]]), and revived [[Hurrian]] polities, particularly [[Urartu]], [[Nairi]] and [[Shupria]] also emerged in parts of the region and southern [[Caucasus]]. The Assyrians simply continued their already extant policies, by conquering any of these new peoples and polities they came into contact with, as they had with the preceding polities of the region. However Assyria gradually withdrew from much of the region for a time in the second half of the 11th century BC, although they continued to campaign militarily at times, in order to protect their borders and keep trade routes open, until a renewed vigorous period of expansion in the late 10th century BC.

These sites in Anatolia show evidence of the collapse:

* [[Miletus]]
* [[Hattusas]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' (Clarendon), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mersin]]
* [[Tarhuntassa]]

====Cyprus====
The catastrophe separates [[Prehistoric Cyprus|Late Cypriot II]] (LCII) from the LCIII period, with the sacking and burning of [[Enkomi]], [[Kition]], and [[Sinta, Cyprus|Sinda]], which may have occurred twice before those sites were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Manuel (2001). ''Collapse of the Bronze Age: The Story of Greece, Troy, Israel and Egypt and the Peoples of the Sea''. pp. 220–239&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Hittite king [[Tudhaliya IV]] (reigned c. 1237–1209 BC), the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites,&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' (Clarendon), p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; either to secure the [[copper]] resource or as a way of preventing [[piracy]].

Shortly afterwards, the island was reconquered by his son around 1200 BC. Some towns (Enkomi, Kition, Palaeokastro and Sinda) show traces of destruction at the end of LCII. Whether or not this is really an indication of a Mycenean invasion is contested.&lt;!--a reference to published doubts would do well here--&gt; Originally, two waves of destruction in c. 1230 BC by the [[Sea Peoples]] and c. 1190 BC by [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[refugees]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Aström has proposed dates of 1190 and 1179 BC (Aström).&lt;/ref&gt;{{who|date=January 2016}}{{clarify|date=January 2016}}

[[Alashiya]] was plundered by the Sea Peoples and ceased to exist in 1085.

The smaller settlements of [[Ayios Dhimitrios]] and [[Kokkinokremnos]], as well as a number of other sites, were abandoned but do not show traces of destruction. Kokkinokremos was a short-lived settlement, where various caches concealed by [[metalsmith|smith]]s have been found. That no one ever returned to reclaim the treasures suggests that they were killed or enslaved. Recovery occurred only in the Early Iron Age with Phoenician and Greek settlement. 

These sites in Cyprus show evidence of the collapse:
* Palaeokastro
* [[Kition]]
* Sinda
* [[Enkomi]]

====Syria====
[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|350px|A map of the Bronze Age collapse]]

Ancient Syria had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking peoples. The [[East Semitic]]-speaking [[Eblaites]], [[Akkadians]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and the [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking [[Ugarit]]es and [[Amorites]] prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=vTrT-bZyuPcC&amp;|title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia|last=Woodard|first=Roger D.|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139469340|location=|page= 5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria during this time was known as "The land of the [[Amorites|Amurru]]".

Before and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battle ground between the empires of the [[Hittites]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Mitanni]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] between the 15th and late 13th centuries BC, with the Assyrians destroying the Hurri-Mitanni empire and annexing much of the Hittite empire. The Egyptian empire had withdrawn from the region after failing to overcome the Hittites and being fearful of the ever growing Assyrian might, leaving much of the region under Assyrian control until the late 11th century BC. Later the coastal regions came under attack from the [[Sea Peoples]]. During this period, from the 12th century BC, the incoming [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking [[Arameans]] came to demographic prominence in Syria, the region outside of the Canaanite-speaking [[Phoenicia]]n coastal areas eventually came to speak [[Aramaic]] and the region came to be known as [[Aramea]] and [[Eber Nari]]. The [[Babylonians]] belatedly attempted to gain a foothold in the region during their brief revival under [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] in the 12th century BC, however they too were overcome by their Assyrian neighbours. The modern term 'Syria' is a later Indo-European corruption of 'Assyria' which only became formally applied to the Levant during the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323–150 BC) (see [[Etymology of Syria]]).

Levantine sites previously showed evidence of trade links with [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]), [[Anatolia]] ([[Hattia]], [[Hurria]], [[Luwia]] and later the [[Hittites]]), [[Egypt]] and the [[Aegean Sea#History|Aegean]] in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence at [[Ugarit]] shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merneptah (ruled 1213–1203 BC) and even the fall of [[Chancellor Bay]] (died 1192 BC). The last Bronze Age king of the [[Semitic people|Semitic]] state of Ugarit, [[Ammurapi]], was a contemporary of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Suppiluliuma II]]. The exact dates of his reign are unknown.

A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city. Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Levantine states from invasion by the advancing [[Sea Peoples]] in a dramatic response to a plea for assistance from the king of [[Alasiya]]. Ammurapi highlights the desperate situation Ugarit faced in letter RS 18.147:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My father, behold, the enemy's ships came (here); my cities(?) were burned, and they did evil things in my country. Does not my father know that all my troops and chariots(?) are in the Land of Hatti, and all my ships are in the [[Lukka lands|Land of Lukka]]?... Thus, the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it: the seven ships of the enemy that came here inflicted much damage upon us.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Nougaryol et al. (1968) Ugaritica V: 87–90 no. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No help arrived and Ugarit was burned to the ground at the end of the Bronze Age. Its destruction levels contained Late Helladic IIIB ware, but no LH IIIC (see [[Mycenaean period]]). Therefore, the date of the destruction is important for the dating of the LH IIIC phase. Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of Pharaoh [[Merneptah]] was found in the destruction levels, 1190 BC was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC.

A [[cuneiform]] tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah. It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the 8th year of [[Ramesses III]], 1178 BC. These letters on clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city speak of attack from the sea, and a letter from [[Alashiya]] ([[Cyprus]]) speaks of cities already being destroyed by attackers who came by sea. It also speaks of the Ugarit fleet being absent, patrolling the [[Lycia]]n coast.

The [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] [[Arameans]] eventually superseded the earlier [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Amorites]], [[Canaanites]] and people of [[Ugarit]]. The Arameans, together with the [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] Canaanites and  [[Neo-Hittites]] came to dominate most of the region demographically, however these people, and the Levant in general, were also conquered and dominated politically and militarily by the Middle Assyrian Empire until Assyria's withdrawal in the late 11th century BC, although the Assyrians continued to conduct military campaigns in the region. However with the rise of [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] in the late 10th century BC,  the entire region once again fell to Assyria.

* [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]
* [[Qatna]]
* [[Hamath]]
* [[Alalakh]]
* [[Aleppo]]
* [[Carchemish]]
* [[Emar]]

====Southern Levant====
Egyptian evidence shows that from the reign of [[Horemheb]] (ruled either 1319 or 1306 to 1292 BC), wandering [[Shasu]] were more problematic than the earlier [[Apiru]]. [[Ramesses II]] (ruled 1279–1213 BC) campaigned against them, pursuing them as far as [[Moab]], where he established a fortress, after a near defeat at the [[Battle of Kadesh]]. During the reign of [[Merneptah]], the [[Shasu]] threatened the "[[Via Maris|Way of Horus]]" north from Gaza. Evidence shows that Deir Alla ([[Sukkot (place)|Succoth]]) was destroyed after the reign of Queen [[Twosret]] (ruled 1191–1189 BC).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Tubbs, Johnathan (1998), "Canaanites" (British Museum Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The destroyed site of [[Lachish]] was briefly reoccupied by squatters and an Egyptian garrison, during the reign of [[Ramesses III]] (ruled 1186–1155 BC). All centres along a coastal route from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] northward were destroyed, and evidence shows Gaza, [[Ashdod]], [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], and [[Jaffa]] were burned and not reoccupied for up to thirty years. Inland [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Bethel]], [[Beit Shemesh]], [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]], [[Debir]], and other sites were destroyed. Refugees escaping the collapse of coastal centres may have fused with incoming nomadic and Anatolian elements to begin the growth of terraced hillside hamlets in the highlands region that was associated with the later development of the [[Hebrews]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the reign of Rameses III, [[Philistines]] were allowed to resettle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa, [[Denyen]] (possibly the [[tribe of Dan]] in the Bible, or more likely the people of Adana, also known as Danuna, part of the Hittite Empire) settled from [[Jaffa|Joppa]] to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and [[Tjekker]] in Acre. The sites quickly achieved independence, as the ''[[Tale of Wenamun]]'' shows. 

These sites in [[Southern Levant]] show evidence of the collapse:
* [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]]
* [[Akko]]
* [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]
* Deir 'Alla ([[Sukkot (place)|Sukkot]])
* [[Bethel]]
* Beth Shemesh
* [[Lachish]]
* [[Ashdod]]
* [[Ashkelon]]

====Greece====
{{Main article|Greek Dark Ages}}

None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived (with the possible exception of the [[Cyclopean]] fortifications on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]), with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. Up to 90% of small sites in the [[Peloponnese]] were abandoned, suggesting a major depopulation.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], which lasted roughly 400 years and ended with the establishment of [[Archaic Greece]]. Other cities like [[Athens]] continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Areas that survived===

====Mesopotamia====
The [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1056 BC) had destroyed the [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] [[Empire]], annexed much of the [[Hittite Empire]] and eclipsed the [[Egyptian Empire]], and at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse controlled an empire stretching from the [[Caucasus mountains]] in the north to the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the south, and from [[Ancient Iran]] in the east to [[Cyprus]] in the west. However, in the 12th century BC, Assyrian satrapies in [[Anatolia]] came under attack from the [[Mushki]] ([[Phrygians]]), and those in the Levant from [[Arameans]], but [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (reigned 1114–1076 BC) was able to defeat and repel these attacks, conquering the incomers. The Middle Assyrian Empire survived intact throughout much of this period, with Assyria dominating and often ruling [[Babylonia]] directly, controlling south east and south western [[Anatolia]], north western [[Iran]] and much of northern and central [[Syria]] and [[Canaan]], as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arameans]] and [[Phrygians]] were subjected, and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the [[Sea Peoples]] who had ravaged Egypt and much of the East Mediterranean, and the Assyrians often conquered as far as [[Phoenicia]] and the [[East Mediterranean]]. However, after the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria withdrew to areas close to its natural borders, encompassing what is today northern Iraq, north east Syria, the fringes of north west Iran, and south eastern Turkey. Assyria still retained a stable monarchy, the best army in the world, and an efficient civil administration, enabling it to survive the Bronze Age Collapse intact. Assyrian written records remained numerous and the most consistent in the world during the period, and the Assyrians were still able to mount long range military campaigns in all directions when necessary. From the late 10th century BC, it once more began to assert itself internationally, with the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] growing to be the largest the world had yet seen.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The situation in [[Babylonia]] was very different. After the Assyrian withdrawal, it was still subject to periodic Assyrian (and [[Elamite]]) subjugation, and new groups of [[Semitic people|Semites]], such as the [[Aramaeans]], [[Suteans]] (and in the period after the Bronze Age Collapse, [[Chaldea]]ns also), spread unchecked into Babylonia from the Levant, and the power of its weak kings barely extended beyond the city limits of Babylon. Babylon was sacked by the [[Elam]]ites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] (c. 1185–1155 BC), and lost control of the [[Diyala River]] valley to [[Assyria]].

====Egypt====
{{Main article|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}
After apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid-twelfth century BC (during the reign of [[Ramesses VI]], 1145 to 1137 BC). Previously, the [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1200 BC) spoke of attacks ([[:de:Libyerkrieg (Merenptah)|Libyan War]]) from [[Putrians]] (from modern [[Libya]]), with associated people of [[Achaeans (Homer)|Ekwesh]], [[Sea Peoples|Shekelesh]], [[Lukka lands|Lukka]], [[Sherden|Shardana]] and [[Tursha]] or [[Tyrrhenians|Teresh]] (possibly [[Troy|Troas]]), and a Canaanite revolt, in the cities of [[Ashkelon]], [[Yenoam]] and among the people of [[Israel]]. A second attack ([[Battle of the Delta]] and [[Battle of Djahy]]) during the reign of [[Ramesses III]] (1186–1155 BC) involved [[Philistines|Peleset]], [[Tjeker]], [[Sherden|Shardana]] and [[Denyen]].

===Conclusion===
[[Robert Drews]] describes the collapse as "the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the [[collapse of the Western Roman Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:1, quotes Fernand Braudel's assessment that the Eastern Mediterranean cultures returned almost to a starting-point ("plan zéro"), "L'Aube", in Braudel, F. (ed.) (1977), ''La Mediterranee: l'espace et l'histoire'' (Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural memories of the disaster told of a "lost [[golden age]]": for example, [[Hesiod]] spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze, separated from the cruel modern Age of Iron by the [[Greek Heroic Age|Age of Heroes]]. [[Rodney Castledon]] suggests that memories of the Bronze Age collapse influenced [[Plato]]'s story of [[Atlantis]]&lt;ref&gt;Castledon, Rodney (1998), "Atlantis Destroyed" (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and the [[Critias]].

==Possible causes==
Various theories have been put forward as possible contributors to the collapse, many of them mutually compatible.

===Environmental===

====Climate change====
{{Main article|Bond event}}
Changes in climate similar to the [[Younger Dryas]] period or the [[Little Ice Age]] punctuate human history. The local effects of these changes may cause crop failures in multiple consecutive years, leading to warfare as a last-ditch effort at survival. The triggers for climate change are still debated, but ancient peoples could not have predicted substantial climate changes.{{clarify|reason=This text does not seem to have any specific relation to the topic of the Late Bronze Age collapse.|date=October 2018}}{{citation-needed|reason=Some source is needed to tie this vague statement to the topic of the Late Bronze Age collapse.|date=October 2018}}

====Volcanoes====
The [[Hekla 3 eruption]] approximately coincides with this period; and, while the exact date is under considerable dispute, one group calculated the date to be specifically 1159 BC, implicating the eruption in the collapse in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Yurco, Frank J. "End of the Late Bronze Age and Other Crisis Periods: A Volcanic Cause". in Teeter, Emily; Larson, John (eds.). ''Gold of Praise: Studies on Ancient Egypt in Honor of Edward F. Wente''. (Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilization 58.) Chicago: [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago]]. 1999:456–458. {{ISBN|1885923090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drought====
Using the [[Palmer Drought Index]] for 35 Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations, it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January AD 1972 would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Harvey|title=The decline of Late Bronze Age civilization as a possible response to climatic change|journal=Climatic Change|volume=4|issue=2|date=June 1982|pages=173–198|doi=10.1007/BF00140587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars.

More recently, it has been shown how the diversion of midwinter storms from the Atlantic to north of the [[Pyrenees]] and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian M. |year=2003 |title=The Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization |location= |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen in [[sediment core]]s from the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] show that there was a period of severe drought at the start of the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kershner |first=Isabel |date=22 October 2013 |title=Pollen Study Points to Drought as Culprit in Bronze Age Mystery |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/middleeast/pollen-study-points-to-culprit-in-bronze-era-mystery.html?pagewanted=all |journal=[[The New York Times]] |doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langgut, Dafna; Finkelstein, Israel ; Litt, Thomas (October 2013) "Climate and the late Bronze Collapse: New evidence from the southern Levant", ''Journal of Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University'', '''40''' (2): 149–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===

====Ironworking====
The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of [[ironworking]] technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in the present [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Stoia and the other essays in M.L. Stig Sørensen and R. Thomas, eds., ''The Bronze Age: Iron Age Transition in Europe'' (Oxford) 1989, and T.H. Wertime and J.D. Muhly, ''The Coming of the Age of Iron'' (New Haven) 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard R. Palmer suggested that [[iron (material)|iron]], superior to bronze for weapons manufacture, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller bronze-equipped armies of [[maryannu]] [[chariot]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Leonard R (1962). ''Mycenaeans and Minoans: Aegean Prehistory in the Light of the Linear B Tablets''. New York, Alfred A. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changes in warfare====
Robert Drews argues&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:192ff&lt;/ref&gt; for the appearance of massed infantry, using newly developed weapons and armor, such as cast rather than forged spearheads and [[Bronze Age sword#Europe|long swords]], a revolutionising cut-and-thrust weapon,&lt;ref&gt;Drews 1993:194&lt;/ref&gt; and [[javelin]]s. The appearance of bronze foundries suggests "that mass production of bronze artifacts was suddenly important in the Aegean". For example, [[Homer]] uses "spears" as a [[metonymy|virtual synonym]] for "warriors".

Such new weaponry, in the hands of large numbers of "running [[skirmisher]]s", who could swarm and cut down a chariot army, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. That would precipitate an abrupt social collapse as raiders began to conquer, loot and burn cities.&lt;ref&gt;Drews, R. (1993). ''The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C.'' (Princeton).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcgoodwin.net/pages/otherbooks/rd_endbrozeage.html|title=Drews (Robert) End of Bronze Age Summary|first=Michael|last=McGoodwin|website=mcgoodwin.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alanlittle.org/weblog/chariots.html|title=alan little’s weblog|website=alanlittle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General systems collapse===

A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the [[Urnfield culture]] of the 12th and 13th centuries BC and the rise of the Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] in the 9th and 10th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html] History of Castlemagner, on the web page of the local historical society.&lt;/ref&gt; General systems collapse theory, pioneered by [[Joseph Tainter]],&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1976). ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesises how social declines in response to complexity may lead to a collapse resulting in simpler forms of society.

In the specific context of the [[Middle East]], a variety of factors – including population growth, [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies – could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to [[arable land]]) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies that were increasingly fragile and less resilient, the combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse.

The growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Carol G.;  Conant, Craig. (1999) ''Citadel to City-state: The Transformation of Greece, 1200–700 B.C.E.'', &lt;/ref&gt; together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include piracy by the [[Sea Peoples]] interrupting maritime trade, as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the [[Dorian invasion|Dorian migration or invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Eric H. (2014). "[[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed]]". Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61593">{{Short description|Best-selling fiction authors to date in any language}}
This is a list of '''best-selling [[fiction]] authors''' to date, in any language. While finding precise sales numbers for any given author is near-impossible, the list is based on approximate numbers provided or repeated by reliable sources. "Best-selling" refers to the estimated number of copies sold of all fiction books written or co-written by an author. To keep the list manageable, only authors with estimated sales of at least 100 million are included. Authors of [[comic book]]s are not included unless they have been published in book format (for example, [[Franco-Belgian comics#Formats|comic albums]], [[manga]] [[tankōbon]] volumes, [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]], or [[graphic novel]]s).

Authors such as [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Jane Austen]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Rick Riordan]], [[Jack Higgins]] and [[Leon Uris]] have not been included in the table because no exact figures could be found—although there are indications that they too have more than 100 million copies of their work in print.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A '''mandarin collar''', '''standing collar''', '''band collar''' or '''choker collar''' is a short unfolded stand-up [[collar (clothing)|collar]] style on a shirt or jacket. The style derives its Western name from the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin bureaucrats]] in [[Qing dynasty|Qing-era China]] that employed it as part of their uniform.
[[File:Chinese-man-ye-jinglu-photographic-self-portrait-aged-21.jpg|thumb|374x374px|A Chinese man, Ye Jinglu, is photographed wearing a traditional Mandarin collar shirt in the early 1900s]]

The length along a mandarin collar is straight, with either straight or rounded edges at top of the centre front.  The edges of the collar either barely meet at the centre front or overlap slightly. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a Mandarin collar? |url=https://itsmando.com/blogs/mando/what-is-a-mandarin-collar |website=MANDO Clothing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlapping mandarin collars are often a continuation of a shirt's [[placket]] and have a button on the collar to secure the two sides of the shirt together. 

==Related nomenclature==
[[Image:NehruY.gif|thumb|upright|left|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] in a ''achkan'' or ''sherwani'', a garment which served as a model for the [[Nehru jacket]] with mandarin collar]]
A similar style known as the '''Nehru collar''' is also found in some modern [[India]]n men's clothing, such as the [[Nehru jacket]]. (Named for [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Prime Minister of India]] 1947&amp;ndash;1964, who commonly wore clothing with this type of collar.)

A '''band ''' is often a mandarin collar. This term is also used for shirts that have only a flat finishing around the neckline; originally such garments were designed for use with a [[detachable collar]], a largely forgotten usage.

==Usage==
In contemporary Western dress, mandarin collars are found in oriental-style and minimalist clothing. Women's mandarin-collared jackets often include other vaguely oriental elements, such as [[silk]] [[knot]]s as closures instead of [[button]]s.

Since mandarin collars are short and do not fold over, [[necktie]]s are not worn with mandarin-collared [[dress shirt]]s. This lack of ties may have led to the recent rising popularity of mandarin collars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomascrampton.com/2007/04/10/cut-ties-join-the-mandarin-collar-society/ Cut Ties: Join The Mandarin Collar Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ACU2004-06-14.jpg|thumb|A United States soldier with "Standing Collar" Uniform]]
Mandarin collars are also utilised heavily in modern-day military combat uniforms like the [[US Army]]'s [[Army Combat Uniform]] . The presence of the mandarin collar on the ACU makes the wearing of body armor more comfortable by lifting the collar up to prevent chafing. Stand collars are also common on historically based military dress uniforms, such as dress uniforms of the [[British Army Uniforms|British Army]], [[Uniforms of the United States Navy|US Navy]] and [[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]]. Even the Russian Army uses a mandarin collar in their newer VKBO uniforms

Mandarin collars are also the proper shape for a single-breasted Greek [[cassock]], or anterri, for [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] clergy. Russians and other Slavic Churches typically have a high, band-style collar, buttoning to the side or on the shoulder, while Greeks have the "notched" Mandarin pattern with a closing loop or hook at the bottom of the "V" in the collar.

The collar is also used for the required sport fencing dress.
 
Mandarin collars feature in [[costume]]s in some notable [[films]], where they are employed either as a futuristic style fashion or to create a distinctive appearance for sinister characters. The title character in the 1962 [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]] ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', as well as Bond's nemesis, [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], both parodied by [[Dr. Evil|Doctor Evil]] in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] series of films are depicted wearing mandarin collared shirts. The mandarin collar can also be found in the uniform of the Empire's officers in the [[Star Wars]] films.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3071">'''Neo-Adlerian''' psychologists are those working in the tradition of, or influenced by [[Alfred Adler]], an early associate of, and dissident from the ideas of, [[Sigmund Freud]].

==Education==

Neo-Adlerian ideas have been identified in the field of education, associated particularly with the work of [[Rudolf Dreikurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. Miller, ''Re-Theorizing Discipline in Education'' (2010) p. 15-6&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Adlerian classroom model stresses the importance of the student's search for feelings of belonging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/education/DLiT/2006/Kylie/fkpage4.htm 'Neo-Adlerian model']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Freudians==

[[Fritz Wittels]] used the term 'Neo-Adlerian' to refer derogatively to the [[Neo-Freudianism|Neo-Freudians]], due to their emphasis on the social aspects of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2769857?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=56209140923 Fritz Wittels, 'The Neo-Adlerians']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Ansbacher]] however sought to capture the Neo-Freudians ''as'' neo-Adlerians, to promote Adler's influence.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz L. and Rowena Ansbacher eds., ''Superiority and Social Interest'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Ellenberger]] would later adjudge that what he called the neo-psychoanalysts like [[Karen Horney]] and [[Erich Fromm]] would indeed more accurately be known as neo-Adlerians.&lt;ref&gt;Henri F. Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) p. 637-41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transactional Analysis]] has also been termed a neo-Adlerian school&lt;ref&gt;Erika Stern, ''TA, the state of the art'' (1984) p. 4 and p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; - [[Eric Berne]] himself acknowledging that "of all those who preceded transactional analysis, Alfred Adler comes the closest to talking like a script analyst".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; A direct line of influence runs from Adler through [[Harry Stack Sullivan]] to [[Thomas Anthony Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Harris, ''I'm OK - You're OK'' (1969) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; - one of the co-creators of TA&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; - with Adler's ideas on guiding fictions and the sense of inferiority feeding into Berne's concept of [[psychological games]],&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 76 and p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; which can also be considered in terms of the interactions of different life style systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ellenberger, p. 643&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Online shaming''' is a form of [[Internet vigilantism]] in which targets are [[Public humiliation|publicly humiliated]] using technology like [[Social media|social]] and [[new media]]. Proponents of shaming see it as a form of [[online participation]] that allows [[hacktivism|hacktivists]] and [[cyber-dissident]]s to right injustices. Critics see it as a tool that encourages [[mob mentality|online mobs]] to destroy the reputation and careers of people or organizations who made perceived slights.

Online shaming frequently involves the publication of private information on the Internet (called [[doxing]]), which can frequently lead to hate messages and [[death threat]]s being used to intimidate that person. The ethics of public humiliation has been a source of debate over [[Internet privacy|privacy]] and [[Media ethics|ethics]].

==Public shaming==
[[File:Pillory 9105377.jpg|thumb|Jon Ronson has compared modern online shaming to medieval [[Pillory|pillories]].]]
The [[social networking]] tools of the Internet have been used as a tool to easily and widely publicize instances of perceived anti-social behavior.

David Furlow, chairman of the Media, Privacy and Defamation Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], has identified the potential privacy concerns raised by websites facilitating the distribution of information that is not part of the [[public record]] (documents filed with a government agency), and has said that such websites "just [give] a forum to people whose statements may not reflect truth."&lt;ref name="snitching redeye"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Swartz, RedEye |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-31/news/0705310470_1_unique-visitors-web-drivers |title=The wide world of cyber snitching |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some controversial incidents of public shaming, the popular link-sharing and discussion website [[Reddit]] introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public [[personally-identifying information]] via the site (colloquially known on Reddit and elsewhere as "[[doxing]]"{{clarify|date=December 2015}}). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

In 2015, online shaming was the subject of the book ''[[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]]'' by [[Jon Ronson]].&lt;ref name="onthemedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onthemedia.org/story/jon-ronson-and-public-shaming/|title=Jon Ronson And Public Shaming|work=onthemedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronson documented how people had become [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] due to humiliation online for misinterpreted jokes, and says people should think twice before gleefully condemning someone for doing almost nothing wrong.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt;

Doxing involves researching and broadcasting [[personally identifiable information]] about an individual, often with the intention of harming that person.&lt;ref name=economistexplains&gt;{{cite news|last=S-W|first=C.|title=What doxxing is, and why it matters|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/03/economist-explains-9|publisher=The Economist, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodrich"&gt;{{cite news|title=What is Doxing?|publisher=TechNewsDaily.com|author=Ryan Goodrich|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/17590-what-is-doxing.html|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragan"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI’s warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zurcher|first=Anthony|title=Duke freshman reveals porn identity|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-echochambers-26477417|publisher=BBC, United Kingdom|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can often lead to [[extortion]], [[coercion]], [[harassment]] and other forms of abuse.

===Revenge porn===
Nonconsensual pornography is a form of sexually explicit recording publicized on the Internet in order to humiliate a person, frequently distributed by [[hacker (term)|computer hackers]] or ex-partners (called [[revenge porn]]). Images and video of sexual acts are often combined with doxing of a person's private details, such as their home addresses and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Bazelon,[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html Why Do We Tolerate Revenge Porn?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (Sept. 25, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;Eric Larson, [http://mashable.com/2013/10/21/revenge-porn/ "It's Still Easy to Get Away With Revenge Porn"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[wikt:victim|Victims']] lives can be ruined as a result, the victims exposed to [[cyber-stalking]] and physical attack as well as facing difficulties in their workplace should their images become known as a result of routine checks by employers.

===Ashley Madison data breach===

[[File:Jules Arsène Garnier - Le supplice des adultères.jpg|thumb|200px|Public humiliation of Ashley Madison users has been argued to be a form of "flogging in the virtual town square".&lt;ref name=orlando/&gt;]]
In July 2015, a group hacked the user data of [[Ashley Madison]], a commercial dating website marketed as helping people have extramarital affairs. In August 2015, over 30 million user account details, including names and email addresses were released publicly.

A variety of security researchers and [[Internet privacy]] activists debated the ethics of the release.&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2015/08/notes-on-the-ashley-madison-hack|title=Early Notes on the Ashley Madison Hack|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/07/20/ashley-madison-ethics-journalism-hacked-documents/|title=In the wake of Ashley Madison, towards a journalism ethics of using hacked documents|work=Online Journalism Blog|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/19/ashley-madison-media/|title=Ashley Madison hack: The ethics of naming users |work=Fortune|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.includesecurity.com/2015/08/forensic-analysis-of-the-AshleyMadison-Hack.html|title=Include Security Blog – As the ROT13 turns….: A light-weight forensic analysis of the AshleyMadison Hack|author=Include Security|work=includesecurity.com|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In December 2013, Justine Sacco, a woman with 170 Twitter followers, tweeted acerbic jokes during a plane trip from New York to Cape Town, such as "Weird German dude get some deodorant"&lt;ref name="onthemedia"/&gt; and, in [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]; "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just Kidding. I'm white!" Sacco, a South African herself,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; intended the tweet to mock American ignorance of South Africa, and in a later interview expressed that her intention was to "mimic—and mock what an actual racist, ignorant person would say."&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ronson, Jon|authorlink1=Jon Ronson|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choire|first1=Sicha|title=Jon Ronson's 'So You've Been Publicly Shamed'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/jon-ronsons-so-youve-been-publicly-shamed.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=The New York Times|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco slept during her 11-hour plane trip, and woke up to find out that she had lost her job and was the number one Twitter topic worldwide, with celebrities and [[new media]] bloggers all over the globe denouncing her and encouraging all their followers to do the same. Sacco's employer, New York internet firm [[IAC (company)|IAC]], declared that she had lost her job as Director of Corporate Communications.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015" /&gt; People began tweeting "Has Justine landed yet?", expressing [[schadenfreude]] at the loss of her career.&lt;ref name="NYTM02122015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Sam Biddle]], the [[Gawker Media]] blogger who promoted the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag, later apologised for his role, admitting that he did so for Internet traffic to his blog,&lt;ref name=poyntersacco/&gt; and noting that "it's easy and thrilling to hate a stranger online.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/journalist-apologizes-for--hasjustinelandedyet-twitter-uproar-after-pr-exec-s-aids-joke-164616178.html|title=Journalist apologizes for #HasJustineLandedYet Twitter uproar after PR exec's AIDS joke|date=20 December 2014|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2014/12/the-internet-rewards-the-meanest-people-most/|title=The Internet Rewards the Meanest People Most|author=Chris Thilk|work=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronson, the public does not understand that a vigilante campaign of public shaming, undertaken with the ostensible intention of defending the [[Underdog (term)|underdog]], may create a mob mentality capable of destroying the lives and careers of the public figures singled out for shaming.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Ronson argued that in the early days of Twitter, people used the platform to share intimate details of their lives, and not as a vehicle of [[Shame society|shaming]]. [[Brooke Gladstone]] argued that the Sacco affair may deter people from expressing themselves online due to a fear of being misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=onthemedia/&gt; Kelly McBride argues that journalists play a key role in expanding the shame and humiliation of targets of the campaigns by relaying claims to a larger audience, while justifying their actions as simply documenting an event in an impartial manner.&lt;ref name=poyntersacco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/326097/journalism-and-public-shaming-some-guidelines/|title=Journalism and public shaming: Some guidelines|work=poynter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes: "Because of the mob mentality that accompanies public shaming events, often there is very little information about the target, sometimes only a single tweet. Yet there is a presumption of guilt and swift move toward justice, with no process for ascertaining facts." McBride further notes "If newspapers ran front-page photos of adulterers in the Middle East being stripped naked and whipped in order to further their shame, we would criticize them as part of a backward system of justice." Ben Adler compared the Sacco incident to a number of Twitter hoaxes, and argued that the media needs to be more careful to fact-check articles and evaluate context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/news_literacy/news_literacy_twitter.php|title=Trusting Twitter|work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adria Richards incident====
In March 2013, at a [[Python Conference|PyCon]] technology conference, a female participant named Adria Richards took offense at a private discussion between two male attendees seated nearby using the words "[[dongle]]" and "[[Fork (software development)|forking]]" in reference to the male presenter, which she perceived as a sexual joke. Richards photographed the attendees with their faces visible, then published the photograph on Twitter including a shaming statement in her tweet. The following day, the employer of one of the photographed individuals, a software developer, terminated his employment because of the joke.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Guardian|title=The Internet Shaming of Lindsey Stone|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/21/internet-shaming-lindsey-stone-jon-ronson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comment to Hacker News article 'Inappropriate comments at pycon 2013 called out'|url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Techie Adria Richards fired after tweeting about men's comments|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57575905/techie-adria-richards-fired-after-tweeting-about-mens-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Asking What Adria Richards Could Have Done Differently Is The Wrong Question|publisher=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/03/22/why-asking-what-adria-richards-could-have-done-differently-is-the-wrong-question/ | first=Deanna|last=Zandt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22863310/sendgrid-employees-tweet-sets-off-firestorm|title=SendGrid employee's tweet sets off firestorm|publisher=The Denver Post|first=Andy|last=Vuong|date=March 25, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Richards' public shaming of the developers, Internet users who were uninvolved launched a [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS Attack]] on her employer, [[SendGrid]], and according to an article by Jon Ronson in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' "told the employer the attacks would stop if Richards was fired".&lt;ref name="nytjonronson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html|title=How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|first=Jon|last=Ronson|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; SendGrid subsequently terminated her employment later the same day citing Richards' dividing the very community she was hired to unite, and the male anatomy joke she had posted a few days earlier on the employer website. Following the incident, PyCon updated its attendee rules stating, "Public shaming can be counter-productive to building a strong community. PyCon does not condone nor participate in such actions out of respect."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytjonronson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How "dongle" jokes got two people fired—and led to DDoS attacks|publisher=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview, Richards—still unemployed—speculated whether the developer was responsible for instigating the Internet backlash against her.&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt; The developer, who was offered a new job "right away", said he had not engaged with those who sent him messages of support, and had posted a short statement on [[Hacker News]] the same night after he was fired saying in part that Richards had "every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position".&lt;ref name="guardianjonronson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ycombinator-hackernews" /&gt;

====The Kitten Killer of Hangzhou====

In 2006, Wang-Jue ({{zh|s=王珏|t=王玨|p=''Wáng-Jué'' |links=no}}), a Chinese nurse appearing in an Internet [[Crush film|crush video]] stomping a helpless kitten with her stilettos, gave herself up to authorities after bloggers and some print media started a campaign to trace back the recording. In the beginning, she was labeled as the kitten killer of [[Hangzhou]], because it was believed she was from there; but some [[internaut]]s recognized an island in northern [[Heilongjiang]] province. Upon discovery of her identity, Wang Jue received death threats from many angry animal lovers.

Wang posted an apology on the [[Luobei]] city government official website. She said she was recently divorced and did not know what to do with her life. She and the cameraman, a provincial TV employee, lost their jobs when internauts discovered their identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2006-03/16/content_540375.htm|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|title=High-heeled kitten killer apologizes|date=2006-03-16|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_the-meow-murderess-brought-to-heel_1018584|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|title=The meow murderess brought to heel|date=2006-03-18|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners posted the video on the Internet in a bid to identify the woman, who was later interviewed by the [[RSPCA]] about her conduct. Outrage was sparked among animal lovers, and a Facebook group called "Death to Mary Bale" was created, and later removed. Police said they were speaking to the 45-year-old about her personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11087061|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|title=Woman who dumped cat in wheelie bin 'profoundly sorry'|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a case was publicized involving a young female from [[Sichuan]], using the alias Huang siu siu (黄小小), torturing and crushing rabbits.  The group that financially sponsored the making of these videos, later revealed to be called "Crushfetish", paid young girls to crush fish, insects, rabbits and other small animals.  The girl was paid 100 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for each attempt, and she had been participating since 2007.  Police said the group makes videos to sell overseas, and the company has allegedly made 279 animal abuse videos with a subscription fee.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BNew%2BPaper/Story/A1Story20101203-250663.html Rabbit-crushing woman confesses]."

On August 26, 2012, [[Yang Dacai]], chief of the Shanxi provincial work safety administration, was caught grinning widely amid the wreckage of a long-distance bus that killed 36 passengers when it collided with a tanker loaded with highly flammable methanol on a Chinese highway in [[Shanxi]] Province. Pictures of the accident began to circulate on [[Sina Weibo]], the most popular micro-blogging site in China which led to a meme dubbing him as the "Smiling Brother". Searches on the [[human flesh search engine]] followed leading to pictures surfacing on Weibo, showing Yang wearing luxury watches such as a $10,000 Rolex initiating another meme calling him "Watch Brother".

The reaction by the South Korean public to the incident prompted several newspapers in South Korea to run editorials voicing concern over Internet vigilantism. One paper quoted [[Daniel J.

====Stephen Fowler and ''Wife Swap''====

Stephen Fowler, a [[UK|British]] [[expatriate]] and [[venture capitalist]] [[businessman]], gained notoriety after his performance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)|Wife Swap]]'' (originally aired Friday January 30, 2009) when his wife exchanged positions in his family with a woman from [[Missouri]] for a two-week period. In response to her rule changes (standard procedure for the second week in the show) he insulted his guest and, in doing so, groups including the lower classes, soldiers, and the overweight. Several websites were made in protest against his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blog/husbands-behaving-badly--120 |title=Husbands Behaving Badly - Yahoo! TV Blog |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the show, and after watching the ''Wife Swap'' video, his wife, a professional [[life coach]], reported that she had encouraged him to attend professional behaviour counselling.  Businesses with only tangential connection to Fowler publicly disclaimed any association with him due to the negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/399231_theinsider09.html |title=The Insider: TV viewers stuff wrong inbox over 'Wife Swap' |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He resigned positions on the boards of two environmental charities to avoid attracting negative press.

====Cyclist abuser incident====

In 2008, video of Patrick Pogan,  a rookie police officer, body-slamming Christopher Long, a cyclist, surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXzRczBk06M |title=Officer Patrick Pogan |publisher=youtube.com |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The altercation happened when members of [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] conducted a bicycling advocacy event at [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7DC173CF93AA15754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;fta=y |title=Officer Investigated in Toppling of Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=James | last=Barron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officer claimed the cyclist had veered into him, and so the biker was charged with assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

The charges against the cyclist were later dropped and Pogan was convicted of lying about the confrontation with the cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/nyregion/30pogan.html |title=Ex-Officer Convicted of Lying About Confrontation With Cyclist |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2010-04-29 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=John | last=Eligon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vigilante group targets mother====

In 2009, a Facebook group was started, accusing a single mother for the death of a 13-month-old child in her foster care. It was the mother's then common-law husband who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the mother was not formally accused of any wrongdoing. However, the members of the group, such as the boy's biological mother, accuse her of knowing what was going on and doing nothing to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/03/13/8733411-sun.html |title=Internet vigilante group torments mother |publisher=cnews.canoe.ca |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-05-03 | first=Andrew | last=Hanon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Cooks Source'' incident====

{{Main article|Cooks Source infringement controversy}}
The food magazine ''Cooks Source'' printed an article by Monica Gaudio without her permission in their October 2010 issue. Learning of the copyright violation, Gaudio emailed Judith Griggs, managing editor of ''Cooks Source Magazine'', requesting that the magazine both apologize and also donate $130 to the Columbia School of Journalism as payment for using her work. Instead she received a very unapologetic letter stating that she (Griggs) herself should be thanked for making the piece better and that Gaudio should be glad that she didn't give someone else credit for writing the article. During the ensuing public outcry, online vigilantes took it upon themselves to avenge Gaudio. The ''Cooks Source'' Facebook page was flooded with thousands of contemptuous comments, forcing the magazine's staff to create new pages in an attempt to escape the protest and accuse 'hackers' of taking control of the original page. The magazine's website was stripped of all content by the staff and shut down a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Rene|title=Cooks Source magazine vs. the Web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dailydish/2010/11/cooks-source-magazine-vs-the-web.html|accessdate=19 November 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullied bus monitor Karen Klein====

In June 2012, An elderly bus monitor, [[Bus monitor bullying video|Karen Klein]], was taunted, picked on, and threatened by four seventh-graders. The act was caught on video and uploaded to the Internet which in turn caused an act of kindness from complete strangers. $703,833  was raised for Klein in donations from concerned strangers who were outraged after viewing a video that captured her torment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bullied Bus Monitor Collects $703,833 Check|url = http://www.inquisitr.com/330131/bullied-bus-monitor-receives-another-700000/|website = The Inquisitr News|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senior solicitor, Alexander Carter-Silk and junior barrister, Charlotte Proudman====

In 2015 a junior barrister Charlotte Proudman working in the UK [[Twitter#Tweets|tweeted]] a screenshot of her [[LinkedIn]] exchange with Alexander Carter-Silk, a senior City solicitor, rebuking him for complimenting her on her profile photograph. The social media backlash included Proudman finding herself condemned as a "[[feminazi]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davies | first = Caroline | title = Stories of 2015: the barrister branded a 'feminazi' in LinkedIn sexism row | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/charlotte-proudman-feminazi-barrister-linkedin-sexism-row | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 29 December 2015 | access-date = 16 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to food preparation:

Food preparation &amp;ndash; art form and applied science that includes but is not limited to [[cooking]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==What ''type'' of thing is food preparation?==

* [[The arts|Art]] &amp;ndash; an art, one of ''the'' arts, is a creative endeavor or discipline.
** [[Culinary art]] &amp;ndash; art of preparing and cooking foods.
* [[Skill]] &amp;ndash;  learned capacity to carry out pre-determined results often with the minimum outlay of time, energy, or both.
* [[Meal preparation]] &amp;ndash; the process of planning meals.

==Essence of food preparation==
* [[Chef]] &amp;ndash; a person who cooks professionally for other people. Although over time the term has come to describe any person who cooks for a living, traditionally it refers to a highly skilled professional who is proficient in all aspects of food [[Preparation (principle)|preparation]].
* [[Cooking]] &amp;ndash; act of preparing [[food]] for [[eating]]. It encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to improve the [[flavor|flavour]] or [[digestion|digestibility of food]]. It generally requires the selection, measurement and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result.
* [[Cuisine]] &amp;ndash; specific set of cooking traditions and practices, often associated with a specific culture. It is often named after the region or place where its underlying culture is present. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade.

==Food preparation techniques==
[[Image:Rhof-brotBacken.ogv|thumb|Baking bread at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]

===Baking===

* [[Baking]] &amp;ndash; the technique of prolonged cooking of food by dry heat acting by [[Heat convection|convection]], normally in an [[oven]], but can also be done in hot ashes or on hot stones. Appliances like [[Rotimatic]] also allow automatic baking.
* [[Blind baking]] &amp;ndash; baking pastry before adding a filling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tescorealfood.com/Cooking-Tips/Baking-blind-.html "How to blind bake"]. [[Tesco]] realfood. Retrieved 30 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boiling]] &amp;ndash; the rapid [[vaporization]] of a [[liquid]], which occurs when a liquid is heated to its [[boiling point]], the [[temperature]] at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure.
* [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanching]] &amp;ndash; cooking technique which food substance, usually a vegetable or fruit, is plunged into boiling water, removed after a brief, timed interval, and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water (shocked) to halt the cooking process.
* [[Braising]] &amp;ndash; combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat; typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid, resulting in a particular flavour.
* [[Coddling]] &amp;ndash; food is heated in water kept just below the boiling point.
* [[Infusion]] &amp;ndash; going to a health cafe and ordering tea without the milk or sugar.
* [[Pressure cooking]] &amp;ndash; cooking in a sealed vessel that does not permit air or liquids to escape below a preset pressure, which allows the liquid in the pot to rise to a higher temperature before boiling.
* [[Simmering]] &amp;ndash; [[food]]s are cooked in hot liquids kept at or just below the [[boiling point]] of [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://culinaryarts.about.com/od/glossary/g/simmer.htm Simmer definition] from [http://culinaryarts.about.com/ About.com - Culinary arts]. Retrieved May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but higher than [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] [[temperature]].
** [[Poaching (cooking)|Poaching]] &amp;ndash; process of gently simmering food in liquid, generally milk, stock or wine.
* [[Steaming]] &amp;ndash; boiling water continuously so it vaporizes into steam and carries heat to the food being steamed, thus cooking the food.
** [[Double steaming]] &amp;ndash; Chinese cooking technique in which food is covered with water and put in a covered ceramic jar and the jar is then steamed for several hours.
* [[Steeping]] &amp;ndash; saturation of a food (such as an herb) in a liquid solvent to extract a soluble ingredient into the solvent.  E.g., a cup of tea is made by steeping tea leaves in a cup of hot water.
* [[Stewing]] &amp;ndash; food is cooked in liquid and served in the resultant [[gravy]].
* [[Vacuum flask cooking]] &amp;ndash;

===Broiling===

[[File:Grilling.jpg|thumb|right|Cooking with [[charcoal]] on a [[barbecue grill]]]]
* [[Grilling]] &amp;ndash; a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above or below.

===Frying===

* [[Frying]] &amp;ndash; [[cooking]] food in [[cooking oil|oil]] or another [[fat]], a technique that originated in ancient [[Old Kingdom|Egypt]] around 2500 BC.&lt;ref name='Tannahill'&gt;Tannahill, Reay. (1995). ''Food in History''. Three Rivers Press. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deep frying]] &amp;ndash; food is submerged in hot oil or fat. This is normally performed with a deep fryer or chip pan.
* [[Hot salt frying]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Hot sand frying]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pan frying]] &amp;ndash; cooking food in a pan using a small amount of cooking oil or fat as a heat transfer agent and to keep the food from sticking.
* [[Pressure frying]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Sautéing]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Stir frying]] &amp;ndash;

===Microwaving===

* [[Microwave oven]] &amp;ndash; type of oven that heats foods quickly and efficiently using microwaves. However, unlike conventional [[oven]]s, a [[microwave]] oven does not brown bread or bake food. This makes microwave ovens unsuitable for cooking certain foods and unable to achieve certain culinary effects. Additional kinds of heat sources can be added into microwave ovens or microwave packaging so as to add these additional effects.

===Roasting===

[[File:16-alimenti, arrosto,Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|200px|right|Roasting, medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] ([[Tacuina sanitatis]] casanatensis 14th century)]]
[[Image:KitchenAid Stand Mixer.jpg|right|thumb|[[KitchenAid]] Stand Mixer in action]]

* [[Roasting]] &amp;ndash;  cooking method that uses dry heat, whether an open flame, [[oven]], or other heat source. Roasting usually causes [[caramelization]] or [[Maillard reaction|Maillard browning]] of the surface of the food, which is considered by some as a [[flavor]] enhancement.
* [[Barbecuing]] &amp;ndash;  method of cooking meat, poultry and occasionally fish with the heat and hot smoke of a fire, smoking wood, or hot coals of charcoal.
* [[Grilling]] &amp;ndash; applying dry heat to the surface of food, by cooking it on a grill, a grill pan, or griddle.
* [[Rotisserie]] &amp;ndash;  meat is skewered on a spit - a long solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire, or while being roasted in an oven.
* [[Searing]] &amp;ndash;  technique used in grilling, baking, braising, roasting, sautéing, etc., in which the surface of the food (usually meat, poultry or fish) is cooked at high temperature so a caramelized crust forms.

===Hot Smoking===

* [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] &amp;ndash; the process of [[seasoning|flavoring]], [[cooking]], or [[food preservation|preserving]] [[food]] by exposing it to the [[smoke]] from burning or smoldering plant materials, most often [[wood]]. Hot smoking will cook and flavor the food, while cold smoking only flavors the food.

===Chemical techniques===
* [[Brining]] &amp;ndash;Brining is a process similar to marination in which meat or poultry is soaked in brine before cooking
* [[Ceviche]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Drying (food)|Drying]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Marinating]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Pickling]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Salting (food)|Salting]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Seasoning]] &amp;ndash;

* [[Cutting]]
** [[Dicing]] &amp;ndash;cutting into cubes
** [[Grating]] &amp;ndash; The use of a grater to mash vegetables. 
** [[Julienning]] &amp;ndash;cutting into very thin pieces such as the thin carrots in store bought salad mix
** [[Mincing]] &amp;ndash;cutting into very small pieces
** [[Peel (fruit)|Peeling]] &amp;ndash;to take the outer skin/covering off of a fruit or vegetable
** [[Shaving]] &amp;ndash;
**[[chiffonade]]; cutting in a ribbon like way
* [[Kneading]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Milling (grinding)|Milling]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Mixture|Mixing]]   ; incorporating different ingredients to make something new; such as how mixing water, sugar, and lemon juice makes lemonade
** [[Blender|Blending]]  ; using a machine called blender to grind ingredients 
*[[Vacuum filler|Vacuum Filling]] &amp;ndash;

'''''Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow''''' is a 2010 [[Sophie Fiennes]] documentary about the [[German people|German]] industrial artist [[Anselm Kiefer]]'s creation of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] in an abandoned factory complex outside [[Barjac, Gard|Barjac]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Shryane2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Shryane|title=Blixa Bargeld and Einstürzende Neubauten: German Experimental Music - 'Evading Do-Re-Mi'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ul_feYRWOUQC&amp;pg=PA174|date=28 November 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2157-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Cannes film festival review – Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/16/over-your-cities-grass-will-grow|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=Touring an Artist's Pre-Apocalyptic Realm|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/movies/over-your-cities-grass-will-grow-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiefer moved to the [[South of France]] from Germany in 1993 and began creating his art installation, "La Ribaute" on 35 acres of land belonging to an old silk factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Rodney|title=Surface assemblages.

'''Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais''' ({{IPA-fr|pjɛʁ bomaʁʃɛ|lang}}; 24 January 1732 – 18 May&lt;ref&gt;He died during the evening of 17–18 May [https://books.google.com/books?id=wVtBbjOxQY0C&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=beaumarchais+may+1799&amp;source=web&amp;ots=N2bOFcQr5L&amp;sig=-AqFAEodPuzwWb94NJIByDZUQ7w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA314,M1]; the date 18 May is most frequently seen in sources.&lt;/ref&gt; 1799) was a [[Early modern France|French]] [[polymath]]. At various times in his life, he was a [[watchmaker]], inventor, playwright, musician, diplomat, spy, publisher, [[Horticulture|horticulturist]], [[arms dealer]], satirist, financier, and [[revolutionary]] (both French and American).

Born a provincial watchmaker's son, Beaumarchais rose in French society and became influential in the court of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as an inventor and music teacher. He made a number of important business and social contacts, played various roles as a diplomat and spy, and had earned a considerable fortune before a series of costly court battles jeopardized his reputation.

An early French supporter of American independence, Beaumarchais lobbied the French government on behalf of the American rebels during the [[American War of Independence]]. Beaumarchais oversaw covert aid from the French and Spanish governments to [[arms dealer|supply arms]] and financial assistance to the rebels in the years before France's formal entry into the war in 1778. He later struggled to recover money he had personally invested in the scheme. Beaumarchais was also a participant in the early stages of the French Revolution. He is probably best known, however, for his theatrical works, especially the three [[#The Figaro plays|Figaro]] plays.

==Early life==
Beaumarchais was born Pierre-Augustin Caron in the [[Rue Saint-Denis (Paris)|Rue Saint-Denis]], Paris on 24 January 1732.&lt;ref name="Lever p.3-4"&gt;Lever pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only boy among the six surviving children of André-Charles Caron, a watchmaker from [[Meaux]]. The family had previously been [[Huguenot]]s, but had converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in the wake of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the increased persecution of Protestants that followed.&lt;ref name="Lever p.3-4"/&gt; The family was comfortably middle-class and Beaumarchais had a peaceful and happy childhood. As the only son, he was spoiled by his parents and sisters. He took an interest in music and played several instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Lever p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Though born a Catholic, Beaumarchais retained a sympathy for Protestants and would campaign throughout his life for their [[civil rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Lever p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; One of his sisters, [[Marie-Josèphe Caron]], later became an artist; their cousin was the artist [[Suzanne Caron (artist)|Suzanne Caron]].&lt;ref name="PastelProfile"&gt;[http://www.pastellists.com/Articles/Carron.pdf Profile of Marie-Josèphe Caron] at the ''Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the age of ten, Beaumarchais had some schooling at a "country school" where he learned some [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="Lever p.6"&gt;Lever p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Beaumarchais left school at twelve to work as an apprentice under his father and learn the art of watchmaking. He may have used his own experiences during these years as the inspiration for the character of Cherubin when he wrote the ''Marriage of Figaro''.&lt;ref name="Lever p.6"/&gt; He generally neglected his work, and at one point was evicted by his father, only to be later allowed back after apologising for his poor behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, pocket watches were commonly unreliable for timekeeping and were worn more as fashion accessories. In response to this, Beaumarchais spent nearly a year researching improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Lever p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1753, at the age of twenty one, he invented an [[escapement]] for watches that allowed them to be made substantially more accurate and compact.&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|title=Beaumarchais in Seville: An Intermezzo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6eem8xQ3lEC&amp;pg=PT20|accessdate=22 January 2018|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300134643 | pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first man to take an interest in this new invention was [[Jean-André Lepaute]], the royal clockmaker in France, whose clocks could be found in the [[Palais du Luxembourg]], [[Tuileries Palace]], the [[Palais-Royal]], and the [[Jardin des Plantes]].&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt; Lepaute had been a mentor to Beaumarchais after discovering the boy's talent in a chance encounter in the Caron family's shop. He encouraged him as he worked on the new invention, earned his trust, and promptly stole the idea for himself, writing a letter to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] describing the "Lepaute system".&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/6643996/Honor_and_Rebellion_in_the_Theater_Beaumarchais_Mozart_and_Figaro | title=Honor and Rebellion in the Theater: Beaumarchais, Mozart and Figaro | first=Robert | last=Fenton | publisher=[[Academia.edu]] | accessdate=22 January 2018 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumarchais was outraged when he read in the September issue of ''Le Mercure de France'' that M. Lepaute had just invented the most wonderful mechanism for a more portable clock.&lt;ref name="Kite1918"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37960/37960-h/37960-h.htm | title=Beaumarchais and the War of American Independence | first=Elizabeth S. | last=Kite | year=1918 | publisher=The Gorham Press | accessdate=22 January 2018 | page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a strongly-worded letter to that same newspaper defending the invention as his own and urging the French Academy of Sciences to see the proof for themselves. "In the interests of truth and my reputation," he says, "I cannot let such an infidelity go by in silence and must claim as mine the invention of this device."&lt;ref name="Grendel1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grendel|first=Frédéric|title=Beaumarchais: The Man who was Figaro|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsokAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 January 2018|date=1 January 1977|publisher=MacDonald and Jane's|page=8|translator=Greaves, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepaute defended himself with a statement by three Jesuits that claimed he had shown them such a mechanism in May 1753.&lt;ref name="Thomas2006"/&gt;

The following February, the Academy indeed ruled that the mechanism was his and not Lepaute's, catapulting him to stardom and relegating Lepaute to infamy, as "''l'affaire Lepaute''" had been the talk of Paris. Soon afterwards, he was asked by King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] to create a watch mounted on a ring for his mistress [[Madame de Pompadour]]. Louis was so impressed by the result that he named Beaumarchais "Purveyor to the King", and the Caron family business became prosperous.&lt;ref name="Fenton"/&gt;

==Rise to influence==

===Marriage and new name===
In 1755 Beaumarchais met Madeleine-Catherine Aubertin, a widow, and married her the following year. She helped Beaumarchais secure a royal office, and he gave up watchmaking. Shortly after his marriage, he adopted the name "Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais", which he derived from "le Bois Marchais", the name of a piece of land belonging to his new wife. He believed the name sounded grander and more [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] and adopted at the same time an elaborate [[coat of arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Lever p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; His wife died less than a year later, which plunged him into financial problems, and he ran up large debts.

===Royal patronage===
Beaumarchais' problems were eased when he was appointed to teach Louis XV's four daughters the [[harp]]. His role soon grew and he became a musical advisor for the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1759, Caron met [[Joseph Paris Duverney]], an older and wealthy entrepreneur. Beaumarchais assisted him in gaining the King's approval for the new military academy he was building, the [[École Royale Militaire]], and in turn Duverney promised to help make him rich.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The two became very close friends and collaborated on many business ventures. Assisted by Duverney, Beaumarchais acquired the title of Secretary-Councillor to the King in 1760–61, thereby gaining access to French nobility. This was followed by the purchase in 1763 of a second title, the office of Lieutenant General of Hunting, a position which oversaw the royal parks. Around this time, he became engaged to Pauline Le Breton, who came from a [[plantation]]-owning family from [[Saint-Domingue]], but broke it off when he discovered she was not as wealthy as he had been led to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 19–20 &amp; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visit to Madrid===
In April 1764, Beaumarchais began a ten-month sojourn in Madrid, ostensibly to help his sister, Lisette, who had been abandoned by her fiancé, [[José Clavijo y Fajardo|Clavijo]], an official at the Ministry of War.&lt;ref name="Gillard"&gt;''Beaumarchais: Le Mariage de Figaro – comédie'', with preface, biography, and annotations by Pol Gillard, Bordas, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Spain, he was mostly concerned with striking business deals for Duverney. They sought exclusive contracts for the newly acquired Spanish colony of [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]] and attempted to gain the right to import [[slaves]] to the Spanish colonies in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Lever p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumarchais went to Madrid with a [[letter of introduction]] from the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], who was now his political patron. Hoping to secure Clavijo's support for his business deals by binding him by marriage, Beaumarchais initially shamed Clavijo into agreeing to marry Lisette, but when further details emerged about Clavijo's conduct, the marriage was called off.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaumarchais's business deals dragged on, and he spent much of his time soaking up the atmosphere of Spain, which would become a major influence on his later writings. Although he befriended important figures such as the foreign minister [[Jerónimo Grimaldi, 1st Duke of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]], his attempts to secure the contracts for Duverney eventually came to nothing and he went home in March 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 25–30&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beaumarchais returned to France with little profit, he had managed to acquire new experience, musical ideas, and ideas for theatrical characters. Beaumarchais considered turning the affair into a play, but decided to leave it to others—including [[Goethe]], who wrote ''[[Clavigo (play)|Clavigo]]'' in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playwright==
Beaumarchais hoped to be made consul to Spain, but his application was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Lever pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he concentrated on developing his business affairs and began to show an interest in writing plays. He had already experimented in writing short [[farce]]s for private audiences, but he now had ambitions to write for the theatre.

His name as a writer was established with his first dramatic play, ''[[Eugenie (play)|Eugénie]]'', which premiered at the [[Comédie Française]] in 1767. This was followed in 1770 by another drama, ''[[Les Deux amis]]''.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;

=== The Figaro plays===
[[File:Marriage of figaro title page.jpg|160px|thumb|The original title page of ''The Marriage of Figaro'']]
Beaumarchais's Figaro plays are ''[[Le Barbier de Séville]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|Le Mariage de Figaro]]'', and ''[[The Guilty Mother|La Mère coupable]]''. Figaro and Count Almaviva, the two characters Beaumarchais most likely conceived in his travels in Spain, were (with Rosine, later the Countess Almaviva) the only ones present in all three plays. They are indicative of the change in social attitudes before, during, and after the French Revolution.  Figaro and Almaviva first appeared in ''[[Le Sacristain]]'', which he wrote around 1765 and dubbed "an interlude, imitating the Spanish style."&lt;ref name="Edney"&gt;''Beaumarchais:  The three Figaro plays'', translation and notes by David Edney, Doverhouse,  2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, this thinly veiled government criticism did not go without opposition. Upon first reading a manuscript of Beaumarchais's play, King Louis XVI stated that "this man mocks everything that must be respected in a government" and refused to let it be performed.
To a lesser degree, the Figaro plays are semi-autobiographical.&lt;ref name="Edney"/&gt; Don Guzman Brid'oison (''Le Mariage'') and Bégearss (''La Mère'') were caricatures of two of Beaumarchais's real-life adversaries, Goezman and Bergasse. The page Chérubin (''Le Mariage'') resembled the youthful Beaumarchais, who did contemplate suicide when his love was to marry another. Suzanne, the heroine of ''Le Mariage'' and ''La Mère'', was modelled after Beaumarchais's third wife, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz. Meanwhile, some of the Count monologues reflect on the playwright's remorse over his numerous sexual exploits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''Le Barbier'' premiered in Paris in 1775. An English translation premiered in London a year later, and that was followed by performances in other European countries.&lt;ref name=wood&gt;John Wood, ''Introduction'', ''The Barber of Seville/The Marriage of Figaro'', Penguin Classics, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequel, ''Le Mariage'', was initially passed by the censor in 1781, but was soon banned from being performed by Louis XVI after a private reading. Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] lamented the ban, as did various influential members of her entourage. Nonetheless, the King was unhappy with the play's satire on the aristocracy and overruled the Queen's entreaties to allow its performance. Over the next three years, Beaumarchais gave many private readings of the play, as well as making revisions to try to pass the censor. The King finally relented and lifted the ban in 1784. The play premiered that year and was enormously popular even with aristocratic audiences. Mozart's opera based on the play, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Le Nozze di Figaro]]'' premiered just two years later in Vienna.&lt;ref name=wood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=Antonia |year=2001 |title=Marie Antoinette: The Journey |location= |publisher=Phoenix |pages=255–6 |isbn=0-75381-305-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Beaumarchais's final play, ''La Mère'', premiered in 1792 in Paris.

In homage to the great French playwright [[Molière]], Beaumarchais also dubbed ''La Mère'' "The Other ''[[Tartuffe]]''". All three Figaro plays enjoyed great success, and are still frequently performed today in theatres and opera houses.

== Court battles==
The death of Duverney on 17 July 1770 triggered a decade of turmoil for Beaumarchais. A few months earlier, the two had signed a statement cancelling all debts that Beaumarchais owed Duverney (about 75,000 pounds), and granting Beaumarchais the modest sum of 15,000 pounds.&lt;ref name="Edney"/&gt; Duverney's sole heir, Count de la Blache, took Beaumarchais to court, claiming the signed statement was a forgery.  Although the 1772 verdict favoured Beaumarchais, it was overturned on appeal the following year by a judge, a magistrate named Goezman, whom Beaumarchais tried in vain to bribe.  At the same time, Beaumarchais was also involved in a dispute with the Duke de Chaulnes over the Duke's mistress, which resulted in Beaumarchais being thrown into jail from February to May 1773.  La Blache took advantage of Beaumarchais' court absence and persuaded Goezman to order Beaumarchais to repay all his debts to Duverney, plus interest and all legal expenses.

To garner public support, Beaumarchais published a four-part pamphlet entitled ''Mémoires contre Goezman''.  The action made Beaumarchais an instant celebrity, for the public at the time saw Beaumarchais as a champion for social justice and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Parlement]]'' (regional court) to which Goezman belonged was very impopular as an attempt of king [[Louis XV of France]] and chancellor [[Maupeou#Maupeou's coup d'etat|Maupeou]] to modernise Justice and make it less corrupt, widely and vociferously denounced as ''tyranny'' by the ''noblesse de robe'' having lost some of their privileges and their political defender (the Parlement).&lt;/ref&gt; Goezman countered Beaumarchais's accusations by launching a lawsuit of his own.  The verdict was equivocal.  On 26 February 1774, both Beaumarchais and Mme. Goezman (who had taken the bribe from Beaumarchais) were sentenced to "blâme" meaning they were nominally deprived of their civil rights. Naturally, Beaumarchais followed few of the restrictions placed upon him. Magistrate Goezman was removed from his post.  At the same time, Goezman's verdict in the La Blache case was overturned.  The Goezman case was so sensational that the judges left the courtroom through a back door to avoid the large, angry mob waiting in front of the court house.&lt;ref name="Edney"/&gt;

==American Revolution==
{{further|France in the American Revolutionary War}}

Before France officially entered the war in 1778, Beaumarchais played a major role in delivering French munitions, money and supplies to the American army.&lt;ref&gt;Harlow Giles Unger, ''Improbable Patriot: The Secret History of Monsieur de Beaumarchais, the French Playwright Who Saved the American Revolution'' (University Press of New England; 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secretly funnel aid to the rebels, he helped set up a fictitious business called [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company]].

To restore his civil rights, Beaumarchais pledged his services to Louis XV. He traveled to London, Amsterdam and [[Vienna]] on various secret missions. His first mission was to travel to London to destroy a pamphlet, ''Les mémoires secrets d'une femme publique'', which Louis XV considered a libel of one of his mistresses, [[Madame du Barry]].  Beaumarchais was sent to London to persuade the French spy [[Chevalier D'Eon]] to return home, but while there he began gathering information on British politics and society. Britain's colonial situation was deteriorating and in 1775 [[Battle of Lexington and Concord|fighting broke out]] between British troops and American rebels. Beaumarchais became a major source of information about the rebellion for the French government and sent a regular stream of reports with exaggerated rumours of the size of the success of the rebel forces [[Siege of Boston|blockading Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaines pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Once back in France, Beaumarchais began work on a new operation. [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], who did not want to break openly with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;Brian N. Morton "Beaumarchais and the American Revolution"&lt;/ref&gt; allowed Beaumarchais to found a commercial enterprise, [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company]],&lt;ref name="Edney"/&gt; supported by the French and Spanish crowns, that supplied the American rebels with weapons, munitions, clothes and provisions, all of which would never be paid for. This policy came to fruition in 1777 when [[John Burgoyne]]'s army [[Saratoga Campaign|capitulated at Saratoga]] to a rebel force largely clothed and armed by the supplies Beaumarchais had been sending; it marked a personal triumph for him. Beaumarchais was injured in a carriage accident while racing into Paris with news of Saratoga.&lt;ref&gt;Schiff pp. 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaumarchais had dealt with [[Silas Deane]], an acting member of the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] in the [[Second Continental Congress]]. For these services, the French Parliament reinstated Beaumarchais's civil rights in 1776. In 1778, Beaumarchais' hopes were fulfilled when the French government agreed to the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–France)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]. France officially entered the [[American War of Independence]] soon after, followed by Spain in 1779 and the Dutch Republic in 1780.

== The Voltaire revival ==
Shortly after the death of [[Voltaire]] in 1778, Beaumarchais set out to publish Voltaire's complete works, many of which were banned in France. He bought the rights to most of Voltaire's many manuscripts from the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckouck in February 1779. To evade French censorship, he set up printing presses in [[Kehl]], Germany. He bought the complete foundry of the famous English type designer [[John Baskerville]] from his widow and also purchased three paper mills. Seventy volumes were published between 1783 and 1790. While the venture proved a financial failure, Beaumarchais was instrumental in preserving many of Voltaire's later works which otherwise might have been lost.

== More court battles and the French Revolution ==
[[File:Statue Beaumarchais Clausade Paris.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Statue of Beaumarchais by [[Louis Clausade]] (1895), in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris]]]]
It was not long before Beaumarchais crossed paths again with the French legal system. In 1787, he became acquainted with Mme. Korman, who was implicated and imprisoned in an adultery suit, which was filed by her husband to expropriate her dowry.  The matter went to court, with Beaumarchais siding with Mme. Korman, and M. Korman assisted by a celebrity lawyer, [[Nicolas Bergasse]]. On 2 April 1790, M. Korman and Bergasse were found guilty of calumny (slander), but Beaumarchais's reputation was also tarnished.

Meanwhile, the [[French Revolution]] broke out. Beaumarchais was no longer quite the idol he had been a few years before, as he thought the excesses of the revolution were endangering liberty. He was financially successful, mainly from supplying drinking water to Paris, and had acquired ranks{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Titles? Positions?}} in the French nobility. In 1791, he took up a lavish residence across from where the [[Bastille]] once stood. He spent under a week in prison during August 1792 for criticising  the government, and was released only three days before [[September massacres|a massacre]] took place in the prison where he had been detained.

Nevertheless, he pledged his services to the new republic.  He attempted to purchase 60,000 rifles for the French Revolutionary army from Holland, but was unable to complete the deal.

==Exile and death==
While he was out of the country, Beaumarchais was falsely declared an ''[[émigré]]'' (a loyalist of the old regime) by his enemies. He spent two and a half years in exile, mostly in Germany, before his name was removed from the list of proscribed émigrés. He returned to Paris in 1796, where he lived out the remainder of his life in relative peace. He is buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

[[Boulevard Beaumarchais]] in [[Paris]] is named after him.

== Operas ==
In 1786, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] composed an opera, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Le Nozze di Figaro]]'', based on ''The Marriage of Figaro'', with a libretto by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] based on the play.  Several composers including [[Paisiello]] in [[The Barber of Seville (Paisiello)|1782]] wrote operas based on ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. [[Rossini]]'s [[The Barber of Seville|1816]] version is his most successful work and still often performed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Operabase]] lists 15 productions of the piece worldwide in 2011, and a similar number in 2012. See [http://operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&amp;lang=en&amp;is=Barbiere+di+Siviglia&amp;by=Rossini&amp;loc=&amp;stype=abs&amp;sd=1&amp;sm=12&amp;sy=2011&amp;etype=abs&amp;ed=31&amp;em=12&amp;ey=2011 2011] and [http://operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&amp;lang=en&amp;is=Barbiere+di+Siviglia&amp;by=Rossini&amp;loc=&amp;stype=abs&amp;sd=1&amp;sm=12&amp;sy=2012&amp;etype=abs&amp;ed=31&amp;em=12&amp;ey=2012 2012] listings in Operabase.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Darius Milhaud]] composed an opera, ''[[La mère coupable]]'', based on ''The Guilty Mother''.

Beaumarchais was also the librettist for [[Antonio Salieri]]'s opera ''[[Tarare (opera)|Tarare]]'', which premiered in Paris in 1787.&lt;ref name=wood /&gt;

Beaumarchais married three times. His first wife was Madeleine-Catherine Franquet (née Aubertin), whom he married on 22 November 1756; she died under mysterious circumstances only 10 months later. He married Geneviève-Madeleine Lévêque (née Wattebled) in 1768. Again, the second Mme. de Beaumarchais died under mysterious circumstances two years later, though most scholars believed she actually suffered from [[tuberculosis]]. Before her death in 1770, she bore a son, Augustin, but he died in 1772. Beaumarchais lived with his lover, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz, for 12 years before she became his third wife in 1786.  Together they had a daughter, Eugénie.

Beaumarchais was accused by his enemies of poisoning his first two wives in order to lay claim to their family inheritance. Beaumarchais, though having no shortage of lovers throughout his life, was known to care deeply for both his family and close friends.  However, Beaumarchais also had a reputation of marrying for financial gain, and both Franquet and Lévêque had previously married into wealthy families.  While there was insufficient evidence to support the accusations, whether or not the poisonings took place is still the subject of debate.

The '''Proto-Celtic language''', also called '''Common Celtic''', is the [[reconstructed language|reconstructed]] ancestor language of all the known [[Celtic languages]]. Its [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the [[comparative method]] of [[historical linguistics]]. As Celtic is a branch of the [[Indo-European language family]], Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. According to one theory, Celtic may be closest to the [[Italic languages]], which together form an [[Italo-Celtic]] branch. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]] of [[Central Europe]] from the last quarter of the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name=ChadCorc&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick with Corcoran|first=Nora with J.X.W.P.|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] of around 800 BC, these people had become fully Celtic.&lt;ref name=ChadCorc/&gt;

The reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken. While [[Continental Celtic]] presents much substantiation for its [[phonology]], and some for [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of [[syntax]]. Although some complete sentences are recorded in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]], the oldest Celtic [[literature]] is found in [[Old Irish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Celtic-literature#ref42288 Celtic literature] at britannica.com, accessed 7 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Middle Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhys|first1=John|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=E. Vincent|title=The Origin of the Welsh Englyn and Kindred Metres|journal=Y Cymmrodor|date=1905|volume=XVIII|url=https://archive.org/stream/ycymmrodor18cymmuoft|publisher=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound changes from Proto-Indo-European==
The phonological changes from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] to Proto-Celtic may be summarised as follows.{{sfn|Matasović|2009}} The changes are roughly in chronological order, with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list.

===Late Proto-Indo-European===
These changes were shared by several other Indo-European branches.
* *e is colored by an adjacent [[laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] consonant:
** eh₂, h₂e &gt; ah₂, h₂a
** eh₃, h₃e &gt; oh₃, h₃o
* Palatovelars merge with the plain velars:
** ḱ &gt; k
** ǵ &gt; g
** ǵʰ &gt; gʰ
* Epenthetic *a is inserted after a syllabic [[sonorant]] if a laryngeal and another sonorant follow (R̥HR &gt; RaHR)
* Laryngeals are lost:
** before a following vowel (HV &gt; V)
** following a vowel in syllables before the accent (VHC´ &gt; VC´)
** following a vowel with [[compensatory lengthening]], otherwise (VH &gt; V̄)
** between plosives in noninitial syllables (CHC &gt; CC)
* Two adjacent dentals become two adjacent sibilants (TT &gt; ss)

====Italo-Celtic====
The following sound changes are shared with the [[Italic languages]] in particular, and can be used in support of the [[Italo-Celtic]] hypothesis.{{sfn|Schrijver|2015|pp=196–197}}
* [[Dybo's rule]]: long close vowels are shortened (or a laryngeal is lost) before resonant + stressed vowel.
** īR´ / ? *iHR´ &gt; iR´
** ūR´ / ? *uHR´ &gt; uR´
* Possibly, postconsonantal laryngeals are lost before pretonic close vowels:
** CHiC´ &gt; CiC´
** CHuC´ &gt; CuC´
* Development of initial [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], following the previous two changes.
* Possibly, vocalization of laryngeals to *ī between a *CR cluster and consonantal *j (CRHjV &gt; CRījV)
* Syllabic laryngeals become *a (CHC &gt; CaC)
* Syllabic resonants before a voiced unaspirated stop become *Ra (R̥D &gt; RaD)
* *m is assimilated or lost before a glide:
** mj &gt; nj
** mw &gt; w
* *p assimilates to *kʷ when another *kʷ follows later in the word (p…kʷ &gt; kʷ…kʷ)
* sr &gt; θr, word-medially -ðr-
* sVs &gt; ss, sTVs &gt; Ts

One change shows non-exact parallels in Italic: the vocalization of syllabic resonants next to laryngeals depending on the environment. Similar developments appear in Italic, but for the syllabic nasals *m̥, *n̥, the result is Proto-Italic *əm, *ən (&gt; Latin ''em'' ~ ''im'', ''en'' ~ ''in'').
* Word-initially, HR̥C &gt; aRC
* Before voiceless stops, CR̥HT &gt; CRaT
* CR̥HV &gt; CaRHV
* CR̥HC &gt; CRāC

===Early Proto-Celtic===
* Sequences of velar and *w merge into the labiovelars (it is uncertain if this preceded or followed the next change; that is, whether gw &gt; b or gw &gt; gʷ):
** kw &gt; kʷ
** gw &gt; gʷ
** gʰw &gt; gʷʰ
* gʷ &gt; b
* Aspirated stops lose their aspiration and merge with the voiced stops (except that this [[feeding order|counterfeeds]] the previous change, so *gʷʰ &gt; *gʷ doesn't result in a merger):
** bʰ &gt; b
** dʰ &gt; d
** gʰ &gt; g
** gʷʰ &gt; gʷ
* *e before a resonant and *a (but not *ā) becomes *a as well (eRa &gt; aRa): *ǵʰelH-ro &gt; *gelaro &gt; *galaro / *gérH-no &gt; *gerano &gt; *garano (Joseph's rule).
* Epenthetic *i is inserted after syllabic liquids when followed by a plosive:
** l̥T &gt; liT
** r̥T &gt; riT
* Epenthetic *a is inserted before the remaining syllabic resonants:
** m̥ &gt; am
** n̥ &gt; an
** l̥ &gt; al
** r̥ &gt; ar
* All remaining nonsyllabic laryngeals are lost.
* ē &gt; ī
* ō &gt; ū in final syllables
* Long vowels are shortened before a syllable-final resonant (V:RC &gt; VRC); this also shortens long diphthongs. ([[Osthoff's law]])

===Late Proto-Celtic===
* Plosives become *x before a different plosive or *s (C₁C₂ &gt; xC₂, Cs &gt; xs)
* p &gt; b before liquids (pL &gt; bL)
* p &gt; w before nasals (pN &gt; wN)
* p &gt; ɸ (except possibly after *s)
* ō &gt; ā
* ew &gt; ow
* uwa &gt; owa

In contrast to the parent language, Proto-Celtic does not use [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] as a [[feature (linguistics)|feature]] for distinguishing [[phoneme]]s. So the Proto-Indo-European [[voiced consonant|voiced]] aspirated stops *{{PIE|''bʰ''}}, *{{PIE|''dʰ''}}, *{{PIE|''gʰ/ǵʰ''}} merged with *{{PIE|''b''}}, *{{PIE|''d''}}, *{{PIE|''g/ǵ''}}. The voiced aspirate [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] *{{PIE|''gʷʰ''}} did not merge with *{{PIE|''gʷ''}}, though: plain *{{PIE|''gʷ''}} became *{{PIE|''b''}} in Proto-Celtic, while aspirated *{{PIE|''gʷʰ''}} became *{{PIE|''gʷ''}}. Thus, PIE *{{PIE|''gʷen-''}} 'woman' became Old Irish ''ben'' and Old Welsh ''ben'', but PIE *{{PIE|''gʷʰn̥-''}} 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish ''gonaid'' and Welsh ''gwanu''.

Proto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''p''}} was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages *{{PIE|''ɸ''}} (as in the table above) and *{{PIE|''h''}} (perhaps attested by the [[toponym]] [[Hercynian Forest|Hercynia]] if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic *{{PIE|''ɸ''}} underwent different changes: the [[consonant cluster|clusters]] *{{PIE|''ɸs''}} and *{{PIE|''ɸt''}} became *{{PIE|''xs''}} and *{{PIE|''xt''}} respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE *{{PIE|''sp-''}} became Old Irish ''s'' (lenited ''f-'', exactly as for PIE *{{PIE|''sw-''}}) and Brythonic ''f''; while {{harvnb|Schrijver|1995|p=348}} argues there was an intermediate stage *{{PIE|''sɸ-''}} (in which *{{PIE|ɸ}} remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), {{harvnb|McCone|1996|pp=44–45}} finds it more economical to believe that *{{PIE|''sp-''}} remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change *{{PIE|''p''}} to *{{PIE|''ɸ''}} did not happen when *{{PIE|''s''}} preceded. (Similarly, [[Grimm's law]] did not apply to ''*p, t, k'' after *''s'' in [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]], and later the same exception occurred again in the [[High German consonant shift]].)

{|class="wikitable"
! Proto-Celtic
! Old Irish
! Welsh
|-
| *{{PIE|laɸs-}} &gt; *{{PIE|laxs-}} 'shine'
| ''las-aid''
| ''llach-ar''
|-
| *{{PIE|seɸtam}} &gt; *{{PIE|sextam}} 'seven'

In [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and the [[Brythonic languages]], a new *{{PIE|''p''}} sound has arisen as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''kʷ''}} phoneme. Consequently, one finds Gaulish ''petuar[ios]'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pedwar'' "four", compared to [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] *''cethair'' and [[Latin]] ''quattuor''. Insofar as this new /p/ fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a [[chain shift]].

The terms '''P-Celtic''' and '''Q-Celtic''' are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme.  However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient [[Continental Celtic languages]]. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the [[Insular Celtic languages]] are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic ''vs'' Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common [[substratum]] influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland,[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5469/1158], or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.

Q-Celtic languages may also have /p/ in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish /kʷ/ was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a /p/ phoneme at the time:
*Latin ''Patricius'' "[[Saint Patrick]]"' &gt; Welsh &gt; Primitive Irish {{sm|Qatrikias}} &gt; Old Irish ''Cothrige'', later [[Saint Patrick|''Padraig'']];
*Latin ''[[presbyter]]'' "priest" &gt; early form of word seen in [[Old Welsh]] ''premter primter'' &gt; Primitive Irish {{sm|qrimitir}} &gt; Old Irish ''cruimther''.
Gaelic ''póg'' "kiss" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase ''osculum pacis'' "kiss of peace") at a stage where ''p'' was borrowed directly as ''p'', without substituting ''c''.

===Vowels===
The Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by [[Antoine Meillet]]. The following [[monophthong]]s have been reconstructed:

==Morphology==

===Nouns===

The [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (structure) of [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s demonstrates no arresting alterations from the parent language. Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three [[grammatical gender|genders]], three [[grammatical number|numbers]] and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pedersen, Holger |title=Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen, 2. Band, Bedeutungslehre (Wortlehre) |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |location=Göttingen |year=1913 |isbn=3-525-26119-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Old Irish may have only five, the evidence from Continental Celtic is considered{{by whom|date=April 2011}} rather unambiguous despite appeals to archaic retentions or [[morphological leveling]]. These cases were [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

Nouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem. There are *''o''-stems, *''ā''-stems, *''i''-stems, *''u''-stems, dental stems, velar stems, nasal stems, *''r''-stems and *''s''-stems.

Likewise, final *-''d'' [[Voicelessness|devoiced]] to *-''t''-: *''druwid''- "druid" &gt; *''druwits''.&lt;ref&gt;''passim'' in Whitley Stokes D.C.L., Hon VII. ''Celtic Declension.'' “Transactions of the Philological Society” Volume 20, Issue 1, pages 97–201, November 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

E.g. *''rīxs'' 'king' (masculine) ([[Gaulish language|Gallic]] -''rix''; [[Old Irish]] ''rí''; [[Middle Welsh]] ''rhi'', [[Old Breton]] ''ri'')

===Verbs===
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
From comparison between early Old Irish and Gaulish forms it seems that Continental and Insular Celtic verbs were to develop differently and so the study of Irish and Welsh may have unduly weighted past opinion of proto-Celtic verbal morphology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It can be inferred from Gaulish and Celtiberian as well as Insular Celtic that the proto-Celtic verb had at least three moods:
* [[Indicative mood|indicative]] — seen in e.g. 1st sg. Gaulish ''delgu'' "I hold", Old Irish ''tongu'' "I swear"
* [[Imperative mood|imperative]] — seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Celtiberian ''usabituz'', Gaulish ''appisetu''
* [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] — seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''buetid'' "may he be", Celtiberian ''asekati''
and four tenses:
* [[Present tense|present]] — seen in e.g. Gaulish ''uediíu-mi'' "I pray", Celtiberian ''zizonti'' "they sow"
* [[preterite]] — seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''sioxti'', Lepontic ''&lt;small&gt;K&lt;/small&gt;ari&lt;small&gt;T&lt;/small&gt;e''
* [[imperfect]] — perhaps in Celtiberian ''kombalkez'', ''atibion''
* [[Future tense|future]] — seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''bissiet'', Old Irish ''bieid'' "he shall be"
A probable [[optative mood]] also features in Gaulish (''tixsintor'') and an [[infinitive]] (with a characteristic ending ''-unei'') in Celtiberian.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Schumacher, ''Die keltischen Primärverben: Ein vergleichendes, etymologisches und morphologisches Lexikon'' (Innsbruck: Institut für Sprachen und Literaturen der Universität, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La Langue gauloise: Description linguistique, commentaire d'inscriptions choisies'' (Paris: Errance, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs were formed by adding [[suffix]]es to a [[verb]]al [[Word stem|stem]]. The stem might be [[Thematic stem|thematic]] or [[Athematic stem|athematic]], an [[Open syllable|open]] or a [[closed syllable]].

==Dating==
Proto-Celtic is mostly dated to roughly 800 BC (Hallstatt C), see [[Celtic languages]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In the first decade of the 21st century a number of scholars addressed this question using  [[computation]]al methods, with differing results. Gray and Atkinson estimated a date of 6100&amp;nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]] (4100&amp;nbsp;BC) while Forster and Toth suggest a date of  3200&amp;nbsp;BC ±1500&amp;nbsp;years for the arrival of Celtic in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1331158100|last=Forster|first=Peter |author2=Toth, Alfred  |title=Toward a phylogenetic chronology of ancient Gaulish, Celtic, and Indo-European|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|pages=9079–9084|year=2003|pmid=12837934|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9079F|pmc=166441}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such early dates are not generally accepted.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">The '''''Scholia Sinaitica''''' are fragments of a work of [[Roman law]] written in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], dating between 438 and 529 AD, containing comments to the books 35-38 of [[Ulpian]]'s ''ad Sabinum'' treatise.

The papyrus fragments that show parts of the work were discovered by the Greek scholar [[Gregorios Bernardakis]] in the 19th century in a [[Mount Sinai]] convent.

The scroll is not the work of a single author, but of different authors at different times who are generally thought to be of Eastern origin. The literature suggests that the authors were connected to the [[Law School of Beirut]], they cite numerous works of Roman jurists, texts from imperial constitutions and also the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]],'' demonstrating knowledge and availability of legal texts of Roman law broader than that demonstrated by contemporary authors of the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the empire.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | publisher=American Philosophical Society | year=1953 | isbn= 9780871694324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spider-Ham''' ('''Peter Porker''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a '[[funny animal]]' [[parody]] of [[Spider-Man]], and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and Mark Armstrong.

He first appeared in the one-shot humor [[comic book]] ''Marvel Tails Starring Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, which was then followed by an ongoing bi-monthly series, ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint. The character existed on Larval Earth, which was an  anthropomorphic universe.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|title= Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|work= Time|date=2009-09-03|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/09/02/top-10-oddest-marvel-characters/slide/spider-ham/|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter). He resided in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created "the world's first atomic powered hairdryer", hoping that "the introduction of nuclear fusion into America's beauty salons" would "revolutionize the hair care industry".&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself. Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a '''Spider-Ham!'''"'' - ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #15 (May 1987)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname "Porker", that of his benefactor May Porker, who after the accident mentally attuned to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains. May Porker's scientific genius was transferred to Peter, giving him the know-how to devise his webspinner gauntlets to replace his lost natural ability. This story contradicted a detail in "Salad Daze" (''Spider-Ham'' #6) where Peter Porker, in a vigil at May Porker's hospital bed, thinks back to his pre-Spider-Ham years when he was just a young pig being raised by his loving aunt.

===Misadventures===
Porker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure teamed up with Captain Americat, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of "The Marauder", in a series of events that led to the creation of the Hulk-Bunny (''Marvel Tails'' #1, "If He Should Punch Me").

Several months later, Spider-Ham encountered his main nemesis and one of his only re-occurring enemies in the form of Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, "The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom"). Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #6, "Salad Daze").

Other notable menaces Porker would face along the way include the Bull-Frog (a parody of the Marvel villain [[Man-Bull]]), the Buzzard (an opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular [[Godzilla]]), and the King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]).

Three characters, not parallels to anybody in the Spider-Man series, also begin in #1: J. Jeremiah Jackal, Jr. (J. Jonah Jackal's nephew), Bunson Bunny and Upton Adam Stray (a cat with shades), all junior trainees at the Daily Beagle. They acquire super-powers in #15, encouraging Spider-Ham in his already made decision to abandon his super-hero career. But they totally fumble their first mission, forcing Peter Porker to resume his alterego as Spider-Ham. Further misadventures of the Beagle Brigadeers were in the back-up stories in ''Marvel Tales''.

The series also included back-up stories featuring such characters as Deerdevil ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]), Goose Rider ([[Ghost Rider]]) and the Fantastic Fur (the [[Fantastic Four]]). Some of these back-ups were contradictory, presenting different anthropomorphic versions of characters in different stories, such as two [[Namor]] counterparts: the Sub-Merchandizer (a dog) and the Sub-Marsupial (possibly a wombat). (Note: the Asinine Torch (a donkey) that appeared in a story with the Sub-Marsupial and the Fantastic Fur's Simian Torch are not two variants of the Fantastic Four's [[Human Torch]]; since he was depicted as elderly in the 1980s, and referred to as an "old sparring partner" of the Sub-Marsupial's, he was obviously a counterpart to the [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]].)

===Marvel Zombies===
When Spider-Ham accidentally travels to the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, he is suddenly zombified by a group of zombies, namely [[Colonel America]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. It appears that he is directly shot in the head by an energy bullet by [[Ultron|Earth 616's Ultron]], effectively killing him but, in a zombie state, Spider-Ham turned into Ham-ibal Lecter. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Spider-Verse===
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Spider-Ham became a member of the Spider-Army fighting against the Inheritors. He played a crucial role in the final confrontation when he switches places with Benjy Parker (the baby brother of [[Spider-Girl]] of [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982]]) - one of the three sacrifices needed for the Inheritors to destroy the Spider-Totems - allowing [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] to get Benjy to safety.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Secret Wars''===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Spider-Ham found himself the only pig in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia and ended up as the captive of its [[Mayor]], [[Norman Osborn]]. He was rescued by [[Spider-Gwen]],&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars: Spider-Verse'' #1 (May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and the two eventually discovered and teamed up with other spider-powered people ([[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Man: India]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]]), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Verse'' vol. 2 #2 (Jun. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Web Warriors''===
Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/&lt;/ref&gt;

Spider-Ham was first featured as star of the 1983 humorous one-shot ''Marvel Tails'', with a backup cast of other anthropomorphic funny-animal parodies of popular Marvel Comics characters, such as Captain AmeriCat (a cat version of [[Captain America]]), Hulk-Bunny (a rabbit version of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]) and Goose Rider (a goose version of [[Ghost Rider]]).

Two years later, a solo series, titled ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' debuted under Marvel's Star Comics imprint. The series, published bi-monthly, lasted seventeen issues before its cancellation in 1987. With the cancellation of ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'', the character became a backup feature in ''Marvel Tales'', a monthly reprint series showcasing Spider-Man's past adventures. Beginning with issue #201 ([[cover date]]d July 1987), these new Spider-Ham stories appeared in issues #201-212, 214-219, 223-230, 233, 236, 237, 239, 240, and 247 before ceasing altogether.

In issue #3 of ''[[What The--?!]]'' (cover dated October 1988), Porker meets with Raven the Hunter (a parody of Spider-Man's nemesis [[Kraven the Hunter]]) in a story that satirized the popular "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles. Spider-Ham also makes appearances in issues #18, 20, 22, and 24 of ''What The--?!'' The 26th issue of ''What The--?!'' (cover dated fall 1993) features "Spider-Ham 15.88", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's future counterpart, Miguel O'Hara a.k.a. ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''. The "15.88" is not seen as a year, but rather a humorous take on the price of a ham (the cover states that it was marked down from the original price of $20.99).

Spider-Ham has also appeared on the cover ''[[Wha...Huh?]]'' #1, and was referred to as a fictional character in the [[Earth-616]] Marvel Universe, in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #52.

''Spider-Man Family'' #1 (2005 one-shot) features a sixteen-page ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' story, in which May Parker ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s daughter) watches a [[DVD]] showing a small portion of a fictional Spider-Ham animated series, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies, [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Here, Spider-Ham appears to mostly be a parody of [[Batman]]. Also in the issue, there is a partial reprint of ''Marvel Tails'' #1.

Spider-Ham was selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'' crossover, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #528. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081211063549/http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=53776]

In January 2007, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] authored the ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] Spider-Ham'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], featuring Spider-Ham's attempt to find his missing "thought balloons" against a Civil War parody. The story does not fit in with previously established Spider-Ham "continuity".

Tom Defalco returned to Spider-Ham's world in 2009, in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4-5. He introduces Swiney-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Ham and counterpart of Defalco's other creation [[Spider-Girl]]. Once again, the story strays away from the established, albeit loose, continuity of the original Spider-Ham stories by altering the character's origin and supporting characters, most notably in establishing Peter Porker as a natural-born pig bitten by a radioactive spider (directly mirroring Spider-Man's origin) and altering his love interest (a counterpart of [[Mary Jane Watson]]) from a [[water buffalo]] to a [[crane (bird)|crane]].

He fights alongside the ''X-Babies'' in issue #4 (March 2010) of their four-issue miniseries from 2009-2010.

To mark the anniversary of ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, Marvel released the ''Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special'' in July 2010, with Tom Defalco writing both Spider-Ham and Swiney-Girl stories. These stories feature most of Spider-Ham's original cast and origin, but incorporates the Mary Crane Watsow character from ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' rather than her original counterpart.

==Other characters==
Earth-8311 featured anthropomorphic parodies of a variety of other Marvel characters.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Spider-Ham is alluded in the cartoon series ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/24/marvel-television-animation-comic-con/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402061057/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/24/marvel-television-animation-comic-con/ |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Flight of the Iron Spider", [[Iron Man]] shows Spider-Man a machine that could scatter any physical object's particles inside across parallel universes. Spider-Man briefly envisions himself being turned into Spider-Ham as a result. In "Run Pig Run", [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (disguised as a [[hot dog]] [[vendor]]) give Spider-Man an enchanted hot dog that turns him into Spider-Ham as payback. Just then, Asgard's finest hunters led by [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] arrive and chase after Spider-Ham as part of Asgardsreia. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comes to Spider-Ham's aid and guesses that Loki had done this to him. While running, Thor tells Spider-Ham that he must keep him alive until the hunt ends at sundown. Thor throws Spider-Ham and his hammer towards Midtown High School. Thor brings Spider-Ham to [[Phil Coulson]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] just as Executioner and the other hunters arrive. Spider-Ham even tries to reason with Executioner that he's not a real pig. [[Phil Coulson]] arrives where he and Thor hold off the hunters while the others get Spider-Ham out of there. While on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] helps to protect Spider-Ham when the wolves that the hunters ride on sprout wings and attack the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. While Thor, Coulson, and Spider-Ham's team fight Executioner and the hunters, Spider-Ham ends up calling out Loki and fights him. Not wanting his friends to sacrifice themselves for him, Spider-Ham fights Executioner. Before Executioner can land the killing blow on Spider-Ham, the sun sets ending the hunt. Spider-Ham changes back to Spider-Man and punches Loki.
:* The actual Spider-Ham appears in the "Spider-Verse" episodes voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. An alternate version of Spider-Man, Peter Porker got his powers from a spider that fell into [[Aunt May]]'s pancake batter that transferred the vitamins and powers to him, becoming Spider-Ham. He uses his powers for good and even joins with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but decides to quit after [[J. Jonah Jameson|J. Jonah Jackal]] turns the public against him. In the episode "Spider-Verse" Pt. 2, he encounters [[Spider-Man]] (whom he mistook for a monkey) while relaxing by his mud pool. With encouragement from Spider-Man, he decides to become Spider-Ham once again and helps fight the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]]. Although the Goblin still manages to get DNA from his chin, Spider-Ham is offered by Iron Mouse a spot on the Avengers team again which he accepts. In the episode "Spider-Verse" Pt. 4, Spider-Ham appears along [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Spider-Girl]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], Spyder-Knight, and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] to help Spider-Man defeat the Spider-Goblin and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. In the episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 1, Spider-Ham ends up in Peter Parker's living room alongside Spyder-Knight and Miles Morales' mother Rio due to the effects of the shattered Siege Perilous.

In the [[performing arts]], a '''stage mother''' is the mother of a [[child actor]]. The mother will often drive her child to auditions, make sure he or she is on the [[Set construction|set]] on time, etc.  The term ''stage mother'' sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/matter-personality/201109/living-vicariously-through-children-twist|title=Living Vicariously through Children with a Twist|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent.

==Definition==
A stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., [[Rose Thompson Hovick]], [[Dina Lohan]], [[Judy Garland|Ethel Gumm]], [[Teri Shields]], [[Hilary Duff|Susan Duff]], etc.) &amp;mdash; representing her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as "momagers" in the film industry.&lt;ref name="momager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/07/13/beyonce-manager-matthew-knowles-britney-spears-kardashian-simpson/#more-50228|title=From Beyonce To Britney Spears, Is It Ever A Good Idea To Be Managed By A Parent?|accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of "stage mother" can be affixed to the mother{{by whom|date=October 2014}} without cause. [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film ''[[Model Behavior]]'', it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie.

==Stage fathers==
Fathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Jackson]] (patriarch of the [[Jackson family]]), [[Murry Wilson]] (father of three of [[The Beach Boys]]), Joe Simpson (father of [[Jessica Simpson|Jessica]] and [[Ashlee Simpson]]), Jeff Archuleta (father of ''[[American Idol]]'' runner-up [[David Archuleta]]), [[Mathew Knowles]] (father of [[Beyoncé]] and [[Solange Knowles]]) and [[Kit Culkin]] (father of [[Macaulay Culkin|Macaulay]] and [[Kieran Culkin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705759/The-father-from-hell.html|title=The father from hell?|date=1996-11-09|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A historical example of such a father was [[Leopold Mozart]], who recognized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his son's]] musical ability at an early age and made the most of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Holmes (musicologist) |date=1845 |title=The Life of Mozart Including His Correspondence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]], father of Tejano superstar [[Selena]], is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days.

Stage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2017/03/16/lavar-ball-hurt-lonzo-ball-nba-draft-stock-ucla-march-madness/99248918/|title=Could LaVar Ball scare NBA teams from drafting Lonzo Ball?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and  backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates.&lt;ref&gt;"Was it Guys Like These who Ruined Sportsmanship....or was it Just Us?"

== Script mother ==
A variant of the term has been a "script mother", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

An example of a script mother has been [[Lynn Johnston]], who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip ''For Better or for Worse'', as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a [[private school]] with tougher regulations on student conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Johnston "Kate and I were constantly bullied due to the strip" Suddenly Silver, 25 Years of FBOFW, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Steel frame development.JPG|thumb|right|Steel framed housing development&lt;!-- so where is that then??? Portsmouth. --&gt;]]
[[Image:Lloyds Axe and Willis.jpg|thumb|right|Rectangular steel frame, or "perimeter frame" of the Willis building (at right) contrasted against the [[diagrid]] frame at [[30 St Mary Axe]], London, UK.]]
'''Steel frame''' is a building technique with a "[[skeleton]] frame" of vertical [[steel]] [[columns]] and horizontal [[i-beam|{{ibeam}}-beams]], constructed in a rectangular grid to support the floors, roof and walls of a building which are all attached to the frame. The development of this technique made the construction of the [[skyscraper]] possible.

==Concept==
The [[Rolling mill|rolled steel]] "profile" or [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of steel columns takes the shape of the letter "I". The two wide [[flange]]s of a column are thicker and wider than the flanges on a [[Beam (structure)|beam]], to better withstand [[compressive stress]] in the structure. Square and round tubular sections of steel can also be used, often filled with concrete. Steel beams are connected to the columns with bolts and threaded fasteners, and historically connected by [[rivets]]. The central "web" of the steel [[i-beam|{{ibeam}}-beams]] is often wider than a column web to resist the higher bending moments that occur in beams.

Wide sheets of steel deck can be used to cover the top of the steel frame as a "form" or [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] mold, below a thick layer of concrete and steel [[rebar|reinforcing bars]]. Another popular alternative is a floor of precast concrete flooring units with some form of concrete topping.  Often in office buildings, the final floor surface is provided by some form of raised flooring system with the void between the walking surface and the structural floor being used for cables and air handling ducts.

The frame needs to be protected from fire because steel softens at high temperature and this can cause the building to partially collapse.  In the case of the columns this is usually done by encasing it in some form of fire resistant structure such as masonry, concrete or plasterboard.  The beams may be cased in concrete, plasterboard or sprayed with a coating to insulate it from the heat of the fire or it can be protected by a fire-resistant ceiling construction.  [[Asbestos]] was a popular material for fireproofing steel structures up until the early 1970s, before the health risks of asbestos fibres were fully understood.

The exterior "skin" of the building is anchored to the frame using a variety of [[construction]] techniques and following a huge variety of [[architectural style]]s. [[Brick]]s, [[List of stone|stone]], [[reinforced concrete]], [[architectural glass]], [[sheet metal]] and simply paint have been used to cover the frame to protect the steel from the weather.

==Cold formed steel frames==
{{see also|Framing (construction)}}
[[Image:Light gage metal framing.JPG|thumb|left|Interior partition walls made with cold formed steel]]
This is also known as LSF or Lightweight Steel Framing.

Thin sheets of galvanized steel can be cold formed into [[Wall stud|steel studs]] for use as a structural or non structural [[building material]] for both external and partition walls in both residential, commercial and industrial construction projects (pictured). The dimension of the room is established with horizontal track that is anchored to the floor and ceiling to outline each room. The vertical studs are arranged in the tracks, usually spaced 16" apart, and fastened at the top and bottom.

The typical profiles used in residential [[construction]] are the C-shape stud and the U-shaped track, and a variety of other profiles. Framing members are generally produced in a thickness of 12 to 25 [[Sheet metal gauge|gauge]]. Heavy gauges, such as 12 and 14 gauge, are commonly used when axial loads (parallel to the length of the member) are high such as in loadbearing construction. Medium-heavy gauges, such as 16 and 18 gauge, are commonly used when there are no axial loads but heavy lateral loads (perpendicular to the member) such as exterior wall studs that need to resist hurricane-force wind loads along coasts. Light gauges, such as 25 gauge, are commonly used where there are no axial loads and very light lateral loads such as in interior construction where the members serve as framing for demising walls between rooms. The wall finish is anchored to the two [[flange]] sides of the stud, which varies from 1-1/4" to 3" thick, and the width of web ranges from 1-5/8" to 14". Rectangular sections are removed from the web to provide access for electrical wiring.

Steel mills produce galvanized sheet steel, the base material for the manufacture of cold formed steel profiles. Sheet steel is then [[Rolling mill|roll-formed]] into the final profiles used for framing. The sheets are zinc coated (galvanized) to prevent [[oxidation]] and [[corrosion]]. Steel framing provides excellent design flexibility due to the high strength to weight ratio of steel, which allows it to [[Span (architecture)|span]] over a long distances, and also resist wind and earthquake loads.

Steel framed walls can be designed to offer excellent thermal and acoustic properties - one of the specific considerations when building using cold formed steel is that thermal bridging can occur across the wall system between the outside environment and interior conditioned space.  Thermal bridging can be protected against by installing a layer of externally fixed insulation along the steel framing - typically referred to as a 'thermal break'.

The spacing between studs is typically 16 inches on center for homes exterior and interior walls depending on designed loading requirements. In office suites the spacing is 24 inches on center for all walls except for elevator and staircasewells.&lt;ref&gt;Light Steel Framing: Improving the Integral Design. http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/1409&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The use of steel for structural purposes was initially slow. The [[Bessemer process]] in 1855 made steel production more efficient, and cheap steels, which had high tensile and compressive strengths plus good ductility were available from about 1870, but wrought and cast iron continued to satisfy most of the demand for iron-based building products, due mainly to problems of producing steel from alkaline ores. These problems, caused principally by the presence of phosphorus, were solved by [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas]] in 1879.

It was not until 1880 that an era of construction based on reliable mild steel began.  By that date the quality of steels being produced had become reasonably consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tatasteelconstruction.com/en/reference/teaching_resources/architectural_studio_reference/history/the_technology_of_iron_and_steel/the_properties_of_cast_iron,_wrought_iron_and_steel "The properties of cast iron, wrought iron and steel"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324031722/http://www.tatasteelconstruction.com/en/reference/teaching_resources/architectural_studio_reference/history/the_technology_of_iron_and_steel/the_properties_of_cast_iron%2C_wrought_iron_and_steel |date=2014-03-24 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Home Insurance Building]], completed in 1885, was the first to use  skeleton frame construction, completely removing the load bearing function of its masonry cladding. In this case the iron columns are merely embedded in the walls, and their load carrying capacity appears to be secondary to the capacity of the masonry, particularly for wind loads. In the United States, the first steel framed building was the [[Rand McNally Building]] in Chicago, erected in 1890.

The [[Royal Insurance Building (Liverpool)|Royal Insurance Building]] in [[Liverpool]] designed by [[James Francis Doyle]] in 1895 (erected 1896-1903) was the first to use a steel frame in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Alistair, A.

'''Tetrapharmacum''', Latinized from the Greek τετραφάρμακος  ''tetrapharmakos'' (feminine; also τετραϕάρμακον ''tetrapharmakon'') "the "fourfold drug", was an [[History of pharmacy#Antiquity|ancient Greek pharmaceutical]] compound, a mixture of wax, pine resin, pitch and animal fat, most often pork fat.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, ''A Greek-English '', Oxford (1940), citing Meno Iatr. 14.19, Ph.1.433 (= Stoic.2.154), Gal.1.242; also -κον, τό, Id.12.328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''[[tetrapharmakos]]'' has been used metaphorically by 1st-century [[Epicureans]] to refer to the four Κύριαι Δόξαι ("chief doctrines") or remedies for healing the soul.&lt;ref&gt;The name cannot be traced further back than Cicero and Philodemos.  
Pamela Gordon, ''Epicurus in Lycia: The Second-century World of Diogenes of Oenoanda'', University of Michigan Press (1996), p. 61, fn 85, citing A. Angeli, "Compendi, eklogai, tetrapharmakos" (1986), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently named after this unprepossessing concoction, ''tetrapharmacum''(or ''''tetrafarmacum'')  was a complicated and expensive dish in Roman Imperial [[Ancient Roman cuisine|cuisine]]. 
It contained [[pig|sow]]'s [[udder]], [[pheasant]], [[wild boar]] and [[ham]] in [[pastry]]. The only surviving source of information on the tetrafarmacum is the ''[[Augustan History]]'', which mentions it three times. All three mentions are credited to the now-lost biography of [[Hadrian]] by [[Marius Maximus]]. According to this source, the Caesar [[Lucius Aelius]] (died 138) invented the dish;  his senior colleague, the Emperor Hadrian, liked it; a later emperor, [[Alexander Severus]], liked it too.

'''Turn-taking''' is a type of organization in [[conversation]] and [[discourse (linguistics)|discourse]] where participants speak one at a time in alternating turns. In practice, it involves processes for constructing contributions, responding to previous comments, and transitioning to a different speaker, using a variety of linguistic and non-linguistic cues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conversation Analysis|last=Drew|first=Paul|last2=Heritage|first2=John|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4129-1848-0|editor-last=Drew|editor-first=Paul|volume=I|location=London|pages=xxxiv|editor-last2=Heritage|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure is generally universal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stivers|first=Tanya|last2=Enfield|first2=N.

In many contexts, conversation turns are a valuable means to participate in social life and have been subject to competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118325001.ch9/summary|title=Turn Allocation and Turn Sharing|last=Hayashi|first=Makoto|date=2012-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|isbn=9781118325001|editor-last=Sidnell|editor-first=Jack|pages=167–190|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118325001.ch9/pdf|editor-last2=Stivers|editor-first2=Tanya}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often thought that turn-taking strategies differ by [[Language and gender|gender]]; consequently, turn-taking has been a topic of intense examination in [[gender studies]].

==Organization==
{{Missing information|section|theories other than Conversation Analysis|talksection=Missing information|date=June 2016}}
In conversation analysis, turn-taking organization describes the sets of practices speakers use to construct and allocate turns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The organization of turn-taking was first explored as a part of [[conversation analysis]] by [[Harvey Sacks]] with [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]] in the late 1960s/early 1970s, and their model is still generally accepted in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/view/document/obo-9780199756384/obo-9780199756384-0121.xml?#obo-9780199756384-0121-div1-0006|title=Conversation Analysis - Sociology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|website=oxfordbibliographiesonline.com|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turn-taking structure within a conversation has three components:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|last2=Schegloff|first2=Emanuel A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=Gail|date=1974-01-01|title=A Simplest Systematics for the Organization of Turn-Taking for Conversation|jstor=412243|journal=Language|volume=50|issue=4|pages=696–735|doi=10.2307/412243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Turn-taking component'' contains the main content of the utterance and is built from various unit types ([[Turn construction unit|Turn-Construction Units]], or TCUs). The end of a TCU is a point where the turn may end and a new speaker may begin, known as a [[Turn construction unit#Transition Relevance Place .28TRP.29|transition-relevant point]] or TRP.
# The ''Turn allocation component'' comprises techniques that select the next speaker. There are two types of techniques: those where the current speaker selects the next speaker, and those where the next speaker selects themself.
# ''Rules'' govern turn construction and give options to designate the next turn-taker in such a way as to minimize gaps and overlap. Once a Transition Relevance Place is reached, the following rules are applied in order:
## The current speaker selects the next speaker and transfers the turn to them; or
## One of the non-speakers self-selects, with the first person to speak claiming the next turn; or
## No one self-selects, and the current speaker continues until the next TRP or the conversation ends
This order of steps serves to maintain two important elements of conversation: one person speaking at a time and minimized space between when one person stops talking and another begins.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Harvey|title=Lectures on Conversation|year=1992|publisher=Blackwell|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=2.32–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the system is not optimized for fairness or efficiency, and because turn-taking is not reliant on a set number or type of participants,&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt; there are many variations in how turn-taking occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=Richard|title=Argumentation, Information, and Interaction: Studies in Face-to-face Interactive Argumentation Under Different Turn-Taking Conditions|year=1989|publisher=Gothenburg Monographs in Linguistics|location=Gothenburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing===
Another cue associated with turn-taking is that of timing. Within turn-taking, timing may cue the hearer to know that they have a turn to speak or make an [[utterance]]. Due to the very nature of turn-taking and that it is dependent on the [[context (language use)|context]], timing varies within a turn and may be subjective within the conversation. [[Human voice|Vocal patterns]], such as [[Vocal register|pitch]], specific to the individual also cue the hearer to know how the timing will play out in turn-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowley|first=S.|date=1998|title=Of timing, turn-taking, and conversations|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistics Research|volume=27|issue=5|pages=541–571|doi=10.1023/A:1024948912805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Tannen]] also shows timing differences in relation to turn-taking. For a particular study, she used a recording of a conversation between a group of her friends at dinner. The group included men and women from across the United States of mixed ethnicities. She concluded that while the amount of space left between speakers may differ, it differs most dramatically between people from different [[regions]]. For instance, [[New York City|New Yorkers]] tend to overlap in conversation, while [[California]]ns tend to leave more space between turns and [[sentences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tannen|first1=Deborah|editor1-last=Paulston|editor1-first=Christina|editor2-last=Kiesling|editor2-first=Scott|editor3-last=Rangel|editor3-first=Elizabeth|title=The handbook of intercultural discourse and communication|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|location=Chicester, UK|pages=135–157|doi=10.1002/9781118247273.ch8|chapter=Turn-taking and intercultural discourse and communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overlap===
When more than one person is engaging in a conversation, there is potential for overlapping or interruption while both or many parties are speaking at the same time. Overlapping in turn-taking can be problematic for the people involved. 
There are four types of overlap including terminal overlaps, continuers, conditional access to the turn, and chordal. Terminal overlaps occur when a speaker assumes the other speaker has or is about to finish their turn and begins to speak, thus creating overlap. Continuers are a way of the hearer acknowledging or understanding what the speaker is saying. As noted by Schegloff, such examples of the continuer's phrases are "mm hm" or "uh huh." Conditional access to the turn implies that the current speaker yields their turn or invites another speaker to [[Interjection|interject]] in the conversation, usually as collaborative effort.&lt;ref name="Schegloff, E. 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schegloff|first=Emanuel A.|date=2000|title=Overlapping talk and the organization of turn-taking for conversation|journal=Language in Society|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–63|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-in-society/article/overlapping-talk-and-the-organization-of-turntaking-for-conversation/D12AD4181BEEFB073869BE7C55B07660|doi=10.1017/s0047404500001019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example that Schegloff illustrates is a speaker invited another to speak out of turn when finding a word in a word search. Chordal consists of a non-serial occurrence of turns; meaning both speakers' turns are occurring at once, such as [[laughter]]. 
It should be noted that the above types of overlap are considered to be non-competitive overlap in conversation.&lt;ref name="Schegloff, E. 2000"/&gt;

Schegloff suggested an overlap resolution device, which consists of 3 parts:&lt;ref name="Schegloff, E. 2000"/&gt; 
# A set of resources that are used to compete for the turn space
# A set of places where the resources are used
# An interactional logic of the use of those resources at those places

Gail Jefferson proposed a categorization of overlaps in conversation with three types of overlap onsets: transitional overlap, recognitional overlap and progressional overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jefferson|first=Gail|date=1984|title=Notes on some orderlinesses of overlap onset|journal=Discourse analysis and natural rhetoric|pages=11–38|url=http://www.liso.ucsb.edu/liso_archives/Jefferson/overlap_onset.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Transitional overlap'' occurs when a speaker enters the conversation at the possible point of completion (i.e. transition relevance place). This occurs frequently when speakers participate in the conversation enthusiastically and exchange speeches with continuity.
#''Recognitional overlap'' occurs when a speaker anticipates the possible remainder of an unfinished sentence, and attempts to finish it for the current speaker. In other words, the overlap arises because the current speaker tries to finish the sentence, when simultaneously the other speaker "think aloud" to reflect his understanding of the ongoing speech.
#''Progressional overlap'' occurs as a result of the speech dysfluency of the previous speaker when another speaker self-selects to continue with the ongoing utterance. An example would be when a speaker is retrieving an appropriate word to utter when other speakers make use of this gap to start his/her turn.

Harvey Sacks, one of the first to study conversation, found a correlation between keeping only one person speaking at a time and controlling the amount of silences between speakers.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt; Although there is no limit or specific requirement for the number of speakers in a given conversation, the number of conversations will rise as the number of participants rise.

Overlaps can often be seen as problematic in terms of turn-taking, with the majority of research being between cooperative versus competitive overlap. One theory by Goldberg (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Julia A.|date=1990-12-01|title=Interrupting the discourse on interruptions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037821669090045F|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=14|issue=6|pages=883–903|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(90)90045-F}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues the dynamic relationship between overlap and power over the conversation by suggesting that two types of overlap are power interruptions and displays of rapport. During conversation, a listener has an obligation to support the speaker. An interruption impedes upon this obligation by infringing upon the wishes of the speaker (which is to be heard). The difference between a power interruption or rapport is the degree to which the speakers wishes are impeded upon. Rapport interruptions contribute to the conversation in that they ultimately cooperate and collaborate with the speaker in order to reach a mutual goal of understanding. Power interruptions are generally hostile and do not cooperate with the speaker. The goals of the power interruptor are both divergent from and regardless of the goals of the speaker. Power interruptions are further categorized into two types: process control interruptions and content control interruptions. Process control interruptions involve attempts to change the topic by utilizing questions and requests, and because they return control to the original speaker are generally seen as the less threatening of the two. Content control interruptions involve attempts to change the topic by utilizing assertions or statements that are unrelated to the current topic. Content control interruptions are viewed as problematic and threatening since they seize control of both the topic and attention away from the speaker.

However, while overlaps have the potential to be competitive, many overlaps are cooperative. Schegloff&lt;ref name="Schegloff, E. 2000" /&gt; concludes that the majority of overlaps are non-problematic. Konakahara et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konakahara|first=Mayu|date=2015-07-01|title=An analysis overlapping questions in casual ELF conversation: Cooperative or competitive contribution|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216615001320|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=84|pages=37–53|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2015.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores cooperative overlap by observing 15 graduate students from 11 different lingua-cultural backgrounds in an ELF ([[English as a lingua franca]]) conversation, or an English-based conversation among individuals of multiple native languages. Two types of overlap were observed: overlaps that were continuers or assessments and did not substantially contribute to the conversation or demand attention away from the speaker, and overlaps that were questions or statements and moved the conversation forwards. The majority of overlap during the study consisted of continuers or assessments that were non-interruptive. Overlapping questions and their interactional environment were analyzed in particular. It was found that overlapping questions demonstrate the speaker's interest in the conversation and knowledge of the content, act as clarifiers, and progress the conversation. In response, speakers who are interrupted by overlapping questions continue on to clarify their meaning. This suggests that overlapping questions, while interruptive in the fact that they demand attention away from the speaker, are cooperative in nature in that they significantly contribute to achieving mutual understanding and communication.

While Goldberg's study primarily focuses on the distinctions and characteristics between power interruptors and displays of rapport, Konakahara et al. explores the ways in which overlap, in particular overlapping questions, can be collaborative and cooperative.

===Eye contact===
During a conversation, turn-taking may involve a cued gaze that prompts the listener that it is their turn or that the speaker is finished talking. There are two gazes that have been identified and associated with turn-taking. The two patterns associated with turn-taking are mutual-break and mutual-hold. Mutual-break is when there is a pause in the conversation and both participants use a momentary break with mutual gaze toward each other, breaking the gaze, then continuing conversation again. This type is correlated with a perceived smoothness due to a decrease in the taking of turns. Mutual-hold is when the speaker also takes a pause in the conversation with mutual gaze, but then still holds the gaze as he/she starts to speak again. Mutual-hold is associated with less successful turn-taking process, because there are more turns taken, thus more turns required to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novick|first=David G.|last2=Hansen|first2=Brian|last3=Ward|first3=Karen|date=1996|title=Coordinating turn-taking with gaze|journal= Spoken Language, 1996. ICSLP 96. Proceedings., Fourth International Conference on|pages=1888–1891|doi=10.1109/ICSLP.1996.608001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Langford also argues that turn-taking is an organizational system. Langford examines facial features, [[eye contact]], and other [[gesture]]s in order to prove that turn-taking is signaled by many gestures, not only a break in [[speech]]. His claims stem from [[Conversational analysis|analysis of conversations]] through speech, [[sign language]], and [[Telecommunication|technology]]. His comparisons of English and [[American Sign Language]] show that turn-taking is systematic and universal across languages and cultures. His research concludes that there is more to turn-taking than simply hearing a pause. As other researchers have shown, eye gaze is an important signal for participants of a conversation to pay attention to. Usually, whoever is speaking will shift their gaze away from the other participants involved in the conversation. When they are finished or about to be finished speaking the speaker will revert their gaze back to the participant that will speak next.&lt;ref&gt;Langford, David. "Analysing talk: Investigating verbal interaction in English", 1994. London, UK: Macmillan Press, pp.69-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural variation==
Turn-taking is developed and socialized from very early on – the first instances being the interactions between parent and child – but it can still be thought of as a learned skill, rather than an innate attribute.&lt;ref name="beattie" /&gt; Conversational turn-taking is greatly affected by [[culture]]. For instance, in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] [[social structure]] and norms of [[interaction]] are reflected in the negotiation of turns in Japanese discourse, specifically with the use of [[Backchannel (linguistics)|backchannel]], or reactive tokens (''[[aizuchi]]'').&lt;ref name=maynard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Senko K.|title=Conversation Management in Contrast: Listener Response in Japanese and American English.|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|year=1990|volume=14|pages=397–412|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(90)90097-w}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Backchannel'' refers to listener responses, mostly [[phatic expression]]s, that are made to support both the speaker's flow of speech and their right to maintain the floor in conversation. ''Aizuchi'' is simply the Japanese term for backchannel, but some linguists make a distinction since the importance of ''aizuchi'' in Japanese conversation can be considered higher than in English conversation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Japanese speakers make use of backchannel far more than American English speakers. In recorded conversations between pairs of same-sex college-age friends, Maynard (1990) found that English-speaking students used backchannel expressions such as ''uh-huh'' or ''right'', mainly at grammatical completion points. Less frequently, the English speakers moved their head or laughed while the other speaker paused or after an utterance was completed.&lt;ref name="maynard" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
B: Yeah I think I know what you mean./
::::(A:1 Yeah){{sfn|Maynard|1990|p=407}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, the Japanese speakers often produced backchannel expressions such as ''un'' or ''sō'' while their partner was speaking. They also tended to mark the end of their own utterances with [[sentence-final particle]]s, and produced vertical head movements near the end of their partner's utterances.&lt;ref name="maynard" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
B:Oya kara sureba kodomo ga sureba iya/ [LAUGH]
::::(A:2 Sō sō sō sō)
A:Demo oya wa ne mō saikin sō mo
::::(B:2 Sō)
A: iwanaku-natta kedo

(Translation:
B: From your parent's view, if the child does... [LAUGH]
:(A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
A: But nowadays parents don't
:(B: I see)
A: say those things.){{sfn|Maynard|1990|p=405}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This demonstrates culturally different floor management strategies. The form of backchannels was similar: both Japanese and American subjects used brief utterances and head movements to signal involvement. The Japanese interlocutors, however, produced backchannels earlier and more often throughout conversation, while the Americans limited their responses mainly to pauses between turns.&lt;ref name="maynard" /&gt;

Additionally, turn-taking can vary in aspects such as time, overlap, and perception of silence in different cultures, but can have universal similarities as well. Stivers et al. (2009) cross-examined ten various [[indigenous language]]s across the globe to see if there were any similar underlying foundation in turn-taking. In analyzing these languages, it was discovered that all ten languages had the same avoidance of wanting to overlap in conversation and wanting to minimize the silence between turn-taking. However, depending on the culture, there was variation in the amount of time taken between turns. Stivers claims that their evidence from examining these languages suggests that there is an underlying [[Linguistic universal|universal]] aspect to turn-taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stivers | first1 = T. | last2 = Enfield | first2 = N. J. | last3 = Brown | first3 = P. | last4 = Englert | first4 = C. | last5 = Hayashi | first5 = M. | last6 = Heinemann | first6 = T. | last7 = Levinson | first7 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Universals and cultural variation in turn-taking in conversation | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0903616106 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 106 | issue = 26 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:66202/component/escidoc:68328/Stivers_2009_universals.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender==
Research has shown that gender is one of many factors that influence the turn-taking strategies between conversation participants. Studies of turn-taking in male-female interactions have yielded mixed results about the exact role of gender in predicting conversational patterns. Such analyses of turn-taking have analyzed conversations in various contexts ranging from verbal exchange between two romantic partners to scripted dialogue in American sitcoms. Rates of interruption are a widely researched area of turn-taking that has elicited various results that conflict with one another, reflecting inconsistencies across studies of gender and turn-taking.

One study reports that male interlocutors systematically interrupt females and tend to dominate conversations, and women are frequently treated in much the same way as children are in conversations.&lt;ref name="zim and west"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Don H.|author2=West, Candace |title=Sex Roles, Interruptions, and Silences in Conversation|journal=Language and Sex: Difference and Dominance|year=1975|pages=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This interruption, however, is not due to female interlocutors’ lack of desire or initiative to speak and be heard in a conversation. "Deep" interruption, or interruption at least two syllables before a potential utterance boundary, is perpetuated more frequently by men, towards women, regardless of ways that women negotiate these interruptions.&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=Candace|title=Against Our Will: Male Interruptions of Females in Cross-Sex Conversation|journal=Language, Sex, and Gender: Does La Difference Make a Difference?: Result of a workshop: New York Academy of Sciences, 1977|year=1979|volume=327|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1979.tb17755.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest that in certain situational contexts, the dominant participants of a conversation will interrupt others regardless of the gender of the speakers. In a study of various romantic relationships, the dominant partners were the ones who interrupted more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kollock | first1 = Peter | last2 = Blumstein | first2 = Philip | last3 = Schwartz | first3 = Pepper | year = 1985 | title = Sex and Power in Interaction: Conversational Privileges and Duties | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 34–46 | doi=10.2307/2095338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the gender of the interrupter nor that of the interrupted partner were correlated with interruption rates.

Language and conversation are primary ways in which social interaction is organized. Unequal conversational patterns are therefore reflective of larger power disparities between men and women. One study by Zimmerman and West found that in same-sex pair conversations, overlap and interruption tend to be equally distributed between the two interlocutors, and interruptions are clustered – that is, only a few of the pairs did all of the interrupting. For opposite-sex pairs, male interlocutors interrupt much more, and interruptions are much more widely distributed – that is, most men did it.&lt;ref name="zim and west" /&gt;
Gender differences in turn-taking are not invariable, however, and are related to the conditions and context of the speech.&lt;ref name="zim and west" /&gt; Gendered aspects of speech and turn-taking must be recognized as being reflective of the cultures in which they exist.&lt;ref&gt;Scherzer, Joel. 1987. A diversity of voices: men's and women's speech in ethnographic perspective. Language, Gender, and Sex in Comparative Perspective. ed. Philips, Susan U.; Steele, Susan; and Tanz, Christine. 95-120. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions have been raised about the correlation between interruption and dominance, and its importance to gender as opposed to other social categories. Studies done by Beattie find status difference more important than gender difference in predicting which speakers interrupted more.&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=Geoffrey|title=Talk: An Analysis of Speech and Non-Verbal Behaviour in Conversation|year=1983|publisher=Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes, England|pages=77–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study done by Krupnick, in a classroom setting, the gender of a conversation moderator, namely the instructor, will affect the turn-taking of male and female speakers.&lt;ref name="Krupnick, Catherine 1985"&gt;Krupnick, Catherine. "Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies." On Teaching and Learning 1 (1985): 34-46. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; She found that boys talk more than female students in classes taught by men, and although women may speak three times more when the instructor is female, their turns came in very short bursts. Krupnick observes that these conversations maintain a "gender rhythm" which cannot be separated from the academic and authoritative contexts.&lt;ref name="Krupnick, Catherine 1985"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17923">The '''two-step flow of communication model''' says that most people form their opinions under the influence of [[opinion leader]]s, who in turn are influenced by the [[mass media]]. In contrast to the one-step flow of the [[Hypodermic needle model|hypodermic needle model or magic bullet theory]], which holds that people are directly influenced by mass media, according to the two-step flow model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. Opinion leaders pass on their own interpretation of information in addition to the actual media content.

== Basic overview ==
The theory is based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders. The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand, through the personal influence of opinion leaders.

== Concept ==
The two-step model says that most people are not directly influenced by mass media, and instead form their opinions based on opinion leaders who interpret media messages and put them into context. Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content, and who interpret it based on their own opinion. They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the [[general public]] who become "opinion followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baran|first=Stanley|title=Theories of Mass Communication|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0767421906/student_view0/chapter12/glossary.html|work=Introduction to Mass Communication|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "opinion leaders" gain their influence through more elite media as opposed to mainstream [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence|newspaper=New York: Free Press|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, [[social influence]] is created and adjusted by the ideals and opinions of each specific "elite media" group, and by these media group's opposing ideals and opinions and in combination with popular mass media sources. Therefore, the leading influence in these opinions is primarily a social persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
The two-step flow of communication model hypothesizes that ideas flow from mass media to [[opinion leader]]s, and from them to a wider population.  It was first introduced by [[sociologist]] [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] ''et al.'' in 1944&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], Hazel Gaudet, ''The people's choice: how the voter makes up his mind in a presidential campaign'', Columbia University Press, 1944, p. 151''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborated by [[Elihu Katz]] and Lazarsfeld in 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elihu Katz  |author2=Paul Felix Lazarsfeld |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=1-4128-0507-4| pages=309''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elihu Katz|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on a Hypothesis|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|date=Spring 1957|pages= 61–78|jstor=2746790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowery and DeFleur argue the book was much more than a simple research report: it was an effort to interpret the authors' research within a framework of conceptual schemes, theoretical issues, and research findings drawn broadly from the scientific study of small groups &lt;ref&gt;Lowery &amp; DeFleur, "Milestones In Mass Communication Research" ''Personal influence: Two-Step Flow of Communication'', Longman Inc., 1983, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[hypodermic needle model]], which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency.

For example, in the field of [[science communication]], Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30-31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the "masses" through [[opinion leadership]]. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.

Based on the two-step flow hypothesis, the term "personal influence" came to illustrate the process intervening between the media's direct message and the audience's reaction to that message. Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influence—based on personality, interests, demographics, or socio-economic factors. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors. The two-step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences' attitudes. This hypothesis provided a basis for the two-step flow theory of [[mass communication]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two Step Flow Theory." Opleidingswebsite Communicatiewetenschap (CW) En Communication Studies (CS).

=== Contemporary debate ===

In the times of digital social media, the more than six decade old theory sparks much new interest. The fact that massive databases are being used to send tailor-made messages to individuals lead back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is a kind of [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic needle / magic bullet model]], with the capacity of [[big data]] analytics informed [[mass customization]]. Empirical studies by other scholars, in contrast, have found that modern [[social media]] platforms, like [[Twitter]], exhibit clear evidence of a two-step flow of communication (see Figure).&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests].

The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[social media]] users obtain their news from [[celebrities]] or other amplifying opinion leaders, who again get informed by [[mass media]] or by individuals with specific insights. The fine-grained digital footprint of [[social media]] also suggests that there are more than simply the one-step and two-step modes of communication flow, leading the search for more complex '''Multistep Flow Models''' based on distinct network structures.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012). One-step, two-step, or multi-step flow: the role of influencers in information processing and dissemination in online, interest-based publics.

== Lazarsfeld and Katz ==

Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz are considered to be the founders of functional theory and their book ''Personal Influence'' (1955) is considered to be the handbook to the theory.

=== Paul Felix Lazarsfeld ===
One of the first to embark on Communications research, was the first to introduce the difference between 'administrative research' and 'critical research' in regards to the media. Critical research he believed, criticizes the media institutions themselves for the perspective ways they serve dominant social groups. Critical research favors interperspective and inductive methods of inquiry.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lazarsfeld's study of the 1940 presidential election was published as ''The People's Choice'' (1944). During the research revealed information about the psychological and social processes that influence voting decisions. The study also uncovered an influence process that Lazarsfeld called "opinion leadership." He concluded that there is a multistep flow of information from the mass media to persons who serve as opinion leaders which then is passed on to the general public. He called this communication process the "two-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul F. Lazarsfeld Biography|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/paul-f-lazarsfeld/|publisher=Book Rags Inc.|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elihu Katz ===
[[Elihu Katz]] was a professor in the School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania when he collaborated with Lazarsfeld in 1955. Their research aimed to observe the flow of influence at the intersections of mass and interpersonal communication and resulted in the book ''Personal Influence''. Katz pursued Lazarfeld's research in a study of the flow of information, which is the basis of ''Personal Influence''. Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that:
"... the traditional image of the mass persuasion process must make room for 'people' as intervening factors between the stimuli of the media and resultant opinions, decisions, and actions."&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"/&gt;

== Published works on the theory ==
=== ''The People's Choice'' ===
The presidential election of 1940 saw President Franklin Roosevelt seek an unprecedented third term in office. Funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Life magazine, and the pollster [[Elmo Roper]], Columbia's Office of Radio Research conducted a study of voting. It was based on a panel study of 2,400 voters in Erie County, Ohio. Paul Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], and [[Hazel Gaudet]] supervised 15 interviewers, who from May–October interviewed the strategically selected 2,400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign. They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed.
''The People's Choice'', a book based on this study presented the theory of  "the two-step flow of communications", which later came to be associated with the so-called "limited effects model" of mass media: the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local "opinion leaders" who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge, or "opinion followers." The results of the research led to the conclusion that sometimes person to person communication can be more effective than traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV, radio etc. This idea developed further in the book ''Personal Influence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ERIE COUNTY STUDY (The People's Choice)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Personal Influence'' ===
In 1944, Paul Lazarsfeld contacted McFadden Publications in regards to his first book, ''The People's Choice''. The two collaborated forming a mutually beneficial partnership in which Macfadden saw a way to financially profit from advertising to the female population and Lazarsfeld saw a way to gain more information on social influence. Out of this came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur, Illinois, where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making. Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C. Wright Mills to head the study. Another part of the research team, Thelma Ehrlich Anderson, trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town. By 1955. the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's book ''Personal Influence''. The book concluded that ultimately, face to face interaction is more influential than traditional media influence and thus confirmed the two-step flow model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DECATUR COUNTY STUDY (Personal Influence)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The original two-step flow hypothesis—that ideas flow from the media to opinion leaders and then to less active sections of the population—has been criticized and negated by myriad consequent studies. Findings from Deutschmann and Danielson assert, "we would urge that the Katz-Lazarsfeld two-stage flow hypothesis, as a description of the initial information process, be applied to mass communication with caution".&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Deutschmann, Wayne A. Danielson (1960) "Diffusion of Knowledge Of the Major News Story" Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly September 1960 vol. 37 no. 3 p345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; They find substantial evidence that initial mass media information flows directly to people on the whole and is not relayed by opinion leaders.

Furthermore, the two-step hypothesis does not adequately describe the flow of learning. Everett Rogers' "Diffusion of Innovations"&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations, New York, Free Press of Glencoe, 1962, pp. 98-102&lt;/ref&gt; cites one study&lt;ref&gt;Lionberger, H. F. (1960). "Adoption of new ideas and practices: a summary of the research dealing with the acceptance of technological change in agriculture, with implications for action in facilitating such change" (No. 301.35 L763). Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which two-thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face-to-face communication. Similarly, critics argue that most of Lazarsfeld's findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information. Both findings suggest a greater prevalence of a one-step flow of communication.

However, Lazarsfeld's two-step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the media's influence on belief and behavior. Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion, at which point opinion leaders initiate the second-step flow.&lt;ref&gt;Troldahl, Verling C. "A Field Test of a Modified "Two-Step Flow of Communication" Model." Public Opinion Quarterly 30.4 (2001): 609-23. Academic Search Premier. Web. 11 Apr. 2010. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings also realize opinion leaders' decisive role in the balance theory, which suggests that people are motivated to keep consistency among their current beliefs and opinions. If a person is exposed to new observations that are inconsistent with present beliefs, he or she is thrown into imbalance. This person will then seek advice from their opinion leader, to provide them with additional cognitions to bring them back into balance. In addition, this theory may be valid during the era when opinion leaders were the only ones to have easy access to media contents. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Today, there is a free flow of information so that anybody could have access to media contents without relying substantially on opinion leaders.

[[Empirical research]] that analyzes vast databases from communication flows in [[social media]] finds that today's digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90 % of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; This shows that the two-step model does not seem to be dead, nor obsolete, but simply one of several ways communication flows in modern networks.

'''Western religions''' refer to [[religion]]s that originated within [[Western culture]], and are thus historically, culturally, and theologically distinct from the [[Eastern religions]]. The term [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Islam]], [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]) is often used in lieu of using the [[East–West dichotomy|East and West]] terminology.

Western culture itself was significantly influenced by the emergence of [[Christianity]] and its adoption as the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in the late 4th century and the term "[[Christendom]]" largely indicates this intertwined history. [[Western Christianity]] was significantly influenced by [[Hellenistic religion]] (notably [[Platonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]) as well as the [[Roman imperial cult]]. Western Christianity is based on [[Roman Catholicism]] ([[Latin Rite]]), as opposed to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], from which it was divided by the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of the 11th century, and further includes all [[Protestantism|Protestant traditions]] splitting off Roman Catholicism from the 16th century.

Since the 19th century, Western religion has diversified into numerous [[new religious movement]]s, including [[Occultism]], [[Spiritism]] and diverse forms of [[Neopaganism]].

== Antiquity ==
{{Main|Ancient Greek religion|Religion in ancient Rome|Hellenistic religion|Platonism|Hellenistic Judaism}}
{{Further|Celtic polytheism|Germanic paganism|Slavic polytheism}}

"The West" as a culture or civilization historically evolved out of Greco-Roman [[classical antiquity]]. These cultures had [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, viz. Greek polytheism and Roman polytheism. "Eastern" influences on these religions are evident from earliest times, the [[Orientalizing period]] at the very beginning of Greek antiquity.

During [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]] and the [[Roman Empire]] period, "Eastern" (Oriental) religions exerted a considerable influence on "Western" religion, giving rise to [[Persia]]n influenced traditions like [[Gnosticism]] and [[Mithraism]], as well as [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and "[[Chaldea]]n" influence on [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s ([[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]]), [[astrology]] and [[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]. [[Early Christianity]] itself is a further example of Orientalizing influence on the later Roman Empire.

During the same period, inherited traditions of native Roman religion were marginalized or overlaid by ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', and the [[Roman imperial cult]] evolved into a [[civil religion]] which involved state ritual rather than religious faith or experience. [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and [[Germanic polytheism|Germanic]] religion was described by [[Roman ethnography]] as primitive, but at the same time as pure or unspoiled compared to the so-called urban decadence of Rome.

== Western Christianity ==
{{Main|Western Christianity}}
{{Further|Catholic Church|Germanic Christianity|Celtic Christianity|Eastern Catholic Churches|Protestantism|Puritans|Anabaptists|Methodism|Pentecostalism|Evangelicalism|Mormonism}}

Western Christianity is based on [[Roman Catholicism]] ([[Latin Rite]]), as opposed to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], from which it was divided by the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of the 11th century. Western Christianity itself was divided by the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, and pronouncedly "Western" forms of Christianity include Puritanism and Evangelicalism, movements resulting from the various "[[Great Awakening]]s" in the 18th to 20th century [[English-speaking world]] and popularly practiced in the United States.

For at least a millennium and a half, [[Europe]] has been nearly equivalent to [[Christian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian culture was the predominant force in [[Western culture|Western civilization]], guiding the course of [[philosophy]], [[art]], [[music]], [[science]], [[social structure]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref name="Koch 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Secularism|Freedom of religion|Religious pluralism|History of atheism}}

Following the [[religious war]]s of the 16th to 17th centuries, the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century paved the way for a detachment of society and politics from religious questions. Inspired by the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] brought the ideal of [[secularization]] and a [[laicist]] state granting freedom of religion to Europe. After the turmoils of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], this development caught hold in other parts of Europe, by means of the [[German mediatization]] and the [[separation of church and state]] in numerous European constitutions drawn up after the [[revolutions of 1848]].

== New religious movements ==
{{Main|New religious movement}}
{{Further|Occultism|Spiritism|New Age|Modern Paganism}}

The principle of religious freedom introduced in Western society in the early 19th century facilitated the emergence of numerous new religious movements. Early examples were derived from western occultism and the tradition of [[Secret society|secret societies]] such as the [[Freemasons]], but from the later 19th century, influence of [[Eastern religions]], notably [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] played an increasing role. From the mid 20th century, Eastern and Western spiritual traditions were increasingly [[syncretism|syncretized]] in the various movements associated with the New Age and Neopagan countercultures.

There remains a minority of the order of 5% of the population in the Western world which adheres to non-Western religions, mostly due to recent [[immigration]], but to some extent also due to [[Proselytism|proselytization]], notably conversion to various sects of Buddhism and Hinduism in the context of the New Age movement in the later part of the 20th century.

'''''Wind from the East''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Vent d'est}}) is a [[1970 in film|1970 film]] by the [[Dziga Vertov Group]], a radical filmmaking cooperative that, at its core, included [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]]. As with most films from this period in Godard's career, directing credit was given to the collective and not himself or other individual filmmakers.

Of the Dziga Vertov Group films, ''Wind from the East'' became particularly notable due to [[Peter Wollen]]'s influential essay about it: "Godard and Counter Cinema: ''Vent d'est''."&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, Peter. "Godard and Counter Cinema: ''Vent d'est''." In ''Readings and Writings: Semiotic Counter-Strategies''. London: Verso, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Wollen contends that ''Wind from the East'' exemplifies how [[Brechtian]] principles of "[[epic theatre]]" can be applied to film as "counter cinema."

==Synopsis==
The film reflects Gorin and (especially) Godard's interest in divorcing sound from image, as a means of reinventing the language of "bourgeois" commercial cinema.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The soundtrack of the film begins with the story of a kidnapped ALCOA executive but abruptly changes the subject to a lengthy lecture on the history and political context of revolutionary cinema, including Marxist-Leninist self-critique, and a critique of Hollywood's film industry. The visual component of the film features an outdoor natural setting and characters in what appears to be a [[spaghetti Western]] film (or a parody thereof). The two components, while separate, frequently interact; the soundtrack occasionally refers to the cinematic tropes that appear onscreen, while the story told in the visuals contains dialogue and sound that overlaps and competes with the primary soundtrack.

The '''World Rugby Sevens Series''' is an annual series of international [[rugby sevens]] tournaments run by [[World Rugby]] featuring national sevens teams.  The series, organised for the first time  in the 1999–2000 season, was formed to develop an elite-level competition series between rugby nations and develop the sevens game into a viable commercial product for World Rugby. The competition was originally known as the '''IRB World Sevens Series''',&lt;ref name=irb-sevens-1999/&gt; but has been known officially as the '''HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series''' since 2014 due to sponsorship from banking group [[HSBC]].&lt;ref name="HSBC release"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2040495.html#hsbc+first+sevens+world+series+title+sponsor |title=HSBC first Sevens World Series title sponsor |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season's circuit consists of 10 tournaments that generally begin in November or December and last until May. The venues are held across 10 countries, and visits five of the six populated continents. The United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and England each host one event. Each tournament has 16 teams — 15 core teams that participate in each tournament and one regional qualifier. 

Teams compete for the World Series title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament. The lowest placed core team at the end of the season is dropped, and replaced by the winner of the [[Hong Kong Sevens]]. New Zealand had originally dominated the Series, winning each of the first six seasons from 1999–2000 to 2004–05, but since then, Fiji, [[South Africa at the World Rugby Sevens Series|South Africa]] and Samoa have each won season titles. England and Australia have placed in the top three on multiple occasions, but neither has won the series. The [[International Olympic Committee]]'s decision in 2009 to add rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016 has added a boost to rugby sevens and to the World Sevens Series; this boost has led to increased exposure and revenues, leading several of the core teams to field fully professional squads. 

==History==

===International sevens===
The first international [[rugby sevens]] tournament was held in 1973 in Scotland, which was celebrating a century of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland.org – September 2007 ''Try and Try again''|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|work=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRrALXZj?url=http://www.scotland.org/about/entertainment-and-sport/features/culture/scottish-rugby.html|archivedate=22 July 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-06-23|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven international teams took part, with [[England national rugby sevens team|England]] defeating Ireland 22–18 in the final to take the trophy. The [[Hong Kong Sevens]] annual tournament began in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/sport/rugby/sevens/article/1723029/pictures-40-years-hong-kong-sevens-part-1-1976-1980 "How it all began: A jewel discovered"], South China Morning Post, 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two decades the number of international sevens competitions increased. The most notable was the [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]] with Scotland hosting the inaugural event in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0080/ "The first Melrose Sevens match 1883"], BBC &lt;/ref&gt; along with rugby joining the [[Rugby sevens at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] program in 1998.

The first season of the World Sevens Series was the 1999–2000 season. At the Series launch, the chairman of the International Rugby Board, Vernon Pugh, described the IRB's vision of the role of this new competition: "this competition has set in place another important element in the IRB’s drive to establish rugby as a truly global sport, one with widespread visibility and steadily improving standards of athletic excellence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series/news/22534?lang=en "New Zealand take maiden Series crown"], World Rugby, 31 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand and Fiji dominated the first series, meeting in the final in eight of the ten season tournaments, and [[New Zealand national rugby sevens team|New Zealand]] narrowly won, overtaking Fiji by winning the last tournament of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series/news/22534?lang=en "New Zealand take maiden Series crown"], World Rugby, 31 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand won the first six seasons in a row from 1999–2000 to 2004–05,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10329289 "Sevens: NZ lose semi, but still claim world title"], ''New Zealand Herald'', 6 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; led by players such as [[Karl Te Nana]] and [[Amasio Valence]]. The number of stops in the series varied over the seasons, but experienced a contraction from 11 tournaments in 2001–02 to 7 tournaments in 2002–03 due to the [[Early 2000s recession|global recession]]. In the [[2005–06 World Sevens Series|2005–06 season]] Fiji clinched the season trophy on the last tournament of the season finishing ahead of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2005–06 Season Overview|website= irb.com|accessdate= 12 December 2013|url= http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/archive/tcode=1060/season=2005/overview.html|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101024145733/http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/archive/tcode%3D1060/season%3D2005/overview.html|archivedate= 24 October 2010|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand regained the trophy in [[2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series|2006–07]] season in the last tournament of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 2006–07 Season Overview|website= irb.com|accessdate= 12 December 2013|url= http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/archive/tcode=1050/season=2006/overview.html|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101023094121/http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/archive/tcode%3D1050/season%3D2006/overview.html|archivedate= 23 October 2010|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa]] was the next team to win the series after taking home the [[2008–09 IRB Sevens World Series|2008–09]] title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2017/12/09/secret-south-africa-sevens-success-country-has-embraced-rugbys/ "The secret to South Africa Sevens' success"], ''Telegraph'', Kate Rowan, 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2009–10 IRB Sevens World Series|2009–10]] season, [[Samoa national rugby sevens team|Samoa]] who finished seventh the previous year shocked the world — led by 2010 top try-scorer and [[World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year]] [[Mikaele Pesamino]] — by winning four of the last five tournaments to overtake New Zealand and win the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fijisun.com.fj/2013/10/20/caucau-pesamino-team-up/ "Caucau, Pesamino Team Up"], ''Fiji Sun'', 20 October, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic era and professionalism===
The [[2011–12 IRB Sevens World Series|2011–12 season]] was the last to have 12 core teams as the [[2011–12 IRB Sevens World Series|2011–12 series]] expanded to 15 teams that had core status. Qualification for these places was played out at the [[2012 Hong Kong Sevens]]. [[Canada national rugby sevens team|Canada]] (returning to core status for the first time since 2008),&lt;ref name="2008-09 core"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/news/newsid=2026934.html#usa+rugby+receives+major+sevens+boost |title=USA Rugby receives major Sevens boost |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612055717/http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/news/newsid%3D2026934.html#usa+rugby+receives+major+sevens+boost |archivedate=12 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spain national rugby sevens team|Spain]] and [[Portugal national rugby sevens team|Portugal]] joined the 12 core teams for the next season. The [[Japan Sevens|Japan]] event also made a return for the first time since 2001 (lasting until 2015). New Zealand continued their dominance by finishing on top.

Argentina was originally planned to begin hosting a tenth event with Mar Del Plata the venue in the 2012–13 season, giving the tour an event on each continent, but when Argentina joined the [[The Rugby Championship|Rugby Championship]] those plans were shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2063382.html|work=irbsevens.com|title=Argentina Sevens World Series round postponed|date=16 August 2012|publisher=International Rugby Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2063150.html|title=HSBC Sevens World Series expands to 10 rounds|date=2012-06-26|work=irbsevens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the same schedule, New Zealand again were the winners over South Africa. They took it again in [[2013–14 IRB Sevens World Series|2013–14]] with Spain the first team to be relegated after finishing last during that season with [[Japan national rugby sevens team|Japan]] replacing them.&lt;ref name="2013-14 promotion"/&gt;

Heading into the [[2014–15 IRB Sevens World Series|2014–15 season]], the top four teams qualifying to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], with Fiji, South Africa, New Zealand and Great Britain all qualifying through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio 2016: Fiji beat Samoa in sevens to lead race for Olympics|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/29587689|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2014–15 IRB Sevens World Series|2014–15 season]] and [[2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series|2015–16 season]] were won by Fiji — the first time a team other than New Zealand won back-to-back season titles — led by 2015 and 2016 season Dream Team nominee [[Osea Kolinisau]] The two seasons also yielded teams winning their first tournaments — the United States won the 2015 London Sevens to finish the season in sixth overall;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usarugby.org/mens-sevens-news/item/men-s-eagles-sevens-win-cup-in-london?category_id=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222101738/http://usarugby.org/mens-sevens-news/item/men-s-eagles-sevens-win-cup-in-london?category_id=3 |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}, USA Rugby, May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya won the 2016 Singapore Sevens, and Scotland won the 2016 London Sevens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series/news/152965|work=World Rugby|title=Kenya win sensational HSBC Singapore Sevens|date=17 April 2016|publisher=International Rugby Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series/news/161490|work=World Rugby|title=Kenya win sensational HSBC Singapore Sevens|date=22 May 2016|publisher=International Rugby Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series|2015–16 season]] World Rugby did a comprehensive review of all nine tournament hosts and adjusted the schedule, dropping two sites ([[Japan Sevens|Japan]] and [[Scotland Sevens|Scotland]]), and adding three sites ([[France Sevens|France]], [[Singapore Sevens|Singapore]] and [[Canada Sevens|Canada]]) to the calendar.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In the [[2016–17 World Rugby Sevens Series|2016–17 series]], a dominant and consistent display by [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa]] saw them reach the finals of the [[2016–17 World Rugby Sevens Series|2016–17]] series rounds on eight occasions, winning five of these. As a result, [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa]] were series champions with victory in the penultimate round in Paris. The season was a qualifier for the [[2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2018]] with the top four teams that hadn't already qualified, coming from this season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldrugby.org/text/189809&lt;/ref&gt; The teams that made it through to the World Cup via this method were [[Canada national rugby sevens team|Canada]], [[Argentina national rugby sevens team|Argentina]], [[Scotland national rugby sevens team|Scotland]] and [[Samoa national rugby sevens team|Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rwcsevens.com/news/249257|work=World Rugby|title=Four men’s teams qualify for RWC Sevens 2018|date=21 May 2017|publisher=World Rugby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Series has consisted of 10 tournament stops since the [[2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series|2015–16 season]]. 

Most of these tournaments began after they were added to the World Series, but with certain exceptions. The oldest running of these tournaments is the Hong Kong Sevens, which dates back to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/sport/rugby/sevens/article/1723029/pictures-40-years-hong-kong-sevens-part-1-1976-1980 "How it all began: A jewel discovered"], South China Morning Post, 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tournaments that pre-date the Series include the Australia Sevens (which ran from 1986 to 1989 and was then disbanded, until it returned in the 1999–2000 season as a leg on the Series) and the France Sevens which began in 1996.

==Core teams, promotion and relegation==

===Core teams===
A group of 15 "core teams" is announced for each season, based on performances in the previous season, and each core team has a guaranteed place in all of that season's events. The core teams have been selected through a designated promotion/relegation process since the 2012–13 season. The core teams for the 2018–19 season are:

Through the 2011–12 series, the number of core teams was 12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irbsevens.com/destination/edition=9/news/newsid=2048923.html#teams+announced+gold+coast+kick |title=Teams announced for Gold Coast kickoff |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011152812/http://irbsevens.com/destination/edition%3D9/news/newsid%3D2048923.html#teams+announced+gold+coast+kick |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of core teams was expanded to 15 for 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/destination/edition=5/news/newsid=2061539.html#who+will+join+sevens+elite |title=Who will join the Sevens elite? |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=22 March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three extra teams were determined by a 12-team qualifying tournament held as part of the [[2012 Hong Kong Sevens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/destination/edition=5/news/newsid=2061615.html#tears+world+series+qualifiers |title=Tears of joy for World Series qualifiers |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The increase in the number of core teams did not directly lead to an increase in the size of the existing tournaments.

===Promotion and relegation===

The following promotion/relegation process has been effective since the [[2013–14 IRB Sevens World Series|2013–14 series]]:&lt;ref name="2013-14 promotion"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/mediacentre/news/newsid=2068901.html#one+down+hsbc+sevens+world+series |title=One up one down for HSBC World Sevens Series |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=9 October 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year.
* The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated.
* The team that wins the 12-team qualifying tournament at the Hong Kong Sevens is promoted.

===Other qualifying===
The World Series results are sometimes used as a qualifier for other tournaments. For example, the top four teams of the 2014–15 series automatically qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Similarly, certain teams from the 2016–17 series qualified for the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens.

== Format ==
[[Rugby sevens]] is a fast-paced version of [[rugby union]] with seven players each side on a full-sized rugby field. Games are much shorter, lasting generally seven minutes each half. The game is quicker and faster-scoring than 15-a-side rugby, which explains part of its appeal. It also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill. Sevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. Currently, in a normal event, 16 teams are entered. 

World Rugby operates satellite tournaments in each continent alongside the Sevens World Series which serve as qualifiers for Series events;&lt;ref name="2008-09 core"/&gt; in 2012–13 they also determined the entrants in the World Series Pre-Qualifier,&lt;ref name="2012–13 qualifying"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/archive/tcode=1270/season=2012/news/newsid=2065481.html#pools+confimed+hong+kong+sevens |title=Pools confirmed for Hong Kong Sevens |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=21 February 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 2013–14 determine the entrants in the Core Team Qualifier.&lt;ref name="2013-14 promotion"/&gt;

In each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss, 0 for a no-show. In case teams are tied after pool play, the tiebreakers are:&lt;ref name="IRB Sevens 2006-07"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbsevens.com/NR/rdonlyres/7A7C20FC-056B-4CE6-B5A5-D4F6ECBF40F7/0/061026SL7sguidegeneric.pdf |title=2006–07 IRB Sevens World Series Media Guide |format=PDF |publisher=[[International Rugby Board]] |accessdate=10 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703041321/http://www.irbsevens.com/NR/rdonlyres/7A7C20FC-056B-4CE6-B5A5-D4F6ECBF40F7/0/061026SL7sguidegeneric.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2009–10 series, four trophies are awarded in each tournament. In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.

In a normal event, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third and fourth-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the losing quarterfinalists of the Bowl.

A third-place match is now conducted between the losing Cup semifinalists in all tournaments; this was introduced for the 2011–12 series.&lt;ref name="New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series"&gt;{{SA Rugby Article | id=1141551 | leagueid=1021 | title=New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=6 June 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606094939/http://www.sarugby.co.za/article.aspx?id=1141551&amp;leagueid=1021 | archivedate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012–13, the season-ending London Sevens expanded to 20 teams, with 12 competing for series points and eight involved in the Core Team Qualifier.&lt;ref name="2012–13 qualifying"/&gt; With the promotion place now determined at the Hong Kong Sevens, the London Sevens returned to the traditional 16-team format in 2013–14. 

===Hong Kong 7s===
The Hong Kong Sevens (an anomaly as a three-day event) is the most famous sevens tournament.
The Hong Kong Sevens had 24 teams through the 2011–12 series, but has featured 28 teams since 2012–13, with 15 core teams and the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series competing for series points. At the 2013 event, the remaining 12 teams were those in the World Series Pre-Qualifier;&lt;ref name="2012–13 qualifying"/&gt; from 2014 forward, the remaining 12 teams are those in the Core Team Qualifier.&lt;ref name="2013-14 promotion"/&gt;
In Hong Kong, the Shield was awarded for the first time in 2010.&lt;ref name="2009-10 points"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/news/newsid=2034177.html#overhaul+sevens+world+series+point+system |title=Overhaul for Sevens World Series point system |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109144828/http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/news/newsid%3D2034177.html#overhaul+sevens+world+series+point+systemhttps:// |archivedate=9 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the six pool winners of the Hong Kong Sevens, plus the two highest-finishing second-place teams, advanced to the Cup. 

In 2010 and 2011, a different system was used:&lt;ref name="HK format"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/edition=5/news/newsid=2035540.html#all+teams+announced+hong+kong+sevens |title=All 24 teams announced for Hong Kong Sevens |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The losing quarterfinalists in the Cup competition contested the Plate competition.
* The four remaining second-place teams and the four best third-place teams, which contested the Plate in previous years, competed for the Bowl.
* The remaining eight teams in the competition, which contested the Bowl in previous years, competed for the Shield.

In the transitional year of 2012, the Hong Kong Sevens was split into two separate competitions. The 12 core teams competed for the Cup, Plate and Bowl under a format similar to that of a regular event. The 12 invited teams all competed for the Shield, with the top three sides in that competition also earning core status for 2012–13. 

From 2013 on, the four trophies in Hong Kong will be contested under the same format used in regular 16-team tournaments. Only the 15 core teams, plus the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series, now compete in the main draw of that event although from 2017 the number of trophies was reduced to just the main Cup with the showpiece final being reduced from 20 minutes to 14 minutes and the Challenge Trophy which were in line with changes which began at the start of the [[2016-17 World Rugby Sevens Series]].

=== Points schedule ===
The season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. World Rugby introduced a new scoring system for the 2011–12 series, in which all teams participating in a tournament are guaranteed points. Initially, World Rugby announced the new points schedule only for the standard 16-team events; the allocations for the Hong Kong Sevens were announced later.&lt;ref name="New Points System for HSBC Sevens World Series"/&gt;

The current points schedule used at each standard event is summarised below.

===Sponsorship===
The International Rugby Board reached a 5-year deal with [[HSBC]] in October 2010 that granted them status as the first-ever title sponsor of the Sevens World Series. Through the agreement, HSBC acquired title naming rights to all tournaments in the World Series, beginning with the Dubai Sevens on 3 December 2010.&lt;ref name="HSBC release"/&gt; HSBC has since sub-licensed the naming rights to individual tournaments, while retaining its name sponsorship of the overall series. A renewed, 4-year deal was announced before the [[2015–16 World Rugby Sevens Series|2015–16 Series]], this deal was also expanded to include the [[World Rugby Women's Sevens Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldrugby.org/sevens-series/news/78453]&lt;/ref&gt;
