The '''1948 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] [[motor race]], held in [[Circuit de Monaco|Monte Carlo]] on 16 May 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1948/1948.html#mc|title=1948 Grands Prix|work=GEL Motorsport Information|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event under a new [[Formula racing|formula]], 1½ litres supercharged or 4½ litres naturally aspirated, it featured a motley crowd of [[brand|marque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Mike.

The '''South Australian blackout of 2016''' was a widespread [[power outage]] in [[South Australia]] that occurred as a result of storm damage to [[electricity transmission]] infrastructure on 28 September 2016. The [[cascading failure]] of the electricity transmission network resulted in almost the entire state losing its electricity supply. [[Kangaroo Island]] did not lose its supply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indaily.com.au/news/local/2016/09/28/thousands-still-without-power-as-wild-weather-continues/ |title=Thousands still without power as wild weather continues |newspaper=[[InDaily]] |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Kangaroo Island power station had been built to supply the island for the contingency of a failure in the power cable under the [[Backstairs Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kangaroo Island Project Profile|url=http://www.sdaengineering.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53:kangaroo-island-project-profile&amp;catid=32:diesel-applications&amp;Itemid=72|website=SDA Engineering|accessdate=13 September 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6tRVPLqZu?url=http://www.sdaengineering.com.au/index.php?option=com_content|archivedate=13 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storms==
On the day of the failure, South Australia experienced a violent storm reported as being a once-in-50-year event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/worsening-conditions-cause-more-blackouts-across-sa/7887020 |title=SA weather: Worsening conditions cause more blackouts as BOM warns of more storms |first=Lauren |last=Waldhuter |author2=staff |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was [[gale force]] and [[storm force]] wind across wide areas of the state. It included at least two [[tornado]]es in the vicinity of [[Blyth, South Australia|Blyth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/sa-weather:-blyth-residents-cleaning-up-after-tornadoes/7888100 |title=SA weather: Blyth residents cleaning up after tornadoes sweep through state's mid north |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which damaged multiple elements of critical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-power-outage-explainer/7886090 |title=SA blackout: Why and how?|date=2016-09-28 |language=en-AU |access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state was hit by at least 80,000 lightning strikes.&lt;ref name="smh28"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/energy-minister-josh-frydenberg-says-south-australia-blackout-raises-questions-about-renewables-20160928-grques.html |title=Minister Josh Frydenberg, senator Nick Xenophon question renewables in wake of South Australia blackout |last=Bourke |first=Latika |last2=Koziol |first2=Michael |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind damaged a total of 23 pylons on electricity transmission lines, including damage on three of the four [[interconnector]]s connecting the [[Adelaide]] area to the north and west of the state.

==Power grid==
The South Australian power grid is operated by [[ElectraNet]] and connected to the [[National Electricity Market]] via two interconnectors to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. These are the [[Heywood interconnector]] (recently upgraded to 650&amp;nbsp;MW at 275&amp;nbsp;kV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.electranet.com.au/projects/sa-vic-heywood-interconnector-upgrade/ |title=SA-Vic (Heywood) Interconnector Upgrade |publisher=[[ElectraNet]] |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.electranet.com.au/wp-content/uploads/resource/2016/06/20140901-Factsheet-HeywoodInterconnector.pdf Fact sheet, Heywood interconnector]&lt;/ref&gt; in the southeast of the state and the [[Murraylink]] (220&amp;nbsp;MW at 150&amp;nbsp;kV) [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] further north, connecting [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]] to [[Red Cliffs, Victoria|Red Cliffs]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-power-outage-explainer/7886090 |title=SA power outage: How did it happen? |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heywood interconnector had been down for upgrade earlier in the year, and was initially blamed for the widespread outage.

==Blackout==
The weather had resulted in localised power outages throughout the day and by around 3:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, almost the entire state power grid had been cut out. Early indications were that as the transmission lines in the [[Mid North]] failed due to damaged pylons, the automatic safety features in the network isolated the generators to protect both the generation facilities and the end consumers' equipment. Over a short period, this resulted in most of the state's distribution network being powered down as the transmission network acted to protect the infrastructure.

The preliminary report from the [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO) identified that problems started 90 seconds before the eventual failure. The first line to trip was a 66&amp;nbsp;kV line near Adelaide, and it was automatically reset. The first major fault was 47 seconds later when two phases of the 275&amp;nbsp;kV line between [[Brinkworth, South Australia|Brinkworth]] and [[Templers, South Australia|Templers]] grounded. The [[Davenport, South Australia|Davenport]]–[[Belalie East, South Australia|Belalie]] line tripped with one phase to ground, was automatically reset, but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be {{cvt|42|km}} from Davenport. One second later (7 seconds before the state went dark), the [[Hallett Wind Farm]] reduced output by 123&amp;nbsp;MW. Four seconds later, a third 275&amp;nbsp;kV transmission line showed a fault, the Davenport–[[Mount Lock]] is on the other side of the same towers as Davenport–Belalie, and the fault was estimated to be {{cvt|1|km||1}} further on.  The damaged power lines caused 5–6 voltage glitches which stressed the [[Low voltage ride through|ride-through capability]] of most of the wind farm capacity, causing nine of them to shut down:&lt;ref name=aemo-update/&gt; Finally, all within one second, the [[Hornsdale Wind Farm]] reduced output by 86&amp;nbsp;MW, [[Snowtown Wind Farm]] reduced output by 106&amp;nbsp;MW, the [[Heywood interconnector]] flow increased to over 850&amp;nbsp;MW and both of its circuits tripped out due to the overload. Supply was then lost to the entire South Australian region of the [[National Electricity Market]], as the [[Torrens Island Power Station]], [[Ladbroke Grove Power Station]], [[Murraylink]] interconnector and all remaining wind farms tripped.&lt;ref name="interim"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://indaily.com.au/news/local/2016/10/05/wind-farms-contributed-to-state-wide-blackout-interim-report/ |title=Blackout report leaves renewables debate dangling in the breeze |newspaper=[[InDaily]] |first1=David |last1=Washington |first2=Bension |last2=Siebert |date=5 October 2016 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEMO identified software settings in the wind farms that prevented repeated restarts once voltage or frequency events occurred too often. The group of wind turbines that could accept 9 ride-throughs in 120 seconds stayed on line through much of the event before the system went black. The rather larger group of turbines that could not accept this many repeated ride-throughs dropped out, instigating the overload and shutdown of the interconnector, and hence the electricity supply. AEMO has suggested better fault ride-through capability for the wind farms. The high wind speed caused 20&amp;nbsp;MW of wind power to disconnect to prevent overspeed.&lt;ref name=aemo-update&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Media_Centre/2016/AEMO_19-October-2016_SA-UPDATE-REPORT.pdf |title=UPDATE REPORT – BLACK SYSTEM EVENT IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA ON 28 SEPTEMBER 2016 |pages=14–22, 36 (Table 4) |date=19 October 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Energy Market Operator]] |access-date=25 December 2016 |quote='voltage ride-through' settings were set to disconnect or reduce turbine output when between three and six 'voltage ride-through' events were detected within a given timeframe. Investigations to date indicate that information on the control system involved and its settings was not included in the models of wind turbine operation provided to AEMO during NEM registration processes prior to connection of the wind farms. Approximately 20&amp;nbsp;MW of wind power was disconnected due to excessive wind during the event.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
As so much of the network had been shut down, the authorities needed to act carefully to bring it back online and provide a stable network. This was initiated in the first few hours following the start of the outage, initially using the Victorian interconnectors to establish a stable frequency on the network, and gradually add South Australia's power generators to the network and restore power to areas as soon as possible. The initial focus was to restore power to the [[Adelaide]] metropolitan area, and suburbs started to regain power within about three hours, and much of the city power was restored by 10 p.m. By the following morning, power had been restored to most of the areas of Adelaide and the areas south and east of it that did not have storm damage to the distribution network. The substantial damage to the transmission network north of Adelaide meant that large areas of the [[Mid North]] and [[Eyre Peninsula]] did not have power restored within 24 hours, and further damaging weather indicated that it could be at least the end of the weekend before some of those areas were restored.&lt;ref name="delicate"/&gt;

AEMO had contracts with two "System Restart Ancillary Services" (SRAS) providers to help bring the network back up. The [[Mintaro]] Emergency Diesel Generator had suffered storm damage, including a cloud-to-ground lightning strike in very close proximity, but would not have been useful anyway due to its location in the network and downed transmission lines.&lt;ref name="final"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/Market_Notices_and_Events/Power_System_Incident_Reports/2017/Integrated-Final-Report-SA-Black-System-28-September-2016.pdf |title=Integrated Final Report SA Black System 28 September 2016|date=28 March 2017|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=[[AEMO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrens Island#Power Stations|Quarantine Power Station]] was unable to start the larger Unit #5 required to provide enough power to restart any of the [[Torrens Island Power Station]] units, so Torrens Island needed power from the Victorian interconnector to be restarted. A circuit breaker in the [[Torrens Island#Power Stations|Quarantine Power Station]] switchyard connecting [[Torrens Island Power Station]] and the smaller units at [[Torrens Island#Power Stations|Quarantine Power Station]] with Unit #5 tripped repeatedly due to in-rush current on the generator transformer and auxiliary transformer, and subsequently ran out of stored energy before Unit #5 could be started.&lt;ref name="final"/&gt;

By the morning of Friday 30 September 2016, about 10,000 properties had not yet had power restored since the blackout on Wednesday afternoon, and 18,000 more had lost power due to distribution network faults caused by continued stormy weather. An additional transmission line fault near [[Tumby Bay, South Australia|Tumby Bay]] was only detected as [[ElectraNet]] tried to power up the system, and this fault prevented the power generator in [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]] from being used to power the lower [[Eyre Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indaily.com.au/news/local/2016/09/30/from-blackouts-to-floods-premier-to-check-storm-damage/ |title=Flood risks for SA as Premier flies into blacked-out region |date=30 September 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |newspaper=[[InDaily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the extensive nature of the damage, temporary transmission towers were sent by [[Western Power (networks corporation)|Western Power]]; these towers can reach a height of 58 metres and take only one day to erect. It is expected that the towers will remain in use for 6 to 12 months while the permanent repairs are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=David|title=Western Australia sends transmission towers to storm-affected SA|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/wa-sends-power-towers-to-help-out-sa/7891014?section=wa|accessdate=30 September 2016|agency=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=29 September 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The [[Flinders Medical Centre]], a major hospital in Adelaide's southern suburbs, was affected when the fuel pump for the diesel-powered back-up generator failed after operating for about an hour. As a result, 17 patients were transferred from the [[intensive care unit]] to the adjacent [[Flinders Private Hospital]], which still had an operating generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/cyclonic-storm-plunges-south-australia-into-the-dark-ages/news-story/480dadb0440519a433b7631b7de1e293 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |title=Storm leaves SA without power, heads to NSW, Victoria, Tasmania |first1=Verity |last1=Edwards |first2=Rebecca |last2=Puddy |first3=Michael |last3=Owen |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several embryos were also lost at [[Flinders Fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/power-blackouts-from-storm-have-destroyed-embryos-at-flinders-fertility-leaving-families-and-medics-distressed-by-their-loss/news-story/606bc8fe6f9f01fe231361c65809b1b9 |first=Tory |last=Shepherd |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |title=Power blackouts from storm have destroyed embryos at Flinders Fertility, leaving families and medics distressed by their loss |date=30 September 2016 |accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zinc [[smelter]] operated by [[Nyrstar]] at [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]] was expected to be shut down for several weeks, as the diesel back-up generator failed after about four hours, and the content of the smelter cooled and solidified.&lt;ref name="delicate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/restoring-power-in-sa-'very-delicate-affair'/7889846 |title=SA weather: Restoring power 'very delicate affair' |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate political responses==

A number of politicians commented whilst the emergency was unfolding.
The Australian Deputy Prime Minister [[Barnaby Joyce]] told ABC "[Windpower] wasn't working too well last night, because they had a blackout",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.afr.com/news/sa-blackout-nick-xenophon-barnaby-joyce-blame-renewables-20160928-grqwpq |title=SA blackout: Nick Xenophon, Barnaby Joyce blame renewables |last=Riordan |first=Primrose |last2=Evans |first2=Simon |work=[[Australian Financial Review]] |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] said state governments had paid "little or no attention to energy security."&lt;ref name="abc29go"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/governments-prioritising-emissions-targets-over-energy-security/7888128 |title=Malcolm Turnbull criticises state governments for 'unrealistic' emissions targets over energy security |last=Anderson |first=Stephanie |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy minister [[Josh Frydenberg]] said that "energy security was the (federal) government's "number one priority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2016/s4547620.htm |title=Politicians put their spin on the blackout that plunged all of South Australia into darkness |last=Lane |first=Sabra |work=[[7.30]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said "it has to be underlined that this was a major weather event."&lt;ref name="smh28"/&gt;

South Australian senator [[Nick Xenophon]] said he supported renewable energy but that the state's approach relied too much on wind. South Australian Premier [[Jay Weatherill]] said Xenophon had "jumped the shark" as the situation was yet to be analysed.&lt;ref name="smh28" /&gt;

Queensland One Nation senator, [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] urged all governments to "exit all climate change policies" while South Australian Greens senator [[Sarah Hanson-Young]] said it was "pathetic" that people were politicking while emergency service officers and volunteers are flat out responding.&lt;ref name="smh28" /&gt;

Opposition Leader [[Bill Shorten]] accused the Coalition of "playing politics with what is a natural disaster" and that there was no link between the storm damage and the state's renewable energy target.&lt;ref name="abc29go" /&gt;

The [[Grattan Institute]]'s Tony Wood was reported as saying "If you've got a wind farm or a coal-fired power station at the end of a transmission line, and that system either is taken out by a storm or is forced to shut down to protect itself from a storm, it doesn't matter what the energy source is" while Clean Energy Council's Tom Butler said the weather event "created a fault in the system which has caused the generation to trip offline" and that "the Snowtown wind farm, north of Adelaide, was actually helping to prop up the state's power supply ahead of gas power stations as the network was gradually brought back online."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-29/sa-weather:-no-link-between-blackout-and-renewables-expert-says/7887052 |title=SA weather: No link between blackout and renewable energy, experts say |last=Doran |first=Matthew |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian Premier [[Daniel Andrews]] told ABC radio that Turnbull had conflated two issues, that "the poles and wires had blown over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/30/ignorant-rubbish-daniel-andrews-slams-malcolm-turnbull-over-sa-blackout-comments |title='Ignorant rubbish': Daniel Andrews slams Malcolm Turnbull over SA blackout comments |last=Hutchens |first=Gareth |date=30 September 2016 |access-date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ensuing flood ==
Following the power outages, the same storm resulted in major flooding, which was dubbed "unrelenting" by South Australia Services Minister [[Peter Malinauskas]]. A flood emergency was issued for towns and suburbs north of Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/09/28/unrelenting-flood-emergency-north-adelaide-rivers-continue-rise|title='Unrelenting': flood emergency north of Adelaide as rivers continue to rise|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flood warnings were also issued for the Adelaide hills area.

== December blackouts ==
Further widespread blackouts occurred beginning late on Tuesday 27 December 2016, with areas losing power for upwards of twelve hours following severe storms causing damage to over 300 powerlines in the [[electric power distribution|electricity distribution]] network. The storms also caused flooding and wind damage, including property destruction due to fallen trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-28/sa-weather-adelaide-traffic-lights-down-floods-highest-rainfall/8150464 |title=SA weather: More wild weather hits state after Adelaide storm leaves trail of destruction |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 155,000 properties lost power at the peak of the storms, requiring over 1200 repair jobs resulting from over 350 powerlines being damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-29/sa-weather-ses-crews-brace-for-more-severe-storms/8151846 |title=SA storms: Thousands still without power as businesses suffer losses in blackout |date=29 December 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 7.30pm on Thursday 29 December, there were more than 11 500 households still without power across the state, some for up to forty-six hours, in regions including the Adelaide Hills, Mid-North, Flinders Ranges, and Murraylands.&lt;ref&gt;https://outage.apps.sapowernetworks.com.au/outagereport/outagesearch?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1&lt;/ref&gt; By 9am on Saturday 31 December, there were still more than 1600 households without power for more than 80 hours, primarily across the Adelaide Hills.&lt;ref&gt;https://outage.apps.sapowernetworks.com.au/outagereport/outagesearch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://outage.apps.sapowernetworks.com.au/outagereport/outagemap&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=outage.apps is a dynamic page that only shows current outages at time of viewing}}

==February blackouts==
On 8 February 2017, over 90,000 households in Adelaide lost power for 45 minutes in the middle of a major heatwave. The [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO) ordered 100 MW of [[load shedding]], but 300 MW was cut,&lt;ref name=abc2017-02&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-15/sa-power-aemo-report-into-rolling-blackouts-during-heatwave/8273836 |title=Load shedding in SA heatwave three times amount ordered|date=15 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing controversy with the state government. The state Energy Minister, [[Tom Koutsantonis]] said that the state had spare generation capacity but the market didn't turn that generation on, as the 165 MW&lt;ref name=abc2017-02/&gt; second unit at [[Pelican Point power station]] had gas and was ready to go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/rolling-blackouts-ordered-as-adelaide-swelters-in-heatwave/news-story/18db2b7f2faa9e0308d2a6a0da2d88cc Rolling blackouts ordered as Adelaide swelters in heatwave (News.com.au)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="more"&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/south-australia/sa-power-crisis-will-there-be-more-blackouts/news-story/82f848efbc42455b9d7c4e1487b04fa5 SA power crisis: Will there be more blackouts?]&lt;/ref&gt; AEMO stated that it had sent notices to all generators, requesting a market response due to increased demand but it did not receive sufficient bids into the market to maintain the supply/demand balance in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.aemo.com.au/Media-Centre/Media-Statement-Update |publisher=[[Australian Energy Market Operator]] |title=Media Statement - South Australia Update |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engie]], the operator of Pelican Point, responded that the Market Rules did not permit it to make a market response unless directed by the market operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://engie.com.au/media/newsitem.aspx?title=Pelican-Point |publisher=[[Engie]] |title=Pelican Point |date=9 February 2017 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was authorised the next day to avoid a repeat on 9 February.&lt;ref name="more"/&gt; The owner later clarified that it was not allowed to bid into the market if supply cannot be guaranteed, and it did not have a current gas supply contract for the second unit.

An '''accident''', also known as an '''unintentional injury''', is an undesirable, incidental, and an unplanned event that could have been prevented had [[Attendant circumstance|circumstances]] leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term "accident" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity.&lt;ref name=Robertson2015&gt;{{cite book | last = Robertson | first = Leon S. | title = Injury Epidemiology: Fourth Edition | year = 2015 | publisher = Lulu Books | url = http://www.nanlee.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical and non-physical===
Physical examples of accidents include unintended motor vehicle collisions or falls, being injured by touching something sharp, hot, moving objects, contacting electricity or ingesting poison. Non-physical examples are unintentionally revealing a [[secret]] or otherwise saying something incorrectly, accidental deletion of data, forgetting an appointment etc.

===By activity===
* Accidents during the execution of work or arising out of it are called [[work accident]]s. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than 337 million accidents happen on the job each year, resulting, together with occupational diseases, in more than 2.3 million deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm ILO Safety and Health at Work]". International Labour Organization (ILO)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In contrast, [[leisure]]-related accidents are mainly [[Sports injury|sports injuries]].

===By vehicle===

* [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Aviation]]
* [[Bicycle safety|Bicycles]]
* [[Sailing ships]]
* [[Traffic collision]]s

* [[Trams]]

==Common causes==
{{See also|Preventable causes of death}}
[[File:Accidents.svg|thumb|300px|Incidence of accidents (of a severity of resulting in seeking medical care), sorted by activity (in Denmark in 2002).]]
Poisons, vehicle collisions and falls are the most common causes of fatal injuries. According to a 2005 survey of injuries sustained at home, which used data from the National Vital Statistics System of the United States [[National Center for Health Statistics]], falls, poisoning, and fire/burn injuries are the most common causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runyan CW, Casteel C, Perkis D |title=Unintentional injuries in the home in the United States Part I: mortality |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=73–9 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15626560 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2004.09.010 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also collects statistically valid injury data (sampled from 100 hospitals) through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System administered by the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]].&lt;ref name=NEISS&gt;CPSC. [http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/General-Information/National-Electronic-Injury-Surveillance-System-NEISS/ National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)].

'''Accident analysis''' is carried out in order to determine the cause or causes of an accident (that can result in single or multiple outcomes) so as to prevent further accidents of a similar kind. It is part of ''accident investigation or incident investigation.'' These analyses may be performed by a range of experts, including [[forensic scientists]], [[Forensic engineering#Forensic engineering|forensic engineers]] or [[health and safety]] advisers. Accident investigators, particularly those in the aircraft industry, are colloquially known as "'''tin-kickers'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7B9WySKhMC&amp;pg=PA6|title=Black Box: Why Air Safety Is No Accident|page=6|first=Nicholas|last=Faith|publisher=Zenith Imprint|year=1997|isbn=0-7603-0400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health and safety]] and [[patient safety]] professionals prefer using the term "incident" in place of the term "accident". Its retrospective nature means that accident analysis is primarily an exercise of directed explanation; conducted using the theories or methods the analyst has to hand, which directs the way in which the events, aspects, or features of accident phenomena are highlighted and explained.

==Sequence==
Accident analysis is performed in four steps:
#'''Fact gathering''': After an accident happened a forensic process starts to gather all possibly relevant facts that may contribute to understanding the accident.
#'''Fact Analysis''': After the forensic process has been completed or at least delivered some results, the facts are put together to give a "big picture." The history of the accident is reconstructed and checked for consistency and plausibility.
#'''Conclusion Drawing''': If the accident history is sufficiently informative, conclusions can be drawn about causation and contributing factors.
#'''Counter-measures''': In some cases the development of counter-measures is desired or recommendations have to be issued to prevent further accidents of the same kind.

==Methods==
There exist numerous forms of Accident Analysis methods. These can be divided into three categories:

#'''Causal Analysis''' uses the principle of causality to determine the course of events. Though people casually speak of a "chain of events", results from Causal Analysis usually have the form of [[Directed acyclic graph|directed a-cyclic graphs]]{{spaced ndash}}the nodes being events and the edges the cause-effect relations. Methods of Causal Analysis differ in their respective notion of causation.
#'''Expert Analysis''' relies on the knowledge and experience of field experts. This form of analysis usually lacks a rigorous (formal/semiformal) methodological approach. This usually affects falsify-ability and objectivity of analyses. This is of importance when conclusions are heavily disputed among experts.
#'''Organizational Analysis''' relies on systemic theories of organization. Most theories imply that if a system's behaviour stayed within the bounds of the ideal organization then no accidents can occur. Organizational Analysis can be falsified and results from analyses can be checked for objectivity. Choosing an organizational theory for accident analysis comes from the assumption that the system to be analysed conforms to that theory.

==Models==

Many models have been described to characterise and analyse accidents. The book ''Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health'' is one source of further details on the different types of models used in accident analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enhancing Occupational Safety and Health|date=2004|author=Taylor, G.A.|author2=Easter, K.M.|author3=Hegney, R.P.|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0750661976|pages=241&amp;ndash;245, see also pages 140–141 and pages 147–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using photographs to extract evidence==
{{See also|Forensic photography}}

Once all available data has been collected by accident scene investigators and law enforcement officers, camera matching, photogrammetry or rectification can be used to determine the exact location of physical evidence shown in the accident scene photos.
#'''Camera matching''': Camera matching uses accident scene photos that show various points of evidence. The technique uses CAD software to create a 3-dimensional model of the accident site and roadway surface. All survey data and photos are then imported into a three dimensional software package like 3D Studio Max. A virtual camera can be then be positioned relative to the 3D roadway surface. Physical evidence is then mapped from the photos onto the 3D roadway to create a three dimensional accident scene drawing.
#'''Photogrammetry''': [[Photogrammetry]] is used to determine the three-dimensional geometry of an object on the accident scene from the original two dimensional photos. The photographs can be used to extract evidence that may be lost after the accident is cleared. Photographs from several viewpoints are imported into software like PhotoModeler. The forensic engineer can then choose points common to each photo. The software will calculate the location of each point in a three dimensional coordinate system. 
#'''Rectification''': Photographic rectification is also used to analyze evidence that may not have been measured at the accident scene. Two dimensional rectification transforms a single photograph into a top-down view. Software like PC-Rect can be used to rectify a digital photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veritecheng.com/white-paper-forensic-accident-reconstruction/ Extracting Physical Evidence from Digital Photographs for use in Forensic Accident Reconstruction], David Danaher, P.E., Jeff Ball, Ph.D., P.E., and Mark Kittel, P.E 2012-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1996, Dia convinced [[Graeme Souness]], then [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] manager, that he was the cousin of [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[Ballon d'Or]] winner [[George Weah]], which led to him signing a one-month contract with Southampton days later. Dia played only one match in his short spell at the club. He came on as a substitute in a league game, but was then himself substituted. He was subsequently released, 14 days into his contract.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hills|first=David|title=The 10 worst foreign signings of all time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport16|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=The Observer|date=6 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After a playing career at the lower levels in France and Germany, and having already failed trials at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] and [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], Dia joined non-league club [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]], where he made only one substitute appearance – on 9 November 1996 in a [[Northern Premier League]] game against [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Days later, Dia was signed by Southampton manager [[Graeme Souness]], after Souness received a phone call purporting to be from [[Liberia national football team|Liberian international]] and then-[[FIFA World Player of the Year]], [[George Weah]]. "Weah" told Souness that Dia was his cousin, had played for [[Paris Saint-Germain]], and had played 13 times for his country. None of this was true, and the phone call to Souness was made by a fellow university student of Dia's, suggesting that he should give Dia a chance with Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Never again...|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2902411.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 December 2012|date=1 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Souness was convinced, and Dia was signed on a one-month contract.

Dia played just one game for Southampton, wearing the number 33 shirt, against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 23 November 1996; he had originally been scheduled to play in a [[reserve team]] friendly against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], but the match was cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch. In the match against Leeds, he came on as a substitute for the injured [[Matthew Le Tissier]] after 32 minutes, but was later substituted himself (for [[Ken Monkou]]) in the 85th minute;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last= Holley |first= Duncan |author2= Chalk, Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X|pages=248 &amp; 504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds won the match 2–0. Le Tissier said: "He ran around the pitch like [[Bambi]] on ice; it was very embarrassing to watch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gibbs|first=Thom|title=Five terrible debuts to make Fernando Torres feel better |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/8309048/Five-terrible-debuts-to-make-Fernando-Torres-feel-better.html|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2008/nov/22/southampton-championship|title=The one-off who played for Southampton|date=|work=Guardian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/|title=The Journal of Failure|date=|work=The Legend of Ali Dia|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212085820/http://journaloffailure.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-legend-of-ali-dia/|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dia was released by Southampton two weeks into his contract.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; He briefly played for non-league [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]], before leaving in February 1997.&lt;ref name="observer" /&gt; Dia only played eight games for the North East outfit, including scoring on his debut in a 5–0 win over [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfcstats.webs.com/9697.htm|title=Gateshead F.C.

==Personal life==
Dia has a son, named [[Simon Dia|Simon]], who plays football for [[Olympique Saint-Quentin|Saint-Quentin]].&lt;ref name= Bleacher/&gt;

He went on to study business at [[Northumbria University]] in Newcastle, graduating in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Nick |title=Meet the BBC's guest editor (and other accidental heroes) |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/meet-the-bbcs-guest-editor-and-other-accidental-heroes-478556.html |access-date=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=17 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a Master of Business Administration from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Bleacher/&gt;

'''Barry Michael George''' (born 15 April 1960, also known as '''Barry Bulsara''')&lt;ref name="retrial3"&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7095885.stm |title= Dando murder case set for retrial  |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a British man who was [[miscarriage of justice|wrongly convicted]] on 2 July 2001 of the [[Murder in English law|murder]] of British television presenter [[Jill Dando]].

Dando's profile and popularity ensured high public interest in the case. In the absence of other suspects, George attracted police attention because many elements in his background seemed to point to his guilt, although the only non-[[circumstantial evidence]] was a tiny speck of material that may or may not have been gunshot residue. He was convicted of murder, but his conviction was subsequently judged unsafe by the Court of Appeal and was quashed in 2007.

== Early life ==
Barry George was born in [[Hammersmith Hospital]], London. His parents had married in July 1954.&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt; He was the youngest of three children;&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; they grew up in a high-rise flat in [[White City, London]].&lt;ref name="Indy"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michelle-diskin-life-on-the-outside-for-barry-george-898987.html |title= Michelle Diskin: Life on the outside for Barry George |newspaper=The Independent |location =London |date= 16 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Michelle Diskin, who lives in Ireland,&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/03/jilldando.media5 |title= Obsessive whose life of fantasy ended in deadly reality |author1= Hopkins, Nick |author2= Morris, Steven |newspaper= The Guardian |location =London |date=3 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; is five years older than he is; his sister Susan, three years older than he is, died of [[epilepsy]] aged 28.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; George also has epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; His parents divorced in December 1973.&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt;

At 14, George attended the publicly funded Heathermount boarding school in [[Sunningdale]], Berkshire, for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |work= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/jilldando/story/0,7369,515874,00.html |title= Life and times of Barry George |date= 2 July 2001 |accessdate= 14 December 2007 |location= London |first= Nick |last= Hopkins |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071208044407/http://www.guardian.co.uk/jilldando/story/0%2C7369%2C515874%2C00.html |archivedate= 8 December 2007 |deadurl= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school without qualifications, his only employment was as a messenger at [[BBC Television Centre]]&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt; on a fixed term contract for six months; the job lasted only five months.&lt;ref&gt;Turney (2005), 70&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in the BBC endured until his arrest; he was a regular reader of the in-house magazine [[Ariel (newspaper)|''Ariel'']], and had reportedly kept four copies of the memorial issue which featured Jill Dando's murder.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; George has exhibited an interest in celebrities.&lt;ref name="retrial2"/&gt;

==Previous criminal convictions and investigations==
George adopted several [[pseudonyms]], starting at school, where he used the name Paul Gadd, the real name of singer [[Gary Glitter]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; In 1980, after George failed in his attempt to join the [[Metropolitan Police]], he [[police impersonation|posed as a policeman]], having obtained false warrant cards. For this he was arrested and prosecuted. In May 1980,&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt; he appeared in court clad in [[glam rock]] clothing and untruthfully stated his name to be Paul Gadd,&lt;ref name="CH4"&gt;"Did Barry George Kill Jill Dando?". [[Channel 4]]. Broadcast 4 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and stated his occupation as 'unemployed musician' and former managing director of a company that handled three rock bands.&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt; At Kingston Magistrates' Court he was convicted and fined [[pound sterling|£]]25.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4444905.ece |title= Profile: Barry George |newspaper=The Times |location =London |date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s he appeared in a local newspaper claiming to be the winner of the British Karate Championship. He gave his name as 'Paul Gadd' and his occupation as 'a singer with the band Xanadu and a session musician with the Electric Light Orchestra'. He was exposed as a fraud by another newspaper.

In April 1990, and again in January 1992, George was arrested and charged with [[indecent assault]]. Neither case went to court.&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt;

Before his trial for the Dando murder, George was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/barry-george-i-am-not-angry-certainly-not-at-society-but-i-would-use-the-word-disgustedrsquo-1987499.html |title= Barry George: 'I am not angry, certainly not at society.

== Overturned conviction for murder of Jill Dando ==
{{main|Jill Dando}}

Jill Dando was shot dead outside her home on 26 April 1999. George (who at the time of the murder lived in a ground floor flat in Crookham Road, Fulham)&lt;ref name="Guardian obsessive"/&gt; was arrested for her [[Murder in English law|murder]] on 25 May 2000, and charged on 29 May 2000.&lt;ref name="retrial3"/&gt; He was convicted by a majority of ten to one, and given a sentence of [[life imprisonment]]&lt;ref name="retrial1"/&gt; on 2 July 2001. This verdict was considered unsafe by some observers at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Joan |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/joan-smith/joan-smith-im-amazed-at-the-dando-verdict-arent-you-9148148.html |title=I'm amazed at the Dando verdict. Aren't you? |newspaper=Independent on Sunday |date=8 July 2001 |location =London |accessdate= 5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeals===
In 2002, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]'s judgment on the appeal, having addressed a number of grounds including eyewitness testimony, scientific evidence, and the role of the trial judge, concluded that the verdict of the jury was not unsafe and that appeal was dismissed.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2159320.stm |title= Appeal judges' verdict on Dando evidence |date=29 July 2002 |accessdate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, George's lawyers sought an appeal on fresh evidence based on medical examinations suggesting he was not capable of committing the crime because of his mental disabilities. The defence brought in neuropsychiatrist Michael Kopelman to dispute the prosecution's claim that George showed signs of "histrionics, paranoia and narcissism" and had a personality disorder. Kopelman testified that "[He] described to me that he can be aware of what's going on around him but he just can't respond", and concluded that George was not calculating enough to have committed the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/02/jilldando.ukcrime |title= A Loner and Fantasist but Not a Calculating Killer |date= 1 August 2008|accessdate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second defence argument was that two new witnesses say they saw armed police at the scene when George was arrested, contrary to official reports about the circumstances of his arrest – the Metropolitan Police maintain there were no armed officers present during the arrest of George. There was scientific evidence linking Barry George to the murder in the form of a single microscopic particle of what was said to have been gunshot residue, together with evidence as to the character of a fibre found on his clothing. It was argued by the defence that the presence of armed officers and their involvement in his arrest might have been responsible for the gunshot residue.

In September 2006, following investigations by George's campaigners and a ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' documentary about the conviction (conducted by miscarriage of justice victim [[M25 Three|Raphael Rowe]]), first broadcast in the UK on 5 September 2006 and which included an interview with the foreman of the trial jury, fresh evidence was submitted to the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] by the programme-makers and by Barry George's solicitor. The evidence concerned scientific analysis of the alleged gunshot residue, eyewitness evidence, and psychiatric reports.

On 20 June 2007, the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] announced that it would refer George's case to the [[Court of Appeal]].&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6769469.stm |title= Fresh appeal in Dando murder case |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2007, George was refused bail prior to the hearing, which began on 5 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6958183.stm |title = Dando killer George refused bail |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071108222533/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6958183.stm |archivedate=8 November 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the defence team's main grounds of appeal was that the single particle of gunshot residue in the coat pocket was not evidence which conclusively linked George to the crime scene; it could have appeared as a result of contamination of the coat when it was placed on a mannequin to be photographed as police evidence.
 
On 7 November 2007 the Court of Appeal reserved judgement in the case and on 15 November 2007 announced that the appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed.

In summary, the reasoning of the Court was that at the trial the prosecution had relied primarily on four categories of evidence:
#One witness who had identified him as being in Jill Dando's street four and a half hours before the murder and other witnesses who, although they could not pick George out at an identity parade, saw a man in the street in the two hours before the murder who might have been George;
#Alleged lies told by George in interview;
#An alleged attempt to create a false alibi;
#The single particle of firearm discharge residue ([[Gunshot residue|FDR]]) found, about a year after the murder, in George's overcoat.

The prosecution had called expert witnesses at the trial whose evidence suggested that it was likely that the particle of FDR came from a gun fired by Barry George rather than from some other source.

Those witnesses and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal that this was not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the jury would have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2007/2722.html |publisher= British and Irish Legal Information Institute |title= George vs R. EWCA Crim 2722 |accessdate= 14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A retrial was ordered and George was remanded in custody, making no application for bail.&lt;ref name = "retrial3" /&gt;

===Retrial===
George appeared before the [[Old Bailey]] on 14 December 2007 and again pleaded not guilty to the murder.&lt;ref name="retrial1"/&gt; His retrial began on 9 June 2008.&lt;ref name=retrial2/&gt; Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in [[social skills]] and a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice [[John Griffith Williams|Griffith Williams]]). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) as a result of the enactment of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003#Bad character|Criminal Justice Act 2003]] since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and one of the jurors. For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him go off in this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade. The trial ended with George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.&lt;ref name = "acquit"/&gt;

==Life after Dando acquittal==

On multiple occasions George has won substantial damages from [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] over various allegations published about him, at least twice pursuing these [[libel]] claims to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. In December 2009, following mediation, he accepted an undisclosed amount from [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Group Newspapers]] over articles published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and the ''[[News of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8415772.stm |title= Barry George in newspaper payout over Dando claims |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] settled with George after claims, unrelated to the Dando murder, that he had developed an obsession with singer [[Cheryl Cole]] and newsreader [[Kay Burley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8682512.stm |title= Barry George wins libel damages over obsession claims |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100517044340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8682512.stm |archivedate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 it emerged that the Ministry of Justice had denied a claim of [[pound sterling|£]]1.4 million compensation made by George in respect of his wrongful imprisonment for Jill Dando's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7603460/Barry-George-refused-1.4-million-compensation-claim-over-Jill-Dando-murder.html |title= Barry George refused £1.4 million compensation claim over Jill Dando murder |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Edwards |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100421094357/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7603460/Barry-George-refused-1.4-million-compensation-claim-over-Jill-Dando-murder.html |archivedate= 21 April 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made by [[Jack Straw]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] and in August 2010 the High Court ruled that George is entitled to a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =BBC News |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11081686 |title= Court grants Barry George compensation review |date=25 August 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100825201205/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11081686 |archivedate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2011, the Supreme Court defined "miscarriage of justice" as evidence "so undermined that no conviction could possibly be based upon it".  This decision cleared the way for George's solicitor, Nicholas Baird, to request that the Justice Secretary Ken Clarke "consider afresh" George's claim for compensation, applying the new test set out by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =BBC News |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13356120 |title= Supreme Court allows miscarriage of justice appeals|date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was heard in the High Court but in their summing up, judges Lord Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Irwin said: "There was indeed a case upon which a reasonable jury properly directed could have convicted the claimant of murder" and on the strength of this, denied George compensation for wrongful incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =BBC News |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21195269 |title= Barry George loses compensation case|date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Che Kung Temple 13.jpg|thumb|Statue of Che Kung in [[Che Kung Temple]], [[Tai Wai]], [[Sha Tin District]].]]
'''Che Kung festival''' or the '''Birthday of Che Kung''' is the day when people celebrate the birth of [[Che Kung]]. On this day, people, especially [[Hongkong]]ers, would like to go to [[Che Kung Temple]] and worship Che Kung. Che Kung was a military commander in Southern [[Song dynasty]]. He protected the [[Emperor Bing of Song]] to escape Mongol invaders and considered as loyalty to the emperors.

The real birthday of Che Kung is 2 January in the [[Chinese lunar calendar]]. Nevertheless, people prefer the next day to celebrate his birthday.
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Procedures of the festival celebration==
[[File:Che Kung Temple 10.jpg|thumb|upright|Drum of Heaven]]
[[File:Che Kung Temple 12.jpg|thumb|upright|Wheeling the Golden Pinwheel]]
They are:&lt;ref&gt;李丞責:新春吉祥開運法, 東週刊, http://eastweek.my-magazine.me/index.php?aid=10494, Retrieved from 3/4/2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Preparing of the [[Sacrifice|offerings]], they may include: [[incense]] sticks, red candles, fresh fruits, flowers, meats and any other [[Chinese New Year]] food.
#Hitting the ‘Drum of heaven’ (天鼓) to inform Che Kung the worshiper has come.
#Placing the offerings in front of the statue of Che Kung, and then lighting up the candles and burning the incense sticks.
#Telling Che Kung your personal information and wishes while offering the incense in the main hall.
#Burning the paper clothes, paper money and other paper offerings to Che Kung in the assigned area.
#Spinning the golden pinwheel with your left hand outside the temple clockwise if you think you had good luck last year and you want to keep it in the coming year; otherwise, if you had bad luck last year and you want it to be good in the coming year, you should spin the pinwheel anti-clockwise.
#Buying your personal pinwheel and placing it in a position that abides by the principles of [[Feng Shui]]. 
#Returning to the temple and giving offerings to Che Kung in thanks to him for taking care of you throughout the prior year.

Apart from the ceremony carried in the above hall, there are other practices to be done in the subordinate halls e.g. [[Tai Sui]] (太歲), [[Cai Shen]](財神). For believers who are students, they often write down their name and wishes on a praying paper, and stick it onto a board called Jinbang timing board (金榜題名板) to pray for better academic achievements. To express their respect to Che Kung, believers may donate to the temple (添香油).  [[Divination]] (求籤)  is also practised in [[Che Kung Temple]] as a way of fortune-telling.

==Popularity and its believers==
On the Che Kung festival in 2014, 65 thousand people went to Che Kung.&lt;ref&gt;''赤口拜車公 人數大跌6成''(n.d. 2014) http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/realtime/news/20140202/52149732&lt;/ref&gt;
Believers think practising divination in Che Kung temple has made accurate predictions in the past. The first time was in 2003, Minister of [[Home Affairs]] Dr [[Patrick Ho]] Chi-ping on behalf of the city pulled out the worst possible bamboo stick in the temple on the Birthday of Che Kung. In the same year, Hong Kong was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;A.Wu(2013).''It's time for Hong Kong to make its own luck'',SCMA, http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1152450/its-time-hong-kong-make-its-own-luck&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the person on behalf of Hong Kong practising divination on the Birthday of Che Kung has changed to [[Lau Wong Fat]], the minister of [[Heung Yee Kuk]] since 2004.

The Birthday of Che Kung also relates to some political controversy. In the event of [[Hong Kong Express Rail Link controversy]], about 20 post-80s generation anti-rail representatives joined the [[Hong Kong Government Lunar New year kau cim tradition]] at Che Kung temple, Sha Tin to draw three divination sticks as a way of demonstration to express their anger towards Hong Kong government.&lt;ref&gt;''80後為社區家園求得下籤''(n.d 2010), The Sun, http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20100216/00407_007.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual Meanings==

===Purpose of the ceremony and date selection===
[[File:Che Kung Temple 14.jpg|thumb|Pinwheels]]
Che Kung is famous for his power to suppress chaos and his supreme ability to cure diseases. Precisely because of the abilities of Che Kung, he was soon revered as a "God" and has been considered as a "God of protection". Consequently, his followers and worshipers constructed a temple specifically for Che Kung in order to praise his power and good deeds.

Moreover, there are four festival seasons of Che Kung’s birthday in [[Lunar Calendar]] (including 2/1, 27/3, 6/6 and 16/8). Since the first festival season falls on the Lunar New Year holiday, believers have dedicated the third day of the Lunar New Year as an annual event to worship Che Kung, and the celebration is known as "The Birthday of Che Kung" nowadays.

===Meanings behind the objects used===
Devotees choose to burn incense sticks. Burning [[incense]] sticks is a common phenomenon during the festival, because the process of burning [[incense]] sticks and the rising smoke symbolizes the appreciation of the devotees to the blessing and protection from Che Kung of the previous year. Devotees would also tell their living problems to Che Kung and hope that he will fulfill their wish. It is believed that their wishes will be carried up to heaven to Che Kung by the smoke of the incense.

[[Pinwheel (toy)|Pinwheels]] can always be found next to the effigy of Che Kung, and they are regarded as ‘a wheel of fortune’. It is believed that the one who turns the pinwheel will be granted with prosperity and good luck for the entire year.

==Reflection of Chinese cultures/values==
[[File:Che Kung Temple 16.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance of Che Kung Temple in Tai Wai, Sha Tin District.]]
In Chinese culture, worshiping Che Kung is similar to worshiping [[Guandi]],&lt;ref&gt;''Superscribing Symbols: The Myth of Guandi, Chinese God of War'', Duara.P(1988), JSTOR
https://www.jstor.org/stable/2057852&lt;/ref&gt; a god widely worshiped within Chinese communities as they believe he protects the entire nation. Both of them were generals protecting their country and demonstrated the loyalty to the motherland and to the people. Hong Kong local residents believe that [[Che Kung]] would protect them and their villages as he protected the [[Song dynasty]]. Being deeply influenced by [[Confucianism]], Chinese people admire the bravery and uprightness of Che Kung.

On the 3rd of First Month in Lunar Month, traditionally, Chinese people think it is easy to have an argument with other people and this will give them misfortune. To prevent this curse from happening, Chinese people would like to worship folk god(s). That is the reason why so many people choose this day to go to worship [[Che Kung]] and pray for their fortune in the following year.

[[File:Weingarten Blutritt Beyer.jpg|thumb|right|Blutritt in Weingarten, c. 1865]]
The '''Blutritt''' (literal translation: Blood Ride) is an equestrian procession in honor of a relic containing the blood of Jesus Christ.  There are several cities in [[Germany]] holding Blutritte, however, the dates are not unified.

== Blutritt in Weingarten ==
[[File:Weingarten Blutritt 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Weingarten Blutritt, 2007]]
[[File:Blutritt 2011 Gruppe Weingarten Blutreiter 1a.jpg|thumb|right|The Rider of the Holy Blood of Weingarten Blutritt, 2011]]
The Blutritt in the Upper [[Swabia]] [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]] is regarded as the biggest equestrian procession in [[Europe]]. It takes place on the Friday after [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] and is also known as the ‘bloodfriday‘ („Blutfreitag“). In 1529 the Blutritt was first mentioned in writing, but even then it was labeled as an old custom. Traditionally, the Blutritt is a pilgrimage for men.

The [[Weingarten Abbey]] has been preserving a holy blood relic for over 950 years. This relic contains several drops of blood in a lump of earth which are supposedly the precious blood of [[Jesus]] Christ. This relic is kept in the church of the Weingarten Abbey.

On the day of the Blutritt, the Rider of the Holy Blood (German: Heilig-Blut-Reiter) carries the relic through Weingarten and the surrounding areas. Every year about 2,000 to 3,000 horsemen dressed in tailcoats and top hats (in 2016 there were 2,366 horsemen), grouped in over 100 groups of Blood Riders, escort the Rider of the Holy Blood on horseback. About 80 [[Chapel (music)|chapels]] accompany the horsemen. Every year the Blutritt in Weingarten is witnessed from the side of the road by over 30,000 pilgrims and spectators.

=== Origin ===

According to legend, the [[Relic of the Holy Blood]] in Weingarten contains the blood of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, who was crucified in 30 or 31 AD on the hill [[Calvary|Golgotha]]. A Roman legionnaire, later known as [[Longinus]], pushed his lance deep into the side of the crucified to determine his death.

The blood of Jesus Christ dripped on the face of the legionnaire and enlightened him; this was, according to the legend, the origin of the miraculous healing force of the blood of Jesus. Longinus collected some drops of the blood, mixed them with the soil of Golgotha and stored them in a lead box. After being baptized by the Apostles, he left Jerusalem and traveled on a ship to the Italian [[Mantua]] where he preached Christianity and was consequently prosecuted. In hardship and distress, he hid the casket and died as a [[Martyr]] later on. One day the place of hiding was revealed to the blind Adilbero, and the news of which reached the Emperor. The Emperor, the Pope, and the Duke of Mantua let Adilbero show them the relic's hiding place and he got his eyesight back. However, a bloody conflict broke out about the relic. As a consequence, the object of dispute was apportioned: one piece for [[Pope Leo IX]], one for the Duke of Mantua, and a third for Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]].&lt;ref name="Legende"&gt;Dirk Grupe: ''Wie das Heilig-Blut von Golgatha nach Oberschwaben kam''. In: ''Schwäbische Zeitung'' vom 12. Mai 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This legend does not withstand a historic investigation; rather, the early Christian prosecution of [[Longinus]] came to an end in [[Cappadocia]]. The relic and his mortal remains were sent as a counter-present from [[Constantinople]] to the city of Mantua. When Mantua was under siege by the [[Lombards]] for one year in 580, the relic was hidden in a secret place and found again in 804. Thereupon, [[Pope Leo III]] (795-816) and [[Charlemagne]] (768-814) had it examined. The relic was disassembled.

While Mantua was under siege by the Hungarians in 923, the parts were hidden again; the greater part, together with the relics of [[Longinus]], in the garden of the Andreas Hospital, and the smaller part in the old church of St. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], close to the cathedral (found in 1479). On 12 March 1048 the greater part of the Relic of the Holy Blood and the remains of Longinus were found in Mantua. [[Pope Leo IX]] (1049–1054) called a synod of the church in 1053 in Mantua and wanted to take the relic of the precious blood to Rome. Due to the opposition of the people of Mantua, a second division of the relic occurred; one piece remained in Mantua, whereas the other was taken to Rome. In 1055 Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] (1039–1056) traveled to Mantua and got another part of the Relic of the Holy Blood.&lt;ref name="Geschichte"&gt;[http://www.blutritt.de/content/5.htm Geschichte des Heiligen Blutes], abgerufen am 13. Mai 2010'''&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Emperor Henry III]] died in 1056, the relic was bequeathed to [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], (1035–1067) as a sign of reconciliation. He gave it as a present to his relation [[Judith of Flanders]] (1032–1094) who was married with her second husband [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]]. When the duke went into the crusade, Judith gave the Relic of the Blood to the abbot of the [[Weingarten Abbey]] Walicho (1088–1108), the “Lieblingsstiftung” (a foundation) and to the burial place of the [[House of Welf]].

The handing over of the reliquary dates to 31 May 1090 and alternatively 12 March 1094. Apparently, it was the Friday after [[Ascension Day]] and is, thus, the origin of Blood Friday and the Ride of the Holy Blood. The handing over is depicted as a relief on the Hosanna-bell (1490) at the Basilica St. Martin.

=== History of Blutritt ===

Until the 17th century the Blutritt was connected with a border bypassing of the area of Weingarten. Therefore, the fathers marched with their sons who had just come of age and gave them a [[slapping (strike)|slapping]] in the face as a memory backing at prominent sites.

=== Procedure ===

As a prelude to Blutritt, in the evening of the Ascension of Christ, thousands of pilgrims take part in a light procession from the Basilica of St.Martin to the Kreuzberg (since 1890).

On Blood Friday at 6 o'clock in the morning, the equestrian fair begins at the basilica. The actual Blutritt starts at about 7 o'clock and leads through the streets and adjacent fields of Weingarten for about ten kilometres. The relic, which is set in a cross studded with gemstones, is carried by the Rider of the Holy Blood, who bestows the Blessing of the Holy Blood (German: Segen des Heiligen Blutes) on houses, farms, and fields. The relic is secured by means of a chain with three rings, in case of the horse rearing up and throwing the rider off. Until the abbey was closed in 2010, a religious priest from the Weingarten Abbey was Rider of the Holy Blood. Since 2011, however, the parson of the basilica occupies this position. After about five hours, the reliquary is returned to the basilica.

=== Altars ===

The equestrian procession travels to four exterior altars. One of them lies outside of the district of [[Weingarten, Württemberg|Weingarten]], in the municipality of [[Baienfurt]]:

* 1st Altar – Thumbstraße 48 in the parish of St. Maria, Weingarten
* 2nd Altar – Galgenkreuz (lit. "gallow cross", small religious monument that resembles a [[wayside cross]] or [[wayside shrine]]; similar in meaning to a [[conciliation cross]], though more specifically relating to an execution site) at the street to Ettishofen in the parish of Heilig Geist, Weingarten
* 3rd Altar – farm at the street after [[Wolpertswende|Mochenwangen]] in the parish of Baienfurt
* 4th Altar – Baienfurter Straße at the missionary cross in the parish of St. Martin, Weingarten

=== Movie: ''Die Blutritter'' ===

In 2003, film director {{ill|Douglas Wolfsperger|de}} made a documentary about several participants of the Blutritt in Weingarten. It is called "Die Blutritter" ("The Riders of the Holy Blood") and premiered  at the [[Locarno Festival]] in the summer of 2004.

== Blutritt in Bad Wurzach ==

In the upper swabian city of [[Bad Wurzach]], the Blutritt is traditionally part of the Festival of the Holy Blood, which takes place on the second Friday of July. With around 1,500 riders and about 5,000 pilgrims, it is the second largest mounted procession in Middle Europe. The object of worship is a relic from the private possessions of [[Pope Innocent XII]].

=== Origin ===

Tradition has it that in Rome, a pilgrim received a piece of cloth drenched in blood from Pope Innocent XII in the year of 1693. This relic then ended up in Bad Wurzach.

=== Procedure ===

The blood-soaked cloth is carried around the city and its surroundings in a gilded reliquary. The horses are festively decorated, and the riders are wearing formal attire. The procession starts at 7 o'clock with the collection of the relic at the town church, and ends with a sermon on top of the Gottesberg (German: God's hill).

'''British rhythm and blues''' (or '''R&amp;B''') was a musical movement that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader [[Beat music|British beat]] and more purist [[British blues]] scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]]. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.

The origins of the movement were in the [[British jazz]], [[skiffle]] and [[British folk revival|folk]] movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures [[Cyril Davies]] and [[Alexis Korner]] to turn to electric blues and form the band [[Blues Incorporated]], which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[the Animals]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Them (band)|Them]], and [[the Spencer Davis Group]], who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, in the wake of the Merseybeat craze, becoming central to the [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] in the UK and a second wave of [[British Invasion]] acts in the US.

Several of the bands and their members went on to become leading rock music performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, helping to create [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[hard rock]] and making rhythm and blues a key component of that music. In the mid to late-1970s, British R&amp;B enjoyed a revival through the [[British soul]] and [[disco]] scenes, the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] circuit, [[new wave music]] and the [[mod revival]], and has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the late 1980s. In the 2000s, a British version of [[contemporary R&amp;B]] began gaining popularity, and since the late 2000s the success of British female singers influenced by soul and R&amp;B led to talk of another "R&amp;B British invasion".

==Characteristics==
[[File:Muddy Waters.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Muddy Waters]], a major influence on the movement, pictured in 1971]]

Commentators often distinguish British rhythm and blues bands from [[beat music|beat]] bands (who were influenced by [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]]) on the one hand, and, from "purist" [[British blues]] (which particularly emulated [[Chicago blues|Chicago]] [[electric blues]] artists), on the other, although there was considerable crossover between the three sets of musicians.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] bands like [[the Beatles]], or from the parallel beat scene in [[Manchester]], were influenced by American forms of music that included [[rockabilly]], [[girl group]]s and the early [[Motown]] sound, helping them to produce commercial orientated form of music that began to dominate the British charts from 1963. However, bands from the developing London club scene were mainly concerned to emulate black rhythm and blues performers, including the work of [[Chess Records]]' blues artists like [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], but also wider rhythm and blues singer and rock and roll pioneers like [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] resulting in a "rawer" or "grittier" sound.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt;

British rhythm and blues differed in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; British rhythm and blues singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, [[glottal stops]], moans and cries.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007p244&gt;R. F. Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5580-6}}, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; However, vocalists such as [[Van Morrison]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Eric Burdon]] and [[Steve Winwood]] did not attempt to emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power.&lt;ref&gt;D. Weissman, ''Which Side Are You On?: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America'' (London: Continuum, 2005), {{ISBN|0-8264-1698-5}}, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In cover versions of R&amp;B songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hicks, ''Sixties Rock: Garage, Psychedelic, and Other Satisfactions'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-252-06915-3}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums&lt;ref name=Longhurts2007p98&gt;B. Longhurst, ''Popular Music and Society'' (London: Polity, 2nd edn., 2007), {{ISBN|0-7456-3162-2}}, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B&gt;R. Unterberger, "Early British R&amp;B", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden noted that after the split of Blues Incorporated at the end of 1962, four main strands could be discerned in British Rhythm and Blues. Cyril Davies left to attempt to recreate the Chicago electric blues of Muddy Waters.&lt;ref name=NME2BR&amp;B/&gt; The style would be the major influence on the later emergence of the blues boom, particularly through the work of [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]]. Alexis Korner continued with Blues Incorporated, bringing in jazz saxophonist [[Graham Bond]] and developing a more jazz orientated sound. This strand would be taken up by acts including the [[Graham Bond Organisation]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[Zoot Money]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt;  A unique form was pursued by Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, who as the resident band at the [[Flamingo Club (London)|Flamingo]] club on Wardour Street, unusual in having a predominantly black audience of American GIs and locals, also utilised jazz, but mixed R&amp;B with elements of Caribbean music, including [[Ska]] and bluebeat. The Rolling Stones and others focused on rocking guitar music based on the work of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and would be followed by many small guitar and drum based groups, many of which would rapidly move into rock music.&lt;ref name=NME2BR&amp;B&gt;N.

==History==

===Origins===

In the early 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced [[boogie-woogie]], and the [[jump blues]] of [[Fats Waller]] and [[Louis Jordan]].&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007pp22&amp;44&gt;R. F.  Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5580-6}}, pp. 22 and 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Imported recordings of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain during and after World War II, merchant seamen visiting the ports of London, [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle on Tyne]] and [[Belfast]], and in a trickle of (illegal) imports.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007p28&gt;R. F. Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5580-6}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 major British record labels [[HMV]] and [[EMI]] (the latter, particularly through their subsidiary [[Decca Records]]), began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007pp22&amp;49&gt;R. F.  Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7546-5580-6}}, pp. 22 and 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of recordings, occasional radio broadcasts were one of the few ways that British people could become familiar with the blues. A one-off broadcast by [[Josh White]] while he was visiting Britain in 1951 was so popular that he was asked to perform for a series of programmes for the BBC, eventually titled ''The Glory Road'' and broadcast in 1952. Later that year, folk song collector [[Alan Lomax]], then resident in London, produced a series of three programmes under the title ''The Art of the Negro'', of last of which, "Blues in the Mississippi Night" featured folk blues recordings by artists including Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker and was the first introduction of many later followers of the blues to the music and hardships of life for African Americans in the Southern US. The next year the ''Jazz Club'' programme, hosted by Max Jones, included a recital of "Town and Country Blues", which played music by a wide range of blues artists.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007bpp155-59&gt;R.

[[File:Chris Barber1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chris Barber]], one of the major figures in the early popularisation of the blues in Britain, playing at the Musikhalle, Hamburg, 1972]]

The British rhythm and blues scene developed in London out of the related jazz, skiffle and [[folk club]] scenes of the 1950s. The first of these scenes, that of jazz, had developed during the Second World War as a reaction to [[swing music|swing]], consciously re-introducing older elements of American jazz, particularly that of [[Dixieland|New Orleans]] to produce [[trad jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3282-2}}, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; This music incorporated elements of the blues and occasional blues-influenced singles reached the British Charts, including [[Humphrey Lyttelton]]'s self-penned "[[Bad Penny Blues]]" (1956), the first jazz record to reach the British top 20.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Brown, ''A Concise History of Jazz'' (Bunker, MO: Mel Bay, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7866-4983-6}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

British trad jazz band-leader [[Chris Barber]] was one of the major figures in the development and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the [[Marquee Club]], which would become one of the major venues for British R&amp;B bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and [[Big Bill Broonzy]] in 1951, and would include [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[Memphis Slim]], [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]].&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007bpp155-59/&gt;{{clear}}

===Skiffle===
{{Main|Skiffle}}
[[File:The Quarrymen ... plus their instruments, The Beatles Story.jpg|thumb|The instruments of the skiffle group [[the Quarrymen]], who would become [[the Beatles]]]]

Lonnie Johnson played at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in 1952 on a bill opened by a group led by the young [[Lonnie Donegan]].&lt;ref name=williamson&gt;Nigel Williamson, ''The Rough Guide to The Blues'' (London, Rough Guides Ltd., 2007), {{ISBN|1-84353-519-X}}, pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Donegan became the key figure in the development of the British skiffle "craze", beginning in [[Ken Colyer]]'s Jazzmen by playing American folk and blues songs, particularly those derived from the recordings of Huddie Leadbetter, during intervals to the accompaniment of guitar, [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] and [[tea-chest bass]] in a lively style that emulated American [[jug bands]].&lt;ref name=Cohen2006/&gt; After Colyer left in 1954 to form a new outfit, the band became Chris Barber's Jazz Band,&lt;ref name=Brocken2003&gt;M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3282-2}}, pp. 69–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and members of the band played "race blues" songs in concert intervals and recorded as The Lonnie Donegan Skiffle Group.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007bpp155-59/&gt; They released their high-tempo version of Lead Belly's "[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]" in 1956 and it became a major hit, spending eight months in the Top 20, peaking at number six (and number eight in the U.S.). It was the first début record to go [[gold album|gold]] in Britain, selling over a million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=Brocken2003/&gt; This stimulated the explosion of the British "skiffle craze" and it has been estimated that in the late 1950s there were 30–50,000 skiffle groups in Britain.&lt;ref name=Cohen2006&gt;R. D. Cohen, ''Folk Music: the Basics'' (London: Routledge 2006), {{ISBN|0-415-97160-8}}, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of guitars grew rapidly and groups performed on banjos, [[tea chest bass]] guitars and [[Washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]]s in church halls, cafes and the flourishing coffee bars of [[Soho]], London.&lt;ref name=Brocken2003/&gt; In addition to members of the Beatles, a large number of British rhythm and blues musicians began their careers playing skiffle, including [[Van Morrison]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Roger Daltrey]].&lt;ref&gt;C. McDevitt, ''Skiffle: The Roots of UK Rock'' (London: Robson Books, 1998), {{ISBN|1-86105-140-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion created a demand for opportunities to play versions of American folk, blues and jazz music that would contribute to the growth of a club scene.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3282-2}}, pp. 74–7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

Until the mid-1950s in Britain the blues was seen as a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a [[folk blues]] set to fit British expectations of American blues, rather than his current electric [[Chicago blues]].&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Macpherson, ''Britain and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85109-431-8}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a [[Public house|pub]] in [[Soho]], co-founded by [[Ewan MacColl]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Boyes, ''The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), {{ISBN|0-7190-4571-1}}, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs, following the lead of MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English [[folk clubs]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002'' (Ashgate, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7546-3282-2}}, pp. 77–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The more traditional American folk blues continued to provide 1960s British groups with material, particularly after the emergence of [[Bob Dylan]], who also popularised folk blues songs. In 1964, for example, the song-catalogue of [[Lead Belly]] provided [[the Animals]] with "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/music/story_behind/houseofrisingsun.shtml "Stories Behind the Song: "House of the Rising Sun"], ''BBC Northern Ireland''.

[[File:Alexis-Korner.jpg|Alex|thumb|upright|right|[[Alexis Korner]] in Hamburg in 1972]]

Blues harpist [[Cyril Davies]] ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse public house in London’s [[Soho]], which served as a focal point for British skiffle acts. Like guitarist [[Alexis Korner]], he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the [[R&amp;B]] segment Barber introduced to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists.&lt;ref name=Allmusic/&gt; They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances.&lt;ref&gt;L. Portis, ''Soul Trains'' (Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2002), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The visit of [[Muddy Waters]] in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R&amp;B in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified [[electric blues]], but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews.&lt;ref name=Allmusic&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, ''All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), {{ISBN|0-87930-736-6}}, p. 700.&lt;/ref&gt; Where British blues had often emulated [[Delta blues]] and [[country blues]] in the emerging [[British folk revival]], Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.&lt;ref name=Allmusic/&gt;

Blues Incorporated had a fluid line up and became a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s. These included future members of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Kinks]];&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; beside [[Graham Bond]] and [[Long John Baldry]].&lt;ref name=Allmusic/&gt; As well as acting as a mentor to these figures and others, including [[John Mayall]] and [[Jimmy Page]],&lt;ref&gt;B. Miles, ''The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era'' (Sterling, 2009), {{ISBN|1-4027-6976-8}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Korner was also a historian, writer and record collector pivotal in the growth of the movement, and often referred to as "the father of British blues".&lt;ref&gt;R. House, ''Blue Smoke: The Recorded Journey of Big Bill Broonzy'' (London: LSU Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0-8071-3720-0}}, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Blues Incorporated established a regular "Rhythm and Blues Night" at the [[Ealing Jazz Club]] and were given a residency at the Marquee Club, from which in 1962 they took the name of the first British blues album, ''[[R&amp;B from the Marquee]]'' (Decca), but Korner and Davies had split over the issue of including horn sections in the Blues Incorporated sound before its release.&lt;ref name=Allmusic/&gt; Korner continued with various line-ups for Blues Incorporated, while Davies went on to form his R&amp;B All Stars.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt;

Early British rhythm and blues bands like Blues Incorporated found that folk clubs would not accept amplified blues performances.&lt;ref name=Schwartz2007p126&gt;R. F.

In addition to the Roundhouse and the Marquee in central London, these included [[Flamingo Club (London)|The Flamingo]], the [[Crawdaddy Club]], Richmond, where the Rolling Stones first began to gain attention,&lt;ref&gt;B.

From 1962 demand for blues recordings in Britain and Europe led to new outlets for American recordings, Chicago recordings that were now available included [[Vee Jay Records]] through EMI's [[Stateside Records|Stateside]] label and Chess Records through [[Pye International]]'s R&amp;B series.

===Major acts===

====The Rolling Stones====
{{Main|The Rolling Stones}}
The most commercially successful act in the genre, were the Rolling Stones.&lt;ref name=ErlewineAMRollingStones/&gt; [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]], who had renewed their childhood association after discovering a shared interest in R&amp;B records, were introduced to guitarist [[Brian Jones]] through Alexis Korner, after a Blues Incorporated gig at the Ealing Jazz Club.&lt;ref name=Murray2011p69/&gt; Blues Incorporated contained two other future members of the Rolling Stones: [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Charlie Watts]].&lt;ref name=rockhall&gt;{{cite web| title = The Rolling Stones Biography| work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum| publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. | url = http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-rolling-stones| accessdate =1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in London in 1962, Jones took their name from a track on the cover of a Muddy Waters album and they abandoned blues purism before their line-up solidified to focus on a wide range of rhythm and blues artists. They debuted at The Marquee and soon gained a residency at the Crawdaddy Club, building up a reputation as a live act.&lt;ref name=ErlewineAMRollingStones/&gt; They signed a recording contract with Decca and their first single was a cover of Chuck Berry's "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]" released in June 1963. Despite its being virtually unpromoted by the band or the record company, their reputation among R&amp;B fans helped it reached number 21 on the UK singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/day-in-music-1025/ |title=This Day in Music Spotlight: Rolling Stones Riot on Ed Sullivan |work=gibson.com |accessdate=4 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104060017/http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Lifestyle/Features/day%2Din%2Dmusic%2D1025/# |archive-date=4 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They produced their first album, ''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]'', in 1964, which largely consisted of rhythm and blues standards. Following in the wake of the Beatles' national and then international success, the Rolling Stones established themselves as the second most popular UK band and joined the British Invasion of the American record charts as leaders of a second wave of R&amp;B oriented bands.&lt;ref name=ErlewineAMRollingStones&gt;S.

Gracyk, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'' (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|1-56639-903-3}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the writing partnership contributed to the marginalisation of Jones and marked a shift away from R&amp;B material. They would investigate a series of new musical styles in their long career, but blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones' music.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt;

====Other London bands====
[[File:Helmfrid-sofa4 Touched.JPG|thumb|left|The original line up of [[the Kinks]], 1965]]

Other London-based bands that pursued a similar course to the Rolling Stones included the Yardbirds, the Kinks, the [[Downliners Sect]], the [[Pretty Things]] and [[Pink Floyd]].&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; The Yardbirds began as the Metropolis Blues Quartet. By 1963 they had acquired Eric Clapton as a lead guitarist and were acting as the backing band for [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]] on his British tour. They earned a formidable reputation as a live act, developing frantic improvised guitar–harmonica "rave-ups", but they enjoyed only modest success with singles based on R&amp;B covers. In 1965 they cut the more pop-oriented single "[[For Your Love]]", which made the top 10 in the UK and US, but the move away from the blues prompted Clapton to quit the band for a stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and then to form [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His replacement Jeff Beck (and eventually his replacement Jimmy Page), saw the band enjoy a series of transatlantic hits and to go on to become pioneers of [[psychedelic rock]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

After an early lack of success with R&amp;B standards, the Kinks enjoyed their breakthrough with the single "[[You Really Got Me]]" (1964). Influenced by [[the Kingsmen]]'s version of "[[Louie, Louie]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=41|title=Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else|author=Thomas M. Kitts|publisher=Routledge|date= 23 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it reached number one in the UK and the top 10 in the US.

====Provincial groups====
[[File:Eric Burdon &amp; the Animals.jpg|thumb|right|upright|thumb|[[The Animals]] in 1964]]

Bands to emerge from other major British cities included [[the Animals]] from Newcastle, [[Them (band)|Them]] from Belfast and [[the Spencer Davis Group]] and [[the Moody Blues]] from [[Birmingham]]. None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on sources that included [[Brill Building]] and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained at the core of their early albums.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; The Animals' sound was characterised by the keyboards of [[Alan Price]] and the powerful vocals of [[Eric Burdon]].

Subsequent singles failed to penetrate the top 20 and hardly broke the top 100 in the US, marking a steep decline in the band's fortunes. However, they would return after line-up changes to be one of the most important psychedelic rock bands and a major influence on [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref&gt;B.

The wider rhythm and blues boom overlapped, both chronologically and in terms of personnel, with the later and more narrowly focused British blues boom.

====1970s====
With the rise of [[disco]] music, [[British soul]] music became popular in the mid-late 1970s. A handful of pub rock acts managed to achieve mainstream success after the advent of [[punk rock]], often being re-categorised as [[new wave music]], including [[Graham Parker and the Rumour]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and [[Elvis Costello]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hatch, and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1989), {{ISBN|0-7190-2349-1}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; London-based R&amp;B pub rock bands received a major boost when [[The Jam]] kicked off the [[mod revival]] in 1977 with their debut album ''[[In the City (The Jam album)|In the City]]'', which mixed R&amp;B standards with originals modelled on [[the Who]]'s early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album ''[[All Mod Cons]]'' (1978), on which [[Paul Weller]]'s song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks.&lt;ref name=AllmusicJam&gt;S. T. Erlewine, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4585|pure_url=yes}} "The Jam"]. Retrieved 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice, the Little Roosters, [[the Inmates]], [[Nine Below Zero]] and [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]], became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London.&lt;ref&gt;T. Rawlings, ''MOD: Clean Living Under Very Difficult Circumstances: Very British Phenomenon'' (London: Omnibus Press, 2000), {{ISBN|0-7119-6813-6}}, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of '60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including [[the Lambrettas]], [[the Merton Parkas]], Squire, and [[Purple Hearts (UK band)|Purple Hearts]]. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early '80s.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2631|pure_url=yes}} "Mod Revival"], ''Allmusic''. Retrieved 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Dave Kelly, who had been a member of the [[John Dummer Blues Band]] formed [[The Blues Band]] with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who continued to tour and record rhythm and blues into the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;G.

====1980s====
Paul Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed [[The Style Council]], who abandoned most of the elements of punk to adopt music much more based in R&amp;B and early soul.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Erlewine, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5548|pure_url=yes}} "The Style Council"], ''Allmusic''. Retrieved 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer&lt;ref&gt;J. Ankeny, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5096|pure_url=yes}} "Robert Palmer"] ''Allmusic''.

Huey, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5854|pure_url=yes}} "Steve Windwood"], ''Allmusic''. Retrieved 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, musicians, particularly African Americans, mixed pop with disco like beats and high tech [[electronic music|electronic]] production to produce the new genre of [[contemporary R&amp;B]], adding elements of other genres, including [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

====2000s–2010s====

==Significance==
Because of the very different circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, but it has also been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; In order to sustain their careers most British R&amp;B artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt; Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of [[world music|world]], [[folk music|folk]] and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and [[post-punk]] music and had a major impact on later genres, including [[Britpop]].&lt;ref name=AllmusicJam/&gt; As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&amp;B/&gt;

The '''Busan Sunrise Festival''' ({{Korean|hangul=부산해맞이축제|rr=Busan Haemaji Chukje}}) is an annual event held in [[Busan]], South Korea.

==History==
The Busan Sunrise Festival was conceived in 1999 to promote Busan as a "metropolis of cosmopolitan culture and tourism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shim|first1=Su-hwa|script-title=ko:부산시, 새천년맞이 문화사업 계획 확정|url=https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004525348|website=[[Yonhap]]|accessdate=August 14, 2018|language=Korean|date=March 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to spread awareness of the inaugural event, the Busan Metropolitan City Government and Busan Cultural Festival Promotion Association invited public participation throughout April to select an official promotional poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ko:&lt;지방단신&gt;새천년 해맞이 축제 포스터 공모|url=https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004528539|website=Yonhap|accessdate=August 14, 2018|language=Korean|date=March 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bell toll ritual occurs in [[Yongdusan Park]] on December 31 followed by the observance of the [[sunrise]] on [[Haeundae Beach]] on January 1.

'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 2012 stage adaptation of the 1981 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[Chariots of Fire|film of the same name]]. Production of the Olympic-themed play, which opened at London's [[Hampstead Theatre]] 9 May 2012 and transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] on 23 June 2012, was partially inspired by the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Summer Olympics]].

==Overview==
The ''Chariots of Fire'' adaptation for the stage was written by playwright [[Mike Bartlett (playwright)|Mike Bartlett]], and [[Edward Hall (director)|Edward Hall]] directed the play. It starred [[Jack Lowden]] as Scottish missionary [[Eric Liddell]], and [[James McArdle]] as Jewish Cambridge student [[Harold Abrahams]]. For the production, stage designer [[Miriam Buether]] transformed the entire theatre into an Olympic stadium, so that audiences had the experience of being in the Olympic stands.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;[http://westend.broadwayworld.com/article/Cast-Announced-for-Hampstead-Theatres-CHARIOTS-OF-FIRE-Opens-May-9-20120402# "Cast Announced for Hampstead Theatre's ''Chariots of Fire''; Opens May 9"].

The play includes the film's iconic [[Vangelis]] score, and Vangelis also created several new pieces of music for the production.&lt;ref name=elsewhere&gt;[http://elsew.com/data/latest.htm#25-5-2012 "''Chariots of Fire'' Stage Play Music: A Possible Release?"] ''Elsewhere: The Independent Vangelis Website''. 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chariots tweeter"&gt;Twitter: ''Chariots Tweeter'', [https://twitter.com/ChariotsHT/status/191903872313344000 16 April 2012],  [https://twitter.com/ChariotsHT/status/192645441958055936 18 April 2012] [https://twitter.com/ChariotsHT/status/203210428313108480 17 May 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=british&gt;Rees, Jasper.

The stage version for the London Olympic year was the idea of the film's director, [[Hugh Hudson]], who co-produced the play; Hudson stated, "Issues of faith, of refusal to compromise, standing up for one's beliefs, achieving something for the sake of it, with passion, and not just for fame or financial gain, are even more vital today."&lt;ref&gt;Jury, Louise.

==Synopsis==
{{main article|Chariots of Fire}}
''Chariots of Fire'' is the inspirational true story of two great British athletes, outsiders who overcome prejudice and personal strife to compete in the [[1924 Paris Olympics]]. [[Eric Liddell]] is a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God. [[Harold Abrahams]] is the son of an immigrant Lithuanian Jew who runs to overcome prejudice. The two young track athletes live for the purity and honour of running, and prevail in the face of enormous odds. The story begins in 1919, and climaxes in the heartbreaks and triumphs of the [[1924 Paris Olympics]].

==Production==
[[File:VangelisElGrecopremiereDE2.jpg|thumb|230px|In addition to his iconic original score, [[Vangelis]] created several new pieces of music for the 2012 play.&lt;ref name=elsewhere /&gt;&lt;ref name="chariots tweeter" /&gt;&lt;ref name=british /&gt;]]
The stage revival of the film was the inspiration of Hugh Hudson, who directed the 1981 film.&lt;ref&gt;Nikkhah, Roya. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9291892/Director-Hugh-Hudson-and-his-wife-Maryam-dAbo-speak-of-their-new-film-inspired-by-the-illness-that-nearly-killed-her.html "Director Hugh Hudson and His Wife Maryam d'Abo Speak of Their New Film Inspired by the Illness That Nearly Killed Her"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 27 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He and fellow co-producer [[Barbara Broccoli]], a film-industry magnate best known for the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] franchise, set about looking for the perfect director for the piece. Broccoli's involvement with ''Chariots of Fire'' extended back to 1980, when she introduced her friend [[Dodi Fayed]] to the screenplay, and he ended up co-financing the film and becoming its executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;Jury, Louise. [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/london/chariots-of-fire-will-run-in-west-end-to-honour-dodi-fayed-7660581.html "''Chariots of Fire'' Will Run in West End... to Honour Dodi Fayed"]. ''[[London Evening Standard]]''. 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudson and Broccoli chose Edward Hall to helm the stage adaptation, based upon his clear and incisive view of all the challenges involved in adapting the athletics-heavy story to the stage. Hall recruited the award-winning playwright Mike Bartlett, based on his many successes including ''[[Earthquakes in London]]'', to write the script for the play.&lt;ref name=british /&gt;

Set designer Miriam Buether transformed Hampstead Theatre into its very own stadium, giving the audience an immersive experience that evoked the 1924 Paris Olympics, including seating in the round around an Olympic track, and a  double [[revolving stage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Syed|Syed, Matthew]].

''[[The Guardian]]''. 29 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Buether also later transformed the Gielgud Theatre into an immersive stadium with a track running through the audience.&lt;ref name=midweek&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01j5nw0 ''Midweek'': Libby Purves interview with Jack Lowden]. [[BBC Radio 4]]. 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; And choreographer Scott Ambler reinvented and choreographed the various running scenes for maximum theatrical effect.&lt;ref name=british /&gt;&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

Scottish up-and-comer [[Jack Lowden]] was cast as Eric Liddell, on the strength of his glowingly reviewed, charismatic, and athletic performance as the main character Cammy in an international tour of the Olivier Award-winning play ''[[Black Watch (play)|Black Watch]]''. And [[RADA]]-trained [[James McArdle]], with several classics under his belt, had most recently portrayed [[Robin Hood]] at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]], and was chosen to play Harold Abrahams.

Rehearsals for the actors portraying athletes incorporated grueling training, including lengthy runs, with a [[British Military Fitness]] instructor.&lt;ref name=midweek /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Richard.

==Differences from the film==
[[File:The Great Court at Trinity College - geograph.org.uk - 1291695.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], site of the Great Court Run]]
In the 1981 film, screenwriter [[Colin Welland]] anchored the period story to the present by opening with Harold Abrahams' 1978 memorial service. In Mike Bartlett's 2012 play, the story is anchored to the present by beginning the piece with 15 modern athletes doing a warm-up, "which turns into a training session, which suddenly evolves into Lord Lindsay and Harold Abrahams."&lt;ref name=british /&gt;

Bartlett also used theatrical techniques to allow the play to "tell two stories at the same time, and show links between them and metaphors and parallels", using the Eric Liddell story to talk about Harold Abrahams and using Harold to talk about Eric.&lt;ref name=british /&gt; The play contains more meetings between Liddell and Abrahams than there were in the film, and also more humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/jack-fired-up-as-he-follows-in-flying-footsteps-of-olympics-legend-liddell-1-2308057 "Jack Fired Up as he Follows in Flying Footsteps of Olympics Legend Liddell"]. ''Southern Reporter''. 21 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the film, the play has Abrahams struggling with, in addition to anti-Semitism, thoughts of his estranged and never-present father.&lt;ref name=shuttleworth /&gt;

Director Edward Hall stated that, in addition, "In theatre you can take components of the story and analyse them narratively in different ways. So you can stretch or freeze a moment in a race.... it gives you more freedom." Astute staging, he noted, can convey all of the various emotions that take place while running, and then finishing, a race.&lt;ref&gt;Hemming, Sarah.

And in contrast to the film, the play also introduces a female admirer for Eric Liddell: his real-life fiancée  Florence Mackenzie, the daughter of Canadian missionaries to China. Also in the play, the very fit ensemble cast and extras are not only utilized for running and racing, but also are frequently employed in singing as well.&lt;ref name=billington /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geiser, Lauren.

[[Libby Purves]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that "even this grumpy Olymposceptic was brought to actual tears, moved to empathy and understanding by the fabulous theatricality of it." She called Edward Hall's staging "thrilling" and the play "irresistible", adding that "above all, it's the sincerity: a full-blooded willingness to take the hearty morality, amateur spirit and patriotism at its own valuation without modish irony." Praising the main cast, Purves singled out Jack Lowden as "outstanding", and Nicholas Woodeson as "superb".&lt;ref&gt;[[Libby Purves|Purves, Libby]].

HampsteadTheatre.com. 24 May 2012. (Excerpt of ''The Times'' review by Libby Purves, 24 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quentin Letts]] in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' deemed the play a "stirring production" and "thrilling", and gave it five stars, adding of the two leads that, "Both actors are splendid."&lt;ref&gt;[[Quentin Letts|Letts, Quentin]].

"It's Edward Hall's staging that's the real winner" he wrote, describing the running sequences as "pure exhilaration". He summed up the play as "a joyful antidote to the modern Olympics", "a real summer high", and "surely one of the great treats of the summer".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hart (novelist)|Hart, Christopher]].

(Excerpt of ''The Sunday Times'' review by Christopher Hart, 27 May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Shuttleworth]] in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' praised Edward Hall's "considerable adroitness" in directing what he deemed "a fine Olympic-season project". He also admired Bartlett's script in that "[h]e utilises the stage's greater ability to open up to the protagonists’ inner voices, showing Abrahams’ preoccupation with his never-present father and in particular Liddell's devout brand of muscular Christianity ...."&lt;ref name=shuttleworth&gt;[[Ian Shuttleworth|Shuttleworth, Ian]]. [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/30b684f6-a4c0-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html "''Chariots of Fire'', Hampstead Theatre, London"]. ''[[Financial Times]]''. 23 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised "Edward Hall's bravura production" and Miriam Buether's "brilliant" set. He also noted approvingly that Hall's "kaleidoscopic pageant" of a play is bound together by music, including Gilbert and Sullivan numbers,  Scottish bagpipes, a medley of British folk tunes, and the iconic Vangelis theme.&lt;ref name=billington&gt;[[Michael Billington (critic)|Billington, Michael]].

Andrzej Lukowski of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' wrote, "This lavish stage adaptation ... is about as close to a West End musical as it's possible to get without in fact being one", citing the frequent Gilbert and Sullivan hits, the impressive stadium set, the 21-strong ensemble cast, and the stylized running choreography. Lukowski praised Bartlett for his "funny, pithy and creative" script, and summarized the production by asserting it is "a spectacle".&lt;ref&gt;Lukowski, Andrzej.

''[[The Independent]]'' noted that, in a play about competition, "what eventually emerges as the really engaging battle of wills is that of Abrahams and Liddell versus the British Establishment – ironic, as they each strive to shine for king and country."&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, Kate. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/chariots-of-fire-hampstead-theatre-londonchildrens-children-almeida-londonin-the-next-room-the-vibrator-play-ustinov-studio-bath-7791217.html "''Chariots of Fire'', Hampstead Theatre, London; ''Children's Children'', Almeida, London; ''In the Next Room'' (''The Vibrator Play''), Ustinov Studio, Bath"].  ''[[The Independent]]''. 27 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; And ''[[The Observer]]'' opined that "[Hall's] fantastically enjoyable production of ''Chariots of Fire'' is a triumph of will that is in keeping with the spirit of the story it tells.... This is an unmissable theatrical offering in the year of the London Olympics."&lt;ref&gt;Kellaway, Kate.

Many reviewers commented on the intense, often breathless, physicality of the production. The high-speed running around the perimeter of the auditorium and through the audience reminded some of ''[[Starlight Express]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Coveney|Coveny, Michael]].

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b01hxmwz ''Front Row'']. [[BBC Radio 4]]. 23 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Hitchings]] in ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' deemed the play a "stirring crowd-pleaser" and "a potently realised spectacle", concluding that while "undeniably bombastic fare", "energy and conviction make ''Chariots of Fire'' a satisfying experience."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hitchings|Hitchings, Henry]].

''[[Evening Standard]]''. 23 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Stage]]'', [[Mark Shenton]] echoed other reviews regarding the high-energy, intriguingly staged production. He emphasized in addition that "the meat of the drama" is the "gripping human confrontation being played out at its centre, in which two young men from very different backgrounds ... are drawn into competition with each other but also a bigger one with themselves and what truly matters to each." Shenton concluded that the play "succeeds on its own terms to provide what is sure to be a huge popular theatrical success."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Shenton|Shenton, Mark]].

The '''Courir de Mardi Gras''' ({{IPA-all|kuɾiɾ d maɾdi ɡɾa|Louisiana French pronunciation:}} {{IPA-fr|kuʁiʁ də maʁdi ɡʁa}}) is a traditional [[Mardi Gras]] event held in many [[Cajun]] communities of south [[Louisiana]] on the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]]. Courir de Mardi Gras is [[Cajun French]] for "Fat Tuesday Run". The rural Mardi Gras celebration is based on early begging rituals, similar to those still celebrated by [[mummer]]s, [[Wassailing|wassailer]]s and celebrants of [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name=ANCELET&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitaine, voyage ton flag : The Traditional Cajun Country Mardi Gras| author = [[Barry Jean Ancelet]] |publisher=Center for Louisiana Studies, University of Southwestern Louisiana| date=1989 |isbn=0-940984-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mardi Gras is the celebration of the final day before [[Lent]], celebrants drink and eat heavily, and also dress in specialized costumes, ostensibly to protect their identities. Popular practices include wearing masks, [[capuchon]]s, and costumes, overturning social conventions, dancing, drinking alcohol, begging, feasting, whipping. Because of violent activities associated with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], Louisiana has a state law prohibiting the wearing of hoods and masks in public. Mardi Gras is one of the few occasions when exceptions are allowed, as are Halloween celebrations and religious observances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/law.aspx?d=78402|title=RS 14:313|accessdate =2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[HBO]] series (the crime drama [[True Detective (TV series)|''True Detective'']] and the post [[Hurricane Katrina]] themed [[Treme (TV series)|''Treme'']]) make reference to the tradition.&lt;ref name=PEOPLE&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20793232,00.html | title= Courir de Mardi Gras: The Strangest Tradition You've Never Heard Of| author= Heigl, Alex |publisher = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date= 2014-03-04 | accessdate= 2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Medieval peasant meal.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Medieval French peasants enjoying a meal]]
[[Barry Jean Ancelet]], Cajun historian and head of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] Folklore Department, has explained the origin of the ''Courir'' as being in rural medieval France:

{{quote|In a nutshell, the country Mardi Gras comes from the way Mardi Gras was celebrated in France in the rural section as opposed to the urban carnival. It’s an early springtime renewal and is essentially a way for communities to celebrate and find themselves|''Barry Ancelet''&lt;ref name=DEEPSOUTH/&gt;}}

These origins are in the customs of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[medieval Europe]], specifically the ''fête de la quémande'' ("feast of begging") of [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]].&lt;ref name = ANCELET/&gt; During the ''fête'', which was a time when begging from house to house was a socially acceptable behavior, disguised revelers would go through the countryside visiting households and performing for offerings. This is similar to other contemporary traditional European customs such as [[Mummers Play|mumming]] and [[wassailing]] which usually occur around [[Christmas]], New Year's, and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. These traditions originated in a time when most of the land and money was held by the upper classes. The poor, at the end of long winters and short on food, would gather in groups and make their way from castle to manor house to beg for food from the wealthy, dancing and singing in return for the generosity of the nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mardi Gras: a Cajun country celebration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQjbSNHQFwQC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=f%C3%AAte+de+la+qu%C3%A9mande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m93nDyYzPX&amp;sig=WAcqq1WSH1BCR0ku6WeFtzS_EVQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X114TbP7IPGD0QGs0-znAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first1=Diane|last1=Hoyt-Goldsmith|first2=Lawrence|last2=Migdale|publisher=Holiday House|date=September 1995|page=11|isbn=978-0-8234-1184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; French medieval [[carnival]] celebrations also featured contests and races, which may be the origins of the chicken chase associated with the ''courir''.&lt;ref name=VIRTUALMUSEUM&gt;{{cite web|title=Courir du Mardi Gras|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/lsm/page4.html|publisher=Canadian Heritage Information Network|accessdate=2010-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129192534/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/lsm/page4.html|archive-date=2010-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the traditional runs have whipping and [[Penance|penitinece]] as part of their traditions. These traditions are traced to the Medieval [[Flagellant]]s, who would hold processions through the streets whipping themselves and sometimes onlookers to beat the sin out of them.&lt;ref name=MGGUMBOZYDECO/&gt; Other of the traditions associated with the ''courir'' are derived from the folk traditions of Pre-Christian [[Celts|Celtic Europe]] and are associated with fertility and renewal. Examples include the use of the [[burlap]] whip and the tune on which the ''Chanson de Mardi Gras'' are based, both of which are traced back to [[Brittany]], a Celtic enclave on the Northwestern French coast near where the original settlers of [[Acadia]] were from.&lt;ref name=MGGUMBOZYDECO&gt;{{cite book|title=Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture|first1=Marcia G.|last1=Gaudet|first2=James C.|last2=McDonald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqEY6o7KDqEC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=f%C3%AAte+de+la+qu%C3%A9mande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yy2FBZ8XqZ&amp;sig=csGub5Xqa9snqMKaA9g0B2suOnE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uu54TbrAIqOI0QGhq7nRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|date=2003-04-15|isbn=978-1-57806-530-1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RomerChanson/&gt; These traditions were carried to North America by European immigrants during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name=VIRTUALMUSEUM/&gt; In the mid to late 18th century when the [[Acadian]] settlers of the [[Canadian Maritimes]] were [[Expulsion of the Acadians|forcibly deported by the English]], many made their way to South Louisiana, settling what would become known as the [[Acadiana]] region. The [[Cajun]]s, as they would become known to the rest of the world, have held on to many of their traditional customs, including their language ([[Acadian French]] became [[Cajun French]]), [[Cajun music|music]], [[Cajun dance|dances]] and religious festivals such as the ''courir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jmeaux/cajun.html|title=Cajun Country|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This determination to hold on to their religious customs and faith has been a major factor in creating the atmosphere that has allowed for the celebration of life, or "la joie de vivre," that is so characteristic of Cajun life and culture in South Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/Cajuns-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html|title=Cajuns - Religion and Expressive Culture|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern revival===
Although the tradition never died out, during the 1930s and 1940s it had begun to fade away, especially during the [[World War II]] era as many of the young men who participated were away serving in the armed forces. During the late 1940s and early 1950s the tradition began to be revived and in the 1960s got a major boost with the "Cajun renaissance", a grass roots effort to promote the unique local food, culture, music and language of the area. In 1993, documentary filmmaker Pat Mire chronicled the tradition with his film ''Dance for a Chicken: The Cajun Mardi Gras''.&lt;ref name=PATMIRE&gt;{{ cite web | title = Dance for a Chicken: The Cajun Mardi Gras|author=Mire, Pat|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/lt/articles_essays/creole_art_dance_chicken.html | publisher = Louisianafolklife.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery of the event is represented in work by local artists such as [[Chuck Broussard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url= http://www.myneworleans.com/Louisiana-Life/May-June-2009/Chuck-Broussard/ |title = Chuck Broussard : Art on the Acadian Prairie | newspaper=Louisiana Life Magazine |date =May 2009 | author= Kemp, John R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Pavy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthurrogergallery.com/exhibition/2005-francis-x-pavy/|title=Arthur Roger Gallery : Francis X.

The increased popularity of Cajun music and culture has also led to more nonlocal attention for the event. In 2011 the [[NPR]] show Snap Judgement did a series of interviews at one event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://snapjudgment.org/courir-de-mardi-gras|title=Courir de Mardi Gras|author=Daniels, Rita|publisher=Snap Judgment Studios|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  the courir was used in a story line by [[David Simon]] for his [[HBO]] series ''[[Treme (TV series)|Treme]]''.&lt;ref name=NOLA.COMTREME&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/treme-hbo/index.ssf/2011/06/hbos_treme_explained_carnival.html#incart_mce|title=HBO's 'Treme' explained: 'Carnival Time|author= Dave Walker|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOLA.COMTREME2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/treme-hbo/index.ssf/2011/06/cajun_mardi_gras_explained_wil.html|title=Cajun Mardi Gras explained: Wilson Savoy on the costumes, music, masks| author= Dave Walker|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVCLUBTREME&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/carnival-time,56913/ |title=Carnival Time|publisher=[[The A.V.

==Traditions==
[[File:Courir run 2010 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chasing a chicken through a muddy field]]
People escape from ordinary life through the alcohol and the roles they portray in costume.&lt;ref name=RURALACADIANA/&gt; In the early morning the riders or runners or ''Mardi Gras'' (as the troop and its individual members are known)&lt;ref name=CAJUNMASK&gt;{{cite book|title=Cajun Mardi Gras masks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAaRvSJaVcEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=basile+courir+de+mardi+gras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FQKE_TnBKY&amp;sig=xW1vsYjwk_zGDUBuB9P2_Oy9Unc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ITd4Tdr7G6Hi0gGI7vnuBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=basile%20courir%20de%20mardi%20gras&amp;f=false|first1=Carl|last1=Lindahl|first2=Carolyn|last2=Ware|publisher=Univ Press of Mississippi|date=June 1997|isbn=978-0-87805-969-0|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather in a central meeting place. As they gather, ''Le Capitaine'' (the leader of the Mardi Gras) and his co-capitaines explain the rules and traditions that must be followed. The Capitaine usually rides on horseback, wears a cape and carries a small flag. After he organizes the troop, the bands begin to play and he leads them on the route. Traditions vary in each town with the way it is carried out. Some towns have people on horse back, some on trailers and some on foot, and others use a variation of all three methods.&lt;ref name=WHATISCOURIR&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.almostcajun.com/almostcajun/WhatIs.cfm | title=What is Courir de Mardi Gras? | accessdate=2010-02-18 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225200228/http://www.almostcajun.com/almostcajun/WhatIs.cfm | archivedate=2009-02-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Capitaine is the first to approach the houses along the route, to ask permission to enter onto their property. At this point, in the spirit of frivolity, individual ''Mardi Gras'' will attempt to sneak onto the property. They are held in check by the Capitaines, who sometimes brandish a plaited [[burlap]] whip.&lt;ref name=BURLAPWHIP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/FOLKLIFEimagebase/FLImagesListing.asp?Page=142|title=Tee Mamou Mardi Gras Whip|publisher=Louisiana Division of the Arts,|author=Carolyn Ware|accessdate=2011-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927071906/http://www.louisianafolklife.org/FOLKLIFEimagebase/FLImagesListing.asp?Page=142|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whips are designed to be flexible and not to inflict any serious damage onto their victims, but do produce a loud noise for the edification of onlookers. Participants claim one has not fully participated until one has been whipped.&lt;ref name=BURLAPWHIP/&gt; Once they are on the property, the revelers play a variety of pranks on the farmers and beg for food&lt;ref name=RURALACADIANA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/mardmain.htm |title=Mardi Gras in Rural Acadiana |accessdate=2010-02-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the communal [[gumbo]] that lies at the end of the route. A prize ingredient is a live [[chicken]], which is usually thrown into the air for the drunken ''Mardi Gras'' to chase through the muddy yards and fields.&lt;ref name=WHATISCOURIR/&gt;

===La Chanson de Mardi Gras===
The Mardi Gras song, known in the local [[Cajun French]] as "La Danse de Mardi Gras" and "La Vieille Chanson de Mardi Gras",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cajun Mardi Gras Celebrations|url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/northamerican/p/CajunMardiGras.htm|access-date=2012-01-06|author=Megan Romer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a traditional tune sung by the participants, although the exact lyrics vary greatly from town to town. The melody of the traditional folk song is similar to melodies of the [[Breton people|Bretons]] from the northern coast of France.&lt;ref name=RomerChanson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/northamerican/a/CajunMardiGrasSong.htm|title=The Cajun Mardi Gras Song|last=Romer|first=Megan|access-date=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune is played in a minor mode not generally found in other [[Cajun music]].&lt;ref name=BLUES4NOLA&gt;{{cite book|title=Blues for New Orleans: Mardi Gras and America's Creole soul|author1=[[Roger D.

And the same song in English:

===Costumes===
Many of the traditional costumes are derivatives of the costumes worn in early rural [[France]] during the same celebration.&lt;ref name=RURALACADIANA/&gt; The costumes not only conceal the identities of the participants, but also allow them to parody authority figures and society. Role reversals can be employed such men dressing up like women or the rich to pose as the poor.&lt;ref name=DEEPSOUTH&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Deep South|url=http://www.deepsouthmag.com/?page_id=3023|title=Courir de Mardi Gras|first=Erin Z.|last=Bass|publisher=|date=2011-02-04|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costumes also directly mock the [[nobility]], the [[clergy]] and the educated; celebrants wear [[mitre|miter]] hats, [[mortarboard]]s and [[capuchon]]s,&lt;ref name=RURALACADIANA/&gt; which were initially designed to mock the [[hennin|tall pointy hats]] worn by noble women. These hats are still worn, primarily by men. The name "capuchon" comes from the same root word, "cappa" in Latin, meaning a cape or hood, that gives us "cap" in English and "chapeau" in French. [[Chaperon (headgear)]] describes the development of the word. The hats are vibrantly decorated to match (or intentionally mis-match) the colorful Mardi Gras costumes that they accompany. The capuchons worn by Mardi Gras celebrants are completely unrelated to the pointy hats worn by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), founded after the [[American Civil War]], and, in fact, predate the KKK costumes by several hundred years.

Originally the costumes were made from old work clothes decorated with cloth remnants and pieces of feed sack material, as many of the participants could not afford to buy material strictly for the event. This led to a patchwork style that has become associated with the costuming of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.knowla.org/entry.php?rec=1306 |title = Georgie and Allen Manuel |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Louisiana| author= Farris, Teresa Parker| publisher= Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shirts and pants of the costume are made by sewing together various pieces of cloth in a patchwork style. The strips of cloth are cut into fringing, and are sewn onto the sleeves, up and down the legs, and on the capuchon.&lt;ref name=WHATISCOURIR/&gt; The end effect is a riot of color and pattern. These costumes are also believed to have originated in [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]].&lt;ref name=WHATISCOURIR/&gt; The masks are made by taking ordinary wire mesh [[window screen]] and attaching large protruding noses and painting on features such as eyes and mouths. The masks are almost see through, but usually not enough to discern the wearer's identity. Many costumes and masks include animal features like beaks, feathers, hair, fur or tails.&lt;ref name=DEEPSOUTH/&gt;

==Notable Courir celebrations==
Each community in the [[Acadiana]] area celebrates their take on the traditional ''Courir de Mardi Gras''. Although there are many variations, most still practice the time honored tradition with ''Le Capitaine'' leading masked revelers on horseback to gather ingredients for making the communal gumbo. A few notable examples have gained attention as vital parts of the local Cajun culture.

===Basile===
In [[Basile, Louisiana|Basile]] the Courir was suspended during [[World War II]], but was re-established during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=BASILECOURIR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/basimard.htm|title=Basile Courir|accessdate=2010-02-18}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A provision allowing women to be a part of the Courir has been in place since the 1980s, and they are also permitted to serve as capitaines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/cjn_wom_mg.html |title=Cajun Women and the Country Mardi Gras tradition|accessdate =2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Basile ''Courir de Mardi Gras'' have a tradition of begging for nickels (called ''cinq sous''). The participants come up to bystanders with an open palm in the traditional begging gesture, and if that does not work, they will try to dig into the pockets or clothes of the bystanders as a prank in an attempt to find the nickels.&lt;ref name=BASILECOURIR/&gt;

===Choupic===
The rural Mardi Gras in [[Choupic, Louisiana|Choupic]] involves a ritual chasing and [[flogging]] with [[willow tree]] [[branches]].&lt;ref name=CHOUPICCOURIR&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/lt/articles_essays/main_misc_mardi_in_choupic.html|chapter=Neither Spared nor Spoiled: The Mardi Gras Chase in Choupic, Louisiana|title=Louisiana Folklore Miscellany|publisher=Louisiana Folklore Society|year=1996|pages=17–28|volume=6|first=Madeleine Domangue|last=Cagle|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young, unmarried men from sixteen or seventeen years old up into their twenties secretly organize the run each year, and they do not disclose their participation in the run to anyone. Once a man is married, he voluntarily stops his participation in the Mardi Gras run. Traditionally, the Mardis Gras were on foot, but today some adaptations have been made, such as the use of pickup trucks and the use of [[all-terrain vehicle|three-wheelers]] by some participants. The Mardis Gras meet early Mardi Gras morning at Possum Square and then climb into the back of a few pickup trucks to hide. The pickup trucks carry the Mardis Gras from one residential section to another where they chase the children of the town, and make them recite [[Catholic]] prayers before giving them their pre-Lenten flogging with willow tree branches or sometimes with the flexible end of a [[fishing pole]]. The Choupic courir de Mardi Gras differs from other courirs in that it does not involve the chasing of chickens nor ritual begging nor the use of horses as a means of transportation.

===Church Point===
[[File:Winners of Children's Courir de Mardi Gras in Church Point, Louisiana - 2017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|2017 Children's Courir de Mardi Gras in Church Point]]
In [[Church Point, Louisiana|Church Point]] the rural Mardi Gras is basically the same as it was in the old days of the early settlers. In 1961 Elton Richard formally organized the event, which until then had been individual, independent groups of riders. Only men are permitted to participate in the run, and all ''Mardi Gras'' must be fully masked and costumed. The Capitaine holds his position as leader for year after year, until he decides to relinquish it. He appoints his co-capitaines who, like himself, must not be masked. The ''Chanson de Mardi Gras'' in Church Point has its own unique lyrics.&lt;ref name=CPMG&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchpointmardigras.com/history.html|title=Church Point Courir de Mardi Gras|accessdate =2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church Point Courir is held on the Sunday before Mardi Gras, a consequence of the formal organization in 1961. Elton Richard and Senator Paul Tate of Mamou flipped a coin to see who would have their official courir on Mardi Gras Day. Mamou won and as a result the Church Point Mardi Gras is on Sunday.&lt;ref name=CPMG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchpoint-la.com/mardigras.html|title=COURIR DE MARDI GRAS|publisher=Town of Church Point|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianarambles.com/news/archives/235/|first=Ian|last=McNulty|title=When Sunday is Tuesday: a Cajun Mardi Gras Alternative|publisher=Louisiana Rambles|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=DG&amp;Dato=20110307&amp;Kategori=NEWS01&amp;Lopenr=103070802&amp;Ref=PH|author=Dwayne Fatherree|title=Church Point Courir du Mardi Gras|accessdate=2011-03-10|publisher=[[Gannett Company]], www.dailyworld.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729194720/http://www.dailyworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Avis=DG&amp;Dato=20110307&amp;Kategori=NEWS01&amp;Lopenr=103070802&amp;Ref=PH|archivedate=2012-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duralde===
In [[Duralde, Louisiana|Duralde]], an unincorporated village between the towns of Mamou and Basile on the southwestern prairies of Louisiana, is one of the Creole Mardi Gras'. Participants at times wear "white face", a way that the Mardi Gras runners dress as "the other" and overturn social conventions and the world for a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/FOLKLIFEimagebase/FLImagesListing.asp?Page=665|title=Duralde Creole Mardi Gras, 1985|publisher=Louisiana Division of the Arts|accessdate=2011-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727042052/http://www.louisianafolklife.org/FOLKLIFEimagebase/FLImagesListing.asp?Page=665|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elton===
[[Elton, Louisiana]] is a small town in [[Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana]] 15 miles west of Eunice on [[U.S. Route 190]]. Although it was defunct for a long time, the Elton courir was revived in the mid-1990s. It follows the same route and its participants sing the same local variation of the Chanson as the courir in 1925. The ride starts at sunrise just to the north of town and goes through the [[Coushatta Indian Reservation]] and then heads south back toward Elton. Like many of the traditional Courirs the ride is an all-male affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/elton.htm |title=Elton Courir de Mardi Gras |accessdate=2010-02-19 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eunice===
In [[Eunice, Louisiana|Eunice]] the celebration dates from when the town was first established in the late 19th century. It was abandoned for a short time during [[World War II]] when many of the local young men were in the army, but was restarted in 1946. The roughly 2000 participants, both male and female, assemble at the National Guard Armory at the corner of South 9th Street and Maple Avenue at 6 a.m., and start the run 8 a.m.&lt;ref name=CITYOFEUNICE&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eunice-la.com/festivals.html|title=City of Eunice, La - Area Festivals:Eunice Courir De Mardi Gras|publisher=City of Eunice, La.|accessdate=2010-02-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323144356/http://www.eunice-la.com/festivals.html|archivedate=2010-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route is {{convert|13|mi|km}} long. They stop at farms along the route and beg for gumbo ingredients and call out "Cinq-sous pour les Mardi Gras!" or "Nickels for the Mardi Gras'!" If ingredients or money are given, they thank the givers of charity with a dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where to Be in 30 Days: Experience an Authentic Cajun Mardi Gras|publisher=Fodors|first=Molly|last=Moker|date=2010-01-20|accessdate=2011-03-10|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/story_3834.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. the revelers return to town for a parade along Second Street. In 1997 a new addition was added to the festivities, the baking of the world's largest [[king cake]].&lt;ref name=CITYOFEUNICE/&gt;

===Gheens===
[[Gheens, Louisiana|Gheens]] is located between [[Raceland, Louisiana|Raceland]] and [[Lockport, Louisiana]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} from New Orleans. Every year during their Cajun Mardi Gras Chase 20,000 people flock to the town of less than 1000 people for the event. Unlike other Cajun Mardi Gras' celebrations, the Gheens event features teen-aged boys and men dressed as [[ghoul]]s riding in pickup trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvmc.net/movie.jsp?movie_id=2290|title=CVMC: Pardon! Pardon! The Cajun Mardi Gras Chase|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the morning parades the group meets behind the local church, where costumes are donned and the ground rules are laid out by the veteran runners to the newly initiated. Each of the newcomers must line up and be given a swat by each of the veterans with the yard long willow branches so they know how bad the switches can hurt if over used. The runners are given bells to pin on their clothing. They then load up into their trucks and attack the town with their willow switches, searching for children.&lt;ref name=MGGUMBOZYDECO/&gt; They chase the children to "beat the sinful stuff out of them so they can be clean for the [[lent]]". Their young victims have the choice to either fall to their knees in a penitent position and say "Pardon! Pardon!" or make the ''Mardi Gras'' chase them, often taunting and daring them to catch and beat them more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabasco.com/arts_pavilion/louisiana_artist/syndey_byrd.cfm|title=PepperFest:Courir de Mardi Gras|publisher=McIlhenny Company|accessdate=2011-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716182722/http://www.tabasco.com/arts_pavilion/louisiana_artist/syndey_byrd.cfm|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mamou===
[[File:Courir de Mardi Gras, Mamou.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mamou courir in the late 1990s]]
In [[Evangeline Parish, Louisiana|Evangeline Parish]], the [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]] celebration starts with a street dance held the Monday evening before Mardi Gras, with bands such as [[Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys]] performing. A crowd favorite is the Mamou variation of the ''Chanson de Mardi Gras''. The next day a street party begins, in anticipation of the Courir, who have been riding through the countryside collecting ingredients for the evening gumbo. The Mamou Courir abides by the older traditions, with the Capitaines unmasked and all other revelers masked in the all-male troupe.&lt;ref name=TRIBUNE&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/chi-mardijan13,0,3555985.story | title= Cajun Mardi Gras : And they're off... on the run for the chickens| newspaper=Chicago Tribune | author= Rozas, Angela |date=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are accompanied by a wagon for the musicians and trailers for participants who do not have horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/mammardi.htm|title=Mardi Gras in Mamou|accessdate=2010-02-18}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was suspended twice in its history, during the American Civil War and during World War Two.&lt;ref name=TRIBUNE/&gt; By the mid-1940s the ''courir'' tradition in Mamou had declined but was revived by Alfred "Fred" Tate, Revon Reed, and Paul Tate, proprietors of the then newly opened "[[Fred's Lounge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|author= Gerald E.

===Soileau===
The run in [[Soileau, Louisiana]] is one of the few [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] ''Courir de Mardi Gras''  in southwest Louisiana, and is thought to be just as old as the Cajun versions. The rural community of Soileau is located to the west of [[Duralde, Louisiana|Duralde]] in [[Allen Parish, Louisiana]] not far from the [[Evangeline Parish, Louisiana]] line. They hold their run on the Monday before Mardi Gras, with its starting point at Andrew Cezar's sulky racing track. From there they head down [[Louisiana Highway 104]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.lsue.edu/acadgate/soileaumardi.htm|title=Mardi Gras in Soileau|accessdate=2010-02-19}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Cameron===
[[File:South Cameron Mardi Gras 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|Two Mardi Gras "stealing" a child's bicycle at the South Cameron Courir]]
In [[Creole, Louisiana|Creole]], a small town in southern [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Mardi Gras celebrations had been defunct for over three decades. This region of [[Southwest Louisiana]] has been plagued by multiple [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] throughout the years, including total destruction by Hurricanes [[Hurricane Audrey|Audrey]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]], and [[Hurricane Ike|Ike]]. As a result, the area has a very small, close-knit, and self-reliant population. The courir was revived in 2014 by a group of Cameron Parish natives. The group mainly consisted of young men who were [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] war veterans. Some were displaced by the hurricanes, living in different parts of the state, and looking to bring comradery and tradition back to their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kplctv.com/story/24795855/cameron-community-host-first-ever-mardi-gras-chicken-run|title=Cameron community hosts first ever Mardi Gras chicken run|accessdate =2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mardi Gras ride throughout the countryside in cattle trailers pulled by pickup trucks. Men and women ride together. The Mardi Gras stop at multiple houses and business in and around the town of Creole to dance, drink, play tricks, chase chickens, and gather ingredients for their communal gumbo that night. They wear traditional Cajun Mardi Gras costumes as well as modern variations. The two to three unmasked Capitaines regulate with burlap whips. A [[Fais do-do]] follows the gumbo. This courir is held two weekends before Mardi Gras day, however, dates are subject to change from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/creolechickenrun|title=South Cameron Courir de Mardi Gras|accessdate =2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tee Mamou-Iota===
The longstanding tradition of the ''courir'' in the small community of [[Tee Mamou, Louisiana|Tee Mamou]] had waned by the late 1960s when new capitane was instrumental in preserving the tradition. An all women's group was established a few years later. The women's group does their run on Saturday before Mardi Gras and the men's run is on Mardi Gras day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerald Frugé : Cajun Mardi Gras Capitaine|url=http://louisianafolklife.nsula.edu/artist-biographies/profiles/84|accessdate=2011-06-09|publisher=[[Northwestern State University|Northwestern State University of Louisiana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitane and co-capitanes of Tee Mamou use a special variation of the burlap whip associated with the courir.&lt;ref name=BURLAPWHIP/&gt; The route of the courir ends in the nearby community of [[Iota, Louisiana]]. Iota has an organized event, with [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] bands playing on the main stage throughout Mardi Gras day. The highlight of the day is the arrival of the Tee Mamou ''courirs'' riding into the town in a wagon after the route through the country. The courir then gathers on the main stage with the capitaine to sing their version of the ''Chanson de Mardi Gras''. Once this task is completed, the Mardi Gras descend on the downtown area dancing and begging for loose change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iotamardigras.com/main.html|title=Tee Mamou-Iota Mardi Gras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18455">The first African drums were heard in Cuba, since the 16th century, only during the celebration of certain feasts, such as the Día de Reyes (Three Kings Day) and Carnestolendas or Carnival, because their use was restricted to some mutual aid societies, called "Cabildos de nación", where the slaves and their descendants were allowed to gather and practice their cultural and religious traditions.
 
The music and dance of the '''Cuban Carnival''' was always very popular in Cuba, and has exerted an important influence in other genres of the Cuban music, such as the "[[Conga]] de Salón" and the "Mozambique" rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando :Los sonidos de la música cubana. Evolución de los formatos instrumentales en Cuba, p. 56. https://www.academia.edu/18302881/Los_sonidos_de_la_m%C3%BAsica_cubana._Evoluci%C3%B3n_de_los_formatos_instrumentales_en_Cuba&lt;/ref&gt; the Cuban [[Conga]] has transcended the national fronteers to become one of the most famous and cherished genres of the Cuban music outside the country, like the well known [[Congas]] de Salón from the late 1930s and early 1940s Bim Bam Bum, from Rafael Hernández and Uno, dos y tres, from Rafael Ortiz, which at a later time was known in English as: One, two, three, Kick!&lt;ref&gt;Torres, George: Encyclopedia of Latin American Music. https://books.google.com/books?id=MX5BXxjwV9cC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Desi+Arnaz+un+dos+[[Conga]]&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jTwJOiaMlm&amp;sig=XkDK7FeiWGDmHe5ZY88_BvvPEm4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAmoVChMI8uHd0f_AyAIVyCYeCh2HWg3t#v=onepage&amp;q=Desi%20Arnaz%20un%20dos%20[[Conga]]&amp;f=false. Consultado: 10-13-15&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, in 1985, the famous [[Conga]] from the Cuban-American group Miami Sound Machine, triggered a true frenzy in the US and all around the world. Its success is only comparable to the popularity of the 1930s [[Conga]] de Salón or the [[Conga]] lines of Desi Arnaz during the 1950s.

==From the 16th to the 18th century==

The miscegenation between blacks and whites in Cuba began with the arrival to the Island of the first slave African women around 1550&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Escobio, Fernando: Raíces de la nacionalidad cubana, Miami, Florida, 1992, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; but their cultures remained relatively independent one from the other for hundreds of years, because the slaves didn’t have access to their Masters cultural traditions, and the Spanish people perceived the African culture as barbaric and primitive. The following description of a black slave's feast, included in a story from the "costumbrista" writer Francisco Baralt, evidence the negative image that the Spanish had toward the cultural manifestations of the Africans. 
According to Baralt: "those (African) dances have such a weird aspect, because of the place, the time and the individuals that perform them, that even those who observe them every day receive an impression difficult to express: we don’t know if it is curiosity or disgust, if it repels or attract its primitive and savage character, that seem to put between this feasts and those of the white men the same distance that exists between the deluge and our times."&lt;ref&gt;Baralt, Francisco: Escenas campestres. Baile de los negros. Costumbristas cubanos del siglo XIX, Selección, prólogo, cronología y bibliografía Salvador Bueno, Consultado: Agosto 25, 2010, http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/costumbristas-cubanos-del-siglo-xix--2/html/fef805c0-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The music from the African people that arrived to Cuba from Spain, or directly from Africa, was only allowed since the beginning of Colonial times, within certain mutual aid societies and religious fraternities which foundation dates from the 16th century. According to David H. Brown, those societies, called Cabildos, "provided aid in case of disease or death, celebrated masses for the souls of the death, collected funds for the liberation from slavery of its members, regularly organized dances and recreational activities during Sundays and Holidays, and sponsored masses, processions and Carnival dances (now called "comparsas") around the annual cycle of Catholic festivals"&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David H.: Santería enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabildos organized big street processions during Sundays, the celebration of Saints and some important Holidays, where their leaders and companions dressed with clothes appropriate for the royalty and high rank military, while those who participated in the processions and dances wear "feathered head pieces and African masks with horns and vegetal ornaments." The Three Kings Day, celebrated in January 6, during the Epiphany, was the most important of those festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David H.: Santería enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important feast where the Cabildos participated was celebrated during the three days before "Ash Wednesday", which at a later time became the Carnestolendas or Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;Feliú, Virtudes: La Fiesta. Fiestas populares tradicionales de Cuba. Instituto Andino de Artes Populares, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1697, the Italian Gemeli Careri mentioned those celebrations: "… on Sunday, February 9th, the black and mulatoes, with picturesque apparels, formed  a gathering to have fun at the Carnival." According to Virtudes Feliú: "… This is the most ancient information about the traditional Havanese "comparsas", and it makes clear that, indeed, the blacks and mulatoes enjoyed themselves at the Carnestolendas that Hispanics and their descendants celebrated, wearing unusual clothes related to those feasts in a gathering that Careri called a "congregation", most probable because the term "comparsa" was not yet in use."&lt;ref&gt;Feliú, Virtudes: La Fiesta. Fiestas populares tradicionales de Cuba. Instituto Andino de Artes Populares, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can assume that the musical instruments utilized in the old Cabildos were the African membranophones that were not utilized in the ritual celebrations, such as the bembé and yuka drums. In reference to the difference between the ritual African drums, that should only be played in religious ceremonies, and the secular drums, that may actually be played in public, Argelier León remarks: 
"Differently from the ritual drums batá and iyesá, which were tuned with a tensor system in N…, the bembé drums could be tuned by applying heat, because they didn’t possess the ritual character of the consecrated drums."

León also says that "…The bembé drums are varied, from those of a big size – more than a meter tall and of a cylindrical shape – to small drums made from containers. In certains areas of Cuba, the bembé drums are made from palm tree trunks, with just one nailed drumhead, and little more than half a meter tall…"&lt;ref&gt;León, Argeliers: Del canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educación. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
The yuka ensemble was composed by three drums made from raw wooden trunks (called in size order: caja, mula and cachimbo) with hide drum-heads nailed to the body. They also utilized a hollow bambu piece beaten with two bamboo sticks called "guagua’’ or "catá"; and also beating over the drum side.&lt;ref&gt;León, ArgeliDel canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educación. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to the drums utilized by the Africans in their feasts, the "costumbrista" author Francisco Baralt wrote around 1846: "The only instrument they use in these feasts is a type of drum made from one wooden piece of about two to four feet long. With an irregular ..and a more or less conical or cylindrical shape. It was hollowwed up to half of its size, and usually covered over its larger side with a raw goat hide."&lt;ref&gt;Baralt, Francisco: Escenas Campestres, Baile de los negros. http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/costumbristas-cubanos-del-siglo-xix--2/html/fef805c0-82b1-11df-acc7-002185ce6064_7.htm. Consultado 12-23-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Día de Reyes 1855.jpg|thumb|600px|right| Three Kings Day. Print by Federico Miahle, 1855.]]

These descriptions also coincide with the visual representations of the Carnivals, during the 19th century, by artists such as Víctor Patricio de Landaluze and Federico Miahle; where frequently appear some cylindrical drums with a nailed hide on the top, performed between the legs of the standing drummer, in a very similar way as the yuka drums are played even today. In numerous prints of Landaluze and Miahle about the Carnival festivities, we can observe some musical instruments, like drums and horns, that were utilized at that time. In a famous Miahle print from 1855, called Three Kings Days, we can see a drummer to the left side, playing a cylindric drum between his legs, and another man at the back, with a hat, blowing a curved horn.

==The 19th century==

According with David H. Brown: "After 1792, when the Cabildos were relegated to the "extramuros" zone of the city, the Carnival processions came out of their locations and went through the entrances toward the fortified "intramuros" area. They marched through the residential and commercial streets of Mercaderes, Obispo and O’Reilly until they reached the central Plaza de Armas, the site of the Captain General of the Island Palace. Inside the Palace patio, as in other stops along the way, the procession´s members represented dances, asked for and received gifts (aguinaldos), and after that, they returned to their homes."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David H.: Santería enthroned, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 2003, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following story from 1866, the author mentions the characteristic sounds as well as the instruments that were performed by those participants in the procession of a Three Kings Day "comparsa" in Havana:

"Innumerable groups of black Africans "comparsas" went along through every street of the Capital city. The hurly-burly is immense and its aspect horrifying… The great noise created by all the drums, horns and whistles deafen the passers-by everywhere; in a corner a Yoruba king surrounded by his court of blacks, here a Gangá, another one there from a Carabalí nation… all of them, kings for a day, singing in a monotonous and unpleasant drone in their African languages."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997,  p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 20th century==

At the beginning of the Independence war, in 1895, the colonial authorities banned all the Carnival activities indefinitely, and this prohibition stayed in effect until the conclusion of the hostilities, at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Mayor of Havana, Carlos de La Torre, reinstate the Carnival festivities officially in 1902. The massive participation of a population of African origin in the Independence war resulted in a greater integration of the Afro-Cubans in social activities, and facilitated a more important participation of this segment of the population in the Carnival during the first years of the Republic. For the first time blacks were allowed to play their music and dances along with the "comparsas" of white people, such as El Alacrán, the Model T cars covered by flower arrangements and the "carrozas" (floats).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997,  p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1902, the municipal authorities began again to strictly regulate the organization of the Carnival processions, showing a preference for the ornamented cars, the floats, the military bands, and the presentation of the King and the Queen, in detriment of the manifestation of Afro-Cuban origin, such as the "comparsa" and the [[Conga]], and around 1916, the suppression of the "comparsa" groups in Havana was almost total.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997,  p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Because during the period from the 1900s and 1910s, the Carnival activities have attracted thousands of foreign visitors to the Capital each spring, finally in 1937, the authorities of the city decided to reauthorize the "comparsas" in the Carnival "paseos" (strolls).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997,  p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the "comparsas" began to permanently participate in the Havanese Carnivals, parading through the Paseo del Prado with distinctive choreographies, dances and songs. Those groups included: El Alacrán, from the Cerro neighborhood, Los Marqueses from Atarés, Las Boyeras from Los Sitios, Los Dandys from Belén, La Sultana from Colón, Las Jardineras from Jesús María, Los Componedoras de Batea from Cayo Hueso, El Príncipe del Raj from Marte, las Mexicanas from Dragones, Los Moros Azules from Guanabacoa, El Barracón from Pueblo Nuevo and Los Guaracheros from Regla.

Celebrados en el mes de Julio, Los Carnavales de Santiago de Cuba y otros pueblos orientales poseían sus propias características. En vez de encontrarse reducidas a ciertas calles y plazas como en la capital, las comparsas santiagueras se extendían a toda la ciudad y la población participaba más activamente en ellas. El estilo y el carácter de la música y la danza eran también differentes.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after 1959, the Revolutionary authorities changed the celebration of the Carnivals from February and March to July 26. At the beginning, this change was made in order not to interrupt the sugar cane harvest in 1979, but it was kept in place at a later time with the purpose of celebrating the "triumph of socialism." Between 1990 and 1995 isolated presentations were offered, which were associated to political events. Those included some groups that went to the streets in November 1993, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the CDRs (Revolution Defense Committees). Finally, in an attempt to attract a larger number of tourists, the government authorized again a modest Carnival celebration, preceding the celebration of Lent (Cuaresma), instead of in July, when it was previously accustomed.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Robin D.: Nationalizing blackness. University of Pittsburgh Press. Pittsburgh. Pa., 1997,  p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music of the Cuban Carnival==

[[File:Conga123.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Cuban Tumbadora.]]
The Cuban Carnival music ensembles used to be varied, but it is also possible to determine certain patterns in reference to the instrumental groups utilized in Havana and Santiago de Cuba, which differ significantly.

This is how Argeliers León describes the basic instrumental of the Havanese comparsa: "…In other zones of the population still remained other instrumental groups such as those of the comparsas, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a [[Conga]], a tumbadora and a quinto, a snare drum (without the snares), a double cow-bell or "jimagua", a bass drum or two frying pans attached to a wooden box or a board. This equipment may be expanded with two tumbadoras and one or more trumpets.&lt;ref&gt;León, Argeliers: Del canto y del tiempo. Editorial Pueblo y Educación. La Habana, Cuba, 1981, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drum called [[Conga]] or tumbadora, of an evident Bantu origin, is, according to Fernando Ortiz: "… a drum from African origin, made of wooden slabs and iron rings, from approximately a meter long, barrel shape, and opened on one end with only one hide drumhead fixed by nails to the body of the drum…" It was tuned using heat in the past, but currently is tuned with metallic tuning pegs.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tumbadora's diameter are as follows, from treble to bass: requinto (9 to 10 inches), quinto (10 t 11 inches), [[Conga]] (macho or tres-dos) (11 to 12 inches), tumbadora (or hembra) (12 to 13 inches), retumbadora (or mambisa) (14 inches).

In the comparsas and [[Conga]]s of Santiago de Cuba various bimembranophone drums, beaten with drumsticks, are utilized: one requinto, three [[Conga]]s (without any relationship with the Havanese [[Conga]]), which are subdivided in two redoblantes or galletas, and one pilón. They also utilize various membranophone drums (with a conical shape and only one drumhead, played with the palms of the hands) called bocúes. The drums are complemented by three percuted metallic idiophones (made from discarded wheel rims), which are selected considering its sonority.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: El carnaval cubano y su música, p. 11. https://www.academia.edu/19810545/El_Carnaval_Cubano_y_su_m%C3%BAsica&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind instruments are represented by the piercing sound of the corneta china, a double-reed Chinese instrument that was inserted in the Santiago de Cuba [[Conga]]s in 1915.,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Fernández, Rolando:The Chinese community and the corneta china: Two divergent paths in Cuba, Yearbook 20014,  p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; and that always performs the initial call to start the [[Conga]] (arrollar), which is how the dancing style of the [[Conga]] is called, characterized by a peculiar form of rhythmic march, dragging the feet and moving the hips and shoulders along with the music rhythm.

The musical style of the Havanese [[Conga]] is quite different from the [[Conga]] Santiaguera, and maybe the element that mostly differentiate both styles is a peculiar rhythmic accent within the 4/4 meter, which is executed by the Havanese Bass drum or the [[Conga]] (drum) from Santiago, respectively.

In the Havanese style, this accent falls on a syncopated note on the third beat of the measure, configurating a very well known rhythmic pattern (one, two, three, cick).
In the [[Conga]] from Santiago, the stressed beats of the measure are more emphasized, thus inducing a powerful impulse feeling, which incites to move the feet along with the rhythmic pulse. In this case, the drum accent is played between the fourth beat of the previous measure and the first of the following measure.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Ruidíaz, Armando: El carnaval cubano y su música, p. 12-13. https://www.academia.edu/19810545/El_Carnaval_Cubano_y_su_m%C3%BAsica&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Hunter''' (July 21, 1802 – February 2, 1886) was a [[Union Army|Union]] general during the [[American Civil War]]. He achieved fame by his unauthorized 1862 order (immediately rescinded) emancipating slaves in three Southern states, for his leadership of United States troops during the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], and as the president of the military commission trying the conspirators involved with the assassination of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==Early life and education==
Hunter (son of Andrew Hunter &amp; Mary Stockton) was born in [[Troy, New York]],&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;Warner, Ezra J. (1964) ''Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders''. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press. p. 243. {{ISBN|0-8071-0822-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]] (2001). ''Civil War High Commands''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. p. 310. {{ISBN|0-8047-3641-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the cousin of writer-illustrator [[David Hunter Strother]] (who would also serve as a Union Army general) and his maternal grandfather was [[Richard Stockton (1730–1781)|Richard Stockton]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]], in 1822, and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S. Infantry Regiment]]. Records of his military service prior to the Civil War contain significant gaps. From 1828 to 1831, he was stationed on the northwest frontier, at [[Fort Dearborn]] ([[Chicago, Illinois]]), where he met and married Maria Kinzie, the daughter of the city's first permanent white resident, [[John Kinzie]]. He served in the infantry for 11 years, and was appointed [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of the 1st U.S. Dragoons in 1833. He resigned from the Army in July 1836 and moved to Illinois, where he worked as a real estate agent&lt;ref name=Eicher /&gt; or speculator.&lt;ref name=Warner /&gt; He rejoined the Army in November 1841 as a paymaster and was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] in March 1842.&lt;ref name=Eicher /&gt; One source&lt;ref name=Spartacus&gt;[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/USACWhunter.htm David Hunter]. Spartacus Educational Publishers Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; claims that he saw action in the [[Second Seminole War]] (1838–42) and the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48).

In 1860, Hunter was stationed at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], and he began a correspondence with [[Abraham Lincoln]], focusing on Hunter's strong anti-slavery views. This relationship had long-lasting political effects, the first of which was an invitation to ride on Lincoln's inaugural train from [[Springfield, Illinois]], to Washington, D.C., in February 1861. During this duty, Hunter suffered a dislocated collarbone at [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], due to a crowd pressing the president-elect.

==Career==

===American Civil War===
Soon after the firing on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], Hunter was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 6th U.S. Cavalry, but three days later (May 17, 1861), his political connection to the Lincoln administration bore fruit and he was appointed the fourth-ranking [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, commanding a brigade in the Department of Washington. He was wounded in the neck and cheek while commanding a division under [[Irvin McDowell]] at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861. In August, he was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers. He served as a division commander in the Western Army under Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]], and was appointed as commander of the Western Department on November 2, 1861, after Frémont was relieved of command due to his attempt to emancipate the slaves of rebellious slave holders. Hunter did not last long in this important responsibility and within two months was reassigned to the Department of Kansas, a post where there was little chance of getting in trouble. He did not accept his exile gracefully and wrote a series of fulminating protest letters to the president, who finally gave in to his complaints. In March 1862, Hunter was transferred again to command the [[Department of the South]] and the [[X Corps (Union Army)|X Corps]]. 
Hunter served as the president of the [[Court-martial of Fitz John Porter|court-martial]] of Maj. Gen. [[Fitz John Porter]] (convicted for his actions at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], but for which he was exonerated by an 1878 Board of Officers), and on the committee that investigated the loss of [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]] in the [[Maryland Campaign]]. He also served briefly as the Assistant Inspector General of the Department of the Gulf.

====General Order No. 11====
[[File:General Orders No. 7, Ft. Pulaski, GA, US.jpg|right|thumb|Historical marker about General Orders No. 7, erected by the Georgia Historical Society in 2008. Read more on the [http://georgiahistory.com/ghmi_marker_updated/history-of-emancipation-gen-david-hunter-and-general-orders-no-7/ Georgia Historical Society's website.] ]]
Hunter was a strong advocate of arming [[African-Americans|black]] men as soldiers for the Union cause. After the [[Battle of Fort Pulaski]], he began enlisting black soldiers from the occupied districts of South Carolina and formed the first such Union Army regiment, the 1st South Carolina (African Descent),&lt;ref&gt;The famous [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts]] was the first black regiment raised in a Northern state.&lt;/ref&gt; which he was initially ordered to disband, but eventually got approval from Congress for his action. A second controversy was caused by his issuing an order emancipating the slaves in Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida:

{{Quotation|The three States of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, comprising the military department of the south, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it becomes a military necessity to declare them under martial law. This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible; the persons in these three States — Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina— heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared forever free.|Maj. Gen. David Hunter|Department of the South, General Order No. 11, May 9, 1862&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/hunter.htm#HUNTER|first=Maj. Gen. David|last=Hunter|publisher=Department of the South|title=General Order No. 11|date=May 9, 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This order was quickly rescinded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/hunter.htm President Lincoln's Proclamation Overruling Hunter's Emancipation, May 19, 1862]. Freedmen.umd.edu (December 10, 2017). Retrieved on 2018-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt; by President Abraham Lincoln, who was concerned about the political effects that it would have in the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] and who advocated instead a gradual emancipation with compensation for slave holders.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al., pp. 46–48&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite Lincoln's concerns that immediate emancipation in the South might drive some slave-holding Unionists to support the Confederacy, the national mood was quickly moving against slavery, especially within the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al., chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The president and Congress had already enacted several laws during the war to severely restrict the institution, beginning with the [[First Confiscation Act]] in August 1861 &lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al., p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in Lincoln's own [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in September 1862, taking effect January 1, 1863. Concerned Confederate slave holders had worried since before the war started that its eventual goal would become the abolition of slavery and they reacted strongly to the Union effort to emancipate Confederate slaves. [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] issued orders to the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] that Hunter was to be considered a "felon to be executed if captured".&lt;ref name=Spartacus/&gt;

====Controversy over enlistment of ex-slaves====
Undeterred by the president's reluctance and intent on extending American freedom to potential black soldiers, Hunter again flouted orders from the federal government and enlisted ex-slaves as soldiers in South Carolina without permission from the War Department.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al., 56&lt;/ref&gt;  This action incensed border state slave holders, and Kentucky Representative [[Charles A. Wickliffe]] sponsored a resolution demanding a response.

Hunter quickly obliged with a sarcastic and defiant letter on June 23, 1862, in which he delivered a stern reminder to the Congress of his authority as a commanding officer in a war zone:

{{Quotation|. . . I reply that no regiment of "Fugitive Slaves" has been, or is being organized in this Department.  There is, however, a fine regiment of persons whose late masters are "Fugitive Rebels"--men who everywhere fly before the appearance of the National Flag, leaving their servants behind them to shift as best they can for themselves.  . . . So far, indeed, are the loyal persons composing this regiment from seeking to avoid the presence of their late owners, that they are now, one and all, working with remarkable industry to place themselves in a position to go in full and effective pursuit of their fugacious and traitorous proprietors.  . . . the instructions given to Brig. Gen. T. W. Sherman by the Hon. Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, and turned over to me by succession for my guidance,--do distinctly authorize me to employ all loyal persons offering their services in defence of the Union and for the suppression of this Rebellion in any manner I might see fit.  . . . In conclusion I would say it is my hope,--there appearing no possibility of other reinforcements owing to the exigencies of the Campaign in the Peninsula,--to have organized by the end of next Fall, and to be able to present to the Government, from forty eight to fifty thousand of these hardy and devoted soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al, pp. 56–59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While increasingly abolitionist Republicans in Congress were amused by the order, border state pro-slavery politicians such as Wickliffe and [[Robert Mallory]] were not.  Mallory described the scene in Congress following the reading of the order as follows:

{{Quotation|The scene was one of which I think this House should forever be ashamed . . . A spectator in the gallery would have supposed we were witnessing here the performance of a buffoon or of a low farce actor upon the stage . . . The reading was received with loud applause and boisterous manifestations of approbation by the Republican members of the House . . . It was a scene, in my opinion, disgraceful to the American Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Edward A. (1997) ''Lincoln's Abolitionist General: The Biography of David Hunter''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. p. 106. {{ISBN|1-57003-110-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The War Department eventually forced Hunter to abandon this scheme, but the government nonetheless moved soon afterward to expand the enlistment of black men as military laborers.  Congress approved the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], which effectively freed all slaves working within the armed forces by forbidding Union soldiers to aid in the return of fugitive slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin et al., pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, Hunter wrote a letter to Confederate leader Jefferson Davis protesting against the Confederate army's brutal mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers. He lampooned the Confederates' claims that they were fighting for freedom, stating that the "liberty" that the Confederates were fighting for was the freedom to commit evil and enslave human beings:

{{Quotation|You say you are fighting for liberty.

====The Valley and "Scorched Earth"====
In the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], Union Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] was ordered by Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to move into the [[Shenandoah Valley]], threaten railroads and the agricultural economy there, and distract [[Robert E. Lee]] while Grant fought him in eastern Virginia. Sigel did a poor job, losing immediately at the [[Battle of New Market]] to a force that included cadets from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI). Hunter replaced Sigel in command of the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] and the Department of West Virginia on May 21, 1864. Grant ordered Hunter to employ [[scorched earth]] tactics similar to those that would be used later in that year during [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]; he was to move through [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], "living off the country" and destroying the Virginia Central Railroad "beyond possibility of repair for weeks." Lee was concerned enough about Hunter that he dispatched a corps under Lt. Gen. [[Jubal A. Early]] to deal with him.

{{wikisource|Southern Historical Society Papers/Volume 08/May/Mrs. Henrietta E. Lee to General Hunter|Mrs. Henrietta E. Lee's Letter to General David Hunter on the Burning of her House}}
On June 5, Hunter defeated Maj. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. "Grumble" Jones]] at the [[Battle of Piedmont]]. Following orders, he moved up the Valley (southward) through Staunton to Lexington, destroying military targets and other industries (such as blacksmiths and stables) that could be used to support the Confederacy. After reaching Lexington, his troops burned down VMI on June 11 in retaliation of that institution sending cadets to fight at New Market. Hunter ordered the home of former Governor [[John Letcher]] burned in retaliation for its absent owner's having issued "a violent and inflammatory proclamation ... inciting the population of the country to rise and wage guerrilla warfare on my troops."&lt;ref&gt;[[Shelby Foote|Foote, Shelby]] (1974). ''[[The Civil War: A Narrative]]''. Vol. 3, ''Red River to Appomattox''. New York: Random House. p. 310. {{ISBN|0-394-74913-8}}. &lt;/ref&gt; Hunter also wreaked havoc on [[Washington College]] in Lexington, later [[Washington and Lee University]]. According to [[Fitzhugh Lee]]'s biography of his uncle, [[Robert E. Lee]], "[Hunter] had no respect for colleges, or the peaceful pursuits of professors and students, or the private dwellings of citizens, though occupied by women and children only, and during his three days occupancy of Lexington in June, 1864, the college buildings were dismantled, apparatus destroyed, and the books mutilated."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Fitzhugh (1894). [https://archive.org/details/generallee02leegoog ''General Lee'']. D. Appleton. pp. 405–406&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter's campaign in the Valley came to an end after he was defeated by Early at the [[Battle of Lynchburg]] on June 19. His headquarters was at [[Sandusky House (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Sandusky House]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982, and now operated as a house museum. After the battle, Hunter retreated across the [[Allegheny Mountains]] into [[West Virginia]], thereby taking his army out of the war altogether for a few weeks and allowing Early a free rein in the Valley. Though this retreat was widely criticized, Ulysses Grant in his Memoirs excused it as follows: "General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place. Unfortunately, this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad." Hunter would maintain until his dying day that it had been a strategically sound move and he wrote a series of persistent letters to Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] and President Lincoln arguing that the retreat was entirely justified. He badgered Grant with letters a few months later arguing that the army and officers he inherited from Franz Sigel were below average, and that he had never been told that he had any assignment to defend Washington DC. After the war, he wrote a letter to Robert E. Lee asking if he as a fellow soldier did not agree with the soundness of the retreat. Lee, who had a loathing of Hunter, wrote back that he had no clue what the exact strategic value of retreating into West Virginia was, but that it had been extremely helpful to himself and the Confederate cause.

The burning of the Virginia Military Academy by Hunter also angered the Confederates and made them more vengeful than before. After retaking possession of the Valley, Early described the scene as "truly heart-rending. Houses had been burned, and helpless women and children left without shelter. The country had been stripped of provisions and many families left without a morsel to eat. Furniture and bedding had been cut to pieces, and old men and women and children robbed of all the clothing they had except that on their backs. Ladies trunks had been rifled and their dresses torn to pieces in mere wantonness.  Even the negro girls had lost their little finery. . . At Lexington he had burned the Military Institute, with all of its contents, including its library and scientific apparatus; and Washington College had been plundered and the statue of George Washington stolen. The residence of Ex-Governor Letcher at that place had been burned by orders, and but a few minutes given Mrs. Letcher and her family to leave the house. . . [A] Mr. Creigh, had been hung, because, on a former occasion, he had killed a straggling and marauding Federal soldier while in the act of insulting and outraging the ladies of his family."&lt;ref&gt;Early, Jubal (1866). [https://archive.org/details/memoiroflastyear00earl ''A Memoir of the Last Year of the War for Independence'']. Toronto: Lovell &amp; Gibson. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  The Confederate raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania in July were accompanied by widespread looting and destruction.

On August 1, Grant placed Maj. Gen [[Phil Sheridan]] in command of the effort to destroy Jubal Early's army. The Shenandoah, Maryland, and Washington DC area all fell under Hunter's military department, but Grant had no intention of allowing Hunter any direct command over the campaign against Early. He therefore informed him that he could retain department command on paper while Sheridan did the active field campaigning. Hunter however declined this offer, stating that he had been so beset by contradictory War Department orders that he had no idea where Jubal Early's army even was, and he would rather just turn everything over to Sheridan. Grant immediately accepted and relieved Hunter of his post.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary W. Gallagher|Gallagher, Gary W.]], ed. (1991) ''Struggle for the Shenandoah: Essays on the 1864 Valley Campaign''. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press. pp. 42–43. {{ISBN|0-87338-429-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve in no more combat commands. He was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] on March 13, 1865, an honor that was relatively common for senior officers late in the war.

==Later life and death==
Hunter served in the honor guard at the funeral of Abraham Lincoln and accompanied his body back to Springfield. He was the president of the military commission trying the conspirators of Lincoln's assassination, from May 8 to July 15, 1865. He retired from the Army in July 1866. He was the author of ''Report of the Military Services of Gen. David Hunter, U.S.A., during the War of the Rebellion'', published in 1873.&lt;ref&gt; Hunter, David (1873) [https://archive.org/search.php?query=Report%20of%20the%20Military%20Services%20of%20Gen.%20David%20Hunter%2C%20U.S.A.%2C%20during%20the%20War%20of%20the%20Rebellion Report of the Military Services of Gen. David Hunter, U.S.A., during the War of the Rebellion'']. New York : D. Van Nostrand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter died in Washington, D.C., and is buried at the [[Princeton Cemetery]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

'''Edinburgh's Hogmanay''' is the observance of [[Hogmanay]]—the Scottish celebration of the [[New Year]]—held in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].  

==History==
The annual Hogmanay celebration was originally an informal street party focused on the [[Tron Kirk]] in the High Street of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]]. Since 1993, it has been officially organised with the focus moved to [[Princes Street]]. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years up to a limit of 100,000 tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A10358165|title=Hogmanay-the Scottish New Year |publisher=BBC |date=10 May 2006|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003–04, most of the organised events were cancelled at short notice due to very high winds. Similarly, the 2006–07 celebrations in Edinburgh were cancelled on the day, again due to high winds and heavy rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6221557.stm |title=Weather spoils Hogmanay parties |publisher=BBC News, Scotland|date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hogmanay celebrations in Edinburgh==
{{main|Hogmanay}}
[[File:stoatsdook1.jpg|thumb|The Annual Stoats Loony Dook held on 1 January]]
''Hogmanay'' is the [[Scots language|Scots]] word for [[New Year's Eve]]. In [[Scotland]], New Year's (''Hogmanay'') is celebrated with several different customs, such as [[First-Foot]]ing, which involves friends or family members going to each other's houses with a gift of whisky and sometimes a lump of coal.

In Edinburgh, it now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party beginning on Hogmanay. Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the [[Princes Street Gardens]] concert and [[Céilidh]], where well-known artists perform and ticket holders can participate in traditional Scottish céilidh dancing.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/scotland/edinburgh/12072862/Hogmanay-what-is-it-and-where-are-the-celebrations-in-edinburgh-and-glasgow.html|title=Hogmanay 2015: what is it and where can I join the celebrations in Edinburgh, Glasgow and the rest of Scotland?|publisher=Daily Telegraph| |date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[New Year's Day]] the celebrations continue with the [[Stoats Loony Dook]] parade.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghshogmanay.com/events/the-stoats-loony-dook/|title=The Stoats Loony Dook - brought to you by the Porridge Pioneers |publisher=EdinburghHogmanay.com |date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrations are among the largest in the world. Celebrations in Edinburgh in 1996–97 were recognised by the Guinness Book of Records at the world's largest New Year party, with approximately 400,000 people in attendance. Numbers have since been restricted due to safety concerns.

==Fireworks displays==
[[File:New Year's Fireworks - geograph.org.uk - 1107164.jpg|thumb|New Year's fireworks in front of the One O'Clock Gun]]
Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, hosts one of the world's most famous New Year celebrations. The celebration is focused on a major street party along [[Princes Street]]. The cannon is fired at [[Edinburgh Castle]] at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a [[bank holiday]] in Scotland.

Other cities across Scotland, such as [[Aberdeen]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.

[[BBC Scotland]] [[Hogmanay Live|broadcast the celebrations]] in Edinburgh to a Scottish audience, with the celebrations also screened across the world. [[STV (TV network)|STV]] covers both worldwide New Year celebrations, and details of events happening around Scotland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-35205272|title=Thousands enjoy Hogmanay celebrations across Scotland|publisher=bbc |date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment for All Expo''' or '''E for All''' was a public video game [[trade show]], created to allow the general public to see and experience new products from the [[video game industry]]. The inaugural E for All Expo was open October 18 to October 21, 2007, at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6168302.html?q=e%20for%20all&amp;tag=result;title;0 "E for All detailed"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespy.com/articles/753/753398p1.html "Entertainment For All Expo Announced"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Second E For All Convention took place from October 3 through October 5, 2008 at the [[Los Angeles Convention Center]].

==History==
On January 5, 2007, [[IDG World Expo]], announced the first annual E for All Expo, the only video game event to receive the endorsement of the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA), the trade organization that organized the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} E for All was launched in response to ESA's reorganization of the E3 event to the E3 Business and Media Summit, where only invitees from the press and in the industry can attend. The expo offers an opportunity for the general public to see and try new products.

On September 16, 2007, [[Games Media Properties]], announced that they will no longer produce the World Series of Video Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.ign.com/gmbar/2007/09/16/66428/ |dead-url=yes |accessdate=2007-10-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622053121/http://blogs.ign.com/gmbar/2007/09/16/66428/ |archivedate=2009-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement reduced the size of Entertainment for All's show floor by 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://wire.ggl.com/2007/09/14/there-will-be-a-game-tournament-at-e-for-all-but-who-will-run-it/ |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829231710/http://wire.ggl.com/2007/09/14/there-will-be-a-game-tournament-at-e-for-all-but-who-will-run-it/ |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IDG World Expo is also responsible for producing tradeshows, [[Business conference|conferences]] and events such as [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld]], [[LinuxWorld Conference and Expo|LinuxWorld]], and [[GreenXchange Xpo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HD Hollywood Movies Torrent|url=https://www.cre8ivedesi9.net/hd-hollywood-movies-torrent/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 Expo had an attendance of about 18,000.&lt;ref name="2007 Attendence"&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2007/10/22/18-000-attend-e-for-all-but-first-a-little-panic/ | accessdate=2007-10-23 |title=18,000 attend E for All; but first, a little panic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two highly anticipated titles, Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' and Konami's ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'' were present in playable form. Organizers consider the event a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/680206/E_For_All_Floor_Report.html | accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/680228/E_For_All_Draws_Smaller_Crowd.html | accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IDG World Expo]] announced the date for the 2008 Entertainment For All show months before their 2007 took place. They announced that the date would be August 28–30, the same weekend that the annual [[Penny Arcade Expo]] video game show falls on.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://www.firingsquad.com/news/newsarticle.asp?searchid=17438 | accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event took place October 3–5.

E for All is now no longer held because the convention was merged back into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] by the ESA in time for the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]].

In 2017, almost a decade after the last E for All, E3 became open to the public for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-opens-to-the-public-for-the-first-time-ever/1100-6447663/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Gary Powers''' (August 17, 1929 – August 1, 1977)—often referred to as simply '''Gary Powers'''—was an American pilot whose [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/powers.asp |title=CIA FOIA – Francis Gary Powers: U-2 Spy Pilot Shot Down by the Soviets |publisher=Foia.cia.gov |accessdate=August 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831191815/http://www.foia.cia.gov/powers.asp |archivedate=August 31, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] was shot down while flying a reconnaissance mission in Soviet Union airspace, causing the [[1960 U-2 incident]].

He later worked as a helicopter pilot for [[KNBC]] and died in a [[1977 Gary Powers helicopter crash|1977 helicopter crash]].

==Early life and education==
Powers was born August 17, 1929, in [[Jenkins, Kentucky]], the son of Oliver Winfield Powers (1904–1970), a [[coal miner]], and his wife Ida Melinda Powers ({{nee|Ford}}; 1905–1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/2118|title=Francis Gary Powers (1929 - 1977) - Find A Grave Memorial|work=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family eventually moved to [[Pound, Virginia]], just across the state border. He was the second born and only male of six children.

His family lived in a mining town, and because of the hardships associated with the life in such a town, his father wanted Powers to become a doctor. He hoped his son would achieve the higher earnings of such a profession and felt the life of a doctor would involve less hardship than any job in his hometown.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{Cite book |last=Powers |first=Francis |title=Operation Overflight: A Memoir of the U-2 Incident |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |year=2004 |ISBN=9781574884227 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and service==
Graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Milligan College]] in [[Tennessee]] in June 1950, he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] in October. He was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in December 1952 after completing his advanced training with USAF Pilot Training Class 52-H&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.52g-52hpilots.org/rosters/52-h.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Williams Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]]. Powers was then assigned to the [[468th Strategic Fighter Squadron]] at [[Turner Air Force Base]], [[Albany, Georgia|Georgia]], as an [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84 Thunderjet]] pilot.

He married Barbara Gay Moore in Newnan, Georgia, on April 2, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Newnan-Coweta Magazine, Sep/Oct, 2011, p. 78, https://issuu.com/debwilli/docs/ncom_0910_11_all_lo/78&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1956 he was recruited by the CIA. In May 1956 he began U-2 training at [[Area 51|Watertown Strip]], Nevada. His training was complete by August 1956 and his unit, the Second Weather Observational Squadron (Provisional) or Detachment 10-10, was deployed to [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]. By 1960, Powers was already a veteran of many covert aerial reconnaissance missions.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|6–9,14–15,24,50–51,55–56,95}}

==The U-2 incident==
{{Main|1960 U-2 incident}}
Powers was discharged from the Air Force in 1956 with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]]. He then joined the CIA's [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] program at the [[General Schedule (US civil service pay scale)|civilian grade]] of GS-12. U-2 pilots flew [[espionage]] missions at altitudes of {{convert|70,000|ft|km}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/u2/u-2-specifications.html |title=U-2 Specifications |publisher=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lockheed Martin U-2 Dragon Lady - Development and Operational History, Performance Specifications and Picture Gallery|url = http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=51|website = www.militaryfactory.com|accessdate = November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U-2 Dragon Lady|url = http://www.military.com/equipment/u-2-dragon-lady|website = Military.com|accessdate = November 16, 2015|first = John|last = Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; supposedly above the reach of Soviet air defenses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = American U-2 spy plane shot down - May 01, 1960 - HISTORY.com|url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/american-u-2-spy-plane-shot-down|website = HISTORY.com|accessdate = November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-2 was equipped with a state-of-the-art camera&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; designed to take high-resolution photos from the [[stratosphere]] over hostile countries, including the [[Soviet Union]]. U-2 missions systematically photographed military installations and other important sites.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Reconnaissance mission===
The primary mission of the U-2s was overflying the Soviet Union. Soviet intelligence had been aware of encroaching U-2 flights at least since 1958 if not sooner&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|47,59}} but lacked effective countermeasures until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Fifty Years Later, Gary Powers and U-2 Spy Plane Incident Remembered|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Fifty_Years_Later_Gary_Powers_and_U2_Spy_Plane_Incident_Remembered/2029269.html|newspaper = RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|date = April 30, 2010|access-date = November 16, 2015|first = Vladimir|last = Abarinov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 1960, Powers's U-2A, ''56-6693'', departed from a military airbase in [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|53}} with support from the U.S. Air Station at [[Badaber]] ([[Peshawar Air Station]]). This was to be the first attempt "to fly all the way across the Soviet Union...but it was considered worth the gamble. The planned route would take us deeper into Russia than we had ever gone, while traversing important targets never before photographed."&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|53–54}}

===Shoot-down===
Powers was shot down by an [[S-75 Dvina]] (SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/s75.htm |title=S-75 |publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005194237/http://astronautix.com/lvs/s75.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; over [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]]. A total of 14 Dvinas were launched,&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, Norman (2001). ''Spyplane: The U-2 History Declassified.'' Zenith Press. p. 137 {{ISBN|0760309574}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which hit a [[MiG-19]] jet fighter which was sent to intercept the U-2 but could not reach a high enough altitude. Its pilot, [[Sergei Safronov (fighter pilot)|Sergei Safronov]], ejected but died of his injuries. Another Soviet aircraft, a newly manufactured [[Su-9]] on a transit flight, also attempted to intercept Powers's U-2. The unarmed Su-9 was directed to ram the U-2, but missed because of the large differences in speed (the Su-9 flew above Mach 1.1, while the U-2 flew at approximately Mach 0.6).

As Powers flew near Kosulino in the Ural Region, three S-75 Dvinas were launched at his U-2, with the first one hitting the aircraft. "What was left of the plane began spinning, only upside down, the nose pointing upward toward the sky, the tail down toward the ground." Powers was unable to activate the plane's self-destruct mechanism before he was thrown out of the plane after releasing the canopy and his seat belt. While descending under his parachute, Powers had time to scatter his escape map, and rid himself of part of his suicide device, a silver dollar coin suspended around his neck containing a poison-laced injection pin, though he kept the poison pin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/gary-powers-secret-diary-soviet-capture-180956939/#yilEojcaVQvIj9qc.99&lt;/ref&gt; "Yet I was still hopeful of escape."  He hit the ground hard, was immediately captured, and taken to [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka Prison]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|61–63,67–71,76}} Powers did note a second chute after landing on the ground, "some distance away and very high, a lone red and white parachute".&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|69,148–149,274,278}}&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rich |first=Ben |title=Skunk Works |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1994 |ISBN=0316743305 |pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159–160}}

===Cover story===
When the U.S. government learned of Powers's disappearance over the Soviet Union, they issued a cover statement claiming a "weather plane" had strayed off course after its pilot had "difficulties with his oxygen equipment". What CIA officials did not realize was that the plane crashed almost fully intact, and the Soviets recovered its equipment. Powers was interrogated extensively by the [[KGB]] for months before he made a confession and a public apology for his part in [[espionage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=tdihVideoCategory&amp;id=52645&amp;HPF_rid=9121459&amp;HPF_mid=1180_T1_Url3 |title=This Day in History – History.com – What Happened Today in History |publisher=History.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compromised by newspaper reports===
Powers tried to limit the information he shared with the KGB to that which could be determined from the remains of his plane's wreckage. He was hampered by information appearing in the western press. A KGB major stated "there's no reason for you to withhold information. We'll find it out anyway. Your press will give it to us."  However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a [[pseudonym]] of "Collins".  At the same time, he repeatedly stated the maximum altitude for the U-2 was {{convert|68,000|ft|km}}, significantly lower than its actual flight ceiling.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|xii,78,91,128,135,137,139,145,165–166,256}}

===Political impact===
The incident set back talks between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. Powers's interrogations ended on June 30, and his solitary confinement ended on July 9. On August 17, 1960, his trial began for espionage before the military division of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Lieutenant General Borisoglebsky, Major General Vorobyev, and Major General Zakharov presided. Roman Rudenko acted as prosecutor in his capacity of [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]].  [[Mikhail I. Grinev]] served as Powers's defense counsel. In attendance were his parents and sister, and his wife Barbara and her mother. His father brought along his attorney Carl McAfee, while the CIA provided two additional attorneys.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|110,114,119,120,142–143,148,157–158,162,188,220}}

===Conviction===
On August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage, "a grave crime covered by Article 2 of the Soviet Union's law 'On Criminality Responsibility for State Crimes'".  His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]]. The US Embassy "News Bulletin" stated, according to Powers, "as far as the government was concerned, I had acted in accordance with the instructions given me and would receive my full salary while imprisoned".&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|157–161}}

He was held in [[Vladimir Central Prison]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} east of Moscow, in building number 2 from September 9, 1960 until February 8, 1962. His cellmate was Zigurd Kruminsh (Zigurds Krūmiņš), a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Russian prisoners there. Some pieces of the plane and Powers's uniform are on display at the [[Central Air Force Museum|Monino Airbase museum]] near [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moninoaviation.com/33a.html|title=Air Force Museum - Monino, Russia|website=www.moninoaviation.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner exchange===
On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged, along with U.S. student [[Frederic Pryor]], in a well-publicized spy swap at the [[Glienicke Bridge]] in [[Berlin]]. The exchange was for Soviet KGB [[Colonel]] [[Rudolf Abel|Vilyam Fisher]], known as "Rudolf Abel", who had been caught by the [[FBI]] and tried and jailed for espionage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel/rudolph-ivanovich-abel-hollow-nickel-case/ Famous Cases: Rudolph Ivanovich Abel (Hollow Nickel Case)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121132429/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel/rudolph-ivanovich-abel-hollow-nickel-case/ |date=January 21, 2016 }}. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Powers credited his father with the swap idea. When released, Powers's total time in captivity was 1 year, 9 months, and 10 days.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|237–240}}

In 2010, CIA documents were released indicating that U.S. officials did not believe Powers's account of the incident at the time, because it was contradicted by a [[classified information|classified]] [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) report which alleged that the U-2 had descended from {{convert|65,000|to|34,000|ft|km}} before changing course and disappearing from radar. However, newly released declassified CIA documents confirm the accuracy of Powers's report.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} The NSA report remains classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7113512.ece |title=CIA documents show US never believed Gary Powers was shot down |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Powers initially received a cold reception on his return home. He was criticized for not activating his aircraft's self-destruct charge to destroy the camera, photographic film, and related classified parts. He was also criticized for not using a CIA-issued "suicide pill" to kill himself (a coin with [[saxitoxin|shellfish toxin]] embedded in its grooves, revealed during CIA testimony to the [[Church Committee]] in 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garypowers.org/1962-spy-exchange-of-powers-for-abel/|title=The 1962 Spy Exchange of Powers for Abel|publisher=Francis Gary Powers, Jr.|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was debriefed extensively by the CIA,&lt;ref name="CIA0000009451"&gt;{{cite web | title = Report of the board of inquiry into the case of francis gary powers (sanitized copy)|publisher = Central Intelligence Agency |url = http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000009451.pdf |format = PDF |date = February 27, 1962 |accessdate = July 12, 2010 |page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockheed Corporation]], and the Air Force, after which a statement was issued by CIA director [[John McCone]] that "Mr. Powers lived up to the terms of his employment and instructions in connection with his mission and in his obligations as an American."&lt;ref name="nydn62"&gt;{{cite news |issue=page 2 |publisher=New York Daily News |date=March 7, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1962, he appeared before a Senate Armed Services Select Committee hearing chaired by Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] which included Senators [[Prescott Bush]], [[Leverett Saltonstall]], [[Robert Byrd]], [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[John Stennis]], [[Strom Thurmond]], and [[Barry Goldwater]]. During the hearing, Senator Saltonstall stated, "I commend you as a courageous, fine young American citizen who lived up to your instructions and who did the best you could under very difficult circumstances."  Senator Bush declared, "I am satisfied he has conducted himself in exemplary fashion and in accordance with the highest traditions of service to one's country, and I congratulate him upon his conduct in captivity."  Senator Goldwater sent him a handwritten note: "You did a good job for your country."&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|264,270–280}}

===Divorce and Remarriage===
Powers and his wife Barbara separated in 1962 and divorced in January 1963. Powers stated that the reasons for the divorce included her infidelity and alcoholism, adding that she constantly threw tantrums and overdosed on pills shortly after his return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.suwanneedemocrat.com/community/remembering-the-people-and-events-that-shaped-suwannee-county-history/article_7e83104e-7f25-11e5-9a26-570f0db36611.html|title=Remembering the people and events that shaped Suwannee County history: Barbara Moore - part 2|last=Musgrove|first=Eric|work=Suwannee Democrat|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started a relationship with Claudia Edwards "Sue" Downey, whom he had met while working briefly at CIA Headquarters. Downey had a child, Dee Rogers, from her previous marriage. They were married on October 26, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;VA Marriage Records 1936-2014, Certificate #32518&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Francis Gary Powers II was born on June 5, 1965.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|287,292–293,323}} The marriage proved to be a very happy one, and Sue worked hard to preserve her husband's legacy after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/25/local/me-powers25|title=Claudia 'Sue' Powers, 68; Wife of Spy Plane Pilot Downed During Cold War|last=Writer|first=From a Times Staff|date=2004-06-25|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise===
During a speech in March 1964, former [[CIA Director]] [[Allen Dulles]] said of Powers, "He performed his duty in a very dangerous mission and he performed it well, and I think I know more about that than some of his detractors and critics know, and I am glad to say that to him tonight."&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|295–296}}

===Later career===
Powers worked for Lockheed as a test pilot from 1962 to 1970, though the CIA paid his salary. In 1970, he wrote the book ''Operation Overflight'' with co-author [[Curt Gentry]]. &lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Francis Gary|title=Operation Overflight: The U-2 pilot tells his story for the first time|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPERATION-OVERFLIGHT-PILOT-TELLS-STORY/dp/0030830451 |date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed fired him, because "the book's publication had ruffled some feathers at Langley." Powers became a helicopter traffic pilot reporter for [[KNBC|KNBC News Channel 4]].

==Death==
{{Main|1977 Gary Powers helicopter crash}}
Powers was piloting a helicopter for KNBC Channel 4 over West Los Angeles on August 1, 1977 when the aircraft crashed, killing him and his cameraman George Spears.&lt;ref name=Powers/&gt;{{rp|251,289–290,324}} They had been recording video tape following brush fires in [[Santa Barbara County]] in the KNBC helicopter and were heading back from them.

His [[Bell 206]] JetRanger helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed at the [[Sepulveda Dam]] recreational area in [[Encino, California]], several miles short of its intended landing site at [[Burbank Airport]]. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] report attributed the probable cause of the crash to pilot error.&lt;ref name="check-six.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Powers-N4TV.htm |title=The Francis Gary Powers Helicopter Crash |publisher=Check-six.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Powers's son, an aviation mechanic had repaired a faulty fuel gauge without informing Powers, who subsequently misread it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phs1.org/U2%20Program/Powers_Helicopter_Crash.htm |title=Powers Helicopter Crash |publisher=Phs1.org |accessdate=August 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613182148/http://phs1.org/U2%20Program/Powers_Helicopter_Crash.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the last moment, he noticed children playing in the area and directed the helicopter elsewhere to avoid landing on them.&lt;ref name="check-six.com"/&gt; He might have landed safely if not for the last-second deviation, which compromised his [[Autorotation|autorotative]] descent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
 
Powers was survived by his wife, children Claudia Dee and Francis Gary Powers Jr., and five sisters. He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] as an Air Force veteran.&lt;ref name="check-six.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Robert Patterson |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/francisg.htm |title=Francis Gary Powers, Captain, United States Air Force |publisher=Arlingtoncemetery.net |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Powers received the CIA's [[Intelligence Star]] in 1965 after his return from the Soviet Union. Powers was originally scheduled to receive it in 1963 along with other pilots involved in the CIA's U-2 program, but the award was postponed for political reasons. In 1970, Powers published his first—and only—book review, on a work about aerial reconnaissance, ''Unarmed and Unafraid'' by Glenn Infield, in the monthly magazine ''Business &amp; Commercial Aviation''. "The subject has great interest to me," he said, in submitting his review.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to G. Haber, Managing Editor, ''Business &amp; Commercial Aviation''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, newly declassified information revealed that Powers's mission had been a joint USAF/CIA operation. In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of the U-2 Incident, his family was presented with his posthumously awarded [[Prisoner of War Medal]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and [[National Defense Service Medal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3736">The '''Global Conference on Cyberspace (GCCS)''' are conferences held biennially since 2011 where governments, private sector and civil society gather to discuss and promote practical cooperation in cyberspace, to enhance cyber capacity building, and to discuss norms for responsible behavior in cyberspace.&lt;ref name="2015Location"/&gt;

== History ==

=== First conference ===

The first conference held in November 2011 in [[London]]. There, a set of principles “for governing behavior in cyberspace” have been established after a discussion from 700 participants.

=== Second conference ===

The second conference held on October 4-5th, 2012 in [[Budapest]]. The main subject and focus that has been discussed was the relationship between internet rights and internet security. Even though very few civil society organisations were invited to speak, the networking was valuable, and had more longer term impact than the Chair’s statement which represents the outcome of the event.

=== Third conference ===

The third event held on 17–18 October 2013 in [[Seoul]]. The conference had grown to approximately 1,600 attendees with greater representation from countries in the global South. Arguably the most significant outcome of the London Process is the Seoul Framework for and Commitment to Open and Secure Cyberspace, which highlights the importance of universal internet access, emphasizes that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and echoes a [[UN]] report that established that international law is applicable online and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.
&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

=== Fourth conference ===

The fourth GCCS conference held at the [[World Forum (The Hague)|World Forum]] from 16 to 17 April 2015 in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="2015Location" /&gt;

The '''[[Great Recession]] in Russia''' was a crisis during 2008–2009 in the [[Russia]]n financial markets as well as an economic recession that was compounded by political fears after the [[2008 South Ossetian war|war with Georgia]] and by the plummeting price of Urals heavy [[Price of petroleum|crude oil]], which lost more than 70% of its value since its record peak of US$147 on 4 July 2008 before rebounding moderately in 2009. According to the [[World Bank]], Russia’s strong short-term [[macroeconomic]] fundamentals made it better prepared than many [[emerging economies]] to deal with the crisis, but its underlying structural weaknesses and high dependence on the price of a single commodity made its impact more pronounced than would otherwise be the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/rer17_eng.pdf | title = Russian economic report | number = 171 | publisher = [[World Bank]] | accessdate = 12 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 during the onset of the crisis, Russian markets plummeted and more than $1&amp;nbsp;trillion had been wiped off the value of Russia's shares,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-CreditCrisis/idUSTRE4AC5M020081113 |agency = Reuters | title= Russian stocks shed over trillion in crisis | date= 13 November 2008| accessdate = 28 November 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090109212019/https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-CreditCrisis/idUSTRE4AC5M020081113 | archivedate = 9 January 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Russian stocks rebounded in 2009 becoming the world’s best performers, with the [[MICEX Index]] having more than doubled in value and regaining half its 2008 losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aR48z1j0bBrU | title = Russian Stocks Cut to ‘Neutral’ at JPMorgan on Commodity Risks | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the crisis progressed, [[Reuters]] and the [[Financial Times]] speculated that the crisis would be used to increase the Kremlin's control over key strategic assets in a reverse of the "loans for shares" sales of the 1990s, when the state sold off major assets to the [[business oligarch|oligarch]]s in return for loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSLA60378720081013 |agency=Reuters |title=Kremlin holds key as crisis threatens oligarchs |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=29 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218191443/https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSLA60378720081013 |archivedate=18 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this earlier speculation, in September 2009 the Russian government announced plans to sell state energy and transport holdings in order to help plug the [[Federal budget of Russia|budget deficit]] and to help improve the nation's aging infrastructure. The state [[Earmark (politics)|earmarked]] about 5,500 enterprises for [[divestment]] and plans to sell shares in companies that are already publicly traded, including [[Rosneft]], the country’s biggest oil producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=agAUNSXARKTk | title = Russia’s Planned State Asset Sales to Outshine Pee | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2008 – January 2009, Russia's [[foreign exchange reserves]] (FXR) fell by $210&amp;nbsp;billion from their peak to $386&amp;nbsp;billion as the central bank adopted a policy of gradual devaluation to combat the sharp devaluation of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]]. The ruble weakened 35% against the dollar from the onset of the crisis in August to January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aPzxsrEg7GUc | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |title=Ruble Gain Versus Dollar ‘Inevitable,’ Zadornov Says| accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ruble stabilized in January the reserves began to steadily grow again throughout 2009, reaching a year-long high of $452&amp;nbsp;billion by year's-end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/accor/press-release-fitch-downgrades-russia-to-bbb-FR0000120404-609688 Fitch Downgrades Russia To BBB] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121204915/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/accor/press-release-fitch-downgrades-russia-to-bbb-FR0000120404-609688 |date=21 January 2013 }}, Dow Jones (via Easy Bourse), 4 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=RUREFEG:IND Russian foreign reserves] [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Retrieved on 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Russia is a major exporter of commodities such as oil and metals, so its economy had been hit hard&lt;ref name=badnews&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/124716/analysis/20081003_global_market_brief_implications_russias_declining_oil_production | title = The Implications of Russia's Declining Oil Production | publisher = [[Stratfor]] | date = 3 October 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by the decline in the price of many commodities.  The Russian stock market declined significantly.  Foreign investors had pulled billions of dollars out of Russia on concerns over escalating geopolitical tensions with the West following the military conflict between Georgia and Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080817/116091756.html | title = South Ossetia conflict wipes $7bln off Russian market – Kudrin | publisher = [[RIA Novosti]] | place = [[Russia|RU]] | date = 17 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as concerns about state interference in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/04/news/international/powell_KGB.fortune/ |publisher=CNN | first=Bill | last=Powell | title=How the KGB (and friends) took over Russia's economy | date=9 September 2008| accessdate= 12 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081013184508/http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/04/news/international/powell_KGB.fortune/| archivedate= 13 October 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those concerns were underscored in July by Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]'s criticism of steel company [[Mechel]] collapsing the company's stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=a1218030204 | title = No Time to Panic | first = Sergi | last = Balashov | publisher = Russia profile | date = 6 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theotherrussia.org/2008/07/29/putin-and-russias-collapsing-stock-market/ | title = Putin and Russia’s Collapsing Stock Market | first = Yulia | last = Latynina | author-link = Yulia Latynina | publisher = The other Russia | date = 29 July 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/09/22/afx5454115.html | title = Russia's Medvedev gives boost to Mechel's owner | newspaper = [[Forbes]] | date = 22 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2008/07/understanding_the_attack_on_me.htm | title = Understanding the Attack on Mechel | first = Robert | last = Amsterdam | author-link = Robert Amsterdam | date = 29 July 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2008, the RTS stock index plunged almost 54%, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/financial-turmoil-accelerates-russia/story.aspx?guid=%7BAD559BFE%2D5E6C%2D4033%2D87C6%2D36EA9D4DFA18%7D | title = Financial turmoil accelerates in Russia | newspaper = MarketWatch | date = 17 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian involvement in the US [[subprime mortgage crisis]] contributed to the volatility in Russia's financial system. The [[Central Bank of Russia|Russian Central Bank]] owned US$100&amp;nbsp;Billion of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] of the two American mortgage giants [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] that were [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|taken over by the US government]]. This investment appeared to be bound for write-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Julian |last= Delasantellis |title= Paulson placates China, Russia – for now | url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/JI10Dj03.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date= 9 September 2008|accessdate=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many analysts, including [[Andrei Illarionov]], former economic policy adviser to then-President Vladimir Putin, claim that in Russia the crisis in the stock market was deepened dramatically by internal factors, including concerns over state interference in the economy fueled in June by Putin's criticism of [[Mechel]] and the conflict over [[TNK-BP]], lack of transparency in banking and political risks associated with escalating geopolitical tensions following the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] in August.&lt;ref name ="illarionov"&gt;{{Citation | first = Andrei | last = Illarionov | url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1016/42/371419.htm | title = Fighting Financial Fires With Blini | newspaper = [[The Moscow Times]] | date = 3 October 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Swedish Foreign minister]] [[Carl Bildt]] said on 17 September that the current Russian financial crisis is "obviously more worrying" than the ongoing [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in view of the political development in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = sv | url = http://di.se/Avdelningar/Artikel.aspx?stat=0&amp;ArticleID=2008%5c09%5c17%5c301279&amp;SectionId=Ettan&amp;menusection=Startsidan;Huvudnyheter | title = Carl Bildt bloggar om krisen |trans-title=Carl Bildt blogs about crisis | newspaper = Dagens industri | date = 17 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Russia's overt reliance on the oil and natural gas sector made it particularly vulnerable.

On 24 July 2008, [[Mechel]]'s stock plunged by almost 38 percent after Russia's Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized its CEO [[Igor Zyuzin]], and accused the company of selling resources to Russia at higher prices than those charged to foreign countries. The comments, which raised fears of another attack similar to that made on [[Yukos]] in 2004, contrasted sharply with previous efforts by President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to improve Russia's reputation as an investor-friendly country.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

===Money markets===

The crisis in [[money market]]s was imminent since spring, when [[Central Bank of Russia]] warned the public of a gradual contraction in bank lending due to unfolding world liquidity crisis. However, the regulator preferred to combat inflation, raising the [[refinancing rate]] and [[Bank reserves|bank reserve contributions]]. 1 September hike in reserve rate alone withdrew nearly 100&amp;nbsp;billion roubles from the money market.&lt;ref name=RUB&gt;{{cite news | title=Russia’s Banking Crisis | url=http://eng.expert.ru/printissues/expert/2008/38/vtoroe_dno_besplatno/ | author=Maxim Rubchenko | publisher=Expert Online |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201073046/http://eng.expert.ru/printissues/expert/2008/38/vtoroe_dno_besplatno/| archivedate= 1 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raise coincided with a seasonal peak in tax payments and left the banking system in a worse state of liquidity than that of August 1998.&lt;ref name=RUB/&gt; A subsequent drop in rouble-to-dollar exchange rate and dollar-denominated prices of Russian corporate securities forced investors to [[Crowding out (economics)|crowd out]], worsening the [[positive feedback]] loop. The interbank [[money market]] that traditionally relied on Russian corporate stock as a [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for the [[repurchase agreement]]s, immediately imploded in what was called "a crisis of trust" or even "elimination of trust":&lt;ref name=ASP&gt;{{ cite news | title=Russia’s Top Economist Needs to Face Reality | url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=27448 | publisher=Saint Peterburg Times|date=24 October 2008 | author=[[Anders Åslund]] |accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025234421/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=27448| archivedate= 25 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the borrowers defaulted on loans, leaving lenders with impaired collateral, other banks stopped lending as a precaution.&lt;ref name=RUB/&gt;

Money market crunch passed its first lowest mark 15–17 September. 17 September the government lent the country's three biggest banks, [[Sberbank]], [[VTB Bank]] and [[Gazprombank]], 1.13&amp;nbsp;trillion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (US$44&amp;nbsp;billion) for at least three months to boost [[Market liquidity|liquidity]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a1sZsKZ32kvU&amp;refer=europe Russian Exchanges Halt Trading for Second Day; VTB Declines], Bloomberg, 17 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the Central Bank lowered the [[reserve requirement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.ru/pw.aspx?file=/press/if/080917_1833473.htm Press Release of the Central Bank] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed 24 September by Central Bank loans to keep the current accounts afloat and prevent a [[bank run]].

On 29 September, [[Vladimir Putin]] announced a government policy aimed at refinancing Russian corporations that previously relied on foreign loans. Government authorized [[Vnesheconombank]] as its principal agent in distributing state loans to these corporations, amounting initially up to 50&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars, or 8% of Russia's foreign currency assets. At the same time Putin recommended the Central Bank to extend [[unsecured loan|unsecured]] stabilization loans to Russian banks,&lt;ref name=K30&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1033709/VEB_nonresident_debt_redemption/| title=VEB to Guarantee Redemption of All Corporate Debt by Year-End | publisher=[[Kommersant]] |date=30 September 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010115919/http://www.kommersant.com/p1033709/VEB_nonresident_debt_redemption/| archivedate= 10 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was duly implemented.&lt;ref name=K1811/&gt; The policy was immediately dubbed "soft re-[[nationalisation]]" and criticized for selective picking of "eligible" borrowers.&lt;ref name=ASP/&gt; The 50&amp;nbsp;billion installment covers only the current portion of 477&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars owed by Russian corporations to foreign lenders; total assets of the government and the Central Bank combined are estimated at 550&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars.&lt;ref name=K30/&gt;

On 23 October, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] changed the long-term outlook on the sovereign credit ratings of Russia from stable to negative, warning of the costs of bailing out troubled banks and a rising risk of a budget deficit in 2009. It also lowered Russia's Transfer and Convertibility (T&amp;C) assessment to [[Bond credit rating|BBB+]] from [[Bond credit rating|A-]]. At the same time, the 'BBB+' long-term foreign currency, the 'A-' long-term local currency ratings and the short-term ratings of [[Bond credit rating|A-2]] were affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/MacroEconomicNews.asp?ArticleCode=49l823n6gf5uvqg |title=TEXT-S&amp;P release on Russian Federation |agency=Reuters |work=Macroeconomic News |publisher=London South East |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian economic crisis==
At the end of November 2008, The Russian economy as a whole was not in a state of recession. The government forecast for 2009 stood at a 6.7% annual growth rate while a November 2008 [[World Bank]] report projected 3% growth for 2009,&lt;ref name=R21&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE4AK4L620081121 | title=Russia acknowledges financial crisis has hit hard |agency=Reuters   |date=21 November 2008 | accessdate=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a revised projection issued 30 March 2009 by the World Bank projects a 4.5% decrease for 2009 with unemployment projected to rise to 12% by the end of 2009. The World Bank report expressed concern about the condition of the poor and recommended increases in social support payments such as unemployment payments and child support payments. The report projected a slight rise in the average price of oil during 2010, up to $53 a barrel from the projected average of $45 for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/world/europe/31russia.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ellen | last=Barry | title=World Bank Sees Slump in Russia Worsening | date=31 March 2009| accessdate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401225415/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/world/europe/31russia.html| archivedate= 1 April 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of December 2008 Russian officials confirmed that possibility of a recession was inevitable. "Russia is headed for a recession", the country's deputy economy minister, [[Andrei Klepach]], has said. Asked whether Russia would have a recession, he said: "It's started already. I'm afraid it will not be over in the next two quarters. ... A major drop began in October and there will also be drops in November–December," he said, according to official reports. Recessions are normally declared after two quarters of negative growth. He also said that full-year economic growth for 2008 would be lower than the 6.8% previously forecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7779132.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Russia confirms recession to come | date=12 December 2008| accessdate= 13 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081212181247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7779132.stm| archivedate= 12 December 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel industry===

Russian steel industry is dependent on foreign markets and domestic construction and automobile industries. Crisis in the industry was first publicly reported in the end of September – early October.

The company, specializing in construction-grade rolled steel, was inherently in worse position than other Russian steel mills. 13 November Evraz announced that, instead of layoffs, it will decrease workers' wages by a third. Some of Evraz facilities were converted to a four-day working week; the company reduced output to an estimated 50–60% of its capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sekonomit na zarplate (Сэкономить на зарплате) |url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008/11/14/168972 |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |date=14 November 2008 |language=Russian |accessdate=15 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226064233/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008%2F11%2F14%2F168972 |archivedate=26 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November [[Goskomstat]] insider reported an unprecedented drop in industrial prices – minus 6.6% monthly, following a 0.8% drop in September (the agency itself delayed its regular monthly report). Most of the losses concentrate in raw material industries; automobile and tool-making industries dropped only 0.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Industrial Deflation Has Little Impact | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1072460/r_528/producer_price_index/ | publisher=Kommersant |date=18 November 2008 | accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two months, gasoline and diesel oil wholesale prices dropped by 12.8% and 16.5%. The worst price fall hit the steel industry: pig iron and ferric alloys dropped 21.7% in October after an 8.9% drop in September. Prices on aluminum and nickel are down to [[break-even]] point. The decline is sufficient to indicate a [[recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gazeta.ru/financial/2008/11/17/2886251.shtml | title= Tzeny ukazyvayut na rezessiyu (Цены указывают на рецессию) | publisher=[[gazeta.ru]] |date=18 November 2008|language=Russian|accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other industries===

In November, the volume of Russian paper exports to China decreased by 30–40%, coupled with a 30% drop in prices. Exports to Western Europe fare marginally better, with an estimated 25–40% drop in production volumes. Russia's largest producer of industrial paper bags, [[Segezh Paper Mill]] (controlled by the [[Bank of Moscow]] and the City of Moscow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?fromsearch=4d9b7ca5-7395-4b3f-86e7-dd3925e20d88&amp;docsid=1010426 | title=Pushkinskuyu ploshchad zavernuli ("Пушкинскую площадь" завернули в бумагу "Инвестлеспрома") | publisher=[[Kommersant]], 12 August 2008 | language=Russian | accessdate=26 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), declared a ten-day shutdown on 24 November.&lt;ref name=BNSK/&gt;  [[UPM (company)|UPM-Kymmene Oyj]] anticipates at least a 30–40% decrease in output compared to 2008.&lt;ref name=BNSK&gt;{{cite news | url=http://kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?fromsearch=43368a4c-1352-45f8-9116-2ab9688056bb&amp;docsid=1080659 | title=Bumaga ne sterpela krizis (Бумага не стерпела кризис) | publisher=[[Kommersant]] |date=24 November 2008 | language=Russian | accessdate=26 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev visited Silicon Valley in San Jose, California in order to cultivate ideas of how to develop Russia as a major research center. Skolkovo, a mid-sized city near Moscow, is the proposed location for this Russian Silicon Valley, and will have its own tax structure. Yet, Medvedev has been criticized by opposition politicians for deflecting attention away from the struggling economy and corruption.

===Airlines===

In June–August 2008 the fleet of [[KrasAir]], a [[Krasnoyarsk]]-based airline with a controlling state interest, was grounded by the fuel suppliers' refusal to extend credit to the company that defaulted on payments. Other members of [[AiRUnion]] consortium, notably [[Dalavia]], also folded in August. Thousands of passengers were stranded in airports; flight delays and cancellations became a national agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1019797/Russian_airline_industry/ | title=Flight Delays Continue Nationwide | publisher=Kommersant |date=3 September 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222233341/http://www.kommersant.com/p1019797/Russian_airline_industry/| archivedate= 22 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government action focused on setting the cap on [[jet fuel]] prices and restructuring its assets into a new company managed by [[Rostechnologii]], a newly formed state [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. Ministry of Transportation distributed the licenses to fly former KrasAir routes to other companies. KrasAir also defaulted on payments to its staff, and on 27 October a [[strike action]], coupled with fuel suppliers' denial of service, finally ruined the airline. [[Dalavia]] lost its license earlier in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://atwonline.com/news/other.html?issueDate=10%2F7%2F2008 | title=Dalavia Far East Airways, based at Khabarovsk, had its traffic rights suspended | publisher=ATW Daily News|date=7 October 2007 | accessdate= 29 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of KrasAir also threatened [[Sky Express]], Russia's first [[low cost carrier]] co-owned by the [[EBRD]] and former manager of KrasAir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sky Express License in Danger | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1024008/airlines_crisis/ | publisher=Kommersant |date=11 September 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222233351/http://www.kommersant.com/p1024008/airlines_crisis/| archivedate= 22 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22 October the assets of bankrupt [[KrasAir]], [[Domodedovo Airlines]], [[Samara Airlines]] and [[Atlant-Soyuz Airlines]] were consolidated in a new company, '''[[Rosavia]]''', co-financed by the City of Moscow and Rostekhnologii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1045266/Russian_airlines/ | title=Airlines of Russia Takes Off | publisher=Kommersant|date=22 October 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rossiya (airline)|Rossiya]], [[Orenair]], [[Kavminvodyavia]], [[Vladivostok Air]], [[Dalavia]] and [[Saravia]] were originally planned to join this proposed airline holding company, too, which would have made Rosavia the largest Russian airline by fleet size. Following a 20 percent drop of domestic passenger numbers in Russia per month, the [[Government of Russia|federal government]] scrapped all plans concerning the new airline on 5 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.com/Business/2009-03-05/Rosavia_plans_held_off_as_doubts_about_smaller_airlines_mount.html ''Rosavia plans held off as doubts about smaller airlines mount'', Russia Today TV, 5 March 2009 ].Accessed: 6 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture, food industry and retail===

Russia had a high grain harvest in 2008, but so it was elsewhere in the world, bringing the prices down. To support the trade, [[Dmitry Medvedev]] authorized a state export subsidy of 40 US dollars per [[metric ton]]. This, according to the minister of agriculture, is sufficient to maintain exports at 20–25&amp;nbsp;million metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Harvester Operators to Be Fed from Budget | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1056449/Subvention_agriculture/ | publisher=Kommersant |date=12 November 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The food industry is, however, locked between high costs of farm produce and tight price and credit terms dictated by retail chains. Food industry executives anticipate that the chains will eventually lose part of their clients to street markets, as the suppliers are forced to develop this independent sales channel.&lt;ref name=POMI&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.expert.ru/articles/2008/11/14/pomidor/ | title= Iz setey na rynok (Из сетей на рынок) | publisher=Expert Online |date=14 November 2008 | language=Russian | accessdate=16 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206022955/http://expert.ru/articles/2008/11/14/pomidor/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic retail chains, [[Leverage (finance)|heavily leveraged]],&lt;ref name=RVR/&gt; were experiencing [[liquidity crisis]] at least since April 2008.&lt;ref name=KAPR&gt;{{cite news | title=Chains Drown in Debts | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p879075/top_50_Russian_retailers_rating/ | publisher=Kommersant, 14 April 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chain to go bankrupt in May 2008, [[Grossmart]] (190 stores in Moscow region), had a particularly high debt-to-[[EBITDA]] ratio of 6 to 1.&lt;ref name=KAPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=E9&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.expert.ru/articles/2008/09/01/document430708/ | title=Vremya defoltov (Время дефолтов) | language=Russian | publisher=Expert Online |date=1 September 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arbat Prestige]], subject to government attacks since 2007, defaulted on its bonds in June.&lt;ref name=E9/&gt; In November 2008 nine leading food retail chains (out of nearly 300) received access to government-backed financing.&lt;ref name=POMI/&gt; Nevertheless, retailers are pressing food suppliers for longer credit terms or bigger [[cash discount]]s, demanding up to 50% price cut for cash payment. Suppliers, in a mirror move, raised "regular" credit prices by 20–60%. Rather than submit to the chains' demands, they simply refuse to sell; visible depletion of stocks has affected only a few affected chains.&lt;ref name=RVR/&gt;

==Social impact==

===Unemployment===

A proprietary [[Ernst &amp; Young]] survey of 113 clients that leaked into Russian press in November summarized their losses at 8% of managerial and 6% of low-level jobs by end of October. All companies in the survey practiced some sort of reducing labor costs. One company in four practiced unpaid "vacations"; 8% of clients settled for reduced working hours.&lt;ref name=V2411&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008/11/24/170362 |title=Glavnye uvolnenia vperedi (Главные увольнения впереди) |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |date=24 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |language=Russian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226064243/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008%2F11%2F24%2F170362 |archivedate=26 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Migratory Service]] announced in November that 1123 Russian companies reported upcoming layoffs of 45 thousand.&lt;ref name=FMSN/&gt;

By late November, Kremlin First Deputy Chief of Staff, [[Vladislav Surkov]], was warning that the middle classes should be defended from poverty during the crisis. He called for swift measures to protect the middle class from layoffs and to support consumption.&lt;ref name=R2811&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/11/28/afx5755046.html | title=Kremlin says to defend Russian middle class in crisis | author=Guy Faulconbridge |agency=Reuters   |date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=7 December 2008 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "If the 1980s were the times of the intellectuals and the 1990s were the times of the oligarchs then the 00s can be seen as the epoch of the middle classes,' Surkov said in a speech published on the Web site of the ruling United Russia party ... The main task of the state during the slump must become the preservation of the middle class, the defence of the middle class from the waves of poverty and confusion that are coming from the West," he said.&lt;ref name=R2811/&gt;

According to official statements released 9 December, rate of unemployment growth peaked in the middle of November and slowed down in subsequent weeks. In the week ending 3 December overall unemployment grew by 1.6% to 1.315&amp;nbsp;million people, following a 2.3% increase in the preceding week. The state also reported an increase in unpaid vacations and reduced working week employees to 149.3 thousands. The number increased by 84% in a single week ending 3 December. The trade unions anticipate that official unemployment will peak at around 2 million people in 2009, when hidden forms of unemployment become visible to statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1091372&amp;ThemesID=437 | title=Monitoring Minzdrava (Мониторинг Минздрава) | language=Russian | publisher=[[Kommersant]], 9 December 2008 | accessdate=9 December 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215132313/http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1091372&amp;ThemesID=437| archivedate= 15 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet on 12 December Putin announced completely different unemployment numbers – 4.6&amp;nbsp;million in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://rg.ru/2008/12/15/putin.html | title=Banki v prioritete (Банки в приоритете) | publisher=Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 December 2008 | accessdate=15 December 2008 | language=Russian | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215075857/http://www.rg.ru/2008/12/15/putin.html| archivedate= 15 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival''' is an annual festival held in the coastside community of [[Half Moon Bay, California]] for one weekend during [[pumpkin]] harvest season.  It is one of the oldest and largest local festivals in California.  Proceeds go to local civic causes and to the beautification of the downtown area of Half Moon Bay.
There is no admission charge for the event.

==Dates==
The annual event is held in October.  [[Columbus Day]] Monday is the Safeway World Champion Pumpkin Weigh-in contest.  The Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival is a two-day event held the following Saturday and Sunday each year.
Festival hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM both Saturday and Sunday.

==Locations==
The festival is located in downtown [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] on Main Street between Miramontes and Spruce Streets. 
The Great Pumpkin Parade is held at Noon on Saturday and runs East along Miramontes, North on Main St, and West on Mill Street.
There are two Music Stages, one at the South entrance and one located next to the Food Court in the IDES grounds.  A Family Stage is located at 620 Main Street.
The associated Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-In is located on the IDES Grounds at 735 Main Street on Columbus Day, the Monday prior to the festival.

==History==
The Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival began in 1971 with the formation of the Main Street Beautification Committee.  The group was formed to raise funds for the revitalization of Main Street, which was beginning to show signs of decay.  With an abundance of pumpkin patches in the area, the committee organized an old-fashioned harvest-style pumpkin festival.
The first festival attracted 30,000 people. That year only one non-profit organization offered food for sale.  The festival now includes dozens of local non-profit groups operating food and game booths, selling everything from pumpkin pie to linguisa sandwiches.  
Proceeds go to various civic and local causes and have included the construction of two parks, multiple scholarship funds, the installation of old-fashioned downtown street lights, the underground wiring of Main Street, and the renovation of City Hall.

== Traditions==
•	The Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off attracts growers from around the United States.  The weigh-off is held the Monday prior to the festival and the winners are on display during the festival weekend.  In 2009, Don Young of Iowa won the event with a 1,659&amp;nbsp;lb [[Atlantic Giant]] pumpkin taking home $9,948 in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/13/BA551A4NTG.DTL|title=1658 pound pumpkin is record|date=October 13, 2009|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
•	Harvest inspired Arts and Crafts are represented by 250 artist and craftmakers.  Original works are available in glass, ceramics, metals, fiber, leather, wood, jewelry and fine art. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Food is a big item at the festival.  Many food offerings include pumpkin such as pie, pancakes, bread, cheesecake, sausages, and ice cream.  Local coastal favorites include Brussels sprouts, artichoke hearts, and Portuguese linguisa sandwiches.  All food is provided by community non-profit groups. &lt;br /&gt;
•	The Great Pumpkin Parade features the weigh-off champion pumpkin, marching bands, classic cars, and costumed children of all ages. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Continuous entertainment is located on three stages throughout the festival.  A variety of music is available from Country, to Blues, to Reggae.  &lt;br /&gt;
•	Family entertainment includes a costume contest, pumpkin carving, games, and a pie eating contest. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Giant pumpkin carving is provided by [[Farmer Mike]], a professional pumpkin carver that turns giant pumpkins (up to a thousand pounds) into faces and reliefs.  [[Farmer Mike]] has carved at the event for 25 years. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Local wine and microbrews offer wine and beer by the glass. &lt;br /&gt;
•	Other attractions include a Sunday Pumpkin Run/Walk, a talent show, a pancake breakfast, giant pumpkin photos, a poster contest exhibit, and a haunted house.

==Traffic ==
The popular event attracts more than 200,000 people to this rural community.  Major access from the greater [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is from Highway 92 to the east.  North/South access from [[San Francisco]] or [[Santa Cruz, Ca|Santa Cruz]] is available using coastal [[California State Route 1|Highway 1]].   The festival, combined with multiple pumpkin patches surrounding the town, generate severe traffic congestion each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/10/13/PENINSUL12943.dtl |title=Pumpkin Moon -Get There Early|date=October 13, 1995|first=Al|last=Morch|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Parking is limited to side streets or paid parking in lots sponsored by local organizations.

'''''Heaven Watch the Philippines''''' is a popular song by [[Irving Berlin]], written in 1946.

It was written as a tribute to [[Philippines|Filipino]] resistance during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]] in [[World War II]]. During the war, Japanese troops in the Philippines attempted to popularize self-glorifying songs such as "Chichi Yo Anata Wa Tsuyokatta" ("Father, You Were Brave" in English). Locals resisted these efforts, preferring instead to sing "God Bless the Philippines" to the tune of Berlin's "[[God Bless America]]" as a show of national pride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,797270,00.html Philippine Flop], Time Magazine, published March 12, 1945, accessed May 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin himself gave the first performance of "Heaven Watch the Philippines"  in [[Tolosa, Leyte]] in 1946, in front of an audience that included [[Sergio Osmeña]] and [[Carlos P. Romulo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elgu.ncc.gov.ph/ecommunity/tolosa-leyte/index.php?cat1=32&amp;cat2=4 Municipality of Tolosa: Brief Historical Sketch], the official website of the Municipality of Tolosa, posted 2002, accessed May 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin was touring U.S. military bases with a stage production of ''[[This Is the Army]]'', in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/199455%7C0/This-Is-the-Army.html THIS IS THE ARMY],  [http://www.tcm.com Turner classic movies].&lt;/ref&gt; During a stop in the Philippines, he heard children in [[Leyte]] singing the song ''God Bless America'' (which he had written in 1918 and had revised in 1938) with the lyric "God Bless the Philippines". Touched by that and feeling that they might like a song of their own, he composed "Heaven Watch the Philippines", trying to combine the spiritual quality of "God Bless America" with their feeling for America and desire to be free.  He taught the song to school children in Leyte and sang the song in the finale of the show when ''This Is the Army'' opened in Leyte. Berlin had donated the "God Bless America" royalties to the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and he presented the rights to "Heaven Watch the Philippines" to the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] with the instruction that if they ever sold the song in the Philippines for profit, the proceeds were to be given to the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines|Boy]] and [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Sears, ''The Irving Berlin Reader'', pp. [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=DqZFJQZiiXIC |page=191 }} 191–192],  Oxford University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9780195383744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1987 interview with [[Playboy]], [[Imelda Marcos]] falsely claimed that Berlin had written "Heaven Watch the Philippines" specifically for her. When asked about her claim, the 99-year-old Berlin denied it outright.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Katherine. "Imelda: Steel Butterfly of the Philippines", p.

The '''Jujuy Exodus''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], '''''Éxodo Jujeño''''') was an episode of the [[Argentine War of Independence]]. It was a massive [[forced relocation|forced displacement]] of people from the [[Jujuy Province]], by orders of General [[Manuel Belgrano]], conducted by his [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriot]] forces that were battling a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalist]] army. The population was compelled to leave under the threat of execution.&lt;ref&gt; ''"los desobedientes serian tratados como traidores y pasados por las armas"''. Roca, José Luis (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JzPOmeeoX_MC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=%22El+%C3%89xodo+Juje%C3%B1o+%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22El%20%C3%89xodo%20Juje%C3%B1o%20%22&amp;f=false Ni con Lima ni con Buenos Aires: la formación de un estado nacional en Charcas]''. Plural Editores, p. 315. {{ISBN|99954-1-076-1}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
During the early 1812 [[Manuel Belgrano]] had created the [[Cockade of Argentina|cockade]] and [[Flag of Argentina]] near the city of [[Rosario]], and then received order to move to the north. He would take command of the [[Army of the North]], based in the city of [[San Salvador de Jujuy]]. The situation was not favourable: a short time before [[Juan José Castelli]] had led the [[First Alto Perú campaign]] and, despite an initial advantage and a brief time ruling the [[Upper Peru]], faced a decisive defeat during the [[Battle of Huaqui]]. The surviving [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]] and remains of the Army had retreated to the south, to Jujuy. They were lacking men, weapons and money, and had to stop a victorious army, better armed and four times bigger. 

The loyalists, led by General Pío Tristán, were advancing south with 3,000 troops from today's [[Bolivia]], into the northwest of Argentina (through [[Humahuaca]]). The revolutionaries were outnumbered 2 to 1, demoralized, badly armed, far from the assistance of the central government, and facing an outbreak of [[malaria]] without medication. In addition, many of the locals, especially of the higher classes, resented the arrival of forces from [[Buenos Aires]] and were ready to [[defector|defect]].

Belgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict [[scorched earth]] policy. On 29 July 1812 Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to "show their [[hero]]ism" and join the march of the army under his command "if, as you assure, you want to be free". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace, and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force.

The exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from Jujuy and [[Salta Province|Salta]]; people travelled south about 250 km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]], on the early hours of 29 August.

The Exodus is commemorated in Jujuy by traditionalist groups with an Evocative March, every 22 August since 1955. The [[Jujuy Province]] is declared honorific capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002, by national law 25.644.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.hcdn.gov.ar/folio-cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=898685323&amp;advquery=%5BField%20Ley%3a%2725664%27%5D&amp;headingswithhits=on&amp;hitsperheading=on&amp;infobase=leyes.nfo&amp;record={A41}&amp;softpage=Document42 Ley 25.644]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''list of foods with religious symbolism''' provides details, and links to articles, of foods which are used in religious communities or traditions to symbolise an aspect of the faith, or to commemorate a festival or hero of that faith group. Many such foods are also closely associated with a particular date or season. As with all religious traditions, some such foods have passed into widespread secular use, but all those on this list have a religious origin. The list is arranged alphabetically and by religion.

Many religions have a particular 'cuisine' or tradition of cookery, associated with their culture (see, for example, [[List of Jewish cuisine dishes]]). This list is ''not'' intended for foods which are merely part of the cultural heritage of a religious body, but ''specifically'' those foods that bear religious symbolism in the way they are made, or the way they are eaten, or both.

*[[Bread]] - often (though not exclusively) unleavened bread; one of the two elements (with wine) of the Christian [[eucharist]], the bread represents Christ's body.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v. Eucharist]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tsoureki#Christopsomo: Christmas Bread|Christopsomo]] - a type of  [[Tsoureki]] bread served at Christmas in Greece; Christmas symbols, and a cross, are traditionally incorporated into the loaf using dough shapes; it is flavoured with figs.&lt;ref&gt;Referenced at the [http://greekfood.about.com/od/greekbreadspitas/r/christopsomo.htm About Food] website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See entry at [http://www.thegreekglutton.com/christopsomo-greek-christmas-bread/ The Greek Glutton].&lt;/ref&gt;

The outside of the egg looks dead but inside there is new life, which is going to break out. The Easter egg is a reminder that Jesus will rise from His tomb and bring new life. Orthodox Christians dye boiled eggs red to make [[red Easter eggs]] that represent the blood of Christ shed for the sins of the world.|date=5 April 2000|accessdate =7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Symbolism&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hPMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=easter+egg+empty+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IpWAT_e-EKnh0QHVmI3RBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=easter%20egg%20empty%20tomb&amp;f=false|title= The Guardian, Volume 29|publisher=H. Harbaugh|quote=Just so, on that first Easter morning, Jesus came to life and walked out of the tomb, and left it, as it were, an empty shell. Just so, too, when the Christian dies, the body is left in the grave, an empty shell, but the soul takes wings and flies away to be with God. Thus you see that though an egg seems to be as dead as a stone, yet it really has life in it; and also it is like Christ's dead body, which was raised to life again. This is the reason we use eggs on Easter. (In days past some used to color the eggs red, so as to show the kind of death by which Christ died,-a ''bloody'' death.)|year=1878|accessdate =7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its structure is different from that of other COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[celecoxib]]: lumiracoxib is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[diclofenac]] (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid class of NSAIDs; it binds to a different site on the COX-2 enzyme than do other COX-2 inhibitors; it is the only [[acid]]ic coxib and has the highest COX-2 selectivity of any NSAID.&lt;ref name=Tacconelli&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tacconelli S, Capone ML, Patrignani P |title=Clinical pharmacology of novel selective COX-2 inhibitors |journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=589–601 |year=2004 |pmid=14965322 |doi= 10.2174/1381612043453108|url=https://zenodo.org/record/977695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its original approval, lumiracoxib has been [[list of withdrawn drugs|withdrawn from the market]] in several countries, mostly due to its potential for causing liver failure (sometimes requiring [[liver transplantation]]). It has never been approved for use in the United States.&lt;ref name = EurJ/&gt;

==History==
The TARGET study ('''T'''herapeutic '''A'''rthritis '''R'''esearch and '''G'''astrointestinal '''E'''vent '''T'''rial) was conducted with more than 18,000 patients to test its gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety against [[naproxen]] and [[ibuprofen]] and also study its efficacy against these two NSAIDs.

In November 2006, Prexige received marketing approval for all European Union countries through a common procedure called MRP. However, in August 2007, Prexige was withdrawn from the market in Australia following 8 serious liver adverse events, including 2 deaths and 2 liver transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tga.gov.au/recalls/2007/lumiracoxib.htm |title=Urgent medicine recall - Lumiracoxib (PREXIGE)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827160513/http://www.tga.gov.au/recalls/2007/lumiracoxib.htm |archive-date=2007-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a not approvable letter for lumiracoxib, requiring additional safety data.&lt;ref&gt;http://hugin.info/134323/R/1156327/223186.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada withdrew Prexige (approved at 100&amp;nbsp;mg dose only) in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2007/2007_141-eng.php Withdrawal of Market Authorization for Prexige&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several European Union countries followed suit in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2007/1169462.shtml Media releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA rejected '''Prexige''' as a trade name for lumiracoxib in 2003.  '''Prexede''' was suggested as an alternative, but the FDA Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support (DMETS) subsequently recommended against it as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/briefing/2005-4090B1_33_GG-FDA-Tab-U.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal from market===
On August 11, 2007, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration ([[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]], the national agency responsible for regulation of pharmaceuticals) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm Medicines Regulator cancels registration of anti inflammatory drug, Lumiracoxib] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603202146/http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm |date=2009-06-03 }}, ''[[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]'', 11 August 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the TGA's Principal Medical Adviser, Dr Rohan Hammett, as of 10 August 2007 the TGA had received 8 reports of serious adverse liver reactions to the drug, including two deaths and two liver transplants.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The TGA and its expert advisory committee, the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC), have urgently investigated these reports. ADRAC has today recommended the cancellation of the registration of Lumiracoxib due to the severity of the reported side effects associated with this drug," Dr Hammett said.

"The TGA has taken this advice to cancel the registration of Lumiracoxib in order to prevent further cases of severe liver damage.

"It seems that the longer people are on the medicine, the greater the chance of liver injury. The TGA is, therefore, advising people to stop taking the Lumiracoxib immediately and to discuss alternative treatments with their doctor," Dr Hammett said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603202146/http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New Zealand has followed suit with Australia in recalling Prexige.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10459030"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=278&amp;objectid=10459030 |title=NZ regulators ban arthritis drug |date=21 August 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2007, Health Canada requested sales of Prexige to stop. Novartis has agreed to the request and has taken steps to do so.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novartis.ca/downloads/en/letters/prexige_fact_20071003_e.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2007, the European Medicines Agency recommended the withdrawal for Prexige from all EU markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/PR_Lumiracoxib_57930107en.pdf Press release: European Medicines Agency recommends withdrawal of the marketing authorisations for lumiracoxib-containing medicines, 13 December 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911153940/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/PR_Lumiracoxib_57930107en.pdf |date=11 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2008, the [[Philippines]] [[Department of Health]] ordered [[Novartis]] Healthcare Phils. Inc. (Novartis) to remove (recall) all lumiracoxib from local drug stores in 2 weeks due to the harmful effects of the drug (potential serious [[liver]]-related side effects, hepatotoxicity or malfunction of the [[lung]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=105842  Abs-Cbn Interactive, DOH recalls lumiracoxib, sets two-week deadline]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2008, The [[Brazil]]ian [[National Health Surveillance Agency]] ordered the withdrawal of 100&amp;nbsp;mg formulations of lumiracoxib and suspended marketing of the 400&amp;nbsp;mg formulation for 90 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u425127.shtml |title=Anvisa cancela registro do Prexige; consumidor deve substituir medicamento |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-22 |work=[[Folha de S.

The '''Michigan Womyn's Music Festival''', often referred to as '''MWMF''' or '''Michfest''', and called the "Original Womyn's Woodstock",&lt;ref&gt;Edwalds, Loraine; Stocker, Midge (eds.) ''The Woman-Centered Economy: Ideals, Reality, and the Space in Between'', Third Side Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; was an international [[Feminism|feminist]] [[music festival]] held every August from 1976 to 2015 in [[Oceana County, Michigan]], USA, near [[Hart Township, Michigan|Hart Township]], in a small wooded area referred to as "The Land" by MichFest organizers and attendees.&lt;ref name=loveletter /&gt; The event was completely built, staffed, run and attended by women.

==History==
{{Radical feminism sidebar|expanded=Actions and ideas}}

===Background===
America's first "[[women's music]] festivals" began appearing in the early 1970s, starting with day festivals at the [[California State University, Sacramento|Sacramento State]] and [[San Diego State University]] campuses, the Midwest Women's Festival held in Missouri, the Boston Women's Music Festival, and the National Women's Music Festival at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. These first regional women-only events exposed audiences to feminist and [[Coming out|openly lesbian]] artists, most of whom operated independently of the mainstream recording industry. Festival gatherings offered an alternative to urban bars, coffeehouses and protest marches, which were some of the few opportunities for lesbians to meet one another in the early 1970s.  The [[separatist feminism|feminist separatism]] of the spaces was a direct outgrowth of and solidarity with the activism created by black power and other racial solidarity movements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Levy, Ariel]]. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/02/090302fa_fact_levy "Lesbian Nation"], ''The New Yorker'', March 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 "Letter to the Community", Michfest founder and organizer Lisa Vogel explained MWMF's [[womyn-born womyn]] intention as a [[women-only space]]: "The Festival, for a single precious week, is intended for womyn who at birth were deemed female, who were raised as girls, and who identify as womyn. I believe that womyn-born womyn (WBW) is a lived experience that constitutes its own distinct gender identity."&lt;ref name="Vogel_letter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Letter to the Community|url=http://michfest.com/letter-to-the-community-4_11_13/|website=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|date=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and early years===
As a private, women-only camping event, the Michigan festival was founded in 1976 by 19-year-old Lisa Vogel, who, with sister Kristie Vogel and friend Mary Kindig, planned an event along the lines of the recent Boston Women's Music Festival and the Midwest Women's Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|title=Intense, Unique No-Man's Lands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/26/travel/26ahead.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1982, the Festival, then in its seventh year, moved to its long-term 650-acre location near Hart, Michigan, attracting the largest audience hitherto (upwards of 8,000 campers). Gradually, it added an acoustic stage (and an August night [[open mic]] stage) in addition to day stage and night stage programming. After much discussion, cement-paved walkways were added to ease access for women with mobility challenges and [[Baby transport|baby strollers]]. Barbara "Boo" Price became Lisa Vogel's business partner after the 1985 festival and was increasingly involved with production until the two parted ways in 1994.  The 1980s saw many unique challenges, including the production of a 10th anniversary double album in 1985, the growth of the gathering to five days (with new intensive workshops) by 1986, the extraordinary thunderstorms of the "Harmonic Convergence" year in 1987, and an outbreak of [[shigella]] in 1988 (the swift handling of which was praised by both local and national health inspectors).&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19880820&amp;id=cm8fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=034EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6037,3712374 "Health Agencies In State Warned of Diarrhea Outbreak"], Milwaukee Journal, August 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2006648 | volume=133 | title=An outbreak of shigellosis at an outdoor music festival | journal=Am J Epidemiol | pages=608–15 | last1 = Lee | first1 = LA | last2 = Ostroff | first2 = SM | last3 = McGee | first3 = HB | last4 = Johnson | first4 = DR | last5 = Downes | first5 = FP | last6 = Cameron | first6 = DN | last7 = Bean | first7 = NH | last8 = Griffin | first8 = PM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
During the 1990s the Festival updated structurally and musically to expand styles of stage performance for a new generation of performers, adding a runway to the Night Stage, a [[Moshing|mosh pit]], and acts including the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Tribe 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scauzillo|first=Retts|title=Retts Returns to the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiantravels/a/RettsatMichigan.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=February 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206020219/http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbiantravels/a/RettsatMichigan.htm|archive-date=February 6, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from a personal perspective for the ''Village Voice'' in fall 1994, artist and Festival kitchen worker Gretchen Phillips said: "I had never seen so many breasts before, so many bare asses, so much damn skin on such a vast terrain. I decided to make that weekend all about studying my body issues" and "I've always used Mich as a place to charge my batteries for the rest of the year, planning my life around being there in August and learning my lessons, both fun and hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Gretchen|authorlink=Gretchen Phillips|title=I Moshed at Mich|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=September 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright [[Carolyn Gage]] later said: "At Michfest, she can experience a degree of safety that is not available to any woman any time anywhere except at the festival. And what does that mean? It means she achieves a level of relaxation, physical, psychic, cellular, that she had never experienced before. She is free, sisters. She is free. Often for the first time in her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|title=Hotter Than Hell: The 2011 Lesbian Tent Revival|year=2011|url=http://carolyngage.weebly.com/hotter-than-hell.html|pages=140–41|quote=At Michfest, she can experience a degree of safety that is not available to any woman any time anywhere except at the Festival. And what does that mean? It means she achieves a level of relaxation, physical, psychic, cellular, that she had never experienced before. She is free, sisters. She is free. Often for the first time in her life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, author and feminist scholar [[Bonnie Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/about/department-faculty/bonnie-morris/|title=Bonnie Morris|date=2018|website=Gender &amp; Women's Studies|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it as "An entire city run by and for lesbian feminists. Utopia revealed. And Eden—built by Eves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eden Built By Eves:  The Culture of Women's Music Festivals|last=Morris|first=Bonnie J|publisher=[[Alyson Publications]]|year=1999|isbn=1-55583-477-9|edition=1st|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final Festival ===
MichFest celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2015. On April 21, Lisa Vogel announced via ''[[Facebook]]'' that it would also be the last festival.&lt;ref name=dearsisters /&gt; An  opinion published in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' by a festivalgoer speculated that the ongoing controversy regarding trans women was to blame.&lt;ref name=Minshal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson-Minshal|first1=Diane|title=Op-ed: Michfest's Founder Chose to Shut Down Rather Than Change With the Times|url=https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/04/24/op-ed-michfests-founder-chose-shut-down-rather-change-times|website=The Advocate|date=April 24, 2015|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogel wrote in her statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt; There have been struggles; there is no doubt about that. This is part of our truth, but it is not--and never has been--our defining story. The Festival has been the crucible for nearly every critical cultural and political issue the lesbian feminist community has grappled with for four decades. Those struggles have been a beautiful part of our collective strength; they have never been a weakness.&lt;ref name=dearsisters /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Functioning, activities and services==
Attendance at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival ranged from 3,000 to 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Core|first=Lindsay|title=How the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival's Topless Womyn Changed My Lesbian Life Forever|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/how-the-michigan-womyns-music-festivals-topless-womyn-changed-my-lesbian-life-forever/|newspaper=Autostraddle|date=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women build all of the stages, run the lighting and [[sound reinforcement system|sound systems]], make the trash collection rounds, serve as electricians, mechanics, security, medical and psychological support, cook meals for thousands over open fire pits, provide childcare, and facilitate workshops covering various topics of interest to the attendees, who are referred to as "festies". Hundreds of women spent upwards of a month out on the land building the festival from the ground up because it was torn down after each event ended, leaving the land as close to how it was found as possible.&lt;ref name="curvemag1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Messman-Rucker |first=Ariel |url=http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2008/Welcome-Home-to-the-Michigan-Womyns-Festival/ |title=Welcome Home to the Michigan Womyns Festival |publisher=Curve |date= |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community decisions were made through worker community meetings where the youngest members of the community were given as much access to participate as the oldest. Community service support included ASL translation at every performance, mental and physical health care, AA meetings, camping for disabled women, as well as a tent solely for women of color.  While men were not allowed at the Festival, male children age 4 and under were allowed within the festival. Childcare for girls and boys aged 5 and under is provided by Sprouts, and for 5 and over girls the main venue is "Gaia Girls". There is also teen circle.  Brother Sun Boys Camp was available for boys aged 5 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMahon |first=Becky |url=http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories05/august/0819051.htm |title=Michigan festival, in its 30th year, is like a reunion |publisher=Gay People's Chronicle |date=August 19, 2005 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and performances==
The Festival created a space for performers of all genres to share their music. While many artists had earned mainstream success after their performance at the festival, the Festival supported diverse performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267197, Goldin-Perschbacher, Shana. “Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival."] The Grove Dictionary of American Music (2014). Oxford Music Online. Web. 21 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Genres include classical, jazz, folk, hard rock, acoustic, bluegrass and gospel.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{jstor|25794545}}, "Quinn, Liz. “Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival.” Off Our Backs 14.9 (Oct. 1984): 24-25. Print."&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival created a high-tech production with three stages in a rural outdoor venue.&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjaudio.com/index.php?page=about&amp;category=Crew_Bios&amp;display=6,|title=myrna johnston audio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians and artists who performed at the festival represented a range of lesbian and womyn's art and music, from [[Sarah Bettens]], [[Laura Nyro]], [[Hattie Gossett]], [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Holly Near]], [[Team Dresch]], [[Kathleen Hanna]], [[Tribe 8]], [[Sia Furler|Sia]], [[Staceyann Chin]] and many more.

==Controversy about transgender people==
Controversy over the Festival's determination to remain a space for [[cisgender]] [[females]] led to protests by trans women and their allies, and a boycott of the Festival by Equality Michigan in 2014.&lt;ref name=boycott /&gt; The boycott was joined by the Human Rights Campaign ("HRC"),&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt; the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ("GLAAD"),&lt;ref name=GLAAD /&gt; the National Center for Lesbian Rights ("NCLR"), and the National LGBTQ Task Force ("The Task Force").

In response to the anti-Festival petition, the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival stated:  "MWMF is not just a party. It is a space wherein females—who have been subjected to all manner of degradation from the moment of their first breath—can unpack and put down the oppressions that are directly tied to that experience under patriarchy...Equality Michigan has initiated a petition and call to action against the Festival based on misrepresentations, purposeful omissions, and selective editing of prior Festival statements on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Michfest Response to Equality Michigan’s Call For Boycott|url=http://michfest.com/statement-from-michigan-womyns-music-festival-8_1_4/|website=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Vogel referred to the boycott as "[[McCarthyism|McCarthy-era]] blacklist tactics".&lt;ref name="betweenthelines"&gt;{{cite web|author=BTL Staff|title=Michfest Responds: We Have a Few Demands Of Our Own|url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=67561|website=Pride Source|publisher=[[Between the Lines (newspaper)|Between The Lines]]|date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michfest supporters responded to the shunning with social media posts, letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Bonnie J.|title=Letter to GLAAD|url=http://www.michfestmatters.com/letter-to-glaad-by-bonnie-j-morris-ph-d/|dead-url=yes|publisher=Voices From The Land|date=September 12, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032643/http://www.michfestmatters.com/letter-to-glaad-by-bonnie-j-morris-ph-d/|archivedate=October 22, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and online media presentations such as "Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival".&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and The Truth About the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival|url=http://www.thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|website=thetruthaboutthemichiganfestival.com|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCLR and The Task Force withdrew their support of the boycott,&lt;ref name="windycity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NCLRs-Kate-Kendell-removes-Michfest-boycott-signature/51126.html|title=NCLR and Task Force remove names from Michfest petition|last1=Toce|first1=Sarah|date=April 9, 2015|website=[[Windy City Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Equality Michigan's executive director resigned from the organization.&lt;ref name="gendertrender"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gendertrender.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/creator-of-michfest-boycott-emily-dievendorf-resigns-as-executive-director-of-equality-michigan/|title=Creator of Michfest Boycott Emily Dievendorf Resigns as Executive Director of Equality Michigan|last1=GallusMag|date=April 14, 2015|website=GenderTrender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The womyn-born-womyn intention first came to attention in 1991 after a [[transsexual]] festival-goer, Nancy Burkholder, was asked to leave the festival when several women recognized her as a trans woman and expressed discomfort with her presence in the space.&lt;ref name="transadvocate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Cristan|title=Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival|url=http://transadvocate.com/michigan-womyns-music-festival_n_8943.htm|website=The TransAdvocate|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth" /&gt; In August 2014, Lisa Vogel apologized for this incident, stating:

{{quote|Over 20 years ago, we asked Nancy Burkholder, a trans womon, to leave the Land. That was wrong, and for that, we are sorry. We, alongside the rest of the LGBTQ community, have learned and changed a great deal over our 39‐year history. We speak to you now in 2014 after two decades of evolution; an evolution grown from our willingness to stay in hard conversations, just as we do every year around issues of race, ability, class and gender. Since that single incident, Festival organizers have never asked a trans womon to leave the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have a Few Demands of our Own: Michfest Response to NCLR and HRC endorsing EQM petition to boycott|url=http://michfest.com/we-have-a-few-demands-of-our-own-michfest-response-to-nclr-and-hrc-endorsing-eqm-petition-to-boycott-‐-81814/|website=Michfest (Michigan Womyn's Music Festival)|date=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2005 interview with [[Amy Ray]], Vogel discussed the intention within its informing political framework and stated: "I feel very strongly that having a space for women, who are born women, to come together for a week, is a healthy, whole, loving space to provide for women who have that experience. To label that as [[transphobia|transphobic]] is, to me, as misplaced as saying the women-of-color tent is racist, or to say that a transsexual-only space, a gathering of folks of women who are born men is misogynist. I have always in my heart believed in the politics and the culture of separate time and space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: 2005-06-13: Amy - Michigan Womyn's Fest Interviews: Interview #3|url=http://www.indigogirls.com/correspondence/2005/2005-06-13-a/interview03.html|website=Indigo Girls|date=June 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319145443/http://www.indigogirls.com/correspondence/2005/2005-06-13-a/interview03.html|archivedate=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Burkholder incident, a protest movement against the womyn-born-womyn intention was organized. Opponents contended that it constituted [[discrimination]] against transsexual and [[transgender]] people, many of whom identified as women and were legally female. In 1994, a protest camp was created across the road from the Festival called [[Camp Trans]]&lt;ref name="straight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Press Release|title=Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Sets the Record "Straight"|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/20060822-mwmf.txt|website=Eminism.org|date=August 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later, "Son of Camp Trans").&lt;ref name="mythsandtruth" /&gt; In 2006, a trans woman and Camp Trans organizer named Lorraine was sold a ticket at the box office.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Supporters of trans women inclusion then issued a press release declaring, incorrectly, that the womyn-born-womyn objective was no longer in effect.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In response, Lisa Vogel reiterated the Festival's adherence to the intention, and also confronted the distribution of misinformation and accusations of [[transphobia]] by Camp Trans, in an August 2006 press release:

{{Quote|"From its inception the Festival has been home to womyn who could be considered gender outlaws, either because of their sexual orientation (lesbian, bisexual, polyamorous, etc.) or their gender presentation (butch, bearded, androgynous, femme - and everything in between). Many womyn producing and attending the Michigan Festival are gender variant womyn...We strongly assert there is nothing transphobic with choosing to spend one week with womyn who were born as, and have lived their lives as, womyn...Supporting womyn-born womyn space is no more inherently transphobic than supporting womyn of color space is racist."&lt;ref name="straight" /&gt;}}

The Michigan Womyn's Music Festival staunchly defended its raison d'être, described by Vogel as "a predominantly lesbian community...defined by lesbian culture" with "a focus on the experience of those born female, who've lived their lives subjected to oppression based on the sole fact of their being female."&lt;ref name="betweenthelines" /&gt; In her statement, Vogel added that "it is not the inclusion of trans women at Festival that we resist; it is the erasure of the specificity of female experience."&lt;ref name="betweenthelines" /&gt;

The protests against womyn-born womyn spaces resulted in some artists who had been invited to and/or performed at the Festival losing contracts or forced to cancel appearances because of their support, or their appearance of support, for the festival's intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill-Meyer|first1=Tobi|title=Bitch Pulled From Festival Lineup|url=http://bilerico.lgbtqnation.com/2010/05/bitch_pulled_from_festival_lineup.php|website=The Bilerico Project|publisher=LGBTQ Nation|date=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other performers were physically threatened by pro-inclusion supporters, faced verbal harassment and bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to the violence against the Butchies and Le Tigre|url=http://eminism.org/michigan/20011007-carns.txt|website=Eminism.org|date=October 7, 2001|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, filmmaker Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to resign from the board of the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp for attending the festival (the organization's Festival-related team had raised funds for BAGRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=St. Martin Lynne|first1=Sara|title=Letter of Resignation from the Board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp|url=http://fishwithoutabicycle.com/2013/10/16/letter-of-resignation-from-the-board-of-bay-area-girls-rock-camp|website=Fish Without a Bicycle|date=October 16, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024010809/http://fishwithoutabicycle.com/2013/10/16/letter-of-resignation-from-the-board-of-bay-area-girls-rock-camp|archivedate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an April 2013 [[Change.org]] petition by trans activist Red Durkin asking performers to boycott MWMF until trans women were included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heated debate follows Michigan Fest boycott petition|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Heated-debate-follows-Michigan-Fest-boycott-petition/42349.html|website=[[Windy City Times]]|date=April 12, 2013|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Vogel released a statement reaffirming the Festival's viewpoint:

{{Quote|"I reject the assertion that creating a time and place for WBW to gather is inherently transphobic. This is a false dichotomy and one that prevents progress and understanding. I believe in the integrity of autonomous space used to gather and celebrate for any group, whether that autonomous space is defined by age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, gender, class or any other identity. Whatever spaces we carve out in our community to encourage healing and rejuvenation should be accepted, and we should support each other in this endeavor. Nobody should be asked to erase the need for autonomous spaces to demonstrate that they are sisters in struggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Lisa|title=Letter to the Community|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2013/Letter-to-the-Community/|website=[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]|date=April 11, 2013|accessdate=April 27, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924233052/http://www.curvemag.com/Curve-Magazine/Web-Articles-2013/Letter-to-the-Community/|archivedate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Michfest Half-Way Soirée==
For years, women created small gatherings outside of the festival and August in their own local communities, consisting mostly of small house parties and potlucks. After attending a festival in August 2004 and a pre-fest potluck, festie and entrepreneur, Lisa A. Snyder, was inspired to take the gatherings to the next level by creating a party that highlighted pieces of the festival in the middle of New York City. In 2005, she created the very first "Michfest Half-Way Soirée", a party that supported the local Michigan Womyn's Music Festival community, female musicians, and women-owned businesses. The worker community and festie community were encouraged to co-mingle and introduce new "festie virgins" to feel a slice of the festival energy, halfway to August. The benefit, the first of its kind (started by Snyder in [[New York City]]) also created buzz about the festival, appearing several times in ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' New York &lt;ref name="Own This City - Life in New York"&gt;{{cite web|last=London|first=Syd|title=We were there: Michigan Womyn's Music Festival Benefit|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/things-to-do/own-this-city-blog/86336/we-were-there-michigan-womyns-music-festival-benefit|publisher=Time Out New York|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and most recently in the February 2011 issue of ''[[GO (American magazine)|GO]]'' in "The Very Best of New York City Music" section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Stephanie|title=The Very Best of NYC Music|journal=Go Magazine|date=February 2011|issue=February 2011 Issue|url=http://www.gomag.com/article/the_very_best_of_nyc_musi20/|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, additional locations for the Half-Way to Michfest Parties (sometimes also called Mid-Way Parties or Michfest Half-Way Parties) have begun to pop up across the United States. Known locations include [[Chicago]]; [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Boston]]; [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]; [[Santa Cruz, California]]; [[Syracuse, New York]]; [[Long Beach, California]]; [[Western Massachusetts]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]] and [[Bellingham, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=V|first=Kingsley|title=Half Way to Michfest Parties|url=http://www.alotoflife.com/Vs_Version_Blog/Entries/2009/1/26_Half_Way_to_Michfest_Parties.html|accessdate=10 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226163352/http://www.alotoflife.com/Vs_Version_Blog/Entries/2009/1/26_Half_Way_to_Michfest_Parties.html|archive-date=26 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of the musicals tryout in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], it was announced that the show would transfer to the [[Noel Coward Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/west-end-transfer-mrs-henderson-presents_38910.html | title=Mrs Henderson Presents transfers to the West End | publisher=Whats On Stage | website=whatsonstage.com | date=9 October 2015 | accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an official opening night of 16 February 2016, following previews from 9 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/tracie-bennett-to-star-in-new-british-musical-based-on-mrs.-hendersons-presents-366459 | title=Tracie Bennett To Star in New British Musical Based on "Mrs. Henderson's Presents" | publisher=[[Playbill]] | website=playbill.com | date=9 October 2015 | accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the cast reprised their roles with the exceptions of [[Mark Hadfield]], who was replaced in the role of Arthur by former [[EastEnders]] actor [[Jamie Foreman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/Full-Cast-Announced-for-MRS-HENDERSON-PRESENTS-Jamie-Foreman-Robert-Hands-and-More-Join-Tracie-Bennett-and-Ian-Bartholomew-Feb-16-20160107 | title=Full Cast Announced for MRS.

The West End show garnered mixed reviews and closed after its initial four month run. No official reason was given for the close although it is not believed to have been a financial success.  In her 2 star review for the [[Evening Standard]], Fiona Mountford stated that the musical "shares with the film a desperate lack of momentum", and of the songs, "none are memorable".&lt;ref name="Evening Standard 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mrs Henderson Presents: Windmill girls story leaves nasty taste | website=Evening Standard | date=February 17, 2016 | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/mrs-henderson-presents-theatre-review-windmill-girls-licked-hitler-but-their-story-leaves-a-nasty-a3182551.html | accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 4 star review for [[The Stage]], [[Mark Shenton]] stated that the show "doesn't shy from occasional hard edges. Instead, by concentrating on the backstage lives of the dancers and management of the Windmill,  there's more of a jaunty, frequently patriotic, flavour to it – that both sings and occasionally stings.&lt;ref name="The Stage 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mrs Henderson Presents review at Noel Coward Theatre | website=The Stage | date=February 17, 2016 | url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2016/mrs-henderson-presents-review-at-the-noel-coward-theatre-london/ | accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its opening in London it was announced that the production would transfer to Toronto in early 2017 and the production opened on March 15, 2017 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Canada where it played a limited engagement until April 23, 2017. The show was essentially recast although [[Tracie Bennett]] reprised the role of Mrs Henderson, with the cast also including [[Peter Polycarpou]] and [[Evelyn Hoskins]] as Maureen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/toronto/article/The-Canadian-Premiere-of-the-West-End-Hit-Musical-MRS-HENDERSON-PRESENTS-Begins-315-20170308|title=The Canadian Premiere of the West End Hit Musical MRS HENDERSON PRESENTS Begins 3/15|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Museum of Ice Cream''', started in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], is an interactive art exhibit with [[ice cream]] and candy themed exhibits, all brightly colored, in a maze of rooms containing "among other things, a rock-candy cave, a unicorn, and a swimming pool of rainbow sprinkles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/10/museum-of-ice-cream-maryellis-bunn.html|title=The Millennial Walt Disney Wants to Turn Empty Stores Into Instagram Playgrounds|first=Anna|last=Wiener|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibits are very often the backdrop for [[selfies]], and the many selfies posted to [[Instagram]], [[Flickr]], [[Facebook]], and other social media sites have served to promote the exhibit.  Each visitor is offered numerous tastings throughout.  Tickets must be purchased in advance for specific time slots online only.

The term "museum" was chosen for the temporary art exhibition because it was something people would understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2017/05/19/the-25-year-old-behind-the-museum-of-ice-cream|title=The 25-Year-Old Behind The Museum Of Ice Cream|first=Susan|last=Adams|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was co-founded by Maryellis Bunn, from [[Laguna Beach]], and Manish Vora, previously of equity research firm Monness, Crespi &amp; Hardt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/manish-vora-artlog-2011-8|title=Why This Guy Left Wall Street To Launch An Art Industry Startup|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition is the brainchild of Maryellis Bunn who was looking for a way to connect to [[millennial]] audiences.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2017/05/19/the-25-year-old-behind-the-museum-of-ice-cream|title=The 25-Year-Old Behind The Museum Of Ice Cream|first=Susan|last=Adams|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She said "It's all about fun, and feeling like a kid again.  Everyone loves ice cream. It's a way to bring people together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/15/museum-of-ice-cream-comes-to-san-francisco-why-so-crazy-popular/|title=Museum of Ice Cream comes to San Francisco: Why so crazy popular?|date=15 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exhibit first opened in Manhattan in the summer of 2016 and has since opened in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museumoficecream.com/miami/|title=Miami|website=MUSEUM OF ICE CREAM|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been wildly popular, with celebrity visitors including [[Katy Perry]], [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and on Mother's Day, [[Jay-Z]], [[Beyoncé]], and [[Blue Ivy]] were photographed lounging in the museum's Sprinkle Pool.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The San Francisco exhibit sold out its first batch of tickets in 18 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-museum-of-ice-cream-san-francisco-2017-9/#the-new-museum-of-ice-cream-is-located-inside-an-iconic-old-bank-on-grant-avenue-1|title=San Francisco's Museum of Ice Cream has a sprinkle pool and a Pop Rocks cave — here's what it's like|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2017 the exhibitions combined have had over 500,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/news/museum-ice-cream-miami|title=The Museum of Ice Cream Is Coming to Miami|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">'''Nacht van de Wansmaak''' (Translation: "Night of Repulsion") is a Flemish-Dutch film festival dedicated to [[cult film]]s, [[exploitation film]]s and other bizarre B-films.

==Concept==
The festival is organized by Belgian film director [[Jan Verheyen (film director)|Jan Verheyen]] (under the alias of "[[Mad Max|Max Rockatansky]]") and Dutch film director and journalist [[Jan Doense]] (under the alias of "Mr. Horror"). They provide the live introduction to each movie and [[film trailer]] shown at the festival. The event tours throughout the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]] during all the important film theaters in [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht]], [[Groningen]], [[Enschede]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Vlissingen]], [[Ghent]], [[Hasselt]], [[Antwerp]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Biddinghuizen]], [[Vlieland]], [[Arnhem]],  [[Breda]], [[Koersel]]-[[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Leiden]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Roeselare]], [[Deventer]], [[Zwolle]] and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nachtvandewansmaak.nl/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Verheyen organized a "Nacht van de Rariteiten" ("Night of the Oddities") film festival in ''De Vooruit'' in Ghent. Despite having a low attendance of only 12 people the idea was reorganized into a full-blown film festival on 28 April 1990 in Rotterdam, which had more success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gorehoundinc.com/nachtvandewansmaak/achtergrond.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new name "Nacht van de Wansmaak" the festival became a recurring event in 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004-2006 and again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gorehoundinc.com/nachtvandewansmaak/achtergrond.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s and early 2000s Verheyen also presented a TV show on the Flemish network Kanaal 2 (nowadays [[2BE (TV channel)|2BE]]) under the title "Nacht van de Wansmaak".

In 2003 two DVD's with trailers of obscure B-movies were released.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.despil.be/e1881/nacht-van-de-wansmaak&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmsalon.be/wansmaak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Year's Eve in London''', a [[New Year's Eve]] firework display, is celebrated along the [[Victoria Embankment]] and [[South Bank]] areas of the [[River Thames]] where the [[London Eye]] and [[Big Ben]] are situated. The countdown is accompanied by the chimes of Big Ben, and a digital countdown timer projected onto the [[Shell Centre]], until 2017. The fireworks are launched off the London Eye at midnight. A company, Titanium Fireworks are responsible for the pyrotechnics.

==History==

===2000–05===
The first major [[New Year's Eve]] fireworks display in London was planned in December 1999 to celebrate the year 2000. It was estimated by the BBC that about 3 million people turned up around the Thames to watch the fireworks display. A "river of fire" was planned to accompany the fireworks display, but failed to make an impact. A fireworks display was planned during 2000 to celebrate 2001, but was cancelled in November due to a dispute between then-[[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]] and the [[London Underground]].&lt;ref name=NYE2000&gt;{{cite news|title=London New Year's party cancelled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1032426.stm|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=BBC News Online|date=20 November 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811102442/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1032426.stm|archivedate=11 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar disputes also occurred, causing displays to be cancelled for both the 2001–02 and 2002–03 celebrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture, Sport and Tourism Committee|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/past_ctees/cst/2002/cstnov20/cstnov20mins.pdf|publisher=London Assembly|accessdate=30 May 2014|date=20 November 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817161912/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/past_ctees/cst/2002/cstnov20/cstnov20mins.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although approximately 80,000 revellers gathered around [[Trafalgar Square]] to celebrate the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A damp squib: the Mayor's plans for New Year's Eve|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/culture/nye2002_report.pdf|publisher=London Assembly|accessdate=30 May 2014|date=1 December 2002|quote=Report of the Culture, Sport and Tourism Committee – December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005002514/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/culture/nye2002_report.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short three-year hiatus, for the 2003–04 event, there were fireworks though only for three minutes. For the 2004–05 event, in the run-up to midnight, an image of candles was projected onto the Shell Centre as a tribute to the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubenfeld|first=Vik|title=Happy New Year!|url=http://www.bigpicweblog.com/exp/index.php/weblog/monthly_archives/C21/P30/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Big Picture (magazine)|The Big Picture]]|date=1 January 2005|quote=New Year's Eve, London—An Image of Candles is Projected onto the Shell Building (left) as a Tribute to the Victims of the Asian Tsunami (REUTERS/Matt Dunham)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124545/http://www.bigpicweblog.com/exp/index.php/weblog/monthly_archives/C21/P30/|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at midnight, fireworks were launched from the wheel itself for the first time.

===2011–12===
For the 2011–12 extravaganza, fireworks were fired in a one-off event from Elizabeth Tower, launching from the top of the building outwards above the many spectators and well wishers below, welcoming in the year in which London went on to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="NYE2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=London gets ready for New Year's Eve's firework display|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16363248|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209122612/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16363248|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fireworks were launched in the shape and colour of the [[Olympic flag]], in a display that lasted approximately eleven minutes compared to being reduced to eight minutes in 2010.&lt;ref name="NYE2011" /&gt;

===2012–13===
The 2012–13 display was based on both the diamond jubilee and the Olympics. The [[Queen's Christmas speech]] was used in the firework display for the first time.&lt;ref name="NYE2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=London enjoys new year fireworks display|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20874115|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=BBC News Online|date=1 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212114103/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20874115|archivedate=12 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013–14===
The theme of the 2013–14 fireworks was 'Firsts' a projection prior to the fireworks featured Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]] talking about the many 'firsts' that have come from the United Kingdom and London itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vodafone joins forces with Mayor for world's first multi-sensory fireworks display|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/media/mayor-press-releases/2013/12/vodafone-joins-forces-with-mayor-for-worlds-first-multi-sensory|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Greater London Authority]]|date=9 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528183811/http://www.london.gov.uk/media/mayor-press-releases/2013/12/vodafone-joins-forces-with-mayor-for-worlds-first-multi-sensory|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to explain the 2013–14 fireworks would the "world first" multi-sensory fireworks display with fruit flavoured sweets and [[radio controlled]] [[LED]] bracelets which had previously been used during [[Coldplay]]'s [[Mylo Xyloto Tour]] and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|London 2012 Paralympics Closing Ceremony]] being handed out to revellers when entering the viewing areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vodafone Announces 'Vodafone Firsts' New Global Own-Brand Engagement Strategy|url=http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/media/vodafone-group-releases/2013/vodafone-announces-vodafone-firsts-new-global-brand-engagement.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Vodafone UK|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sweets were as stated in the information leaflet to be eaten prior to the display to "prepare" spectators with the flavours that they were going to experience during the evening. Scented mists and edible flavoured foam were also sprayed throughout the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Multisensory Fireworks|url=http://bompasandparr.com/projects/view/flavour-fireworks|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Bompas &amp; Parr|date=19 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104082308/http://bompasandparr.com/projects/view/flavour-fireworks|archivedate=4 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revellers usher in 2014 with fireworks and fruit mist|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/01/uk-usa-new-years-idUKBRE9BU0LH20140101|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=1 January 2014|author=Victoria Cavaliere|author2=Eric M.

===2014–15===
For the 2014–15 display, the designer of the display stated that the fireworks would focus on London being a world-class city and how it can continue its repetition on being one. It was also focused on how the New Year's event in London was special to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/designing-londons-new-years-eve-fireworks/3039586.article|title=Designing London's New Year's Eve fireworks – Design Week|author=|date=19 December 2014|work=DesignWeek.co.uk|access-date=5 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231175812/http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/designing-londons-new-years-eve-fireworks/3039586.article|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014–15 display was the subject of controversy as a £10 charge was introduced by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, for tickets to the official viewing areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year's Eve revellers without tickets warned away from London fireworks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-london-fireworks|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=1 January 2015|date=31 December 2014|author=Ben Quinn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101030802/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-london-fireworks|archivedate=1 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–16===
For the 2015–16 display, the Mayor of London announced a partnership with [[UNICEF]] to raise money for the charity from the profits made during the evening. The [[Elizabeth Tower]] clock face, London Eye and the surrounding areas were lit in blue to support the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/london-new-years-eve-with-unicef |title=Mayor's New Year's Eve fireworks display with Unicef |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229033531/https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/london-new-years-eve-with-unicef |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016–17===
New Mayor of London [[Sadiq Khan]] stated the 2016–17 display will be the "most exciting New Year fireworks yet for the city". {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Khan announced a partnership with the BBC to film the fireworks in 360 degrees. The fireworks display paid homage to [[Prince (singer)|Prince]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Ronnie Corbett]] who died in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2016-12-31/london-new-years-eve-fireworks-2016 |title=London New Year's Eve Fireworks 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229032254/https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2016-12-31/london-new-years-eve-fireworks-2016 |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017–18===
The 2017–18 firework display featured a soundtrack dominated by female artists such as [[Ariana Grande]], [[Little Mix]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Dua Lipa]] and [[Florence Welch]] which was played to mark the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|centenary of women being allowed to vote]]. Big Ben also chimed at midnight amid ongoing repairs. For the first time, the 60 second countdown was only projected from 15 seconds instead of the full 60 seconds due to Big Ben's accuracy being different due to the repair work being carried out on the tower and the bell. In addition, the London Eye's capsules also marked the countdown with each of them lighting down from 10 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/girl-power-to-rock-the-show-at-londons-new-years-eve-firework-display-11364239541698|title=Girl power to rock the show at London's New Year's Eve firework display|work=BT.com|access-date=28 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052401/http://home.bt.com/news/uk-news/girl-power-to-rock-the-show-at-londons-new-years-eve-firework-display-11364239541698|archivedate=29 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/security-for-new-years-eve-celebrations-reviewed-met-police-says-11187374 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228162720/https://news.sky.com/story/security-for-new-years-eve-celebrations-reviewed-met-police-says-11187374 |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariana Grande's [[One Last Time (Ariana Grande song)|One Last Time]] was played as part of the soundtrack to the firework display with 22 red fireworks to pay tribute to the 22 people who died in the [[Manchester Arena bombing|Manchester Arena attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/ariana-grande-leads-london-new-years-eve-fireworks-soundtrack-2201143|title=Ariana Grande leads the London New Year's Eve fireworks soundtrack|date=2018-01-01|work=NME|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5225529/Poignant-moment-London-saw-2018-Ariana-Grande-song.html|title=Poignant moment London saw in 2018 with Ariana Grande song|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/898655/new-years-eve-fireworks-london-eye-nye-pictures-latest-2018-celebrations|title=Happy New Year!

===2018-19===
It is unknown if Big Ben will be able to chime due to repair works on the tower which last until 2021, but however  Big Ben’s clock hands were taken off in April, so for the first time ever the next event could all be digitally timed. It is known that lots of people will show up.

==Music==
Since 2010–11, musical soundtracks have been played during the fireworks. In 2010–11, 2011–12 and 2014–15, [[BBC Radio 1]] provided the soundtrack to the firework displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Year 2011 fireworks at London Eye to have musical soundtrack|url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4957|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=London SE1|date=23 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230231904/http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4957|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012–13, 2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2018-19, Bounce, a music editing company based in London, provided the soundtrack to the displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbounce.com/clients|title=Clients|website=thisisbounce.com|access-date=10 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112182508/http://www.thisisbounce.com/clients|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally an indoor tennis court (''[[jeu de paume]]'') it was converted by the Italian designer [[Carlo Vigarani]] into a theatre which was used by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s [[Paris Opera]] from 15 November 1672 to 1 February 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, p. 299; Harris-Warrick 1992, p. 856.&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the [[Rue de Vaugirard]], just west of the city moat (''fossé'') and the Rue des Fossés Monsieur-le-Prince (now the [[Rue Monsieur-le-Prince]]). Today the site of the former theatre extends into the Rue de Médicis, just south of no. 15 (or 13 bis) Rue de Vaugirard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xLgxAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA284-IA1 Nuitter &amp; Thoinan 1886, after p. 284].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lully's ''Les fêtes de l'Amour et de Bacchus'' opened at the Salle du Bel-Air in November 1672. This was followed by his first ''[[tragédie lyrique]]'', ''[[Cadmus et Hermione]]'', on 27 April 1673. The theatre was equipped with stage machinery, but Lully regarded it as temporary. After [[Molière]] died on 17 February 1673, Lully convinced [[King Louis XIV]] to allow him to use Molière's [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|theatre at the Palais-Royal]] free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick 1992, p. 856.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharwin I''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شروین) was the fifth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 772 to 817. He was the son and successor of [[Surkhab II]].

== Background ==
In 760, during the reign of Sharwin's father Surkhab II, [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]], the head of the [[Dabuyid dynasty]] that had ruled Tabaristan since the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], revolted against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Khurshid was defeated and poisoned himself after learning that his family had been captured by the Abbasids.&lt;ref name="Madelung200"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of the Dabuyid dynasty, but other minor dynasties in the region such as the [[Bavandids]], [[House of Karen|Karenids]] and [[Zarmihrids]], who were all formerly subject to the Dabuyids, continued to control parts of Tabaristan as tributary vassals of the Abbasid government.

== Biography ==
[[Image:Tabaristan-EN.svg|thumb|right|260px|Map of [[Tabaristan]].]]
In 772, Surkhab II died, and was succeeded by Sharwin I. During the same period, [[Khalid ibn Barmak]], the Abbasid governor of Tabaristan, left the region. Shortly after Khalid's departure, the Karenid ruler [[Vandad Hormozd]] sent Sharwin a letter which urged him to revolt against the Abbasids. Sharwin accepted,&lt;ref name="IbnIsfandiyar911"&gt;Ibn Isfandiyar, p. 128-132&lt;/ref&gt; and along with Vandad Hormozd and the Zarmihrid ruler revolted against the Abbasids. Sharwin then began destroying the cities built by the Muslims in the region, and in 782, along with Vandad Hormozd, exterminated all the Muslims in Tabaristan. During the same period, the Karenids assumed the former Dabuyid title of ''Gilgilan'',&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while Sharwin assumed the title of ''[[Padishkhwargar|Padashwargarshah]]'' ("King of the Mountains").&lt;ref name="MadelungBavand"&gt;Madelung (1984), pp. 747–753&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharwin and the other rulers of Tabaristan managed to repel several Arab invasions of Tabaristan, until they were finally defeated in 785, and once again agreed to pay tribute to the Abbasid caliphs.

In 805, the Abbasid caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] visited [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] where he met Sharwin and Vandad Hormozd, who reaffirmed their submission to him and promised to pay tax. In order to ensure their loyalty, Harun took Sharwin's grandson [[Shahriyar I]] and Vandad Hormozd's son Karin as hostages to [[Baghdad]]. The two princes were allowed to return to Tabaristan after Harun's death four years later.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharwin died in 817, and was succeeded by his grandson Shahriyar I.

"'''So Cruel'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the sixth track on their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', concluding side one of the album. The song was written at Elsinore in [[Dalkey]]. While audio engineer [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] changed reels to listen to a demo of another song, lead singer [[Bono]] began to improvise a song on guitar. The rest of the band quickly joined in, creating the first take of the song. It was developed as an acoustic track, with Flood adding overdubs and additional elements later. Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] and Flood noted that the technology in the studio was crucial in transforming the acoustic song into the final mix.

During the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'', guitarist [[the Edge]] separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. The separation had a major effect on the development of the song, as Bono channelled their pain into the lyrics. Bono said "there were lots of other things going on internally within the band and outside it, and I was working through all of that", noting that the Edge's separation from Aislinn was just one component of that. Thematically the song is about unrequited love, jealousy, obsession, and possessiveness.

U2 have performed "So Cruel" live just four times, all of which were on the [[Zoo TV Tour]] in 1992. The track was favourably received by critics.

==Writing and inspiration==
"So Cruel" was developed by lead singer [[Bono]]. Following the recording sessions at [[Hansa Studios]] in [[West Berlin]] in 1990, U2 resumed the album's sessions in February 1991 at the seaside manor Elsinore in [[Dalkey]], renting the house for ₤10,000 per month.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1994_articles/mar94/u2robbieadams.html |title=ROBBIE ADAMS: U2's Achtung Baby &amp; Zooropa |journal=[[Sound on Sound]] |first=Paul |last=Tingen |date=March 1994 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGee (2008), pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Daniel Lanois]]' strategy was to record in houses, mansions, or castles, as he believed it brought atmosphere to the recordings.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt; During the recording at Elsinore, while working on another song, [[Audio engineering|audio engineer]] [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] changed the [[reel]] to listen to an earlier take. Bono picked up a guitar and began to sing. The rest of the band quickly joined in. Flood said, "All of a sudden, almost in the time it had taken for me to wind off the reel and wind the next reel on, it was quite obvious that there was a song about to pop out, and if I wasn't suddenly taking the reel off and getting a new piece of tape on, and changing from monitoring a backing track downstairs to everybody's in the control room wanting to record now, it would never have happened."&lt;ref&gt;Beyda (2000), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

"So Cruel" was developed acoustically, with guitarist [[the Edge]] playing an acoustic guitar, bassist [[Adam Clayton]] playing an [[Acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]], and drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] using a [[bodhrán]].&lt;ref name="U2228" /&gt; Author John D. Luerssen interpreted the song as beginning "with the same kind of basic approach to songcraft that gave wings to '[[She's a Mystery to Me]]'".&lt;ref&gt;Luerssen (2010), pp. 258-259&lt;/ref&gt; Bono said that "People thought it was too traditional, one more attempt at writing a song for [[Roy Orbison]]".&lt;ref name="U2228"&gt;McCormick (2006), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrically, it was also inspired by [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]. Bono said, "His is a very delicate mode of expression on the outside, though too often it is laced underneath with a lot of pain and rage."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;

According to Clayton, Flood "did a couple of treatments to the track that utterly transformed it." He [[Dynamic range compression#Side-chaining|keyed]] Clayton's bass with the bodhrán, which "gave it a much more bubbly, off-beat feel".&lt;ref name="U2228" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g45"&gt;Graham (2004), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by some [[overdub]]bing and the laying down of a full drum track. Flood said, "I think the way we shifted around the rhythm was very important... The bass is played, but in the studio we doctored it to change the emphasis of where the bass line lay. That turned it into something that had a more unique feel about it, meshed against the song."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; Duchess Nell Catchpole was brought in to play [[violin]] and [[viola]] for the song. The strings were arranged by the Edge and producer [[Brian Eno]].&lt;ref name="ABnotes" /&gt; Clayton explained that while the original acoustic version "wasn't something one could imagine being on the record", it "was lifted up by studio trickery."&lt;ref name="U2228" /&gt; Flood believes that the use of technology was crucial in making the final mix.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; An early version of the track was later released on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of ''Achtung Baby''.

[[File:The edge u2 at brasilia 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=|The Edge (pictured in 2011) separated from his wife during the recording of ''Achtung Baby''. Their painful emotions were channelled in the lyrics.]]

During the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'', the Edge separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'."&lt;ref name="FTSD"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=U2, [[Davis Guggenheim]] (Director) |title=[[From the Sky Down]] |medium=film |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide|BBC Worldwide Canada]] |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose."&lt;ref name="FTSD" /&gt; ''[[Hot Press]]'' editor [[Niall Stokes]] noted that in the lyrics, "Bono is clearly drawing on the experiences of those close to him, and particularly on the emotional turmoil that the Edge and Aislinn had been going through."&lt;ref name="Stokes"&gt;Stokes (2005), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Bono said "that's in there, but it's unfair to lump it all on the Edge and Aislinn splitting up. That was one of the saddest things... But that was only one part of it. There were lots of other things going on internally within the band and outside it, and I was working through all of that. People are desperately trying to hold onto each other in a time when that's very difficult. Looking around, you see how unprepared for it all people are, and the deals they make."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;

Thematically, "So Cruel" also deals with unrequited love, jealousy, obsession, and possessiveness.&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g49"&gt;Graham (2004), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Stokes described it as "the desolate complaint of a lover who has been spurned but who remains in love with his tormentor."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; ''Uncut'' contributor Gavin Martin said "the lyrics of the song reinforce the idea of ''Achtung Baby'' as a kind of romantic masque, where images of love, debased or abandoned, abound."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; Elizabeth Wurtzel of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' noted "with its lovely string arrangements, winding keyboards, and frothy, hypnotic melodies, is reminiscent of [[Tommy James and the Shondells|Tommy James]]'s "[[Crimson and Clover]]", except that every lovingly sweet line is contrasted with a bitterly ironic counter line", citing the lyric "I disappeared in you / You disappeared from me / I gave you everything you wanted / It wasn't what you wanted" as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Wurtzel (2003), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Hubert Dreyfuss, a Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and Mark Wrathall, a Humanities Professor at [[Brigham Young University]] believed that the song was an exploration into philosophical [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Quoting the lyric "Head of heaven, fingers in the mire", they said "if we are essentially dual in this way, then any attempt to overcome one side in favour of the other inevitably ends in despair", comparing the underlying philosophy to [[Blaise Pascal]]'s ''[[Pensées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfuss (2006), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Višnja Cogan wrote "Women... never get treated badly in U2 songs... Women are put on a pedestal by Bono, his mother's untimely death being undoubtedly one of the reasons. If anything, in some of the songs on ''Achtung Baby'', it is the man who gets the raw deal. On 'So Cruel', it is the man who is the victim of a woman. It is the reverse of the classical torch song".&lt;ref name="Cogan"&gt;Cogan (2008), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting the lyric "Her skin is pale like God's only dove / Screams like an angel for your love / Then she makes you watch her from above / And you need her like a drug", he added "The man is manipulated by the woman's sexual power. He is incapable of pulling himself out of this relationship and despite his best efforts, he comes back to her."&lt;ref name="Cogan" /&gt; He noted that the woman is portrayed as "cruel, unreliable and unfaithful. She can only betray him and the duality between love and lust is well depicted in the song." Cogan concluded by saying "unlike the classical torch song, this one ends with the man seemingly deciding to leave the woman... The only thing we don't know in the end is whether he actually acts on his promise or not."&lt;ref name="Cogan" /&gt;

Conversely, author Deane Galbraith believed the song was told from the woman's viewpoint, saying "a woman is unable to receive love without also hating those who love her. She acts simultaneously as tender lover and cruel sadist. The lyrics that describe her 'like an angel' are immediately juxtaposed with a more sordid description that pictures her love as an addictive and manipulative drug. Instead of the subtle and vivifying transcendence of a heavenly angel, when she offers to take her lover higher, he is forced to watch her while she controls him 'from above'. For this is a fallen angel, not purely good or evil, but a lover whose best intentions are insidiously corrupt".&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith (2011), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
"So Cruel" was favourably received by critics. ''Hot Press'' editor Niall Stokes called it "dark, bitter, intense and masochistic", believing the lyrics to be the aspect that made the song memorable. He added, "As a statement about marital infidelity, the sense of betrayal that accompanies it and the rage that almost inevitably follows, it would be hard to surpass."&lt;ref name="Stokes" /&gt; ''Uncut'' contributor Gavin Martin rated the song four stars, calling it "lustful and lustrous". He said that "the Edge's looped five-note piano motif is encircled by a sabre-rattling guitar and a fine synthesized string part; lushly multi-dimensional, pregnant with poise and feeling" and that the theme of "marital disharmony and emotional desolation" underpinning ''Achtung Baby'' was especially evident on the song.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Gavin |date=April 2009 |title=Achtung Baby |journal=The Ultimate Music Guide |issue=U2 |pages=74–77 |publisher=''Uncut''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Potter of ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' wrote that it was "riddled with images of self-doubt and uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Achtung Baby: faith and flesh with a kick |newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |first=Greg |last=Potter |page=6 |date=21 November 1991 |quote=While songs such as One, Until the End of the World, So Cruel and the dour closer Love is Blindness are riddled with images of self-doubt and uncertainty, they are countered by the uplifting cadences of Even Better than the Real Thing, Mysterious Ways and Acrobat.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elysa Gardner of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "Bono sounds humbler and more vulnerable than in the past", noting that he "[acknowledges] his own potential for hypocrisy and inadequacy, and addressing basic human weaknesses rather than the failings of society at large".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/achtung-baby-19920109 |title=U2's 'Achtung Baby': Bring the Noise |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=9 January 1992 |issue=621 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
U2 have only performed "So Cruel" four times live, all of which were on the [[Zoo TV Tour]]. The first appearance was on 22 May 1992 in Milan, Italy, on the second leg of the tour when, at the end of "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]", Bono sang a few lines of "So Cruel" in place of "[[All I Want Is You (U2 song)|All I Want Is You]]".&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1992, a few days prior to the commencement of the third leg of the tour, U2 rehearsed the song in Hershey, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; The second performance in concert was on 22 August 1992 in Foxboro, Massachusetts. Bono performed the song acoustically. Concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra said that it "[chilled] the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;de la Parra (2003), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The final performances occurred on 9 and 15 September 1992 in Pontiac, Michigan, and Chicago, Illinois respectively. On both occasions it was played in place of "All I Want Is You". Abbreviated performances, recorded at Hansa studios, appear in the 2011 documentary ''[[From the Sky Down]]''.&lt;ref name="FTSD" /&gt;

==Covers==
[[Depeche Mode]] reworked the song for the 2011 tribute album ''[[AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered]]''. "We first heard ''Achtung Baby'' working on ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]]," remarked [[Martin Gore]]. "It was the closest our bands ever got: U2 had become more [[Electronic music|electronic]], while Depeche Mode were working on a new rock vision. But there was never a rivalry. Bono used reverse psychology in his email ''(requesting the band's participation in the tribute album)'', saying he totally understood why we'd say no. We just thought, 'Why not?' 'So Cruel' is Bono at his best, words-wise. And we couldn't tackle '[[One (U2 song)|One]]' – that would be almost [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What's On Your Free CD?|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|date=December 2011|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Splinter.jpg|thumb|Splinter]]

A '''splinter''' is a fragment of a larger object (especially [[Timber|wood]]), or a [[foreign body]] that penetrates or is purposely injected into a body. The foreign body must be lodged inside tissue to be considered a splinter. Splinters may cause initial pain through ripping of flesh and muscle, infection through bacteria on the foreign object, and severe internal damage through migration to vital organs or bone over time.
 
Splinters commonly consist of [[wood]], but there are many other types. According to the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), common types of splinters are glass, plastic, metal, and spines of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Capellan O, Hollander, JE. "Management of lacerations in the emergency department". ''Emerg Med Clin North Am.'' 2003;21:205–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Splinters can necessitate amputation; if it is in the finger for more than one 2–3 days, advice should be sought from a doctor.

==Contracting a splinter==
Generally, a splinter causes an initial feeling of pain as the sharp object makes its initial penetration through the body. Through this penetration, the object cuts through the [[cutaneous]] layer of the skin, and settles in the [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] layer of the skin, and can even penetrate further down, breaking the sub-cutaneous layer, settling in muscle tissue, or even the bone. Some splinters will remain in place, but most will continue to migrate through the body, further damaging their surroundings.

==Types==
[[File:Sea Urchins enjoying sunbathing.jpg|thumb|Sea urchins may cause splinters]]
According to the AAFP, the most common foreign bodies contracted by people fall into two official classes: biological splinters, and nonbiological splinters.&lt;ref&gt;American College of Emergency Physicians: clinical policy for the initial approach to patients presenting with penetrating extremity trauma.  Ann Emerg Med.  1999;33:612–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In the biological class, splinters include bone, fish spines, teeth, and wood. In the nonbiological class, common splinters contracted are glass, metal, aluminum, fishhooks, pencil graphite, and plastic.

Rarely, people may become infected with splinters from more unusual sources. Common cases of exotic foreign bodies include sea urchins, insect stings, stingray spines, and even grenade shrapnel.

==Specific details of some splinters==
* Wood: this type of splinter is contracted from lumber or other vegetative materials. Wood splinters must be removed from wounds because they are associated with inflammation and risk of infection. Larger or deeper splinters can result in difficult removal, or localization of the foreign body.
* Fishhooks: fishhooks that become lodged in the skin are problematic because of the barbs found on the ends of most fishhooks. These barbs are designed to make removal difficult, and if care is not taken, the victim can experience tearing of not only the flesh, but the muscle as well. The most common injuries caused by fishhooks occur in the hand, face, scalp, foot, and eye.
* Glass:  one study found that patients were more likely to feel sensations from glass present in their skin than from any other kind of splinter. Though glass is generally detectable by radiography and is radiopaque, there is limited ability for radiography to detect glass fragments smaller than 2mm. Most glass splinters are inert, and generally lack the ability to migrate to other regions of the body{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.
* Other: Pencil lead and other graphite foreign bodies, once lodged in the cutaneous layer of the skin, can cause permanent pigment tattooing if not removed immediately. Metallic bodies range from [[BB gun|BB]] pellets to grenade shrapnel. Smaller objects can be removed without much difficulty if the depth of the wound remains superficial, but if the wound does not protrude past the subcutaneous layers of the skin, and remains inert, the object can actually remain in place. In larger objects, fragments that remain superficial in one’s body may be removed without much trouble, but if wounds protrude past the subcutaneous layers of the skin and even into the muscular area or near vital organs, such objects must be left alone and immediate medical attention must be sought.
* {{anchor|Hair splinter}}Hair: Short lengths of hair, especially stiff hair such as trimmed [[beard]] hair or pet hair, can work its way under the skin of the feet or hands. So-called "hair splinters" are commonly experienced by [[hairdresser]]s and [[dog groomer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthline.com/health/hair-splinter&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from an [[ingrown hair]], where a hair still attached to its [[hair follicle|follicle]] grows back under (or fails to emerge from) the skin.

==Detection==
[[File:Anatomy The Skin - NCI Visuals Online.jpg|thumb|Anatomy The Skin - NCI Visuals Online]]
Splinters are often first detected by the person with the splinter in their body. There are many signs that a splinter has entered one’s body.

===Signs of a hidden foreign body===
* Puncture wound
* Blood-stained injury track of a fresh wound
* Sharp pain with deep palpation over a puncture wound
* Discoloration beneath the epidermis
* Wound that elicits pain with movement
* Wound that fails to heal
* [[Abscess]] (with sterile culture)
* Pain associated with a mass
* Mass under the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]
* Chronically draining purulent wound
* [[Cyst]]
* Granuloma formation
* Sterile monoarticular [[arthritis]]
* Periosteal reactions
* [[Osteomyelitis]]
* Pseudo tumors of bone
* Delayed tendon or nerve injury

Many times, if the presence in a body is not known, but only effects are felt, modern technologies will be employed. Depending on the type of foreign body the patient is infected with modern detectors can range from Computed Tomography, Radiography, and Ultrasonography. If manual detection and localization fail, such modern technologies may be utilized accordingly:&lt;ref name=tibbles&gt;Tibbles  CD, Porcaro  W.  Procedural applications of ultrasound.  Emerg Med Clin North Am.  2004;22:797–815.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tomography]] - reserved for failed exploration of infection
* [[Radiography]] - used to locate bone, fish spines, glass, gravel-stone, metal, aluminum, pencil graphite, some plastics, teeth, and some wood (e.g., spines, cactus, thorns)
* [[Ultrasonography]] - used to locate glass, metal, pencil graphite, some plastics, stone, and some types of wood.&lt;ref name=tibbles /&gt;

==Removal==
There are many medical techniques to remove splinters safely. Common medical techniques include the Elliptical Technique and the String Technique.&lt;ref name=Blankstein&gt;Blankstein  A, Cohen  I, Heiman  Z, Salai  M, Diamant  L, Heim  M, et al.  Ultrasonography as a diagnostic modality and therapeutic adjuvant in the management of soft tissue foreign bodies in the lower extremities.  Isr Med Assoc J.  2001;3:411–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the elliptical technique the surrounding area of the splinter is sliced in an elliptical formation. From there the flesh in the elliptical area is cut (in the shape of an upside-down cone) and the whole chunk of flesh containing the splinter is removed. The Needle Cover Technique is limited to fishhook removal. A string is looped around the base of the hook, and as the hook is pressed further into the skin, the string is pulled, allowing the barbs to be unhooked from muscle and follow the path of the rest of the hook out of the body without snagging any additional flesh.&lt;ref name=Blankstein /&gt;

==Infection==
Infection is usually determined by the duration of time that the foreign object remains lodged in the human body. Objects that have included poison, deep penetration, dirt, or bite injuries generally result in a shorter time until infection is notable.  According to the AAFP patients that are older, or have diabetes, or have wounds that are longer, wider, more jagged or deeper, have a much higher risk of infection. Simply the easiest way to avoid infection is to  completely remove the splinters or foreign body as soon as possible. 
Though infection is generally the largest complication encountered with splinters, ranging from 1.1 to 12 percent presence, the use of antibiotics in non-bite cases is generally deemed unnecessary by the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;Broder  KR, Cortese  MM, Iskander  JK, Kretsinger  K, Slade  BA, Brown  KH, et al., for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

One case of tetanus contraction through a splinter was seen in Ohio, 1993. An 80-year-old woman was presented to an ED with dysphagia and a stiff jaw.  Not long after a preliminary checkup, a wood splinter was found to have been lodged in her chin for approximately 1 week; the area was erythematous with active purulent drainage. The woman was diagnosed with tetanus, admitted to the hospital, and begun on a regimen of 3,000 units of tetanus immune globulin, tetanus toxoid, and intravenous clindamycin. Despite aggressive treatment, including assisted mechanical ventilation, the patient succumbed to the effects of her primary infection and died 15 days later. The woman had no history of previous tetanus vaccinations despite previous care for a wound and on-going medical attention for hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;Buttaravoli PM, Stair TO.

On 20 December 1984 a [[dangerous goods]] [[train]] passing through the [[Summit Tunnel]] on the [[Greater Manchester]]/[[West Yorkshire]] border, caught fire on the rail line between [[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]] and [[Todmorden]], England.

==History==
{{main|Summit Tunnel}}
The tunnel, which is {{convert|2885|yd|m}} in length, was built in 1840-41. Twelve of the fourteen construction shafts,&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt; at intervals of approximately {{convert|220|yd|m}},{{cn|date=March 2016}} were left open to help vent smoke and steam from the [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] that passed through it.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt;

The incident was one of a series of railway accidents during 1984, coming only days after the fatal collision between an express passenger train and a train of fuel oil tankers at [[Eccles rail crash (1984)|Eccles]], Greater Manchester on 4 December. One day earlier on 3 December a train guard had been killed after a collision between a diesel multiple unit and parcels vans at Longsight also in Manchester. This third serious railway accident in the North West of England in less than 3 weeks led the [[Littleborough and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Littleborough and Saddleworth]] MP [[Geoffrey Dickens]] to call for an inquiry into railway safety, in particular with respect to the conveyance of dangerous chemicals such as those involved in the accidents at Eccles and Summit Tunnel.&lt;ref name="Granada News"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4fVhmSacr0 |title=Granada News report on Summit Tunnel Disaster |publisher=LittleboroughLocal |date=27 April 2015 |access-date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire==
The train involved was the 01:40 freight train from [[Haverton Hill]], [[Teesside]] to {{rws|Glazebrook}} oil distribution terminal in [[Merseyside]]. It was formed by [[British Rail Class 47|class 47]] [[diesel locomotive]] 47 125 and thirteen [[tank car|tankers]].&lt;ref name = "RA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_Summit1984.pdf |periodical=Railway accident |title=Report on the derailment and fire that occurred on 20th December 1984 at Summit Tunnel in the London Midland Region of British Railways |location=London |author=[[Department of Transport]] |date=4 June 1986 |format=PDF, 5.7 MB |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 05:50 on 20 December 1984, the train, carrying more than {{convert|1000000|L|impgal USgal}} ({{convert|835|t|LT ST|disp=or}}) of four-star [[petrol]] in thirteen [[tank car|tankers]], entered the tunnel on the Yorkshire (north) side travelling at {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}. One-third of the way through the tunnel, a defective [[axle]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] ([[journal bearing]]) derailed the fourth tanker, which caused the derailment of those behind. Only the locomotive and the first three tankers remained on the rails. One of the derailed tankers fell on its side and began to leak petrol into the tunnel. Vapour from the leaking petrol was probably ignited by the [[hot box|damaged axle box]].&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt;

The three train crew members could see fire spreading through the [[Track ballast|ballast]] beneath the other track in the tunnel, so they left the train and ran the remaining mile to the south portal (where they knew there was a direct [[telephone]] connection to the signaller) to raise the alarm.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt;

Crews from [[Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service|Greater Manchester Fire Brigade]] and [[West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service|West Yorkshire Fire Brigade]] quickly attended the scene. Co-ordination between the brigades appears to have worked well, perhaps because they had both participated in an emergency exercise in the tunnel a month before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the Derailment and the fire that occurred on 20th December 1984 at Summit Tunnel|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_Summit1984.pdf|website=railwaysarchive.co.uk|publisher=Department of Transport|accessdate=20 April 2017|page=12|format=PDF|date=4 June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The train crew were persuaded to return to the train, where they uncoupled the three tankers still on the rails and used the locomotive to drive them out.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt; Greater Manchester fire brigade then loaded firefighting equipment onto track trolleys and sent a crew with [[SCBA|breathing apparatus]] (BA) in to begin their firefighting operation at the south end of the train. They also lowered hoselines down one of the [[ventilation shaft]]s to provide a water supply. At the same time, crews from West Yorkshire fire brigade entered the tunnel and began fighting fires in the ballast at the north end of the train.

However, at 9.40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the pressure in one of the heated tankers rose high enough to open its pressure relief valves. The vented vapour caught fire and blew flames onto the tunnel wall. The wall deflected the flames both ways along the tunnel, and the bricks in the tunnel wall began to [[spall]] and melt in the flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/gallery/remembering-summit-tunnel-fire-30-8315438|title=Remembering the Summit tunnel fire 30 years on|first=Damon|last=Wilkinson|date=19 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BA crews from both brigades decided to evacuate.&lt;ref name=Times211284/&gt; They managed to leave just before the first explosion rocked the tunnel.

Left to itself, the fire burned as hot as it could. As the walls warmed up and the air temperature in the tunnel rose, all 10 tankers discharged petrol vapour from their pressure relief valves. Two tankers melted (at approximately {{convert|1530|C|disp=or}}) and discharged their remaining loads.

The fuel supply to the fire was so rich that some of the combustibles were unable to find oxygen inside the tunnel with which to burn; they were instead ejected from vent shafts 8 and 9 as fuel-rich gases that burst into flame when they encountered oxygen in the air outside. At the height of the fire, pillars of flame approximately {{convert|45|m|ft}} high rose from the shaft outlets on the hillside above.

The gases are estimated to have flowed up these shafts at {{convert|50|m/s|mph}}. Air at this speed is capable of blowing around heavy items: hot projectiles made from tunnel lining (rather like [[volcanic bombs|lava bombs]] from a [[volcano]]) were cast out over the hillside. These set much of the vegetation on fire,{{sfn|Stephen|2016|p=103}} and caused the closure of the [[A6033 road]].&lt;ref name=Times211284/&gt; In the cleanup operation afterwards, small globules of metal were found on the ground surrounding shaft 9; these had been melted from the tanker walls, swept up with the exhaust gases, and dropped out onto the grass around the top of the shaft.

Unable to get close enough to safely fight the fire directly,{{sfn|Stephen|2016|p=102}} the fire brigades forced high-expansion foam into ventilation shafts far from the fire.&lt;ref name=Times211284/&gt; This created blockages that starved the fire of oxygen. By mid-afternoon the next day, the inferno was no longer burning, though the fire was by no means knocked down. Petrol continued to leak from the derailed wagons through the tunnel drainage and ballast and the vapour sporadically reignited when it came into contact with the hot tunnel lining. Two hundred people were evacuated from their homes and workplaces in [[Walsden]] in response.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times211284&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Homes evacuated as train explodes |first=David |last=Nicholson-Lord |day_of_week=Friday |date=21 December 1984 |page_number=28 |issue=62018 |column=A-E }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were allowed back home the next day.&lt;ref name=Times221284/&gt;

The brigades continued to fight the fire for another two days, until West Yorkshire Fire Brigade issued the stop message just after 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Christmas Eve. Fire crews remained at the site until 7 January 1985.{{sfn|Stephen|2016|p=103}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Summit Tunnel, North Portal - geograph.org.uk - 60363.jpg|thumb|People walking through Summit Tunnel in August 1985, before the line was reopened to traffic]]
Due to the fire, the line between {{rws|Rochdale}} and {{rws|Todmorden}} was closed. Passenger trains between two stations were replaced by buses.&lt;ref name=Times221284&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Rail disruption for weeks after tunnel fire |day_of_week=Saturday |date=22 December 1884 |page_number=2 |issue=62019 |column= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|1100000|L|impgal USgal}} of [[petrol]] carried by the train, {{convert|275000|L|impgal USgal}} were rescued by the train crew when they drove the locomotive and the first three tankers to safety.  A further {{convert|16000|L|impgal USgal}} of petrol were recovered after the fire was extinguished, and {{convert|900000|L|impgal USgal}} ({{convert|670|t|LT ST|disp=or}}) burnt.

The damage done by the fire was minimal. Approximately half a mile of track had to be replaced, as did all the electrical services and signalling. The biggest surprise was how well the brick lining had stood up to the fire.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt; Although some bricks in the tunnel and in the blast relief shafts had become so hot that they vitrified and ran like molten glass, most of the brickwork lining of the tunnel was scorched but still serviceable. One of the photographs taken in the aftermath shows a rail tanker directly beneath shaft 9: it is crowned with a mass of vitrified slag from bricks in the shaft that had melted and dripped down.

The last of the wagons was removed from the tunnel on 1 March 1985.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt; Once British Rail had replaced the track and electrical services, shored up the bases of vent shafts 8 and 9 and filled the two shafts with inert foam (all this took eight months), locals were allowed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk through the tunnel before train services resumed on 19 August 1985.&lt;ref name = "RA" /&gt;

The Summit Tunnel fire is probably one of the biggest underground fires in transportation history, certainly bigger than the [[1996 Channel Tunnel fire]] (a relatively meagre 350 [[watt|megawatts]]) and probably bigger than the ill-defined [[Salang tunnel fire]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Only the Crozet tunnel accident (France, 20 March 1971) may have been bigger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tunnels-ferroviaires.org/tu42/42078.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The BR train crew who returned to the site to rescue a locomotive and three tankers left the fire site shortly before one of the other petrol tankers filled the tunnel with flames. The firefighters in BA sets who were in the tunnel when it filled with flames were saved because blast relief shafts 8 and 9 acted as flame vents (a function their designer never envisaged).

At the Masons Arms [[public house]] in Todmorden, there is a small collection of photographs noting the fire, along with the statistics of the construction,{{cn|date=March 2016}} and a quotation by [[George Stephenson]], the tunnel's builder, who said, "I stake my reputation and my head that the tunnel will never fail so as to injure any human life".&lt;ref name=Times010391&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= |day_of_week=On track to hail Pennine navvies |first=Peter |last=Davenport |date=1 March 1991 |page_number=11 |issue=63954 |column=C-F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
A [[public enquiry]] was held into the accident. The hearing was held in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name=Times090285&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Tanker train crew ran for their lives |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 February 1985 |page_number=3 |issue=62058 |column=B-C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report was published on 4 June 1985.&lt;ref name = "RA"/&gt;

==Plot==
A mysterious object plummets to Earth, sending out a shock wave that causes five strangers to die, only to miraculously come back to life moments later. The members of the group are Vera (Shantel VanSanten), a struggling radio-astronomer living in New Mexico who is searching for her missing son; Erin (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a young mother in Tucson, Arizona who is desperate to protect her seven-year-old daughter Amy from her abusive policeman ex-husband; Peter (Joel Courtney), a troubled high school student and orphan in Little Rock, Arkansas; Raul (J.D. Pardo), a federal agent in Mexico who is looking to escape his dangerous and violent undercover assignment; and Joshua (Jon Fletcher), a charismatic second-generation televangelist in Houston, Texas. Most mysterious of all is the figure known only as The Man (Diogo Morgado), who offers Vera the location of her abducted son if she will help him with one morally complicated task which puts her on a collision course with Rose ([[Anna Diop]]), a nurse in Houston who has been in a coma for seven years after being shot by an unknown hitman. Drawn together by fate and biblical prophecy, "The Messengers" soon learn they now have supernatural gifts that might be the only hope for preventing the impending [[Rapture]].

*[[Diogo Morgado]] as "The Man"&lt;ref name="cwtvpr"/&gt;
:The [[Devil]] [[incarnate]], who attempts to stop the Messengers. He cannot physically harm or kill any Messenger (or any other human being) by himself, which leads to him using and manipulating other people to try to carry out his wishes. He considers himself an admirer of the Horsemen's work, but competes with Rose Arvale (Horseman of Death) for the seals and the power of the meteorite in which the Devil was sent to Earth. The Man is also responsible for taking Vera's son, Michael, to [[Saint Monica]].

Rose Arvale, the Horseman of Death, is the leader of the current generation, and they want to use The Man's meteorite as their ultimate weapon for the end of humanity. In contrast to the angel Messengers, the Horsemen immediately become aware of their powers upon a seal being broken as well as their destiny, and about each other's identity. It is also implied that all four of them are telepathic (only to each other) and can read each other's minds.
*[[Anna Diop]] as Rose Arvale&lt;ref name="cwtvpr"/&gt;
:A former nurse whose experience during war turned her into a cold-blood murderer with psychotic tendencies. Back from war, she started [[Angel of mercy (criminology)|killing ill patients as an ''act of mercy'']] while having an affair with a married doctor until he ended the affair to return to his wife. Feeling jealous, Rose killed the doctor's wife and kept her ring as a [[souvenir]], completing her transformation into the Horseman of Death. Rose then decided to pose as and become the ''de facto'' leader of the Messengers as a ruse to find the other Horsemen of the Apocalypse with their help. She shelters the Messengers at a foreclosed house and uses a local eatery/bar entitled "The Last Supper Bar-Grill" as their base of operations. After she shows her true colors by killing Joshua, he is later resurrected by the Devil himself.

*Sam Littlefield as Leland Schiller&lt;ref name="deadline"/&gt;
:Chosen as the Horseman of Pestilence, he is the leader of a hacking group called "[[Abaddon]]", who wants revenge against an insurance company for denying medical treatment for his ill mother. His plan (which involved killing many innocent people) was stopped once by the Messengers, but he was later released from prison by Rose so he could choose to complete his plan, thus breaking his seal.
*[[Riley Smith]] as Mark Plowman&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;
:Chosen as the Horseman of Famine, he is initially one of the chairmen of an agricultural company. He cares about the field and his workers, unlike his charismatic and unscrupulous brother Vincent, towards whom he a harbors deep resentment. It turns out that both brothers were set up as potential Horsemen of Famine, but Mark is chosen in the end when he kills his brother out of that resentment and thus (like the other three Horsemen) instantly loses his humanity and joins the Horsemen's cause.

 |ShortSummary    = The seven united Messengers, Vera, Raul, Peter, Joshua, Erin, Koa and Zahir, face off against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Rose, Cindy, Leland, and Mark, in a final confrontation. Following another vision from Joshua, they realize that the Horsemen plot to release a lethal "red acid rain" upon Houston, Texas, to break the fifth seal using government drones to carry out the plot. Meanwhile, the Devil tries to persuade Erin's ex-husband to set fire and burn down the motel where the Fairburns are holding Vera's son, Michael, in attempt to kill all of them to tie up any loose ends. Alan teams up with Leo to try to find Michael following Joshua's vision, while Nadia is asked to take Erin's daughter, Amy, away from the city before the event will take place. Despite the Messengers combined powers, they all end up captive by the evil Horsemen and their mercenaries when they realize that joining their powers and perform as selfless act will make a difference. Just as the red acid rain begins to fall upon the city and people begin dying, the Messengers allow themselves to be shot by the mercenaries allowing the powers of God to transform the red rain into healing blue rain, which turns the balance in their favor. The Four Horsemen are defeated and the city is saved and the fifth seal remains intact and the Messengers are resurrected. Vera is finally reunited with her son Michael after he is found in the rubble of the burned-down motel with not an injury upon him. Two weeks later, as the Messengers are back at the Last Supper Bar, Joshua confides in Vera that he had another vision that her son, Michael, is the archangel of Heaven to bring peace, but that Erin's daughter, Amy, is in fact the antichrist (the woman with the upside-down face in his vision) who will bring death to the world. It is confirmed to the viewers when the Devil eyes the Messengers from a distance and addresses Amy as his daughter.

'''The Moot''' was a discussion group concerned with education, social reconstruction, and the role of culture in society.  It was convened by [[J. H. Oldham]], editor of the [[Christian Newsletter]], and its participants were mainly Christian intellectuals.  [[Karl Mannheim]] was a central figure in the group.  Others who attended included [[T. S. Eliot]], [[John Middleton Murry]], [[Frederick Clarke (educator)|Sir Fred Clarke]], [[Michael Polanyi]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Walter Hamilton Moberly|Sir Walter Moberly]], [[John Baillie (theologian)|Professor John Baillie]], Sir Hector Herrington, [[Geoffrey Vickers]], [[Alec Vidler|A.R. Vidler]], [[H. A. Hodges]] and [[Adolph Lowe]]. Catholic historian and independent scholar [[Christopher Dawson]] also contributed numerous written submissions, although he was able to attend only two meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Keith|title=The Moot Papers: Faith, Freedom and Society 1938-1944|publisher=T &amp; T Clark|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion group grew out of a Conference on Church, Community and State held at Oxford in 1937.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"More than anything else, the discussions of the Moot revolved around the topic of order and, more particularly, around the problem of how order might be restored in British society and culture in the context of a ‘world turned upside down’." (Mullins and Jacobs, 2006)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The discussions influenced T.S. Eliot's works of [[cultural criticism]] ''The Idea of a Christian society'' and ''Notes towards the definition of culture''.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 554''', adopted on 17 August 1984, after recalling [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 473|473]] (1980), the Council condemned the [[South African general election, 1984|1984 general election]] in South Africa and the adoption of the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act (110 of 1983)]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100828032047/http://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/apartheid.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council stated that the constitution was against the [[United Nations Charter]] and declared the elections and constitution both [[Void (law)|null and void]] as it would further entrench minority rule in the country. The resolution also urged Member States and international organisations not to accord recognition to the elections, stating that the total eradication of [[apartheid]] and the establishment of democracy in South Africa would lead to a just and lasting solution to the "explosive situation" in the country.

The resolution, which required the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] to monitor its implementation, was approved by 13 votes to none against, while the United Kingdom and United States [[abstention|abstained]] from voting.

==Uses==
Website correlation is used in:
*Internet Investigations&lt;ref name="ncjrs_manual"&gt;Investigations Involving the Internet 
and Computer Networks [http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/210798.pdf], ''National Institute of Justice (U.S.)'',2007&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the overall scope of an investigation

*[[Data mining]] systems to maximize input or output data
*[[risk management]] programs to ensure websites are being monitored for problems that introduce fiscal risk
*Compliance monitoring as part of a [[compliance and ethics program]] or policy to ensure websites follow established guidelines

==Correlation types==
There are several known types of correlation, each demonstrating different strengths and weaknesses.  A practical website correlation process may require combining two or more of these methods.

===Similar structure===
To save time and effort, website owners duplicate major portions of website code across many [[Domain name|domain]]s. Similarity of code structure can provide enough information for correlation.  Organizations known to have a publicly search-able databases for this kind of correlation include:
*http://www.delineal.com

note: Websites can sometimes utilize the same structure but have no relationship to each other (as when websites coincidentally utilize the same [[content management system]]).

===Same server or subnet===
Also known as correlated [[Reverse DNS lookup]].  Websites may be served from the same [[Server (computing)|server]], on one or more [[ip address]], on one or more [[subnet]].  Several organizations retain archives of ip address data and correlate the data. Examples include:
* http://www.domaintools.com
note: Correlation via this method may be misleading because websites frequently exist on the same server (aka [[shared hosting]]) but have no relationship to each other.

===Same owner===
Websites may be authored by the same person or organization.  Website owners are required to provide contact information to a [[Domain name registrar|registrar]] to obtain a [[domain name]].  Domain ownership can be determined via the [[WHOIS]] protocol which provides no mechanism for searching or correlating ownership.  Several organizations retain archives of WHOIS information and provide searching and correlation services.  Examples include:
*http://whoisology.com
*http://www.domaintools.com

note: Website ownership information can be ''falsified'', ''outdated'', or ''hidden from public view''.  Website Correlation via this method can be accurate, misleading, or impossible depending on the information contained in WHOIS records.

===Similar content===
Search engines provide search-able databases of indexed website content.  Search engine results lists are correlated by content similarity.

====Google====
* on [[Google.com]] type 'related:website_name_here.com' to find websites related by name or phrases
* find a unique-sounding phrase on the website then use search engine(s) to locate the phrase literally on other websites
**In the search box, place quotes around the phrase to do a literal phrase search
**instead of copyright 2010 xyzcompany use "copyright 2010 xyzcompany"
note: This method of correlation is ''inherently slow'' because one must guess which phrases to search for.  Also, related websites may not contain literally similar content (as when a site is translated into another language).

===Same category===

Websites are frequently categorized or tagged similarly via automated or manual means.  Examples of publicly accessible website categorization databases include:
* http://www.similarsitesearch.com/
* http://similarsites.com
* http://similarsites.de
* http://www.similarsitecheck.com

The '''X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission''' ('''XRISM'''), formerly named the X-ray Astronomy Recovery Mission (XARM, pronounced "charm"),&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to Paul Hertz, director of NASA's astrophysics division, this is because the project "does need some luck"&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[X-ray astronomy]] satellite of the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) to provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name=Hertz201706&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/attachments/190966/public/HertzAAAC2017Jun22FINAL2.pdf |title=Astrophysics |last1=Hertz |first1=Paul |format=PDF |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=22 June 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/609732/1/SA6000060006.pdf |title=ASTRO-Hに対する高エネルギーコミュニティの総括と今後の方向性について |last1=Fujimoto |first1=Ryuichi |last2=Tashiro |first2=Makoto |format=PDF |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=5 January 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the only international X-ray observatory project of its period, XRISM will function as a next generation space telescope in the X-ray astronomy field, similar to how the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi Space Telescope]], and the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Observatory are placed in their respective fields.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/shiryo/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2016/10/06/1377887_7.pdf |title=Ｘ線天文衛星代替機の検討状況について |format=PDF |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission will crosslink X-ray telescopes of the present ([[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]], [[XMM-Newton]]) with that of the future ([[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics|ATHENA]], [[List of proposed space observatories#Design studies|Lynx]]/X-Ray Surveyor), thus preventing the formation of a blank period in X-ray astronomy in the early 2020s resulting from the loss of [[Hitomi (satellite)|''Hitomi'']].&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; During its formulation, XRISM/XARM was also known as the "ASTRO-H Successor", "ASTRO-H2".
 
==Overview==
[[File:Astro-H schema (en).png|thumbnail|The XRISM project will be based on the [[Astro-H|ASTRO-H]] mission]]
With the retirement of [[Suzaku (satellite)|''Suzaku'']] in August 2015, and the detectors onboard [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and [[XMM-Newton]] operating for more than 15 years and gradually aging, the failure of ''Hitomi'' meant that X-ray astronomers will have a 12-year blank period in soft X-ray observation, until the launch of ATHENA (which according to [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] director general Saku Tsuneta is a "super ASTRO-H"&lt;ref name="Foust20160613"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=June 13, 2016 |title=NASA and JAXA begin discussions on aftermath of Hitomi failure |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-and-jaxa-begin-discussions-on-aftermath-of-hitomi-failure/ |newspaper=[[SpaceNews]] |accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 2028.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISASnews430"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/outreach/isas_news/files/ISASnews430.pdf |title=ISASニュース 2017.1 No.430 |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=22 January 2017 |access-date=2016-03-23 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in a major setback for the international community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www8.cao.go.jp/space/comittee/dai52/siryou2-1.pdf |title=Ｘ線天文衛星「ひとみ」の異常事象への対応と代替機の開発について |format=PDF |publisher=Committee on National Space Policy of Japan |date=18 August 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; as there will be no telescope to cover the most important part of X-ray astronomy, when in other wavelengths the operation of large scale observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the [[Thirty Meter Telescope]] will commence.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; A lack of missions could also deprive young astronomers a chance to gain hands-on experience from participating in a project.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; For these reasons, as well as to recover the science that was to be gained from ''Hitomi'', the XRISM project began. The XRISM mission has been recommended by ISAS's Advisory Council for Research and Management, the High Energy AstroPhysics Association in Japan, NASA Astrophysics Subcommittee, NASA Science Committee, NASA Advisory Council.&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcos"/&gt; With a planned launch in March 2021,&lt;ref name="pcos"/&gt; XRISM will recover the science that was lost with ''Hitomi'', such as the structure formation of the universe, feedback from galaxies/active galaxy nuclei, and the history of material circulation from stars to galaxy clusters.&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"/&gt; The space telescope will also serve as a technology demonstrator for the European [[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics|ATHENA]] (Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics) telescope.&lt;ref name="ISASnews430"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/topics/files/20151202_1.pdf#page=14 |title=X線天文衛星 ASTRO-Hの衛星概要 |last1=Takahashi |first1=Tadayuki |format=PDF |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=2017-07-13 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2011.mpe.mpg.de/athena/workshop_mpe_2011/talks/Athena_Dotani_2011June15.pdf#page=9 |title=The 1st Athena Science Workshop JAXA Contribution |last1=Dotani |first1=Tadayasu |format=PDF |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] |date=15 June 2011 |access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple space agencies, including NASA and the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA)&lt;ref name="ESAcv0620"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/59243-gravitational-wave-mission-selected-planet-hunting-mission-moves-forward/ |title=GRAVITATIONAL WAVE MISSION SELECTED, PLANET-HUNTING MISSION MOVES FORWARD |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=20 June 2017 |access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are participating in the mission. In Japan, the project is led by JAXA's [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] (ISAS) division, and the U.S. participation is led by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC). The U.S. contribution is expected to cost around $80 million, which is about the same amount as the contribution to ''Hitomi''.&lt;ref name="Foust20160721"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=July 21, 2016 |title=NASA may build replacement instrument for Japanese astronomy mission |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-may-build-replacement-instrument-for-japanese-astronomy-mission/ |newspaper=[[SpaceNews]] |accessdate=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www8.cao.go.jp/space/comittee/27-kiban/kiban-dai26/siryou2.pdf |title=第９回 宇宙科学・探査小委員会 議事要旨 |format=PDF |publisher=Committee on National Space Policy of Japan |date=1 November 2016 |access-date=2017-06-30 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of astronomers from GSFC suggests pairing the XARM satellite with a source satellite containing radioactive sources. XRISM will observe the source sat to conduct absolute calibration of its telescopes, thus functioning as a in-orbit X-ray "standard candle".  With its broad effective area, the telescope could potentially establish several standard candles in the sky by observing constant celestial sources. If this concept proves successful, later missions such as ATHENA and Lynx may have their own source sats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/iachec/meetings/2017/presentations/IACHEC2017_Markevitch_session12.pdf |title=Cal X-1: an in-orbit X-ray standard candle |last1=Markevitch |first1=M |last2=Jahoda |first2=K |last3=Hill |first3=J |format=PDF |publisher=[[MIT]] |date=29 March 2017 |access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes from ''Hitomi''===
The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission will be one of the first projects for ISAS to place a separate Project Manager (PM) and a Primary Investigator (PI). This measure was taken as part of ISAS's reform in project management to prevent the recurrence of the ''Hitomi'' accident.&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; In traditional ISAS missions, the PM was also responsible for tasks that would typically be allocated to PI's in a NASA mission.

While ''Hitomi'' had an array of instruments spanning from soft X-ray to soft gamma ray, XRISM will focus around the Resolve instrument (equivalent to ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXS),&lt;ref name="x-rayuniverse2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/1402684/MTashiro_t.pdf |title=X‐ray Astronomy Recovery Mission XARM |last1=Tashiro |first1=Makoto |last2=Kelley |first2=Richard |format=PDF |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=8 June 2017 |access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Xtend (SXI), which has a high affinity to Resolve.&lt;ref name="mext30"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/gijiroku/1379220.htm |title=宇宙開発利用部会（第30回） 議事録 |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=29 September 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elimination of a hard X-ray telescope is based on the launch of NASA's [[NuSTAR]] satellite, a development that wasn't put to consideration when the [[Hitomi (satellite)|NeXT]] proposal was initially formulated.&lt;ref name="mext29"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/gijiroku/1376305.htm |title=宇宙開発利用部会（第29回） 議事録 |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; NuSTAR's spatial and energy resolution is analogous to ''Hitomi''{{'s}} hard X-ray instruments.&lt;ref name="mext29"/&gt; Once the operation of XRISM starts, collaborative observations with NuSTAR will likely be essential.&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"/&gt; Meanwhile, the scientific value of the soft and hard X-ray band width boundary has been noted; therefor the option of upgrading XRISM's instruments to be partially capable of hard X-ray observation is under consideration.&lt;ref name="mext30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mext29"/&gt; Furthermore, a hard X-ray telescope proposal with abilities surpassing ''Hitomi'' has also been proposed.&lt;ref name="FORCE2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/bitstream/a-is/609717/1/SA6000060036.pdf |title=軟Ｘ線から硬Ｘ線の広帯域を高感度で撮像分光する小型衛星計画 FORCE - Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution - |last1=Nakazawa |first1=Kazuhiro |last2=Mori |first2=Koji |format=PDF |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=6 January 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''FORCE'' (Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution) space telescope is a candidate for the next ISAS competitive medium class mission. If selected, FORCE is to be launched after the mid 2020s, with an eye towards conducting simultaneous observations with ATHENA.&lt;ref name="FORCE2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HEAPA2017"/&gt;

==History==
Following the premature termination of the ''Hitomi'' mission, on 14 June 2016 JAXA announced their proposal to rebuild the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://smd-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/APD_ImpPlan_2016-12-15_0.pdf#page=16 |title=Astrophysics Implementation Plan: 2016 Update |format=PDF |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=15 December 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XARM pre-project preparation team was formed in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/outreach/isas_news/files/ISASnews435.pdf#page=6 |title=ISASニュース 2017.6 No.435 |publisher=[[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] |format=PDF |date=23 June 2017 |access-date=2017-07-04 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. side, formulation is to begin in the summer of 2017.&lt;ref name="Hertz201706"/&gt; In June 2017, ESA announced that they will participate in XRISM as a mission of opportunity.&lt;ref name="ESAcv0620"/&gt;

==Instruments==
XRISM will carry two instruments for studying the soft X-ray energy range, Resolve and Xtend. The satellite will have telescopes for each of the instruments, SXT-I (Soft X-ray Telescope for Imager) and SXT-S (Soft X-ray Telescope for Spectrometer).&lt;ref name="mext20160929"/&gt; The pair of telescopes will have a focal length of {{convert|5.6|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ASTRO-H Successor"/&gt;

===Resolve===
Resolve is a X-ray micro calorimeter. The instrument will likely not be a complete remanufacture of ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXS, as there are some space-qualified hardware left from developing SXS, and these spare parts may be utilized to build Resolve.&lt;ref name="Foust20160613"/&gt;

===Xtend===
Xtend is a X-ray [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera. Unlike Resolve, which will be a "built-to-print" version of its predecessor, Xtend differs in that its energy resolution will be improved from ''Hitomi''{{'s}} SXI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu2/059/shiryo/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2017/06/20/1386893_1.pdf |title=X線天文衛星ASTRO-Hのプロジェクト終了について |format=PDF |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|MEXT]] |date=30 May 2017 |access-date=2017-07-01 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
