The '''Aggregat series''' (German for "Aggregate') was a set of [[ballistic missile]] designs developed in 1933&amp;ndash;45 by a research program of [[Nazi Germany]]'s army ([[Wehrmacht]]). Its greatest success was the A4, more commonly known as the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]].

{{anchor |A1}}

==A1 (1933)==
[[Image:Aggregate (3D-comparison).jpg|thumb|right|400px|Aggregat rockets compared]]
The A1 was the first rocket design in the Aggregat series. It was designed in 1933 by [[Wernher von Braun]] in a [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]] research program at [[Kummersdorf]] headed by [[Walter Dornberger]]. The A1 was the grandfather of most modern rockets. The rocket was {{convert |1.4|m|0}} long, {{convert|30.5|cm|0}} in diameter, and had a takeoff weight of {{convert|150|kg|0}}. The engine, designed by [[Arthur Rudolph]], used a pressure-fed [[rocket propellant]] system burning [[alcohol]] and [[liquid oxygen]], and produced 300 [[kilogram-force|kgf]] (660 [[pound-force|lbf]], 2.9 [[kilonewton|kN]]) of thrust for 16 seconds. The rocket was stabilized by a {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} [[gyroscope]] in the nose, but there was concern that this might cause problems with the [[liquid fuel]]s{{clarify|what on earth does the gyroscope have to do with the fuel?|date=April 2018}}. Although the engine had been successfully test fired, the first flight attempt blew up on the launching pad on 21 December 1933.&lt;ref&gt;http://weebau.com/rocket/a1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since the design was thought to be unstable, no further attempts were made, and efforts moved to the A2 design.{{Sfn | Gatland | 1989 | p = 10}}

{{anchor |A2}}

==A2 (1934)==
[[Image:Aggregate-2 (3D-cutoff).jpg|thumb|right|400px|A-2 Rocket]]
The A2 was designed in 1934 by von Braun under the program at Kummersdorf headed by [[Walter Dornberger]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

At a length of {{convert|1.6|m|0}} and thrust of 3&amp;nbsp;kN from alcohol and liquid oxygen, it was in outline similar to the A1. However, in contrast to the A1, the A2 had the stabilization [[gyroscopes]] in the center of the rocket between the alcohol and oxygen tanks, which made it more stable. The rocket weighed {{convert|72|kg|0}} empty, with takeoff weight of {{convert|107|kg|0}}. Initial flight testing was done in September 1934 at Kummersdorf.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Two A2s were built for a full out test, and were named after a [[Wilhelm Busch]] cartoon, ''[[Max and Moritz]]''. On December 19 and December 20, 1934, they were launched in front of the Army brass on [[Borkum]] island in the [[North Sea]]. They reached altitudes of {{convert|2.2|km|1}} and {{convert |3.5|km|1}}.{{Sfn | Gatland | 1989 | p = 10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.aggregat-2.de/geschichte.html | title = Aggregat 2 | place = [[Germany|DE]] | language = German | contribution = Raketenaggregate „A1“ und „A2“}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor |A3}}

==A3 (1935&amp;ndash;1937)==
Development of the A3 can be traced at least to February 1935 when Major [[Ernst Ritter von Horstig]] sent General [[Karl Heinrich Emil Becker|Karl Becker]] a budget of almost half a million marks for the construction of two new test stands at Kummersdorf. Included were mobile test rigs, small locomotives, and office and storage space. The A3 plans called for a rocket with an [[inertial guidance system]] and a {{convert|1500|kg|abbr=on}} thrust engine.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, M.J. ''Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War''. New York: Knopf, 2007. p 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1936, Army General [[Werner von Fritsch]] witnessed a static firing of an A3 engine at Kummersdorf, and was sufficiently impressed to lend his support to the rocket program. {{sfn|Huzel|1962|p=233}}{{sfn|Neufeld|1996|p=81}} Like the earlier A1 and A2 rockets, the A3 also used a pressure-fed propellant system, and the same liquid oxygen and 75% alcohol mixture as the earlier designs. It generated its {{convert|14.7|kN|abbr=on}} for 45 seconds. It used a three-gyroscope system to deflect [[tungsten alloy]] jet vanes.{{sfn |Huzel|1962|p=236}} The design was finished and secretly patented{{clarify|what is a secret patent?|date=April 2018}} in the spring of 1936 and further modifications that made the rocket stable at supersonic velocities were finalized in the autumn.{{sfn|Neufeld|1996|pp = 84–85}}

This was the first of the Aggregat rockets to be [[rocket launch|launched]] from the Peenemünde area.{{Sfn | Huzel | 1962 | p = 235}} As part of [[Operation Lighthouse (1937)|Operation Lighthouse]] the first A3 was launched on 4 December 1937, but suffered problems with both premature parachute deployment and engine failure, and crashed close to the takeoff point. The second launch on 6 December 1937 suffered similar problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://weebau.com/rocket/a3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The parachute was disabled in the third and fourth rockets launched on 8 and 11 December 1937, but these, too, experienced engine failures, though the lack of parachute drag allowed them to crash further from the launch site.{{Sfn|Neufeld|1996|pp = 102–5}}

According to another source, one A3 reached a maximum downrange of {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} and maximum altitude of {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn | Gatland | 1989 | p = 11}}

With each launch a failure, von Braun and Dornberger looked for the cause. At first there was some thought of an [[electrostatics|electrostatic charge]] that prematurely set off the parachute, but this was largely disproved. Ultimately, the failures were attributed to the inadequate design of the rocket's experimental inertial guidance system and minor instabilities in the body and fin design.{{Sfn|Neufeld|1996|pp = 102–5}}

After this unsuccessful series of launches, the A3 was abandoned and redesigned as the A5.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} In the meantime, work on the A4 continued.{{Sfn|Neufeld| 1996 |p= 105}}

==A5 (1938&amp;ndash;1942)==
The A5 was a scaled-down test model of the A4 which replaced the former unsuccessful A3 in this role. It was flown from 1938 to 1942, and played a vital role in testing the aerodynamics and technology of the A4. Its rocket engine was identical to the A3, with a new control system and a shape similar to the A4. 25 were launched, some several times; it was fitted with a parachute recovery system and could float for up to two hours before sinking to allow recovery by boat. Variants were constructed both with no propulsion system and [[monopropellant]] engines for [[air drop]] testing.

The A5 was {{convert|5.825|m|abbr=on}} long, with a diameter of {{convert|0.78|m|abbr=on}} and a takeoff weight of {{convert|900|kg|abbr=on}}, and like the A3 was fueled with alcohol with liquid oxygen as an [[oxidant]]. The first launch of the A5 took place in the summer of 1938 at [[Greifswalder Oie]] and the first successful guided flights were made in October 1939 in order to test the control systems planned for use in the A4. The A5 reached a ceiling of up to {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=juergen&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Michels | first1 = Juergen | last2 = Przybilski | first2 = Olaf | title = Peenemuende und seine Erben in Ost und West | publisher = Bernard &amp; Graefe | year = 1997 | location = Bonn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor |A4|V-2 rocket}}

==A4 – V-2 rocket  (1942&amp;ndash;1945)==
{{Main|V-2 rocket}}
The A4 was a full-sized design with a range of about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;322&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(200&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt;, an initial peak altitude of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;89&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(55&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt; and a payload of about a [[tonne]]. Versions of the A4 were used in warfare. They included the first ballistic missile and the first projectile to reach [[outer space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Peenemuende | first = Walter | last = Dornberger | publisher = Moewig | place = Berlin | year = 1985 | ISBN = 3-8118-4341-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase in capability came from a redesign of the A3 engine, now known as the A5, by [[Walter Thiel]]. It became clearer that [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun's]] designs were turning into useful weapons, and Dornberger moved the team from the artillery testing grounds at Kummersdorf (near [[Berlin]]) to a small town, [[Peenemünde]], on the island of [[Usedom]] on Germany's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast, in order to provide more room for testing and greater secrecy. This version was reliable, and by 1941 the team had fired about 70 A5 rockets. The first A4 flew in March 1942, flying about &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;1.6&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt; and crashing into the water. The second launch reached an altitude of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;11&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(7&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt; before exploding. The third rocket, launched on October 3, 1942, followed its trajectory perfectly. It landed &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;193&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(120&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt; away, and reached a height of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;83&amp;nbsp;kilometers&amp;nbsp;(52&amp;nbsp;mi)&lt;/span&gt;.{{sfn|Neufeld|1996}} The highest altitude reached during the war was {{convert|174.6|km|mi|abbr=off}} on 20 June 1944.{{sfn|Neufeld|1996}}

Production started in 1943 on the rocket. The missile testing ground at Blizna was quickly located by the Polish resistance movement, the [[Armia Krajowa]], thanks to reports from local farmers. Armia Krajowa field agents even managed to obtain pieces of the fired rockets, by arriving on the scene before German patrols.  In early March 1944, [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Intelligence Headquarters]] received a report of an [[Armia Krajowa]] agent (code name: ''‘Makary’'') who had covertly surveyed the Blizna [[Rail tracks|railway line]] and observed a [[Railroad car|freight car]] heavily guarded by [[Schutzstaffel|SS troops]] containing ''‘an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo’''.&lt;ref name="McGovern"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGovern|first=James|authorlink=James "Earthquake McGoon" McGovern Jr.|title=Crossbow and Overcast|year=1964 | publisher = W. Morrow|location=New York|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a plan was formed to make an attempt to capture a whole unexploded [[V-2 rocket]] and transport it to Britain. Around 20 May 1944, a relatively undamaged V-2 rocket fell on the swampy bank of the [[Bug River]] near the village of Sarnaki and local Poles managed to hide it before German arrival. The rocket was then dismantled and smuggled across Poland.&lt;ref name="Wojewódzki"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojewódzki|first=Michał|title=Akcja V-1, V-2|year=1984| location=Warsaw |language=Polish|isbn=83-211-0521-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late July 1944, the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] ([[Home Army and V1 and V2]]) secretly transported parts of the rocket out of Poland in [[Operation Most III]] (Bridge III),&lt;ref name="RussianSpaceWeb"&gt;[[#Anatoly69|Zak, Anatoly]]: Russian Space Web: 2009&lt;/ref&gt; for analysis by [[List of intelligence agencies#U|British intelligence]].

===A4-SLBM===
In late 1943 [[Deutsche Arbeitsfront]] Director, Otto Lafferenz, proposed the idea of a towable watertight container which could hold an A4 rocket. This suggestion progressed to the design of a container of 500 tons displacement to be towed behind a U-boat. Once in firing position, the containers would be trimmed to drop their aft end to a vertical position for launch. The project was dubbed ''Projekt Schwimmweste'' and the containers themselves referred to by the codename ''[[Rocket U-boat|Prüfstand XII]]''. Work on the containers was carried out by the Vulkanwerft, and a single example was completed by the end of the war, but never tested with a rocket launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Paterson | first = Lawrence | title = Black Flag: The Surrender of Germany's U-Boat Forces | publisher = MBI | year = 2009 | pages = 57–58 | isbn = 978-0-7603-3754-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor |A9|A4b}}

===A4b/A9===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Peenemünde]] --&gt;
In anticipation of the possibility that launch sites might be forced back into the Reich itself, von Braun and his colleagues were put under pressure to develop a longer-range version of the A4 known alternatively as A9 and A4b, the reason for the dual designation being that the A4 series had received "national priority"; the A4b designation ensured the availability of scarce resources.{{Sfn | Neufeld | 1996 | pp =  63, 93, 250, 283}}

In June 1939, Kurt Patt of the [[Peenemünde#HVP Organization|Peenemünde Design Office]], proposed wings for converting rocket speed and altitude into aerodynamic [[lift (force)|lift]] and range.{{Sfn | Neufeld | 1996 | p = 92}}  As the rocket encountered thicker atmosphere on its descent phase, it would execute a pullout and enter a shallow glide, trading speed for distance. Patt also proposed the ''Flossengeschoss'' (fin projectile).  Both concepts were utilized by [[Walter Dornberger]] when he drafted a memo for presentation to Hitler regarding the "America rocket" on July 31, 1940.{{Sfn | Neufeld | 1996 | pp = 138, 283}}

Design studies on the A9 began in 1940. In addition to its wings, the A9 would have been somewhat larger than the A4 and its engine would have produced about 30% more thrust. Following wind tunnel testing of models, the design was subsequently modified to replace the wings with fuselage [[strake (aviation)|strakes]], as the tests showed that these provided better lift at [[supersonic speed]]s and also solved the problem of [[transonic]] shift of the centre of lift.

Development was suspended in 1941, but in 1944 several V-2s were modified to an approximation of the A9 configuration under the designation A4b.{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | pp = 90–91}}  It was calculated that by fitting wings, the A4's range would be extended to {{convert|750|km|abbr =on}}, allowing targets in Britain to be attacked from launch sites within Germany itself. It was intended that following launch the curve of the A4b's trajectory would become shallower and the rocket would glide toward its target. It was anticipated that interception by enemy aircraft at the end of the glide phase would be virtually impossible as over the target the A-4b was intended to enter a near vertical dive leaving little time for interception.

The A4b concept was tested by fitting swept back wings to two A4s launched from Blizna. Little development work had been carried out and the first launch on 27 December 1944 was a complete failure. The second launch attempt, on 24 January 1945, was partially successful, in that the wing broke off, but the A4b still managed to become the first winged guided missile to break the [[sound barrier]] and attain [[Mach number|Mach]] 4.{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | p = 87}}&lt;ref name = harvey&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harvey | first = Brian  | title = Europe's space programme: to Ariane and beyond | publisher = Springer | year = 2003 | page = 16 | isbn = 978-1-85233-722-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations &amp;ndash; Planned, not constructed==

===A6===
A6 was a designation applied to a variant of the A5 test rocket which used different propellants.&lt;ref name=juergen/&gt;

Some sources indicate that it was also applied to a speculative proposal for a manned [[aerial reconnaissance]] version of the A4b winged variant of the A4. This A6 was initially proposed to the German Air Ministry as an uninterceptable reconnaissance craft. It would be launched vertically by rocket, taking it to an apogee of {{convert|95|km|abbr=on}}; after re-entering the atmosphere it would enter a supersonic glide phase, when its single [[ramjet]] would be ignited. It was hoped that this would provide 15 to 20 minutes of cruise at {{convert|2900|km/h|abbr=on}} and would allow the aircraft to return to its base and make a conventional runway landing assisted by a [[drag chute]]. However, the Air Ministry had no requirement for such an aircraft and the proposal was rejected. Similar concepts (though unmanned) were produced after the war in the form of the USA's [[SM-64 Navaho]] missile and the USSR's [[Burya]], both intercontinental cruise missiles with ramjet propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = A6  | publisher = Astronautix  | url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/a6.htm  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107181026/http://astronautix.com/lvs/a6.htm  | archivedate = 2010-01-07  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A7===
The A7 was a winged design that was never fully constructed. It was worked on between 1940 and 1943 at Peenemünde for the [[Kriegsmarine]]. The A7 was similar in structure to the A5, but had larger tail unit fins (1.621 m²) in order to obtain greater range in gliding flight. Two unpowered models of the A7 were dropped from airplanes in order to test flight stability; no powered test was ever performed. The finished rocket should have produced a takeoff thrust of 15&amp;nbsp;kN and a takeoff weight of 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. The design had a diameter of 0.38 m and a length of 5.91 m.{{Citation needed | date =September 2007}}

===A8===
The A8 was a proposed "stretched" variant of the A4, to use storable [[rocket propellant]]s (most likely [[nitric acid]] &amp; kerosene). The design never reached the prototype stage, but further design work was carried out after the war by a German rocket team in France as the "Super V-2". The project was eventually cancelled, but led to the French [[Véronique (rocket)|Véronique]] and [[Diamant]] rocket projects.&lt;ref name="juergen" /&gt;{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | p = 179}}

It was proposed to use an advanced version of the A9 to attack targets on the US mainland from launch sites in Europe, for which it would need to be launched atop a booster stage, the A10.

Design work on the A10 began in 1940, for a projected first flight to take place in 1946. The initial design was carried out by [[Ludwig Roth]] und Graupe and was completed on 29 June 1940. [[Hermann Oberth]] worked on the design during 1941, and in December 1941 Walter Thiel proposed that the A10 use an engine composed of six bundled A4 engines, which it was thought would give a total thrust of 180 tonnes.

Work on the A10 was resumed in late 1944 under the ''Projekt Amerika'' codename, and the A10's design was amended to incorporate a cluster of 6 A4 combustion chambers feeding into a single expansion nozzle. This was later altered to a massive single chamber and single nozzle. Test stands were constructed at Peenemunde for firings of the 200 tonne (440,920 lbf) thrust motor.

It was considered that existing guidance systems would not be accurate enough over a distance of 5,000&amp;nbsp;km, and it was decided to make the A9 piloted. The pilot was to be guided on his terminal glide towards the target by radio beacons on U-boats and by automatic weather stations landed in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]].

The final design of the A10 booster was approximately {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} in height. Powered by a {{convert|1670|kN|abbr=on}} thrust rocket burning diesel oil and nitric acid, during its 50-second burn it would have propelled its A9 second stage to a speed of about {{convert |4300|km/h|abbr=on}} and an altitude of {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | pp = 91–93}}

===A11===
The A11 (''Japan Rakete'') was a design concept which would have acted as the first stage of a three-stage rocket, the other two stages being the A9 and A10.

The A11 design was shown by von Braun to US officers in Garmisch-Partenkirchen; the drawing was later published in 1946 by the US Army. The A11 was shown as using six of the large single-chamber engines proposed for the A10 stage, with a modified A10 second stage nested within the A11. The design also showed the winged A9, indicating a gliding landing or bombing mission. To achieve orbit, either a new "kick stage" would have been required, or the A9 would have to have been lightened. In either case, only a payload of approximately {{convert|300|kg|abbr=on}} could have been placed in a low earth orbit.{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | p = 94}}

===A12===
The A12 design was a true [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital rocket]]. It was proposed as a four-stage vehicle, comprising A12, A11, A10 and A9 stages. Calculations suggested it could place as much as 10 tonnes payload in [[low Earth orbit]].

The A12 stage itself would have weighed around 3,500 tonnes fully fuelled, and would have stood {{convert|33|m|abbr=on}} high. It was to have been propelled by 50 A10 engines, fuelled by [[liquid oxygen]] and alcohol.{{Sfn | Reuter | 2000 | p = 95}}

The '''All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae''' or '''ASAS-SN''' is an automated program to search for new [[supernova]]e and other astronomical transients. It has robotic telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Currently, it can survey the entire sky approximately once every day.&lt;ref name=Dong&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dong|first1=S.|last2=Shappee|first2=B. J.|last3=Prieto|first3=J. L.|last4=Jha|first4=S.

Initially, there were four ASAS-SN telescopes at [[Haleakala]] and another four at [[Cerro Tololo]], an [[LCOGT]] site.  Twelve more telescopes were deployed in 2017 in Chile, South Africa and Texas, with funds from the Moore Foundation, the Ohio State University, the Mount Cuba Astronomical Foundation, China, Chile, Denmark, and Germany.  All the telescopes (Nikon telephoto f400/2.8 lenses) have a diameter of 14 cm and ProLine PL230 CCD cameras. The pixels in the cameras span 7.8 arc seconds, so follow up observations on other telescopes are usually required to get a more accurate location.&lt;ref name=holo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holoien|first1=Tom|last2=Stanek|first2=Kris|title=ASAS-SN's (Assassin's) Homepage|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml|website=www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=19 January 2016|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of the project is to look for bright supernovae, including the most powerful supernova ever discovered, [[ASASSN-15lh]]. However other transient objects are  frequently discovered, including nearby [[tidal disruption event]]s, Galactic [[nova]]e (e.g., [[ASASSN-16kt]], [[ASASSN-16ma]], and [[ASASSN-18fv]]), [[cataclysmic variable]]s, and [[stellar flare]]s, including several of the largest flares ever seen. In July 2017 ASAS-SN has discovered its first comet, [[ASASSN1]]. It can detect new objects with magnitudes between 18 and 8.&lt;ref name=holo/&gt;

Objects discovered receive designations starting with '''ASASSN''' followed by a dash, a two digit year and letters, for example [[ASASSN-15lh]].

'''''Amazon Watershed : the new environmental investigation''''' is a 1991 book by British writer and environmental and political activist, [[George Monbiot]].

==Synopsis==
The book is an investigation into the expulsion of peasants from their homes and their forced relocation to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. Military police attempt to kill Monbiot as he exposes a vast military project opening up the area to logging and deforestation. He tracks timber cut illegally from Indian reserves all the way back to retailers in the United Kingdom. According to the publishers, Monbiot also "examines the role of the British and American governments in promoting, wittingly or otherwise, this great ecological catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/books/amazon-watershed/|title=Amazon Watershed|accessdate=19 August 2015|website=Monbiot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book won the [[Natural World Book Prize]], described as "the premier environmental book prize in the UK" in 1991.

{{Anatomical terminology series}}

[[Anatomical terminology]] is used to describe microanatomical (or [[histology|histological]]) structures. This helps describe precisely the structure, layout and position of an object, and minimises ambiguity. An internationally accepted lexicon is [[Terminologia Histologica]].

==Layout==
[[File:Normal gastric mucosa intermed mag.jpg|thumb|This [[Histology|Histological]] section taken from the [[gastric antrum]], showing the [[stomach]] wall. The [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the stomach is the upper empty portion, and is surrounded by a single layer of columnar cells, called ''[[simple columnar epithelium]]''.]]
===Epithelia and endothelia===
''[[Epithelium|Epithelial]]'' cells line body surfaces, and are described according to their shape, with three principal shapes: squamous, columnar, and cuboidal. 
* '''Squamous epithelium''' has cells that are wider than their height (flat and scale-like).
* '''Cuboidal epithelium''' has cells whose height and width are approximately the same (cube shaped).
* '''Columnar epithelium''' has cells taller than they are wide (column-shaped).

''[[Endothelium]]'' refers to cells that line the interior surface of [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymphatic vessel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000035470|Endothelium}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming an interface between circulating [[blood]] or [[lymph]] in the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] and the rest of the vessel wall. It is a thin layer of simple, or single-layered, [[squamous epithelial cell|squamous cells]] called '''endothelial cells'''.  Endothelial cells in direct contact with blood are called vascular endothelial cells, whereas those in direct contact with lymph are known as lymphatic endothelial cells.

Epithelium can be arranged in a single layer of cells described as "simple", or more than one layer, described as "stratified". By layer, epithelium is classed as either simple epithelium, only one cell thick (unilayered) or stratified epithelium as [[stratified squamous epithelium]], [[stratified cuboidal epithelium]], and [[stratified columnar epithelium]] that are two or more cells thick (multi-layered),&lt;ref name="vanLommel-2002-p97"&gt;van Lommel, 2002: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvYjLNKLu9sC&amp;pg=PA97 p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Lommel, 2002: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EvYjLNKLu9sC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94]&lt;/ref&gt; and both types of layering can be made up of any of the cell shapes.&lt;ref name="marieb-p103-104"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marieb, Elaine M.|title=Human Anatomy and Physiology|edition=3rd|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|date=1995|isbn=0-8053-4281-8|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when taller simple columnar epithelial cells are viewed in cross section showing several nuclei appearing at different heights, they can be confused with stratified epithelia. This kind of epithelium is therefore described as [[pseudostratified columnar epithelium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Melfi, Rudy C.|editor2=Alley, Keith E.|title=Permar's oral embryology and microscopic anatomy: a textbook for students in dental hygiene|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date=2000|isbn=978-0-683-30644-6|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGonan0UwhQC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transitional epithelium]] has cells that can change from squamous to cuboidal, depending on the amount of tension on the epithelium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=Rebecca |title=Epithelial Cells |url=http://www.anatomyone.com/a/epithelial-cells/ |work=AnatomyOne |publisher=Amirsys, Inc. |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219035306/http://www.anatomyone.com/a/epithelial-cells/ |archivedate=2012-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mucosa===
A '''mucous membrane''' or '''mucosa''' is a [[biological membrane|membrane]] that lines various cavities in the body and covers the surface of internal organs. It consists of one or more layers of [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] overlying a layer of [[loose connective tissue]]. It is mostly of [[endoderm]]al origin and is continuous with the skin at various [[body orifice|body openings]] such as the [[eye]]s, [[ear]]s, [[Mucous membrane of nose|inside the nose]], [[Oral mucosa|inside the mouth]], [[lip]], the [[urethra]]l opening and the [[anus]]. Some mucous membranes secrete [[mucus]], a thick protective fluid. The function of the membrane is to stop [[pathogen]]s and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated.

===Submucosal and muscular layers===
The [[submucosa]] consists of a dense and irregular layer of connective tissue with [[blood vessel]]s, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscular layer. It contains the [[submucous plexus]], and [[enteric nervous system|enteric nervous plexus]], situated on the inner surface of the muscular layer.&lt;ref name=WHEATERS2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Deakin|first=Barbara Young ... [et al.] ; drawings by Philip J.|title=Wheater's functional histology : a text and colour atlas|year=2006|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=[Edinburgh?]|isbn=978-0-4430-6-8508|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|263}}

The [[muscular layer]] (also known as the ''muscularis propria''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral: Four layers of the G.I. tract|url=http://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/digestive/GI_layers.php|work=The Histology Guide|publisher=University of Leeds|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) consists of two layers of muscle, the inner and outer layer. The muscle of the inner layer is arranged in circular rings around the tract, whereas the muscle of the outer layer is arranged longitudinally. The stomach has an extra layer, an inner oblique muscular layer.&lt;ref name=WHEATERS2006 /&gt;{{rp|263}}  Between the two muscle layers are the [[myenteric plexus|myenteric]] or Auerbach's plexus. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells ([[interstitial cells of Cajal]]). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity ([[basal electrical rhythm]]) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can of course be modulated by the rest of the [[autonomic nervous system]].

The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch.

===Serosa and adventitia===
* '''[[Serosa]]''' (if the tissue is [[intraperitoneal]]) / '''[[Adventitia]]''' (if the tissue is [[retroperitoneal]]) -- these last two tissue types differ slightly in form and function according to the part of the gastrointestinal tract they belong to.

==Position on the cell membrane==
The hollow inner part of a body organ (such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]]) or tube (such as an [[artery]]) is called the ''[[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]''. The side of a cell facing the lumen is called the ''{{wt|en|apex|apical}}'' surface; the opposite side, facing away from the lumen is the ''[[Epithelial polarity#Basolateral membranes|basolateral]]'' surface, which faces instead  towards the ''[[interstitium]]'', and away from the lumen.

Bisection bandwidth accounts for the bottleneck bandwidth of the entire network. Therefore bisection bandwidth represents bandwidth characteristics of the network better than any other metric.

== Bisection bandwidth calculations&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
For a [[Network topology|linear array]] with n nodes bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth. For linear array only one link needs to be broken to bisect the network into two partitions. 
[[File:Bisected linear array.jpg|none|thumb|173x173px|Bisection of linear array network]]

For [[Ring network|ring]] topology with n nodes two links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth becomes bandwidth of two links. 
[[File:Bisected ring.jpg|none|thumb|178x178px|Bisection of a ring network]]
For [[Tree network|tree]] topology with n nodes can be bisected at the root by breaking one link, so bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth.
[[File:Bisected tree.jpg|none|thumb|170x170px|Bisection of a tree network]]

For [[Mesh networking|Mesh]] topology with n nodes, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; links.
[[File:Bisected mesh.jpg|none|thumb|173x173px|Bisection of a 2d mesh network]]

For [[Hypercube internetwork topology|Hyper-cube]] topology with n nodes, n/2 links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of n/2 links.

== Significance of bisection bandwidth ==
Theoretical support for the importance of this measure of network performance was developed in the PhD research of [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Thomborson:Clark_D=.html Clark Thomborson (formerly Clark Thompson)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~cthombor/Pubs/cmu-cs-80-140/cmu-cs-80-140scans.pdf|author=C.

The '''Comoé National Park Research Station''', located in the [[Comoé National Park]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], was founded by Professor Karl Eduard Linsenmair in 1989/90.

The research station was forced to close after the outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]] in 2002. After the end of the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]] in 2011 repairs at the station began and in 2014 the station had achieved again its full working capacity. The focus of the field based research is on conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour.

==History==
In 1989/90 a first research camp was realized with substantial funding provided by the Volkswagen Stiftung, the [[University of Würzburg]] and the respective Ministry (Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst). A successful application for a research grant by Linsenmair at the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] led to the expansion and transformation into a permanent station, after various bureaucratic hurdles in [[Germany]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], which delayed the construction of the field station approximately 8 years.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Habekuss|first1=Fritz|title=Der Patron und sein Paradies|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/11/elfenbeinkueste-comoe-nationalpark-forschungsstation-savanne|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=Die Zeit|issue=N°11/2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction started in 2000 and in early 2002 all guesthouses and other buildings apart from the lab were finished and a move from the camp to the new station was possible.

The outbreak of the [[First Ivorian Civil War]], in September 2002, resulted in the loss of the entire removable and demountable equipment and the closure of the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Degen|first1=Marieke|title=Civil war leaves Ivory Coast research in tatters|journal=Nature|date=13 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6924|pages=680–680|doi=10.1038/421680b|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/421680b.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|pmid=12610586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the positive development in the country after the [[Second Ivorian Civil War]], the rehabilitation of the station started in 2012 with remaining funds from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation and the University of Würzburg. With the construction of the solar plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coskun|first1=Ayhan|title=36 kWP for Research Station in Ivory Coast|url=http://www.solar23.com/news1.html|website=SOLAR23|publisher=SOLAR23|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2014, the rehabilitation was finished and the station had achieved its full working capacity again,&lt;ref name="Die Zeit"/&gt; making it one of the most modern field research stations in Africa.&lt;ref name="afrika"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Erik|title=Research Station Comoé|url=http://www.afrikazentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung_in_afrika/research_station_comoe/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=Afrikazentrum|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziels|first1=Susanne|last2=Linsenmair|first2=Karl Eduard|title=Comoé Research Station|journal=GTÖ Conference 2015|date=7 April 2015|page=Free Session 12-P11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homepage"/&gt;

==Research==
The Research of the station focuses on various fields of conservation, tropical ecology and behaviour, e.g. ecophysiology, chemical and evolutionary  ecology. In its first 2 decades before the civil war over 20 international research institutions conducted projects at the station with over 100 scientists contributing to the over 200 papers published in peer reviewed journals. Far more students participated in field courses, collecting data for more than 40 diploma, masters, bachelors and Ph.D. theses.&lt;ref name="uni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linsenmair|first1=Eduard|title=Tropenforscher kehren zurück|url=http://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/aktuelles_veranstaltungen/archiv1/single/artikel/tropenfors-1/|website=University of Würzburg|publisher=einBLICK|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

Moreau received a PhD in biology from [[Harvard University]] (2003 – 2007) under the guidance of [[E.O. Wilson|Dr. E.O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Letters to a Young Scientist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Passion Principle" /&gt; and [[Naomi Pierce|Dr. Naomi E. Pierce]].

She received a MSc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SF State Magazine: Connected to the Academy|url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~sfsumag/archive/spring_09/campus6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[San Francisco State University]] and the [[California Academy of Science]]s (2000 – 2003) and a Bachelors (1996 – 2000) from [[San Francisco State University]].

== Career ==

Moreau and colleagues were the first to establish the origin of the ants at 140 million years ago using molecular sequence data (40 million years older than previous estimates), and that the diversification of the ants coincided with the rise of the [[flowering plants]] (angiosperms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient Ants Arose 140-168 Million Years Ago: Insects Needed Flowering Plants To Flourish|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060407144825.htm|accessdate=16 September 2013|newspaper=Science News|date=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreau|first=Corrie |author2=Charles D.

[[File:Deadband.svg|thumb|Deadband is the period of dead-state of a system.]]
A '''deadband''' (sometimes called a '''neutral zone''' or '''dead zone''') is a band of input values in the [[domain of a function|domain]] of a [[transfer function]] in a [[control system]] or signal processing system where the output is zero (the output is 'dead' - no action occurs).  Deadband regions can be used in control systems such as [[servoamplifier]]s to prevent [[oscillation]] or repeated activation-deactivation cycles (called 'hunting' in [[proportional control]] systems).  A form of deadband that occurs in mechanical systems, [[simple machine#compound machines|compound machines]] such as [[gear train]]s is [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]].

[[File:Deadband plot.svg|thumb|Input and output of the deadband operator.]]

==Voltage regulators==
In some power substations there are [[voltage regulator|regulators]] that keep the [[voltage]] within certain predetermined limits, but there is a range of voltage in-between during which no changes are made, such as between 112 and 118 volts ('''deadband''' is 6 volts here), or 215 to 225 volts ('''deadband''' is 10 volts here).

==Backlash==
{{see|Backlash (engineering)}}
[[File:Backlash.svg|thumb|[[Backlash (engineering)|Backlash]] is a mechanical form of deadband.]]
Gear teeth with slop (''[[backlash (engineering)|backlash]]'') exhibit deadband. There is no drive from the input to the output shaft in either direction while the teeth are not meshed. [[Leadscrews]] generally also have backlash and hence a deadband, which must be taken into account when making position adjustments, especially with [[CNC]] systems. If mechanical backlash eliminators are not available, the control can compensate for backlash by adding the deadband value to the position vector whenever direction is reversed.

==Hysteresis vs. deadband==
Deadband is different from [[hysteresis]]. With hysteresis there is no dead zone, and so the output is always in one direction or another.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} Devices with hysteresis have memory, in that previous system states dictate future states.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} Examples of devices with hysteresis are single-mode thermostats and smoke alarms.

===Thermostats===
Simple (single mode) [[thermostat]]s exhibit hysteresis. For example, the furnace in the basement of a house is adjusted automatically by the thermostat to be switched on as soon as the temperature at the thermostat falls to 18&amp;nbsp;°C and the furnace is switched off by the thermostat as soon as the temperature at the thermostat reaches 22&amp;nbsp;°C. There is no temperature at which the house is not being heated or allowed to cool (furnace on or off).

A thermostat which sets a single temperature and automatically controls both heating and cooling systems without a mode change exhibits a deadband range around the target temperature.  The low end of the deadband is just above the temperature where the heating system turns on.  The high end of the deadband is just below the temperature where the air-conditioning system starts.

Dr '''Denis Coulthard Graham''' [[FRSE]] FRSC FIB FRSA (1929-2002) was a British biological chemist. He specialised in plant diseases and their treatment.

==Life==

He was born in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in December 1929.

He went to [[Durham University]] graduating BSc. He then undertook postgraduate studies at [[Edinburgh University]] gaining a doctorate (PhD). He rose to be Director of Agricultural Scientific Services in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries within the [[Scottish Office]]. Edinburgh University granted him a second, honorary doctorate (DSc) whilst in this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s he lived in Caiystone Gardens in southern Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?topic=446296.0&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1975 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Mary Noble]], .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 12 October 2002.

==Family==

In 1968 he married Elizabeth (Betty) Fraser, a New Zealander. They had no children.

'''eCybermission''' (stylized as '''eCYBERMISSION''') is a [[U.S. Army]]-sponsored online educational [[science fair]] for students in grades 6-9 in the United States or at US Army schools across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neal|first=Dennis|title=Students fly 7,500 miles to compete in Army science competition|url=http://www.army.mil/article/83179/Students_fly_7_500_miles_to_compete_in_Army_science_competition/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=ARMY.MIL - The Official Homepage of the United States Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest is conducted entirely online—groups of 3-4 students submit "Mission Folders", which contain detailed information about their projects choosing either Scientific Inquiry or the Engineering Design Process.

The competition selects winners on state, regional, and finally national levels for each grade level. All regional winners receive a one-week trip to the Washington, DC area to attend the National Judging and Educational Event (NJ&amp;EE). Students can win up to $9,000 in savings bonds (maturity value).&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=eCyberMission Fact Sheet 2011-2012|url=https://www.ecybermission.com/public/NewsMedia/eCM%20Fact%20Sheet%20FINAL.pdf|publisher=US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NJ&amp;EE event includes many opportunities to meet others, physical training, various workshops and panels, as well as the STEM Challenge, which is a day working with scientists and engineers from different sectors of [[RDECOM]], the department of the Army that oversees the events.

eCYBERMISSION is part of the Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP).

The competition is administered by the [[National Science Teachers Association|National Science Teachers Association (NSTA)]].

The '''electron rest mass''' (symbol: {{math|'''''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'''}}) is the [[Mass in special relativity|mass]] of a stationary [[electron]]. It is one of the fundamental [[Physical constant|constants]] of [[physics]] and is also very important in [[chemistry]] because of its relation{{dubious|date=June 2018}} to the [[Avogadro constant]]. It has a value of about {{val|9.109|e=−31}} [[kilogram]]s or about {{val|5.486|e=−4}} [[atomic mass unit]]s, [[Mass–energy equivalence|equivalent]] to an [[energy]] of about {{val|8.187|e=−14}} [[joule]]s or about 0.5110 [[Electronvolt|MeV]].&lt;ref name="CODATA"&gt;[[CODATA 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term "rest mass" is used because according to [[special relativity]] the mass of an object is increased in a frame of reference that is moving relative to that object. Most practical measurements are carried out on moving electrons. If the electron is moving at a [[Relativistic speed|relativistic velocity]], the result must therefore be corrected to obtain the rest mass. This correction is only substantial for electrons accelerated by voltages of well over 100 [[Volt|kV]].

== Determination ==
Since the electron mass determines a number of observed effects in atomic physics, there are potentially many ways to determine its mass from an experiment, if the values of other physical constants are already considered known.

Historically, the mass of the electron was determined directly from combining two measurements. The [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of the electron was first estimated by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1890 by measuring the deflection of "cathode rays" due to a known magnetic field in a [[cathode ray tube]]. This was before it was even known what cathode rays actually were! It was seven years later that [[J. J. Thomson]] showed that cathode rays consist of streams of particles, to be called electrons, and made more precise measurements of their mass-to-charge ratio again using a cathode ray tube.

The second measurement was of the [[Electric charge|charge]] of the electron. This was determined with a precision of better than 1% by [[Robert A. Millikan]] in his famous [[oil drop experiment]] in 1909. Together with the mass-to-charge ratio, the electron mass was thereby determined with reasonable precision. The value of mass that was found for the electron was initially met with surprise by physicists, since it was so small (less than .1%) compared to the known mass of a hydrogen atom.

The electron rest mass can be calculated from the  [[Rydberg constant]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; and the [[fine structure constant]] ''α'' obtained through spectroscopic measurements. Using the definition of the Rydberg constant:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\infty} = \frac{m_{\rm e}c\alpha^2}{2h} &lt;/math&gt;,

thus

:&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm e} = \frac{2R_{\infty}h}{c\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light and ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref name="CODATA" /&gt;  The relative uncertainty, 5{{e|&amp;minus;8}} in the 2006 [[Committee on Data for Science and Technology | CODATA]] recommended value,&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{citation | title = The NIST reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/index.html | publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is due entirely to the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant.

The electron relative atomic mass can be measured directly in a [[Penning trap]]. It can also be inferred from the spectra of [[antiprotonic helium]] atoms ([[helium]] atoms where one of the electrons has been replaced by an [[antiproton]]) or from measurements of the electron [[g-factor (physics)|''g''-factor]] in the hydrogenic ions &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; or &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;.

The electron relative atomic mass is an adjusted parameter in the CODATA set of fundamental physical constants, while the electron rest mass in kilograms is calculated from the values of the Planck constant, the fine structure constant and the Rydberg constant, as detailed above.&lt;ref name="CODATA" /&gt; &lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;

== Relationship to other physical constants ==
As mentioned above, the electron mass is used to calculate{{CN|date=June 2018}} the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;N_{\rm A} = \frac{M_{\rm u} A_{\rm r}({\rm e})}{m_{\rm e}} = \frac{M_{\rm u} A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2}{2R_\infty h}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence it is also related to the [[atomic mass constant]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm u} = \frac{N_{\rm A}}{M_{\rm u}} = \frac{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})}{m_{\rm e}} = \frac{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2}{2R_\infty h}&lt;/math&gt;
where M&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is [[molar mass constant]] (defined in [[SI]]) and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e) is a directly measured quantity, the [[relative mass of electron]].

Note that ''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is defined in terms of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and not the other way round, and so the name "electron mass in atomic mass units" for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e) involves a circular definition (at least in terms of practical measurements).

The electron relative atomic mass also enters into the calculation of all other relative atomic masses. By convention, relative atomic masses are quoted for neutral atoms, but the actual measurements are made on positive [[ion]]s, either in a [[mass spectrometer]] or a [[Penning trap]]. Hence the mass of the electrons must be added back on to the measured values before tabulation. A correction must also be made for the mass equivalent of the [[binding energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. Taking the simplest case of complete ionization of all electrons, for a nuclide X of [[atomic number]] ''Z'',&lt;ref name="CODATA" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\rm r}({\rm X}) = A_{\rm r}({\rm X}^{Z+}) + ZA_{\rm r}({\rm e}) - E_{\rm b}/m_{\rm u}c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
As relative atomic masses are measured as ratios of masses, the corrections must be applied to both ions: the uncertainties in the corrections are negligible, as illustrated below for hydrogen 1 and oxygen 16.

The principle can be shown by the determination of the electron relative atomic mass by Farnham ''et al.'' at the University of Washington (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.3598 | last1 = Farnham | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Van Dyck, Jr. | first2 = R. S. | last3 = Schwinberg | first3 = P. B. | title = Determination of the Electron's Atomic Mass and the Proton/Electron Mass Ratio via Penning Trap Mass Spectroscopy | journal = [[Physical Review Letters|Phys. Rev. Lett.]] | year = 1995 | volume = 75 | issue = 20 | pages = 3598–3601 | bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.3598F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the measurement of the frequencies of the [[cyclotron radiation]] emitted by electrons and by &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in a Penning trap. The ratio of the two frequencies is equal to six times the inverse ratio of the masses of the two particles (the heavier the particle, the lower the frequency of the cyclotron radiation; the higher the charge on the particle, the higher the frequency):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\nu_c ({}^{12}{\rm C}^{6+})}{\nu_c ({\rm e})} = \frac{6A_{\rm r}({\rm e})}{A_{\rm r}({}^{12}{\rm C}^{6+})} = 0.000\,274\,365\,185\,89(58)&lt;/math&gt;
As the relative atomic mass of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is very nearly 12, the ratio of frequencies can be used to calculate a first approximation to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e), {{nowrap|5.486&amp;thinsp;303&amp;thinsp;7178{{e|&amp;minus;4}}}}. This approximate value is then used to calculate a first approximation to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;), knowing that ''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C)/''m''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (from the sum of the six ionization energies of carbon) is {{nowrap|1.105&amp;thinsp;8674{{e|&amp;minus;6}}}}: ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≈ {{nowrap|11.996&amp;thinsp;708&amp;thinsp;723&amp;thinsp;6367}}. This value is then used to calculate a new approximation to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and the process repeated until the values no longer vary (given the relative uncertainty of the measurement, 2.1{{e|&amp;minus;9}}): this happens by the fourth cycle of iterations for these results, giving ''A''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(e)&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|5.485&amp;thinsp;799&amp;thinsp;111(12){{e|&amp;minus;4}}}} for these data.

In [[structural geology|structural]] [[geology]], '''en échelon veins''' or "en échelon gash fractures" are structures within rock caused by noncoaxial [[Shear (geology)|shear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = G.

They appear as sets of short, parallel, planar, mineral-filled lenses within a body of a rock.  They originate as [[Tension (geology)|tension]] [[fracture]]s that are parallel to the major [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] orientation, σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, in a [[shear zone]]. They are subsequently filled by [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of a mineral, typically [[quartz]] or [[calcite]]. As soon as they form, they begin to rotate in the shear zone. Subsequent growth of the fracture therefore causes the vein to take on a [[wikt:sigmoidal|sigmoidal]] shape. They can be used to determine the incremental [[kinematics]] of the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation history]] of the rock.

In [[chemistry]], '''ferrous''' (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), indicates a [[divalent]] [[iron]] compound (+2 [[oxidation state]]), as opposed to [[ferric]], which indicates a [[trivalent]] iron compound (+3 oxidation state).&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{Citation | title = Ferrous | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferrous | accessdate = 19 April 2008 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage has decreased, with current [[IUPAC]] nomenclature having names containing the oxidation state in bracketed Roman numerals instead, such as [[iron(II) oxide]] for ferrous oxide (FeO), and [[iron(III) oxide]] for ferric oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[File:Pourbaix Diagram of Iron.svg|thumb|[[Pourbaix diagram]] of aqueous iron]]

Outside chemistry, ''ferrous'' indicates the presence of iron.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; The word is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|ferrum}}'' ("iron").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Etymology (Meaning of Words) | date = 30 November 2007 | url = http://en.allexperts.com/q/Etymology-Meaning-Words-1474/Origin-word-1.htm | accessdate = 19 April 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrous metals include [[steel]] and [[pig iron]] (with a carbon content of a few percent) and [[alloy]]s of iron with other metals (such as stainless steel). Manipulation of atom-to-atom relationships between iron, carbon, and various alloying elements establishes the specific properties of ferrous metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrous Alloys Properties|url=http://www.steelforge.com/literature/ferrousnon-ferrous-materials-textbook/ferrous-metals/|publisher=All Metals &amp; Forge Group|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-ferrous]] [[metal]]s and alloys do not contain an appreciable amount of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Non ferrous | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/non%20ferrous | accessdate = 19 April 2008 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;Ferric refers to iron-containing materials or compounds. In chemistry the term is reserved for iron with an oxidation number of +3, also denoted iron(III) or Fe3+. On the other hand, ferrous refers to iron with oxidation number of +2, denoted iron(II) or Fe2+.

'''Ghanim''' is an [[impact crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Ghanim was first observed in ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images during that mission's February 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at 38.5° North [[Latitude]], 281.5° West [[Longitude]] and is 13.9 kilometers across.&lt;ref name=gpn /&gt;  The topography of the impact crater appears very subdued, suggesting that the crater has undergone significant viscous relaxation since its formation.  Tectonics has also affected this crater, by influencing the final, polygonal shape of the crater as well disrupting the southeastern and northwestern margins of the crater following its formation.

[[Ghanim bin Ayyub|Ghanim]] is named after the title character of the "[[Tale of Ghanim Bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the Thrall O’ Love]]" in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''. Incidentally, craters named after Ghanim's father, [[Ayyub (crater)|Ayyub]], and sister, [[Fitnah (crater)|Fitnah]], are found nearby.

{{compact ToC|side=yes|center=yes|nobreak=yes|seealso=yes|refs=yes|}}


{{Science}}



==A==
*'''[[Height above ground level|Above ground level]]''' — In [[aviation]], [[atmospheric sciences]] and [[broadcasting]], a '''height above ground level''' ('''AGL'''&lt;ref name="CAP413"&gt;{{cite book | date=28 May 2015 | title=Radiotelephony Manual |publisher=UK Civil Aviation Authority| id=CAP413| isbn=9780 11792 893 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[height#In aviation|height]] measured with respect to the underlying [[earth's surface|ground surface]]. This is as opposed to altitude/elevation [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL), or (in [[broadcast engineering]]) [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT). In other words, these expressions (AGL, AMSL, HAAT) indicate where the "zero level" or "reference altitude" is located.
*'''[[Absolute humidity]]''' — describes the water content of air and is expressed in either grams per cubic meter&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, S.S., "A treatise on producer-gas and gas-producers", (1906) The Engineering and Mining Journal, London, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; or grams per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W, (2007) ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'' (8th Edition),  Section 12, Psychrometry, Evaporative Cooling and Solids Drying [[McGraw-Hill]], {{ISBN|978-0-07-151135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*'''[[Absolute value]]''' — In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[non-negative]] value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} without regard to its [[sign (mathematics)|sign]]. Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = −''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|−''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.
*'''[[Acceleration]]''' —  In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.
*'''[[Acquisition of signal]]''' —  A '''pass''', in [[spaceflight]] and [[satellite communications]], is the period in which a [[satellite]] or other [[spacecraft]] is above the [[Horizontal coordinate system|local horizon]] and available for [[radio]] communication with a particular [[ground station]], [[satellite receiver]], or relay satellite (or, in some cases, for visual sighting). The beginning of a pass is termed ''acquisition of signal''; the end of a pass is termed ''loss of signal''.&lt;ref name=NLSA&gt;{{cite web|title=AOS, TCA, and LOS|url=http://www.nlsa.com/definitions/aos_defined.html|publisher=Northern Lights Software Associates|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the ''time of closest approach''.&lt;ref name=NLSA/&gt;
*'''[[Action (physics)|Action]]''' — In [[physics]], '''action''' is an attribute of the [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of a [[physical system]] from which the [[equations of motion]] of the system can be derived. It is a [[functional (mathematics)|mathematical functional]] which takes the [[trajectory]], also called ''path'' or ''history'', of the system as its argument and has a [[real number]] as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.&lt;ref name="mcgraw1"&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{ISBN|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of [[energy|[energy]]]⋅[[time|[time]]] or [[momentum|[momentum]]]⋅[[length|[length]]], and its [[SI unit]] is [[joule]]-second.
*'''[[Automatic direction finder|ADF]]''' —Automatic direction finder
*'''[[Advanced Space Vision System]]''' — The '''Advanced Space Vision System''' (also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS) is a  [[computer vision]] system designed primarily for [[International Space Station]] (ISS) assembly.&lt;ref name="nrcc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|title=Space Vision System Helps Astronauts See in Space|accessdate=February 13, 2008|publisher=National Research Council of Canada|year=2008|author=NRCC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603143525/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/education/innovations/discoveries/svs.html|archivedate=June 3, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses regular 2D cameras in the [[Space Shuttle]] bay, on the [[Canadarm]], or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.&lt;ref name="nrcc"/&gt;
*'''[[Aeroacoustics]]''' — Is a branch of [[acoustics]] that studies noise generation via either [[turbulent]] fluid motion or [[aerodynamic]] forces interacting with surfaces. Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows.  A notable example of this phenomenon is the [[Aeolian sound|Aeolian tones]] produced by wind blowing over fixed objects.
*'''[[Aerobraking]]''' — is a [[spaceflight]] maneuver that reduces the high point of an [[elliptical orbit]] ([[apoapsis]]) by flying the vehicle through the [[atmosphere]] at the low point of the [[orbit]] ([[periapsis]]). The resulting [[Drag (physics)|drag]] slows the [[spacecraft]]. Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a [[rocket engine]].
*'''[[Aerocapture]]''' —  is an [[Orbital maneuver|orbital transfer maneuver]] used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a [[hyperbolic trajectory]] to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' — is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. 
*'''[[Aeroelasticity]]''' — is the branch of [[physics]] and [[engineering]] that studies the interactions between the [[inertial force|inertial]], [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a [[fluid]] flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as [[energy harvesting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sousa|first=V. C.|title=Enhanced aeroelastic energy harvesting by exploiting combined nonlinearities: theory and experiment|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2011|volume=20|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding [[snoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first= P. D. M. |title= Laser palatoplasty for snoring due to palatal flutter: a further report|journal= Clinical Otolaryngology|year=1994|volume=19|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields: static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or [[steady state|steady]] response of an elastic body to a fluid flow; and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the body's [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (typically [[vibration]]al) response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of [[fluid mechanics]], [[solid mechanics]], [[structural dynamics]] and [[dynamical systems]]. The synthesis of aeroelasticity with [[thermodynamics]] is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with [[control theory]] is known as aeroservoelasticity.
*'''[[Aeronautics]]''' — Is the science or art involved with the study, [[design process|design]], and manufacturing of air [[flight]] capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the [[atmosphere]].
*'''[[Aerospace architecture]]''' — is broadly defined to encompass [[architecture|architectural]] design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems; [[space vehicle]]s, [[space station]]s, habitats and lunar and [[planetary surface construction]] bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems.
*'''[[Aerospace bearing]]''' — '''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.
*'''[[Aerospace engineering]]''' — is the primary field of [[engineering]] concerned with the development of [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Aerospace Engineering''. [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-75440-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has two major and overlapping branches: Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering.  [[Avionics]] engineering is similar, but deals with the [[electronic engineering|electronics]] side of aerospace engineering.
*'''[[Aerospace materials]]''' — are materials, frequently [[alloy|metal alloy]]s, that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for [[aerospace]] purposes. These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].
*'''[[Aerospike engine]]''' — is a type of [[rocket engine]] that maintains its [[aerodynamic]] efficiency across a wide range of [[altitude]]s. It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25–30% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for [[thrust]].
*'''[[Aerostat]]''' — is a [[lighter than air]] aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and powered [[airship]]s.
*'''[[Aerostructure]]''' — is a component of an [[aircraft]]'s airframe. This may include all or part of the [[fuselage]], [[wing]]s, or flight control surfaces.
*'''[[Aft-crossing trajectory]]''' — is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rocket's rotation (induced by the deployment from the aircraft) is slowed by a small [[parachute]] attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it.  It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. 
*'''[[Above ground level|AGL]]''' — Above ground level
*'''[[Aileron]]''' — is a hinged [[flight control surface]] usually forming part of the [[trailing edge]] of each [[wing]] of a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in [[Flight dynamics|roll]] (or movement around the aircraft's [[Flight control surfaces#Longitudinal axis|longitudinal axis]]), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the [[Lift (force)|lift vector]].  Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.
*'''[[Air-augmented rocket]]''' —
*'''[[Aircraft]]''' — is a [[machine]] that is able to [[flight|fly]] by gaining support from the [[air]].&lt;!--English word "aircraft" is singular and plural with no "s". See also the link to Wiktionary below.--&gt; It counters the force of gravity by using either [[Buoyancy|static lift]] or by using the [[Lift (force)|dynamic lift]] of an [[airfoil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft|title=Aircraft - Define Aircraft at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328141634/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aircraft|archivedate=28 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in a few cases the [[Powered lift|downward thrust]] from [[jet engine]]s.  Common examples of aircraft include [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[airship]]s (including [[blimp]]s), [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]]s, and [[hot air balloon]]s.&lt;ref name="wingsoverkansas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Kinds &amp; Types of Aircraft|url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/features/a1037/|website=www.wingsoverkansas.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121165354/http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/features/a1037/|archivedate=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*'''[[Aircraft flight control systems]]''' — A conventional [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] '''aircraft flight control system''' consists of [[flight control surfaces]], the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight. [[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.
*'''[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]''' —
*'''[[Airfoil]]''' — An '''airfoil''' ([[American English]]) or '''aerofoil''' ([[British English]]) is the cross-sectional shape of a [[wing]], blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]).
*'''[[Airlock]]''' — is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a [[pressure vessel]] and its surroundings while minimizing the change of [[pressure]] in the vessel and loss of [[air]] from it.  The lock consists of a small chamber with two [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] [[door]]s in series which do not open simultaneously.
*'''[[Airship]]''' — An '''airship''' or '''dirigible balloon''' is a type of [[aerostat]] or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airship|title=Definition of AIRSHIP|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a [[lifting gas]] that is less dense than the surrounding air.
*'''[[Albedo]]''' — is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an [[astronomical body]] (e.g. a [[planet]] like [[Earth]]). It is [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).
*'''[[Anemometer]]''' — is a device used for measuring [[wind speed]], and is also a common [[weather station]] instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word ''anemos'', which means [[wind]], and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in [[meteorology]].
*'''[[Angle of attack]]''' —  In [[fluid dynamics]], '''angle of attack''' ('''AOA''', or '''&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;''') is the [[angle]] between a [[Airfoil#Airfoil terminology|reference line]] on a body (often the [[chord (aircraft)|chord line]] of an [[airfoil]]) and the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/incline.html|title=NASA aeronautics guided tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle of attack is the angle between the body's reference line and the oncoming flow. 
*'''[[Angular momentum]]''' — In [[physics]], '''angular momentum''' (rarely, '''moment of momentum''' or '''rotational momentum''') is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].
*'''[[Angular velocity]]''' — In [[physics]], the '''angular velocity''' of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its [[angular displacement]] relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, [[radians per second]] in [[SI]] units, and is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.
*'''[[Anticyclone]]''' — An '''anticyclone''' (that is, opposite to a [[cyclone]]) is a [[weather]] [[meteorological phenomenon|phenomenon]] defined by the United States [[National Weather Service]]'s glossary as "a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Glossary: Anticyclone|date=|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140523/http://www.nws.noaa.gov/glossary/index.php?word=anticyclone|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Antimatter rocket]]''' — is a proposed class of [[rocket]]s that use [[antimatter]] as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the [[rest mass]] of a matter/antimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher [[energy density]] and [[specific impulse]] than any other proposed class of rocket.
*'''[[Apsis]]''' — is an extreme point in the [[orbit]] of an [[physical body|object]]. The word comes via Latin from Greek and is [[cognate]] with ''[[apse]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apsis|title=the definition of apsis|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[elliptic orbit]]s about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes ''peri-'' ({{ety||''περί'' (peri)|near}}) and ''ap-''/''apo-'' ({{ety||''ἀπ(ό)'' (ap(ó))|away from}}) added to a reference to the [[primary (astronomy)|body being orbited]].

This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and (usually) higher cost.  Also, the [[thrust]] levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines.
*'''[[Areal velocity]]''' — In [[classical mechanics]], '''areal velocity''' (also called '''sector velocity''' or '''sectorial velocity''') is the rate at which [[area]] is swept out by a particle as it moves along a [[curve]].

*'''[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)]]''' — In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

*'''[[Beam-powered propulsion]]''' — also known as directed energy propulsion, is a class of [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft propulsion]] that uses energy beamed to the spacecraft from a remote power plant to provide energy. The beam is typically either a [[microwave]] or a [[laser]] beam and it is either pulsed or continuous.  A continuous beam lends itself to [[thermal rocket]]s, [[Photonic laser thruster|photonic thrusters]] and [[light sail]]s, whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and [[pulse detonation engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Breakthrough|title=Progress in beamed energy propulsion {{!}} Kevin Parkin|date=2018-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnvHNoYuTpI|accessdate=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Buoyancy]]''' — In [[physics]], '''buoyancy''' or '''upthrust''', is an upward [[force]] exerted by a [[fluid]] that opposes the [[weight]] of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upwards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and (as explained by [[Archimedes' principle]]) is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the [[Displacement (fluid)|displaced]] fluid.

*'''[[Cabin pressurization]]''' — is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

In the [[Solar System]], a [[planet]] is said to be '''inferior''' or '''interior''' with respect to another planet if its [[orbit]] lies inside the other planet's orbit around the [[Sun]]. In this situation, the latter planet is said to be '''superior''' to the former. In the reference frame of the [[Earth]], in which the terms were originally used, the inferior planets are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], while the superior planets are [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. [[Dwarf planet]]s like [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] or [[Pluto]] and most [[asteroids]] are 'superior' in the sense that they almost all orbit outside the orbit of Earth.

== History ==
These terms were originally used in the [[geocentric]] [[cosmology]] of [[Claudius Ptolemy]] to differentiate as inferior those planets ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]) whose [[epicycle]] remained co-linear with the Earth and Sun, and as superior those planets ([[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]) that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | title=The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes
 | page=186 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
 | isbn=0-521-28031-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, the terms were modified by [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], who rejected Ptolemy's geocentric model, to distinguish a [[planet]]'s [[orbit]]'s size in relation to the [[Earth]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Planets in each category==
When [[Earth]] is stated or assumed to be the reference point: 
*"Inferior planet" refers to [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], which are closer to the [[Sun]] than Earth is.
*"Superior planet" refers to [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]] (the latter two added later), which are farther from the Sun than Earth is.

The terms are sometimes used more generally; for example, Earth is an inferior planet relative to Mars.

== Other planetary terms ==
Interior planet now seems to be the preferred term for astronomers. Inferior/interior and superior are different from the terms [[inner planet]] and [[outer planet]], which designate those planets which lie inside the [[asteroid belt]] and those that lie outside it, respectively. Inferior planet is also different from [[minor planet]] or [[dwarf planet]]. Superior planet is also different from [[gas giant]].

[[Image:Inscribed square.svg|thumb|right|Example: The black dashed curve goes through all corners of several blue squares.]]
The '''inscribed square problem''', also known as the '''square peg problem''' or the '''Toeplitz' conjecture''', is an unsolved question in [[geometry]]: ''Does every [[Jordan curve|plane simple closed curve]] contain all four vertices of some [[Square (geometry)|square]]?''  This is true if the curve is [[convex set|convex]] or piecewise [[Smooth function|smooth]] and in other special cases. The problem was proposed by [[Otto Toeplitz]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last= Toeplitz | first = O. | authorlink = Otto Toeplitz | title = Über einige Aufgaben der Analysis situs | journal = Verhandlungen der Schweizerischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Solothurn | volume = 94 | date = 1911 | page = 197 | language = de }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early positive results were obtained by [[Arnold Emch]]&lt;ref name="Emch"&gt;{{citation |last=Emch |first=Arnold |year=1916 |title=On some properties of the medians of closed continuous curves formed by analytic arcs |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |doi=10.2307/2370541 |mr=1506274 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=6–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Lev Schnirelmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Šnirel'man |first=L.

== Problem statement ==
Let ''C'' be a [[Jordan curve]]. A [[polygon]] ''P'' is '''inscribed in ''C'' ''' if all vertices of ''P'' belong to ''C''. The '''inscribed square problem''' asks:

: ''Does every Jordan curve admit an inscribed square?''

It is ''not'' required that the vertices of the square appear along the curve in any particular order.

==Examples==
Some figures, such as [[circle]]s and [[Square (geometry)|square]]s, admit infinitely many [[inscribed]] squares. If ''C'' is an [[obtuse triangle]] then it admits exactly one inscribed square; right triangles admit exactly two, and acute triangles admit exactly three.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bailey | first1 = Herbert | last2 = DeTemple | first2 = Duane | title = Squares inscribed in angles and triangles | journal = [[Mathematics Magazine]] | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | date = 1998 | pages = 278–284 | doi=10.2307/2690699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resolved cases ==
It is tempting to attempt to solve the inscribed square problem by proving that a special class of well-behaved curves always contains an inscribed square, and then to approximate an arbitrary curve by a sequence of well-behaved curves and infer that there still exists an inscribed square as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of squares inscribed in the curves of the sequence. One reason this argument has not been carried out to completion is that the limit of a sequence of squares may be a single point rather than itself being a square. Nevertheless, many special cases of curves are now known to have an inscribed square.&lt;ref name="matschke"&gt;{{citation |last=Matschke |first=Benjamin |year=2014 |title=A survey on the square peg problem |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |doi=10.1090/noti1100 |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=346–352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piecewise analytic curves===
{{harvtxt|Emch|1916}} showed that [[piecewise]] [[analytic curve]]s always have inscribed squares. In particular this is true for [[polygon]]s. Emch's proof considers the curves traced out by the [[midpoint]]s of [[Secant line|secant]] [[line segments]] to the curve, parallel to a given line. He shows that, when these curves are intersected with the curves generated in the same way for a perpendicular family of secants, there are an odd number of crossings. Therefore, there always exists at least one crossing, which forms the center of a [[rhombus]] inscribed in the given curve. By rotating the two perpendicular lines continuously through a [[right angle]], and applying the [[intermediate value theorem]], he shows that at least one of these rhombi is a square.&lt;ref name="matschke"/&gt;

=== Locally monotone curves ===
[[Walter Stromquist|Stromquist]] has proved that every ''local monotone'' plane simple curve admits an inscribed square. &lt;ref name="stromquist"&gt;{{citation |last=Stromquist |first=Walter |year=1989 |title=Inscribed squares and square-like quadrilaterals in closed curves |journal = Mathematika|mr=1045781|doi=10.1112/S0025579300013061|volume=36 |issue=2|pages= 187 – 197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition for the admission to happen is that for any point {{mvar|p}}, the curve {{mvar|C}} should be locally represented as a graph of a function {{math|''y''{{=}}''f''(''x'')}}.

In more precise terms, for any given point {{mvar|p}} on {{mvar|C}}, there is a neighborhood {{math|''U''(''p'')}} and a fixed direction {{math|''n''(''p'')}} (the direction of the “{{mvar|y}}-axis”) such that no [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] of {{mvar|C}} -in this neighborhood- is parallel to {{math|''n''(''p'')}}. 

Locally monotone curves include all types of [[polygon]]s, all closed [[convex set|convex]] curves, and all piecewise [[Smooth function#Differentiability classes|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] curves without any [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp]]s.

===Curves without special trapezoids===
An even weaker condition on the curve than local monotonicity is that, for some &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the curve does not have any inscribed special trapezoids of size &amp;epsilon;. A special trapezoid is an [[isosceles trapezoid]] with three equal sides, each longer than the fourth side, inscribed in the curve with a vertex ordering consistent with the clockwise ordering of the curve itself. Its size is the length of the part of the curve that extends around the three equal sides. If there are no such trapezoids (or an even number of them), the limiting argument for general curves can be carried to completion, showing that curves with this property always have an inscribed square.&lt;ref name="matschke"/&gt;

===Curves in annuli===
If a Jordan curve inscribed in an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose outer radius is at most {{math|1 + {{sqrt|2}}}} times its inner radius, and it is drawn in such a way that it separates the inner circle of the annulus from the outer circle, then it contains an inscribed square. In this case, if the given curve is approximated by some well-behaved curve, then any large squares that contain the center of the annulus and are inscribed in the approximation are topologically separated from smaller inscribed squares that do not contain the center. The limit of a sequence of large squares must again be a large square, rather than a degenerate point, so the limiting argument may be used.&lt;ref name="matschke"/&gt;

===Symmetric curves===
The affirmative answer is also known for centrally symmetric curves, even badly-behaved ones such as the [[Koch snowflake]], and curves with reflective symmetry across a line.&lt;ref name="nielsen-wright"&gt;{{citation |last1=Nielsen |first1=Mark J. |last2=Wright |first2=S. E. |year=1995 |title=Rectangles inscribed in symmetric continua |journal=Geometriae Dedicata |mr=1340790 |doi=10.1007/BF01263570 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=285–297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants and generalizations ==
One may ask whether other shapes can be inscribed into an arbitrary Jordan curve. It is known that for any triangle ''T'' and Jordan curve ''C'', there is a triangle similar to ''T'' and inscribed in ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Meyerson |first=Mark D. |year=1980 |title=Equilateral triangles and continuous curves |journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae |mr=600575 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.4064/fm-110-1-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Kronheimer |first1=E. H. |last2=Kronheimer |first2=P. B. |author2-link=Peter B. Kronheimer |year=1981 |title=The tripos problem |journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society |series=Second Series |mr=623685 |doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-24.1.182 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=182–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the set of the vertices of such triangles is [[dense set|dense]] in ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nielsen |first=Mark J. |year=1992 |title=Triangles inscribed in simple closed curves |journal=Geometriae Dedicata |mr=1181760 |doi=10.1007/BF00151519 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=291–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is always an inscribed [[equilateral triangle]]. It is also known that any Jordan curve admits an inscribed [[rectangle]].

Some generalizations of the inscribed square problem consider inscribed polygons for curves and even more general [[continuum (topology)|continua]] in higher dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s. For example, Stromquist proved that every continuous closed curve ''C'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; satisfying "Condition A" that no two chords of ''C'' in a suitable neighborhood of any point are perpendicular admits an inscribed quadrilateral with equal sides and equal diagonals.&lt;ref name="stromquist"/&gt; This class of curves includes all ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; curves. Nielsen and Wright proved that any symmetric continuum ''K'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; contains many inscribed rectangles.&lt;ref name="nielsen-wright"/&gt; H.W. Guggenheimer proved that every hypersurface ''C''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-[[diffeomorphic]] to the [[n-sphere|sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; contains 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; vertices of a regular Euclidean [[n-cube|''n''-cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Guggenheimer |first=H. |year=1965 |title=Finite sets on curves and surfaces |journal=Israel Journal of Mathematics |doi=10.1007/BF02760036 |mr=0188898 |volume=3 |pages=104–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Space Shuttle]] '''LKS''' (Russian: Лёгкий Космический Самолёт, "Light Cosmos Plane") was a [[Soviet Union]] project led by [[Vladimir Chelomey]] in response to the [[Space Shuttle|United States Space Shuttle]]. The ''LKS'' was smaller and cheaper than its American counterpart, but was ultimately discarded in favor of the larger [[Buran programme|Buran]]. Claiming that the Buran project was too big, heavy, and expensive for Russia to complete, Chelomey designed the LKS in 1979. He ordered the construction of a full-scale mock-up, as a way to further stimulate interest. The project was never fully sanctioned however, and in 1982, Chelomey was officially ordered by the Soviet government to stop any further development. In March 1983, Chelomey made yet another attempt to obtain permission to build the LKS to repel US Intercontinental ballistic missiles. This too proved futile. In 1991 the mock-up was destroyed, possibly by sabotage. 

== History ==
From 1950 to 1964, before the [[Space Shuttle|US Space Shuttle]] in 1972, Chelomey developed two concepts for a spacecraft that would launch vertically and land horizontally. The MP-1 Kosmoplan{{refneeded|date=October 2018}} was planned to complete missions to the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, it would land with the support of turbocharged engines similar to a conventional airplane. The other concept, called [[Raketoplan]] or "rocket plane", was a space shuttle intended to orbit the Earth and transport passengers, space freight, and weapons. Both concepts were never implemented due to the dis-empowerment of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. 

In 1976, the Soviet government formally authorized the “head-designer” [[Valentin Glushko]] to proceed with the Buran project, which was intended to simply copy the Space Shuttle. The Buran project and its massive [[launch vehicle]] ''Energia'' were the targets of several critics among Russian space designers and scientists. One of them was Vladimir Chelomey, Glushko’s former ally, who was responsible for the famous OKB-52 [[NPO Mashinostroyeniya]] (from which came the [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]] rocket, the [[TKS (spacecraft)|TKS spacecraft]], and the [[Almaz]] and [[Salyut programme|Salyut]] space stations).

In 1979, Chelomey affirmed that the Buran project was too big, heavy, and expensive for Russia to complete, and designed the ''LKS'', another space shuttle concept, as an alternative to the [[Buran programme|Buran]] or [[Energia]]. The first concept had two V-type vertical stabilizers, similar to the [[F/A-18]] vertical stabilizer arrangement. This was later changed to the conventional arrangement of a rudder, similar to the Space Shuttle and Buran. 

In 1980, within a month of work, Chelomey ordered the construction of a full-scale mock-up by his team, as a way to further stimulate Soviet authorities in his direction. 

In 1982, Chelomey was officially ordered by the Soviet government to stop any further development of the LKS project. By this point, he was believed to have expended more than 400,000 rubles in a program not formally authorized by the Soviets. When US President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) in March 1983, Chelomey made yet another attempt to obtain permission to build the LKS to repel US [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. However, in September 1983, he was rejected by a government commission. Chelomey died in December 1984, leaving behind his most ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/lks.html LKS russianspaceweb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the mock-up was destroyed in a so-called “act of sabotage” by unknown people for unknown reasons. It is believed{{whom|date=October 2018}} that if the LKS project was to be approved and completed, it would've been a valid alternative not only to Buran but also to [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] itself for [[Mir]] and [[International Space Station|ISS]] space operations.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Hendrikx Bert Vis: Energiya-Buran The Soviet Space Shuttle, Kapitel: The roots of Buran Page 28 The origins of the Space Shuttle Page 44–45. {{ISBN|978-0-387-69848-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Anatoly Zak [www.russianspaceweb.com/raketoplan.html Raketoplan RussianSpaceWeb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leopold Adametz''' (11 October 1861, [[Valtice]] &amp;ndash; 27 January 1941, [[Vienna]]) was a [[Moravia]]-born [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[zoologist]]. The son of a manufacturer, he studied at the Hochschule für Bodenkultur in [[Vienna]] and at the [[University of Leipzig]]. In 1886, he was awarded his doctorate. He became an assistant of Martin Wickens and in 1888 an assistant professor of zoology. From 1891 he was a professor in [[Kraków|Krakau]], from 1898 until 1932 he was the professor of animal product studies and the morphology of house pets at the Hochschule für Bodenkultur in Wien. He was a member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9388">This is a list of [[butterfly]] species in diverse genera with the common name '''[[wikt:fritillary|fritillary]]'''. The term refers to the chequered markings on the wings, usually black on orange, and derives from the Latin ''fritillus'' (meaning dice-box - or, according to some sources, a chequerboard: the [[Fritillaria meleagris|fritillary flower]], with its chequered markings, has the same derivation).&lt;ref name=SOED&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0199206872|pages=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most fritillaries belong to the family [[Nymphalidae]].

'''Magnification''' is the process of enlarging the [[angular diameter|apparent size]], not physical size, of something. This enlargement is quantified by a calculated number also called "magnification". When this number is less than one, it refers to a reduction in size, sometimes called ''minification'' or ''de-magnification''.

Typically, magnification is related to scaling up [[visual]]s or [[image]]s to be able to see more detail, increasing [[angular resolution|resolution]], using [[microscope]], [[printing]] techniques, or [[digital processing]]. In all cases, the magnification of the image does not change the [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] of the image.

==Examples of magnification==
Some [[optical instrument]]s provide visual aid by magnifying small or distant subjects.

* A [[magnifying glass]], which uses a [[Lens (optics)|positive (convex) lens]] to make things look bigger by allowing the user to hold them closer to their eye.
* A [[telescope]], which uses its large [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] or [[primary mirror]] to create an image of a distant object and then allows the user to examine the image closely with a smaller [[eyepiece]] lens, thus making the object look larger.
* A [[microscope]], which makes a small object appear as a much larger image at a comfortable distance for viewing. A microscope is similar in layout to a telescope except that the object being viewed is close to the objective, which is usually much smaller than the eyepiece.
* A [[slide projector]], which projects a large image of a small slide on a screen. A photographic [[enlarger]] is similar.

==Magnification as a number (optical magnification)==
Optical magnification is the ratio between the apparent size of an object (or its size in an image) and its true size, and thus it is a [[dimensionless number]]. Optical magnification is sometimes referred to as "power" (for example "10× power"), although this can lead to confusion with [[optical power]].

===Linear or transverse magnification===
For [[real image]]s, such as images projected on a screen, ''size'' means a linear dimension (measured, for example, in millimeters or [[inch]]es).

===Angular magnification===
For [[optical instrument]]s with an [[eyepiece]], the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece ([[virtual image]] in infinite distance) cannot be given, thus ''size'' means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point ([[angular size]]). Strictly speaking, one should take the [[tangent]] of that angle (in practice, this makes a difference only if the angle is larger than a few degrees). Thus, angular magnification is given by:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathrm{MA}=\frac{\tan \varepsilon}{\tan \varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="incline"&gt;{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle subtended by the object at the front focal point of the objective and &lt;math display="incline"&gt;{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle subtended by the image at the rear focal point of the eyepiece.

For example, the mean angular size of the [[Moon]]'s disk as viewed from Earth's surface is about 0.52°. Thus, through [[binoculars]] with 10× magnification, the Moon appears to subtend an angle of about 5.2°.

By convention, for [[magnifying glass]]es and optical [[microscope]]s, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: 25&amp;nbsp;cm from the eye.

[[File:basic optic geometry.png|thumb|A [[Thin lens]] where black dimensions are real, grey are virtual. The direction of the arrows can be used to describe cartesian +/- signage : from the centre of the lens, left or down = negative, right or up = positive.]]

===By instrument===
====Single lens====
The linear magnification of a [[thin lens]] is

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M = {f \over f-d_o}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[focal length]] and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d_o&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the lens to the object. Note that for [[real image]]s, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is negative and the image is inverted. For [[virtual image]]s, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is positive and the image is upright.

With &lt;math display="incline"&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; being the distance from the lens to the image, &lt;math display="incline"&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; the height of the image and &lt;math display="incline"&gt;h_o&lt;/math&gt; the height of the object, the magnification can also be written as:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M = -{d_i \over d_o} = {h_i \over h_o}&lt;/math&gt;

Note again that a negative magnification implies an inverted image.

====Photography====
The image recorded by a [[photographic film]] or [[image sensor]] is always a [[real image]] and is usually inverted. When measuring the height of an inverted image using the [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be negative, and as a result ''M'' will also be negative. However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is "[[real image|real]] is positive, [[virtual image|virtual]] is negative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sidney F. |last=Ray |title=Applied Photographic Optics: Lenses and Optical Systems for Photography, Film, Video, Electronic and Digital Imaging |location= |publisher=Focal Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-240-51540-4 |page=40 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=cuzYl4hx-B8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA40,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always ''real'' and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are ''real'' and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are ''virtual'' and negative. Therefore, the ''photographic magnification'' formulae are traditionally presented as:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M = {d_i \over d_o}  =  {h_i \over h_o}  =  {f \over d_o-f}  =  {d_i-f \over f}&lt;/math&gt;

====Telescope====
The angular magnification of an [[optical telescope]] is given by

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M= -{f_o \over f_e}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math display="incline"&gt;f_o&lt;/math&gt; is the [[focal length]] of the [[objective (optics)|objective]] [[lens (optics)|lens]] in a [[refracting telescope|refractor]] or of the [[primary mirror]] in a [[reflecting telescope|reflector]], and &lt;math display="incline"&gt;f_e&lt;/math&gt; is the focal length of the [[eyepiece]].

====Magnifying glass====
The maximum angular magnification (compared to the naked eye) of a [[magnifying glass]] depends on how the glass and the object are held, relative to the eye. If the lens is held at a distance from the object such that its front focal point is on the object being viewed, the relaxed eye (focused to infinity) can view the image with angular magnification

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathrm{MA}={25\ \mathrm{cm}\over f}\quad&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math display="incline"&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[focal length]] of the [[lens (optics)|lens]] in centimeters. The constant 25&amp;nbsp;cm is an estimate of the "near point" distance of the eye&amp;mdash;the closest distance at which the healthy naked eye can focus. In this case the angular magnification is independent from the distance kept between the eye and the magnifying glass.

If instead the lens is held very close to the eye and the object is placed closer to the lens than its focal point so that the observer focuses on the near point, a larger angular magnification can be obtained, approaching

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathrm{MA}={25\ \mathrm{cm}\over f}+1\quad&lt;/math&gt;

A different interpretation of the working of the latter case is that the magnifying glass changes the diopter of the eye (making it myopic) so that the object can be placed closer to the eye resulting in a larger angular magnification.

====Microscope====
The angular magnification of a [[microscope]] is given by

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathrm{MA}=M_o \times M_e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math display="incline"&gt;M_o&lt;/math&gt; is the magnification of the objective and &lt;math display="incline"&gt;M_e&lt;/math&gt; the magnification of the eyepiece. The magnification of the objective depends on its [[focal length]] &lt;math display="incline"&gt;f_o&lt;/math&gt; and on the distance &lt;math display="incline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; between objective back focal plane and the [[focal plane]] of the [[eyepiece]] (called the tube length):

&lt;math display="block"&gt;M_o={d \over f_o}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnification of the eyepiece depends upon its focal length &lt;math display="incline"&gt;f_e&lt;/math&gt; and is calculated by the same equation as that of a magnifying glass (above).

Note that both astronomical telescopes as well as simple microscopes produce an inverted image, thus the equation for the magnification of a telescope or microscope is often given with a [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Measurement of telescope magnification===
Measuring the actual angular magnification of a telescope is difficult, but it is possible to use the reciprocal relationship between the linear magnification and the angular magnification, since the linear magnification is constant for all objects.

The telescope is focused correctly for viewing objects at the distance for which the angular magnification is to be determined and then the object glass is used as an object the image of which is known as the [[exit pupil]]. The diameter of this may be measured using an instrument known as a Ramsden [[dynameter]] which consists of a Ramsden eyepiece with micrometer hairs in the back focal plane. This is mounted in front of the telescope eyepiece and used to evaluate the diameter of the exit pupil. This will be much smaller than the object glass diameter, which gives the linear magnification (actually a reduction), the angular magnification can be determined from
:&lt;math display="incline"&gt;\mathrm{MA} =1 / M  = D_{\mathrm{Objective}}/{D_\mathrm{Ramsden}}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Maximum usable magnification===
With any telescope or microscope, or a lens
a maximum magnification exists beyond which the image looks bigger but shows no more detail.  It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see.  Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called "empty magnification".

For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction]].  In practice it is considered to be 2× the aperture in millimetres or 50× the aperture in inches; so, a 60mm diameter telescope has a maximum usable magnification of 120×.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

With an optical microscope having a high [[numerical aperture]] and using [[oil immersion]], the best possible resolution is 200&amp;nbsp;nm corresponding to a magnification of around 1200×. Without oil immersion, the maximum usable magnification is around 800×.  For details, see [[Optical microscope#Limitations|limitations of optical microscopes]].

Small, cheap telescopes and microscopes are sometimes supplied with the eyepieces that give magnification far higher than is usable.

==Magnification and micron bar==

Magnification figures on printed pictures can be misleading.  Editors of journals and magazines routinely resize images to fit the page, making any magnification number provided in the figure legend incorrect.  A scale bar (or micron bar) is a bar of stated length superimposed on a picture.  This bar can be used to make accurate measurements on a picture.  When a picture is resized the bar will be resized in proportion.  If a picture has a scale bar, the actual magnification can easily be calculated.  Where the scale (magnification) of an image is important or relevant, including a scale bar is preferable to stating magnification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">'''The National Centre for e-Social Science''' (NCeSS) was a [[UK]] based centre which aimed to promote [[e-Social Science]].  It was founded circa 2003 with funding from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) to investigate how innovative and powerful computer-based infrastructure and tools developed over the previous three years under the UK e-Science programme could benefit [[social science]]. The foundation of much of the work was the use of computational infrastructure that was collaboratively provisioned and worked across organisational boundaries. Collaboration was key and the computational approach was commonly known as '[[Grid Computing]]'.

e-Social Science refers to the use of enhanced computer and information technology infrastructure and tools for social science. The role of NCeSS was to investigate specific applications of e-Social Science, develop tools to support them and to advise on the future strategic direction of [[e-Social Science]] and [[e-Science]] more generally. NCeSS also provided information, training, advice, support and on-line resources to help the social science research community adopt e-Social Science approaches. NCeSS developed a portal based e-Infrastructure based on [https://sakaiproject.org/ Sakai] to support e-Social Science, but it was short lived due to lack of resources for sustaining it.

NCeSS was coordinated from the [[University of Manchester]], and involved groups from various other UK universities. The NCeSS research programme included applications of [[e-Science]] in both quantitative and qualitative social sciences, and studies of issues relevant to promoting the wider adoption of [[e-Science]].

NCeSS gradually stopped functioning and the NCeSS Sakai Portal went off line in around 2011.

By 2015, little remains online to indicate that NCeSS ever existed, but the Internet Archive Way Back Machine captured something of the Web Site that once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Neurotree and Academic Family Tree are volunteer-run; accuracy is maintained by a group of volunteer editors. Hierarchical connections between parents and children are defined as any meaningful mentoring relationship (research assistant, graduate student, or postdoctoral fellow) between researchers. Continuous records extend well into the Middle Ages and earlier.
 
As of 5 February 2018, Neurotree contained 116,874 people with 135,773 connections among them.&lt;ref name ="NeurotreeTree"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neurotree.org/|title=Neurotree|website=neurotree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 5 February 2018, Academic Family Tree contained 689,800 people with 606,600 connections among them.&lt;ref name="AFTAbout"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academictree.org/about.php|title=About The Academic Tree|website=academictree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Family Tree encompasses a broad range of disciplines. As of 5 February 2018, there were 55 disciplines spanning science (e.g., [[human genetics]], [[microbiology]], and [[psychology]]), [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]], [[engineering]], and the [[humanities]] (e.g., [[economics]], [[law]], and [[theology]]).&lt;ref name="AFT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academictree.org/|title=The Academic Family Tree|website=academictree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two databases are closely linked. A search for a person in Neurotree gives results not only from Neurotree, but also from any of the 54 other trees in Academic Family Tree in which that person appears. The same is true for a search in any of those trees under Academic Family Tree or from the main page of Academic Family Tree.

==History==

[[File:Operation Castle test.ogv|thumb|320px|Operation Castle test video]]
'''Operation Castle''' was a United States series of [[nuclear weapon yield|high-yield]] (high-energy) [[nuclear test]]s by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF-7) at [[Bikini Atoll]] beginning in March 1954. It followed ''[[Operation Upshot–Knothole]]'' and preceded ''[[Operation Teapot]]''.

Conducted as a joint venture between the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), the ultimate objective of the operation was to test designs for an aircraft-deliverable [[thermonuclear]] weapon.

Operation Castle was considered by government officials to be a success as it proved the feasibility of deployable "dry" fuel designs for [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. There were technical difficulties with some of the tests: one device had a yield much lower than predicted (a "[[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]"), while two other bombs detonated with over twice their predicted yields. One test in particular, ''[[Castle Bravo]]'', resulted in extensive radiological contamination of nearby islands (including inhabitants and U.S. soldiers stationed there), as well as a nearby Japanese fishing boat (the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]''), resulting in one direct fatality, and then continued health problems for many of those exposed. Public reaction to the tests and an awareness of the long-range effects of [[nuclear fallout]] has been attributed as being part of the motivation for the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963.

==Background==

[[Bikini Atoll]] had previously hosted nuclear testing in 1946 as part of ''[[Operation Crossroads]]'' where the world's fourth and fifth atomic weapons were detonated in Bikini Lagoon. Since then, American nuclear weapons testing had moved to [[Enewetak|Enewetok Atoll]] to take advantage of generally larger islands and deeper water. Both atolls were part of the American [[Pacific Proving Grounds]].

The extremely [[nuclear weapon yield|high yields]] of the Castle weapons caused concern within the AEC that potential damage to the limited infrastructure already established at Enewetak would delay other operations. Additionally, the cratering from the ''Castle'' weapons was expected to be comparable to that of ''[[Ivy Mike]]'', a 10.4 [[TNT equivalent|megatons of TNT]] (Mt) device tested at Enawetak in 1952 leaving a crater approximately {{convert|1|mi}} in diameter marking the location of the obliterated test island [[Elugelab]].&lt;ref&gt;''Operation Ivy'', pg 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ivy Mike'' test was the world's first "hydrogen bomb", producing a full-scale [[thermonuclear]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] explosion. The ''Ivy Mike'' device used liquid [[deuterium]], an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], making it a "wet" bomb. The complex [[Dewar flask|dewar]] mechanisms needed to store the liquid deuterium at [[cryogenic]] temperatures made the device three stories tall and 82 tons in total weight, far too heavy and bulky to be a usable weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Sun'', pg 495.&lt;/ref&gt; With the success of ''Ivy Mike'' as proof of the [[Teller-Ulam]] bomb concept, research began on using a "dry" fuel to make a practical fusion weapon so that the United States could begin production and deployment of thermonuclear weapons in quantity. The final result incorporated [[lithium hydride#Lithium deuteride|lithium deuteride]] as the fusion fuel in the Teller-Ulam design, vastly reducing size and weight and simplifying the overall design. ''Operation Castle'' was charted to test four dry fuel designs, two wet bombs, and one smaller device. The approval for ''Operation Castle'' was issued to JTF-7 by Major General [[Kenneth D. Nichols]], the General Manager of the AEC, on January 21, 1954.

==Experiments==
''Operation Castle'' was organized into seven experiments, all but one of which were to take place at Bikini Atoll. Below is the '''original''' test schedule (as of February 1954).&lt;ref&gt;''Castle Series'', pg 247&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Echo'' test was canceled due to the liquid fuel design becoming obsolete with the success of dry-fueled ''Bravo'' as noted above. ''Yankee'' was similarly considered obsolete and the Jughead device was replaced with a "Runt II" device (similar to the ''Union device''), which was hastily completed at Los Alamos and flown to Bikini. With this revision, both of the wet fuel devices were removed from the test schedule.

''Operation Castle'' was intended to test lithium deuteride (LiD) as a thermonuclear fusion fuel. A solid at room temperature, LiD, if it worked, would be far more practical than the cryogenic liquid deuterium fuel in the Ivy Mike device. The same Teller-Ulam principle would be used as in the ''Ivy Mike'' so-called "Sausage" device, but the fusion reactions were different. ''Ivy Mike'' fused deuterium with deuterium, but the LiD devices would fuse deuterium with tritium. The tritium was produced during the explosion by irradiating the lithium with [[neutron temperature|fast neutrons]].

''Bravo'', ''Yankee (II)'', and ''Union'' used lithium enriched in the Li-6 isotope (''Bravo'' and ''Yankee'' used lithium enriched to 40% Li-6, while the lithium used in ''Union'' was enriched to 95% Li-6), while ''Romeo'' and ''Koon'' were fueled with natural lithium (92% Li-7, 7.5% Li-6). The use of natural lithium would be important to the ability of the US to rapidly expand its nuclear stockpile during the [[Cold War]] [[nuclear arms race]], since the so-called "Alloy Development Plants" were in an early stage at the time ''Castle'' was carried out. The first plant started production in the fall of 1953.

As a hedge, development of liquid deuterium weapons continued in parallel. Even though they were much less practical because of the logistical problems dealing with the transport, handling, and storage of a cryogenic device, the Cold War arms race drove the demand for a viable fusion weapon. The "Ramrod" and "Jughead" devices were liquid fuel designs greatly reduced in size and weight from their so-called "Sausage" predecessor. The "Jughead" device was eventually weaponized, and it saw limited fielding by the [[U.S. Air Force]] until the "dry" fuel H-bombs became common.

''Nectar'' was not a fusion weapon in the same sense as the rest of the ''Castle'' series. Even though it used lithium fuel for [[boosted fission weapon|fission boosting]], the principal reaction material in the second stage was uranium and plutonium. Similar to the Teller-Ulam configuration, a [[nuclear fission]] explosion was used to create high temperatures and pressures to compress a second [[fissionable]] mass. This would have otherwise been too large to sustain an efficient reaction if it were triggered with conventional explosives. This experiment was intended to develop intermediate yield weapons for expanding the inventory (around 1-2 Mt vs. 4-8).

Many fusion or thermonuclear weapons generate much, or even most, of their yields from fission. Although the U-238 isotope of uranium will not sustain a chain reaction, it still fissions when irradiated by the intense fast neutron flux of a fusion explosion. Because U-238 is plentiful and has no [[critical mass]], it can be added in (in theory) almost unlimited quantities as a [[neutron reflector#Nuclear weapons|tamper]] around a fusion bomb, helping to contain the fusion reaction and contributing its own fission energy. For example, the fast-fission of the U-238 tamper contributed 77% (8.0 megatons) to the yield of the 10.4 Mt ''Ivy Mike'' explosion.

==Test execution==
The most notable event of ''Operation Castle'' was the ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' test. The dry fuel for ''Bravo'' was 40% Li-6 and 60% Li-7. Only the Li-6 was expected to breed tritium for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction; the Li-7 was expected to be inert. Yet [[J. Carson Mark]], the head of the Los Alamos Theoretical Design Division, had speculated that ''Bravo'' could "go big", estimating that the device could produce an explosive yield as much as 20% more than had been originally calculated.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, page 179&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered, because of the unexpected larger yield, that the Li-7 in the device also undergoes breeding that produces tritium. In practice, ''Bravo'' exceeded expectations by 150%, yielding 15 Mt — about 1,000 times more powerful than the ''[[Little Boy]]'' weapon used on [[Hiroshima]]. ''Castle Bravo'' remains to this day, the largest detonation ever carried out anywhere by the United States, and the fifth largest H-bomb detonation in the world.

Because ''Castle Bravo'' greatly exceeded its expected yield, JTF-7 was caught unprepared. Much of the permanent infrastructure on Bikini Atoll was heavily damaged. The intense thermal flash ignited a fire at a distance of {{convert|20|nmi|km}} on the island of Eneu (base island of Bikini Atoll).&lt;ref&gt;Castle Series, pg 209&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] contaminated all of the atoll, so much so, that it could not be approached by JTF-7 for 24 hours after the test, and even then exposure times were limited.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, pg 140&lt;/ref&gt; As the fallout spread downwind to the east, more atolls were contaminated by radioactive calcium ash from the incinerated underwater coral banks. Although the atolls were evacuated soon after the test, 239 Marshallese on the [[Utirik Atoll|Utirik]], [[Rongelap Atoll|Rongelap]], and [[Ailinginae Atoll]]s were subjected to significant levels of radiation. 28 Americans stationed on the [[Rongerik]] Atoll were also exposed. Follow-up studies of the contaminated individuals began soon after the blast as [[Project 4.1]], and though the short-term effects of the radiation exposure for most of the Marshallese were mild and/or hard to correlate, the long-term effects were pronounced. Additionally, 23 Japanese fishermen aboard ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' were also exposed to high levels of radiation. They suffered symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]], and one crew member died in September 1954.

The heavy contamination and extensive damage from ''Bravo'' significantly delayed the rest of the series. The rescheduling after ''Bravo'' was ''officially'' released on April 14, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''Castle Series'' pg 268&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Castle Romeo'' and ''Koon'' tests were complete by the time that this revision was published.

As ''Operation Castle'' progressed, the increased yields and fallout caused test locations to be reevaluated. While the majority of the tests were planned for barges near the sand spit of Iroij, some were moved to the craters of ''Bravo'' and ''Union''. In addition, ''Castle Nectar'' was moved from Bikini Atoll to the crater of ''Ivy Mike'' at [[Eniwetok]] for expediency, since Bikini was still heavily contaminated from the previous tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Castle Series'' pg 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final test in ''Operation Castle'' took place on May 14, 1954.

''Operation Castle'' was an unqualified success for the implementation of dry fuel devices. The ''Bravo'' design was quickly weaponized and is suspected to be the progenitor of the [[Mark 21 nuclear bomb|Mk-21]] gravity bomb. The Mk-21 design project began on March 26, 1954 (just three weeks after ''Bravo'') with production of 275 weapons beginning in late 1955. ''Romeo'', relying on natural lithium, was rapidly turned into the [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|Mk-17 bomb]], the first deployable US [[thermonuclear weapon|H-bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomicmuseum.com/Tour/cw2.cfm Development of the Mk 17 bomb], Atomic Museum.com&lt;/ref&gt; and was available to strategic forces as an Emergency Capability weapon by mid-1954. Most of the ''Castle'' dry fuel devices eventually appeared in the inventory and ultimately grandfathered the majority of thermonuclear configurations.

In contrast, the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]]-designed ''Koon'' was a failure. Using natural lithium and a heavily modified [[Teller-Ulam]] configuration, the test produced only 110 kiloton of an expected 1.5 megaton yield. While engineers at the Radiation Laboratory had hoped it would lead to a promising new field of weapons, it was eventually determined that the design allowed premature heating of the lithium fuel, thereby disrupting the delicate fusion conditions.

'''Paolo Del Buono''' (1625-1659) was an Italian scientific instrument maker.

A Florentine disciple of [[Famiano Michelini]] (1604-1665),&lt;ref&gt;October 26, 1625 - 1662 according to: de Lalande, Joseph Jérôme François. [https://books.google.com/books?id=a_wOAAAAQAAJ Voyage d'un François en Italie, fait dans les années 1765 &amp; 1766. Vol. 2.] 1769. p343-344&lt;/ref&gt; Paolo Del Buono received his [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Pisa]] in 1649. In 1655, he went to [[Germany]] to enter the service of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] (Emperor from 1637 to 1657) and was appointed director of the [[Imperial Mint]]. During his stay, with his student [[Geminiano Montanari]] (1633-1687), he visited the imperial mines in the [[Carpathian mountains]] and invented a method of extracting water. Del Buono performed wide-ranging research in [[physics]] and experimental science. Paolo and his brother [[Candido Del Buono]] (1618-1676) both belonged to the [[Accademia del Cimento]],&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lIqAQAAMAAJ Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Volume 6]. Springer-Verlag, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; with whom Paolo corresponded from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Boschiero, Luciano. Experiment and natural philosophy in seventeenth-century Tuscany: The history of the Accademia del Cimento. Vol. 21. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2007. p98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also noted for an experiment in 1657 which showed the incompessibility of water where water compressed in a gold shell by a screw seeped through pores in the gold,&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Charles.

'''''Psychology and Alchemy''''' is Volume 12 in ''[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung]]'', a series of books published by [[Princeton University Press]] in the U.S. and [[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]] in the U.K. It is study of the analogies between [[alchemy]], [[Christian dogma]], and [[symbol|psychological symbolism]].&lt;ref name='PUP12'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/696.html | title = Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 12: Psychology and Alchemy | accessdate = 2014-01-20 | publisher = Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alchemy is central to Jung's hypothesis of the [[collective unconscious]]. This book begins with an outline of the process and aims of [[psychotherapy]] as seen by Jung. It then moves on to work out the analogies mentioned above and his own understanding of the [[analytic psychology|analytic process]]. Jung reminds us of the dual nature of alchemy, comprising both the chemical process and a parallel mystical component. He also discusses the seemingly deliberate mystification of the alchemists. Finally, in using the alchemical process to provide insights into [[individuation]], Jung emphasises the importance of alchemy in relating to us the transcendent nature of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].&lt;ref name='Routledge'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/catalogs/jung_and_analytical_psychology_2013_online_catalog/4/ | title = Collected Works of C.G.

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In this book, Jung argues for a reevaluation of the symbolism of [[Alchemy]] as being intimately related to the psychoanalytical process. Using a cycle of dreams of one of his patients he shows how the symbols used by the Alchemists occur in the psyche as part of the reservoir of mythological images drawn upon by the individual in their dream states. Jung draws an analogy between the Great Work of the Alchemists and the process of reintegration and individuation of the psyche in the modern psychiatric patient.

In drawing these parallels Jung reinforces the universal nature of his theory of the archetype and makes an impassioned argument for the importance of spirituality in the psychic health of the modern man. Lavishly illustrated with images, drawings and paintings from Alchemy and other mythological sources including [[Christianity]] the book is another example of Jung's immense erudition and fascination with the eso- and exoteric expressions of spirituality and the psyche in religion and mysticism.

Influenced by pioneering work by [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]] and [[Herbert Silberer]] (who was in turn influenced by Jung), ''Psychology and Alchemy'' is a seminal work of reevaluation of a forgotten system of thought which did much to revitalise interest in Alchemy as a serious force in Western philosophical and esoteric culture.

Also interesting about this book is that the patient whose dreams are being analyzed in the second section is the physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who would go on to collaborate with Jung on such ideas as the acausal connection principle of [[synchronicity]]. The dreams are interpreted as a series to elucidate the meanings of recurring motifs and symbols, with the series culminating in the vision of a 'world clock', which is actually several clocks on different planes operating on different scales and colours as a symbol of Pauli's unconscious apprehension of some grand cosmic order. Three of the best of these dreams were also mentioned by Jung in his Terry lectures ''Psychology of Religion''.

==Content==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The fundamental thesis Jung is advancing about the relationship between Alchemy and Psychology is that for pre-scientific humans there is not a sharp distinction between subject and object and thus this leads them to unconsciously [[Psychological projection|project]] their own inner states onto external objects (especially objects that are mostly unknown to them), so a reflective analysis of alchemical symbols becomes revelatory about the unconscious psychic life of this time period. Prior to this rational segregation of experience the world was a totally different one, phenomenologically, as people did not distinguish between the qualities of the object they were perceiving and their own values, emotions, and beliefs. It is partly for this reason that the alchemists cannot say aloud exactly what the [[philosopher's stone]] really 'is' and why there are so many different symbols for the work.

For the alchemist trying to understand matter and develop base metals into their purest form, gold, substances are grouped as being alike based on their perceived value. Jung documents as these alchemists collectively come to understand that they themselves must embody the change they hope to effect within their materials: for instance, if they hope to achieve the philosopher's stone that can redeem 'base' or 'vulgar' metals, then the alchemist too must become a redeemer figure. It became apparent to the alchemists that they were trying to redeem nature as Christ had redeemed man, hence the identification of the ''Lapis Philosophorum'' with Christ the Redeemer. The [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Opus]] (work) of alchemy, viewed through this interpretation, becomes a symbolic account of the fundamental process the human psyche undergoes as it re-orients its value system and creates meaning out of chaos. The opus beginning with the [[nigredo]] (blackening, akin to depression or nihilistic loss of value) in order to descend back into the manipulable ''[[prima materia]]'' and proceeding through a process of spiritual purification that must unite seemingly irreconcilable opposites (the coniunctio) to achieve new levels of consciousness.

==Part I. Introduction to the Religious and Psychological Problems of Alchemy==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Jung sets out the central thesis of the book: that Alchemy draws upon a vast array of symbols, images and patterns drawn from the [[Collective Unconscious]] of the West. Jung defends his exploration of the [[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] and [[Soul]] against various critics who have accused him of being both religious and anti-religious depending on their point of view. He argues for a deeper understanding of the Western spiritual traditions e.g. [[Esoteric Christianity]] and Alchemy alongside an examination of the Eastern ones e.g. [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] etc. Jung diagnoses the spiritual laziness of the West in not truly embracing the Christian [[Myth]] as an inner journey of transformation. Alchemy, he argues, is a 'Western [[Yoga]]' which was designed to facilitate this. The book will begin with a description of a whole cycle of dreams described by an unnamed patient (to protect confidentiality) which will be interpreted in their archetypal and mythological sense by Jung. This is designed to illustrate the existence of Jung's theory of the [[Collective Unconscious]] and the psychological goal or [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Great Work]] of psychic and spiritual integration or wholeness through the individuation process. That affects the mind state.

==Part II. Individual Dream Symbolism in Alchemy==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

Jung sets out his agenda and explains his method. The text that follows will contain several cycles of dreams recounted by a patient to a student of Jung. Each dream will be described and then analysed and interpreted with reference to Alchemical imagery and psychoanalytic theory. Jung is at pains to explain that the patient knew nothing of Jung's interpretations and so was not influenced in any way during the dream process.

Jung details an entire cycle of the patient's dreams, summarising the details of each then interpreting them in terms of their parallels with alchemical imagery to reveal their psychological content.

==Part III. Religious Ideas in Alchemy==

* Chapter 1 - Basic Concepts of Alchemy

* Chapter 3 - The Work
* Chapter 4 - The Prima Materia
* Chapter 5 - The Lapis-Christ Parallel
* Chapter 6 - Alchemical Symbolism in the History of Religion

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not without importance for us to appreciate the high value set upon the mandala, for it accords very well with the paramount significance of individual mandala symbols which are characterized by the same qualities of a ---so to speak---"metaphysical" (fn4 ...the term "metaphysical:I am only using it figuratively, in the psychological sense, to characterize the peculiar statements made by dreams.) nature. Unless everything deceives us, they signify nothing less than a psychic centre of the personality not to be identified with the ego.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotations==

"The real mystery does not behave mysteriously or secretively; it speaks a secret language, it adumbrates itself by a variety of images which all indicate its true nature. I am not speaking of a secret personally guarded by someone, with a content known to its possessor, but of a mystery, a matter or circumstance which is "secret," i.e., known only through vague hints but essentially unknown. The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery - his own psychic background -into what was to be explained: ''Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius!'' This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence." (Part 3, Chapter 2.1)

"I am therefore inclined to assume that the real root of alchemy is to be sought less in philosophical doctrines than in the projections of individual investigators. I mean by this that while working on his chemical experiments the operator had certain psychic experiences which appeared to him as the particular behaviour of the chemical process. Since it was a question of projection, he was naturally unconscious of the fact that the experience had nothing to do with matter itself (that is, with matter as we know it today). He experienced his projection as a property of matter; but what he was in reality experiencing was his own unconscious. In this way he recapitulated the whole history of mankind's knowledge of nature.... Such projections repeat themselves whenever man tries to explore an empty darkness and involuntarily fills it with living form." (Part 3, Chapter 2.1).

"When the alchemist speaks of Mercurius, on the face of it he means quicksilver (mercury), but inwardly he means the world-creating spirit concealed or imprisoned in matter. The dragon is probably the oldest pictoral symbol in alchemy of which we have documentary evidence. It appears as the [[Ouroboros]], the tail-eater, in the Codex Marcianus, which dates from the tenth or eleventh century, together with the legend 'the One, the All'. Time and again the alchemists reiterate that the ''opus'' proceeds from the one and leads back to the one, that it is a sort of circle like a dragon biting its own tail. For this reason the ''opus'' was often called ''circulare'' (circular) or else ''rota'' (the wheel). Mercurius stands at the beginning and end of the work: he is the ''prima materia'', the ''caput corvi'', the ''nigredo''; as dragon he devours himself and as dragon he dies, to rise again in the ''lapis''. He is the play of colours in the ''cauda pavonis'' and the division into the four elements. He is the hermaphrodite that was in the beginning, that splits into the classical brother-sister duality and is reunited in the ''coniunctio'', to appear once again at the end in the radiant form of the ''lumen novum'', the stone. He is metallic yet liquid, matter yet spirit, cold yet fiery, poison and yet healing draught - a symbol uniting all the opposites." (Part 3, Chapter 3.1).

"Now, all these myth-pictures represent a drama of the human psyche on the further side of consciousness, showing ''man as both the one to be redeemed and the redeemer''. The first formulation is Christian, the second alchemical. In the first case man attributes the need of redemption to himself and leaves the work of redemption, the actual ''opus'', to the autonomous divine figure; in the latter case man takes upon himself the duty of carrying out the redeeming ''opus'', and attributes the state of suffering and consequent need of redemption to the ''anima mundi'' imprisoned in matter. In both cases redemption is a ''work''. In Christianity it is the life and death of the God-man which, by a unique sacrifice, bring about the reconciliation of man, who craves redemption and is sunk in materiality, with God. The mystical effect of the God-man's self-sacrifice extends, broadly speaking, to all men, though it is efficacious only for those who submit through faith or are chosen by divine grace; but in the Pauline acceptance it acts as an apocatastasis and extends also to non-human creation in general, which, in its imperfect state, awaits redemption like the merely natural man." (Part 3, Chapter 3.3).

"From this point of view, alchemy seems like a continuation of Christian mysticism carried on in the subterranean darkness of the unconscious.... But this unconscious continuation never reached the surface, where the conscious mind could have dealt with it. All that appeared in consciousness were the symbolic symptoms of the unconscious process. Had the alchemist succeeded in forming any concrete idea of his unconscious contents, he would have been obliged to recognize that he had taken the place of Christ - or, to be more exact, that he, regarded not as ego but as self, had taken over the work of redeeming not man but God. He would then have had to recognize not only himself as the equivalent of Christ, but Christ as a symbol of the self. This tremendous conclusion failed to dawn on the medieval mind." (Part 3, Chapter 5.1).

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''rib fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|break]] in a [[rib]] bone.&lt;ref name=Mos2013&gt;{{cite book|title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary |format= E-Book|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323112587|page=1567|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aW0zkZl0JgQC&amp;pg=PA1567|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013051/https://books.google.ca/books?id=aW0zkZl0JgQC&amp;pg=PA1567|archivedate=2017-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically results in chest pain that is worse with breathing in.&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; [[Bruising]] may occur at the site of the break.&lt;ref name=Ad2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=James G.|title=Emergency Medicine E-Book: Clinical Essentials (Expert Consult – Online)|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1455733946|page=682|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rpoH-KYE93IC&amp;pg=PA682|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013053/https://books.google.ca/books?id=rpoH-KYE93IC&amp;pg=PA682|archivedate=2017-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When several ribs are broken in several places a [[flail chest]] results.&lt;ref name=Wanek04&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wanek |first1=Sandra |last2=Mayberry |first2=John C |title=Blunt thoracic trauma: flail chest, pulmonary contusion, and blast injury |journal=Critical Care Clinics |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=71–81 |year=2004 |pmid=14979330 |doi=10.1016/S0749-0704(03)00098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential complications include a [[pneumothorax]], [[pulmonary contusion]], and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=May2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Rib fractures usually occur from a direct blows to the chest such as during a [[motor vehicle collision]] or from a [[crush injury]].&lt;ref name=May2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; Coughing or [[metastatic cancer]] may also result in a broken rib.&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; The middle ribs are most commonly fractured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = PET-CT: Rare Findings and Diseases|last = Nanni|first = Christina|publisher = Springer|year = 2012|isbn = 978-3-642-24698-2|location = |page = 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; Fractures of the first or second ribs are more likely to be associated with complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy CE|first1=4th|last2=Raja|first2=AS|last3=Baumann|first3=BM|last4=Medak|first4=AJ|last5=Langdorf|first5=MI|last6=Nishijima|first6=DK|last7=Hendey|first7=GW|last8=Mower|first8=WR|last9=Rodriguez|first9=RM|title=Rib Fracture Diagnosis in the Panscan Era.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=27 May 2017|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2017.04.011|pmid=28559032|volume=70|pages=904–909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis can be made based on symptoms and supported by [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=Ad2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
[[Pain control]] is an important part of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=SD|last2=Walters|first2=MR|title=Patients with rib fractures: use of incentive spirometry volumes to guide care.|journal=Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses|date=2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=89–91; quiz 92–03|doi=10.1097/JTN.0b013e31825629ee|pmid=22673074}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the use of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), [[NSAIDs]], or [[opioids]].&lt;ref name=May2015/&gt; A [[nerve block]] may be another option.&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; While fractured ribs have been wrapped, this may increase complications.&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; In those with a flail chest, surgery may improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuurmans|first1=J|last2=Goslings|first2=JC|last3=Schepers|first3=T|title=Operative management versus non-operative management of rib fractures in flail chest injuries: a systematic review.|journal=European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery|date=April 2017|volume=43|issue=2|pages=163–68|doi=10.1007/s00068-016-0721-2|pmid=27572897|pmc=5378742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coughlin|first1=TA|last2=Ng|first2=JW|last3=Rollins|first3=KE|last4=Forward|first4=DP|last5=Ollivere|first5=BJ|title=Management of rib fractures in traumatic flail chest: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.|journal=The Bone &amp; Joint Journal|date=August 2016|volume=98-B|issue=8|pages=1119–25|doi=10.1302/0301-620X.98B8.37282|pmid=27482027}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a common injury following trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senekjian|first1=L|last2=Nirula|first2=R|title=Rib Fracture Fixation: Indications and Outcomes.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=January 2017|volume=33|issue=1|pages=153–65|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2016.08.009|pmid=27894495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
This typically results in chest pain that is worse with breathing in.&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt; [[Bruising]] may occur at the site of the break.&lt;ref name=Ad2012/&gt;

===Complications===
When several ribs are broken in several places a [[flail chest]] results.&lt;ref name=Wanek04/&gt; Potential complications include a [[pneumothorax]], [[pulmonary contusion]], and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=May2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mos2013/&gt;

==Causes==
Rib fractures can occur with or without direct trauma during recreational activity. [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) has also been known to cause thoracic injury, including but not limited to rib and [[Sternal fracture|sternum fractures]]. They can also occur as a consequence of diseases such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis. While for elderly individuals a fall can cause a rib fracture, in adults automobile accidents are a common event for such an injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|825981|Rib Fracture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[File:X-ray of rib fractures and pneumothorax.jpg|thumb|Right sided pneumothorax and rib fractures]]
Signs of a broken rib may includ:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rib-injuries/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title = Broken or bruised ribs|date = 2015|accessdate = 15 August 2015|website = NHS.UK|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150820045022/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rib-injuries/Pages/Introduction.aspx|archivedate = 20 August 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pain on inhalation
* Swelling in chest area
* Bruise in chest area
* Increasing shortness of breath
* Coughing up blood (rib may have damaged lung)

Plain [[X-rays]] often pick up displaced fractures but often miss undisplaced fractures.&lt;ref name=Den2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dennis |first1=BM |last2=Bellister |first2=SA |last3=Guillamondegui |first3=OD |title=Thoracic Trauma. |journal=The Surgical clinics of North America |date=October 2017 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1047–1064 |doi=10.1016/j.suc.2017.06.009 |pmid=28958357}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CT scan]]ning is generally able to pick up both types of fractures.&lt;ref name=Den2017/&gt;

Because children have more flexible chest walls than adults do, their ribs are more likely to bend than to break; therefore the presence of rib fractures in children is evidence of a significant amount of force and may indicate severe [[thorax|thoracic]] injuries such as [[pulmonary contusion]].&lt;ref name=Wanek04/&gt; Rib fractures are also a sign of more serious injury in elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fatality Risk and the Presence of Rib Fractures|journal = Annals of Advances in Automotive Medicine / Annual Scientific Conference|date = 2008-01-01|issn = 1943-2461|pmc = 3256783|pmid = 19026224|pages = 73–84|volume = 52|first = Richard|last = Kent|first2 = William|last2 = Woods|first3 = Ola|last3 = Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no specific treatment for rib fractures, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morice |first1=A H |last2=McGarvey |first2=L |last3=Pavord |first3=I |title=Recommendations for the management of cough in adults |journal=Thorax |volume=61  |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=i1–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16936230 |pmc=2080754 |doi=10.1136/thx.2006.065144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of [[mechanical ventilation|assisted ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brunner &amp; Suddarth's Textbook of Canadian Medical-surgical Nursing|url = https://books.google.com/?id=SB_-CRXvZPYC&amp;pg=PA637&amp;lpg=PA637&amp;dq=flail+chest+sometimes+needs+assisted+ventilation#v=onepage&amp;q=flail%2520chest%2520sometimes%2520needs%2520assisted%2520ventilation&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wil|page = 637|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 9780781799898|language = en|first = Pauline|last = Paul|first2 = Beverly|last2 = Williams|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160629114720/https://books.google.com/books?id=SB_-CRXvZPYC&amp;pg=PA637&amp;lpg=PA637&amp;dq=flail+chest+sometimes+needs+assisted+ventilation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LRmcVdhbz3&amp;sig=KtI8XKo2R3QEdGiRIVK1ElqdaVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBmoVChMI84fwyaqrxwIVStKACh0AKwyV#v=onepage&amp;q=flail%2520chest%2520sometimes%2520needs%2520assisted%2520ventilation&amp;f=false|archivedate = 2016-06-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying [[viscus|viscera]] (e.g., lung [[bruise|contusion]]) or remotely (e.g., cervical spine injury). Spontaneous fractures in athletes generally require a cessation of the cause, e.g., time off rowing, while maintaining cardiovascular fitness.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Nerve blocks===
Nerve blocks that may be used to help with pain related to rib fractures include [[epidural anesthesia]], [[paravertebral block]], and [[serratus anterior plane block]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wardhan |first1=R |title=Assessment and management of rib fracture pain in geriatric population: an ode to old age. |journal=Current Opinion in Anesthesiology |date=October 2013 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=626–31 |doi=10.1097/01.aco.0000432516.93715.a7 |pmid=23995061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Stuart A. |last2=Auyong |first2=David B. |title=Ultrasound Guided Regional Anesthesia |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190630478 |page=PT388 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Rd8oDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT388 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgery===
Treatment options for internal fixation/repair of rib fractures include:
* Judet and/or sanchez plates/struts are a metal plate with strips that bend around the rib and then is further secured with sutures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=D.

* Anterior locking plates are metal plates that have holes for screws throughout the plate. The plate is positioned over the rib and screwed into the bone at the desired position. The plates may be bent to match the contour of the section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Skeletal Trauma: Basic Science, Management, and Reconstruction|url = https://books.google.com/?id=IDXgoS0vLFQC&amp;pg=PA1418&amp;dq=anterior+locking+plate#v=onepage&amp;q=anterior%2520locking%2520plate&amp;f=false|publisher = Elsevier Health Scien|page = 1418|date = 2009-01-01|isbn = 1416022201|language = en|first = Bruce D.|last = Browner|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160508172225/https://books.google.com/books?id=IDXgoS0vLFQC&amp;pg=PA1418&amp;dq=anterior+locking+plate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBmoVChMIzNqshZyrxwIVy9SACh1ozgL0#v=onepage&amp;q=anterior%2520locking%2520plate&amp;f=false|archivedate = 2016-05-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ScienceBlogs''' is an [[invitation-only]] [[blog]] network and [[virtual community]] that operated initially for a little less than twelve years, from 2006 to 2017. It was created by [[Seed (magazine)|Seed Media Group]] to enhance public understanding of [[science]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/channel/about.php |title=About ScienceBlogs |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710164443/http://scienceblogs.com/channel/about.php |archivedate=July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each blog had its own theme, speciality and author(s) and was not subject to editorial control. Authors included active [[scientist]]s working in industry, universities and medical schools as well as college professors, physicians, professional writers, graduate students, and post-docs. On 24 January 2015, 19 of the blogs had seen posting in the past month. 11 of these had been on ScienceBlogs since 2006. ScienceBlogs shut down at the end of October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2017/10/16/aard-is-moving/|title=Aard Is Moving – Aardvarchaeology|website=scienceblogs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2017/10/17/need-advice-from-wordpress-experts/|title=Need advice from WordPress experts|date=2017-10-18|work=Pharyngula|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August of 2018, the webiste’s front page displayed a notice suggesting it was about to become active once again.

== History  ==
ScienceBlogs was launched in January 2006 with 15 blogs on the network. For the launch blogs, Seed invited some of the best-known independent science bloggers and allowed them to blog about whichever subjects they wished.&lt;ref name="OJR"&gt;[http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/060413bryant/ Pass the politics, please: Science blogs peppered with commentary]&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue was generated through advertisements sold to companies who wished to attract "bright, curious consumers who buy products like automobiles, books, cellphones, computers, liquor, music and watches." &lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/business/media/20adco.html?ex=1295413200&amp;en=276970868d8a4d4b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Science Blogs as a Vehicle for Upscale Ads]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the free rein given to bloggers and the incentive to increase traffic, bloggers on the network often discussed hot topics such as [[politics]] and [[religion]] in addition to science. These topics frequently incited heated arguments in the comment threads and bloggers on the network sometimes got into arguments with each other over a series of posts.&lt;ref name="OJR"/&gt;

ScienceBlogs and Seed received some notable awards at the end of their first year of activity, including the 2006 [[UTNE Independent Press Award]] for Best Science/Technology Coverage being granted to Seed, in large part due to the success of ScienceBlogs. Additionally, two blogs on the network received Weblog awards: [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] for Best Science Blog and [[Respectful Insolence (website)|Respectful Insolence]] for Best Medical/Health Issues Blog.

The creators of ScienceBlogs expanded their collection of hosted blogs in three major waves, supplemented by individual additions along the way.  Some of the most trafficked blogs included Pharyngula, Respectful Insolence, Good Math Bad Math, Deltoid, Cognitive Daily, Living the Scientific Life (Scientist, Interrupted) and On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess.

According to [[Technorati]], {{as of |2007|07|07|lc=y}}, ScienceBlogs had an "authority" of 9,581 and its number of inbound links ranks it 37th among blogs worldwide.&lt;ref name="Technorati Ranking"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://technorati.com/search/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scienceblogs.com%2F | title = ScienceBlogs Technorati Ranking | publisher = Technorati, Inc | accessdate = 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008|03|14}}, [[Quantcast]] charts it as having over 1.1 million monthly unique visitors, 65% of whom are from the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Quantcast Ranking"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quantcast.com/scienceblogs.com | title = ScienceBlogs Quantcast Ranking | accessdate = 2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|02}}, ScienceBlogs hosted 75 blogs dedicated to various fields of research. In April 2011, ScienceBlogs was taken over by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]. While Seed would still maintain ownership of the site, National Geographic would acquire editorial control and responsibility for advertising sales on the site.&lt;ref name=cjr-natgeo&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic Taking the Wheel at Scienceblogs.com|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/national_geographic_taking_the.php?page=all|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ScienceBlogs launched a [[German language]] edition of the site, ScienceBlogs.de, in 2008 in partnership with [[Hubert Burda Media]]. As of 7 December 2010, the site hosted 35 blogs.&lt;ref name="ScienceBlogs.de"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; ScienceBlogs Brazil debuted in March 2009 with 23 Portuguese language blogs.

==="PepsiGate"===
In June 2010, ScienceBlogs started a blog which was sponsored by [[PepsiCo]] and was to be written by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jul/20/pepsico-scienceblog-bloggerati | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=PepsiCo and the shame of the bloggerati | first=David | last=Appell | date=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jul/21/pepsi-scienceblogs-bloggers | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=How we tried (not) to silence Pepsi | first=David | last=Dobbs | date=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to backlash by many of the bloggers on ScienceBlogs who considered this to be an unethical mix of advertising and journalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/jul/07/scienceblogs-blogging-pepsi | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=ScienceBlogs, we have a problem | first=Alok | last=Jha | date=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/jul/09/seed-editorial-independence-scienceblogs | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=This isn't the first time Seed has sacrificed editorial independence | first=Gaia | last=Vince | date=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PepsiCo blog was withdrawn from ScienceBlogs. This affair was informally named "PepsiGate". By the middle of July approximately a quarter of the bloggers had left ScienceBlogs.  Subsequently, some bloggers such as PZ Myers of [[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] announced they were going on strike as part of a general feeling that the people running Seed had failed to respond to concerns surrounding the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PZ Myers on July 20, 2010 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/07/pharyngula_on_strike.php |title=Pharyngula on STRIKE – Pharyngula |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2014-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119150158/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/07/pharyngula_on_strike.php |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed Media responded by killing off ''Food Frontiers'', the Pepsico sponsored blog, but that didn't stop the defections. According to PZ Myers, "The ship is sinking". A writer at the ''New York Times Magazine'' reviewed the incident and commented, "ScienceBlogs has become Fox News for the religion-baiting, peak-oil crowd."&lt;ref name="Heffernan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/magazine/01FOB-medium-t.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1280602905-4qXmj56op8jMph4rzxzSAA|title=Unnatural Science|last=Heffernan|first=Virginia|date=July 30, 2010|work=New York Times|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other science blogging networks were launched, including scientopia.org, scienceseeker.org and one hosted by ''[[The Guardian]]''. In early 2015, however, eleven of the network's 2006 founding-generation blogs were still active, including Myers's.

===Demise===
On 14 October 2017, astrophysics blogger Steinn Sigurðsson publicly revealed that ScienceBlogs was due to be shut down,&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2017/10/14/qrt/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Gorski]], author of the "Respectful Insolence" blog under his pseudonym Orac, stated that ScienceBlogs had "barely existed as an entity for a few years".
&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2017/10/17/a-change-is-gonna-come/&lt;/ref&gt; Astrophysics blogger [[Ethan Siegel]] reported on 22 October 2017 that ScienceBlogs had informed bloggers it "no longer had the funds to keep the site operational, and so they would be shutting down".&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/author/esiegel/&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Revival===
In late August of 2018, a note appeared on the home page which said that ScienceBlogs was now part of the Science 2.0 family and that plans were in place to make the site active once again. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ScienceBlogs |url=http://scienceblogs.com |website=ScienceBlogs. |publisher=Science 2.0 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827183728/http://scienceblogs.com |archivedate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociologists for Women in Society''' ('''SWS''') is an international organization of social scientists--students, faculty, practitioners, and researchers--working together to improve the position of women within [[sociology]] and society in general.

== History ==

In 1969, several hundred women gathered at a "counter-convention" at [[Glide Memorial Church]] rather than attend the ASA meetings at the Hilton Hotel. Sharing feelings of insecurity and stories of initially mystifying experiences as graduate students and faculty, and encouraging each other with applause, they came to see that some of the stresses in being sociologists were not idiosyncratic, but part of the experience of being women. Later that year, some 20 founding women met to build an organization and network. Although SWS was created to redress the plight of women sociologists, SWS has become an organization that also focuses on improving the social position of women in society through feminist sociological research and writing.

SWS holds annual meetings and publishes the academic journal ''[[Gender &amp; Society]]''.

'''Soyuz 2''' ({{lang-ru|'''Союз 2'''}}, '''Union 2''') was an uncrewed [[spacecraft]] in the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] family intended to be the target of a docking maneuver by the manned [[Soyuz 3]] spacecraft. It was intended to be the first docking of a manned spacecraft in the Soviet space program. Although the two craft approached closely, the docking did not take place and the first successful Soviet docking of manned spacecraft took place in the joint [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]] mission.

'''Leonhard Euler Telescope''', or the Swiss EULER Telescope, is a national, fully automatic {{convert|1.2|m|ft|adj=on}} [[reflecting telescope]], built and operated by the [[Geneva Observatory]]. It is located at an altitude of {{convert|2375|m|ft|abbr=on}} at [[European Southern Observatory|ESO's]] [[La Silla Observatory]] site in the Chilean [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]] region, about 460 kilometers north of [[Santiago de Chile]]. The telescope, which saw its first light on 12 April 1998, is named after Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Paul Euler]].&lt;ref name="eso-euler"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/swiss/ |title=Swiss 1.2-metre Leonhard Euler Telescope |work=ESO |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="exo-euler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanets.ch/projects/euler/ |title=EULER |work=Exoplanets |publisher=Université de Genève |location=Switzerland |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euler telescope uses the '''CORALIE''' instrument to search for [[exoplanets]]. In addition, the telescope uses the multi-purpose '''EulerCam''' (ecam), a high precision [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] instrument, and a smaller, piggyback mounted telescope, called "Pisco".&lt;ref name="exo-euler" /&gt; Its first discovery was a planet in orbit around [[Gliese 86]], determined to be a [[hot Jupiter]] with an orbital period of only 15.8 earth days and about four times the mass of Jupiter.&lt;ref name="arxiv9910223" /&gt; Since then, many other exoplanets have been discovered or examined in follow-up observations.

Together with the [[Mercator Telescope]], Euler was part of the Southern Sky extrasolar Planet search Programme, which has discovered numerous extrasolar planets.&lt;ref name="coralie" /&gt; It has also been frequently employed for follow-up characterization to determine the mass of exoplanets discovered by the Wide Angle Search for Planets, [[SuperWASP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2010A&amp;A...517L...1Q | title=WASP-8b: a retrograde transiting planet in a multiple system | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=517 | year=2010 |display-authors=4 |author1=Queloz, D. |author2=Anderson, D.

== Instruments ==

The ''CORALIE spectrograph'' is an [[Echelle grating|echelle]] type [[spectrograph]] used for astronomy and was commissioned at the Euler Telescope in April 1998. The instrument performs [[doppler spectroscopy]], that is it measures the [[Doppler effect]] on a star's [[electromagnetic spectrum]] caused by the gravitational tug of an  exoplanet orbiting around it.&lt;ref name="CORALIE-I"&gt;{{cite journal

Mayor, [https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.105-sep01/messenger-no105-1-7.pdf From CORALIE to HARPS],  September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The spectrograph participates in the [http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/planet/coralie.html Southern Sky extrasolar Planet search Programme].

Doppler spectroscopy, also known as "radial velocity" or "wobble" method, is an indirect [[Methods of detecting exoplanets|detection method]] as it only observes the star's spectrum and not the planet itself. It differs from the [[transit method]] used by the space-based [[Kepler mission]] and ground-based SuperWASP and [[Next-Generation Transit Survey]] and can therefore be complementary to their observations. This is because the size of an exoplanet can be estimated using the transit method, while Doppler spectroscopy is used to estimate its mass. By combining the measured size and mass from both methods, it can be determined whether the observed exoplanet is gaseous or rocky.

The  [[ELODIE spectrograph]] was a  device similar to CORALIE&lt;ref&gt;

=== Characteristics ===

The resolution of CORALIE is fixed at R = 50,000 with a 3 pixel sampling. The detector [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] is 2k X 2k with a 15 micrometer pixel size.

=== Discovered exoplanets ===

Five planetary object have been discovered using CORALIE along with several confirmations of discoveries by other programs.

The '''Tehran School of Political Science''' ({{lang-fa|مدرسه علوم سياسی تهران}} ''Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi''), was one of the first modern institutions of higher education in Iran at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==

The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by [[Hassan Pirnia]]. It was run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It later merged with the School of Law (''Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq''), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1933.

==People==
===Political===
Many of the school's faculty and [[alumni]] later became ministers and political figures in Iran. Notable examples are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6626">'''Veneer theory''' is a term coined by Dutch [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]] to label the Hobbesian view of human morality that he criticizes throughout his work. Although he criticizes this view in earlier works, the term in this form is introduced in his 2005 book "Our Inner Ape", denoting a concept that he rejects, namely that human [[morality]] is "a cultural overlay, a thin veneer hiding an otherwise selfish and brutish nature".&lt;ref name="pap"&gt;{{cite book |title= Primates and philosophers: How morality evolved |last=de Waal |first=Frans |authorlink=Frans de Waal |author2=Robert Wright |author3=Christine M. Korsgaard |author4=Philip Kitcher |author5=Peter Singer  |editor1-last=Macedo |editor1-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Ober |editor2-first=Josiah |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-14129-9 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the veneer theory goes back to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and has more recently been advocated by biologists like [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]].

==Proponents of the theory==
As evidenced by de Waals' characterisation of this theory as "Hobbesian", one of the earliest and most influential thinkers criticized by him for having popularized this view is [[Thomas Hobbes]]:

{{Quote
|text=The traditional view is that of a contract among our ancestors, who decided to live together “by covenant only, which is artificial,” as Thomas Hobbes put it.
|author=Frans de Waal |title=Our Inner Ape
}}

A few centuries later, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] developed the idea that moral tendencies are not part of the human nature, and so our ancestors became moral by choice, not by [[evolution]]. Thus it represents a discrepancy in Huxley's Darwinian conviction. Social behavior is explained by this theory as a veneer of morality. This dualistic point of view separates humans from animals by rejecting every connection between human morality and animal social tendencies.
[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], as another advocate of the veneer theory, sees morality as "an accidental capability produced, in its boundless stupidity, by a biological process that is normally opposed to the expression of such a capability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.1988.tb00857.x |last=Williams |first=George C. |authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) |year=1988 |title=Reply to comments on "Huxley's Evolution and Ethics in Sociobiological Perspective." |journal=Zygon |volume=23 |pages=437–438 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] argued that humans no longer have [[instinct]]s because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong ''drives''. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Abraham H. |last=Maslow |title=Motivation and Personality |chapter=Instinct Theory Reexamined |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1954 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins seems to condone the veneer theory when he writes:

{{Quote
|text=we, alone on Earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators
|author=[[Richard Dawkins]] |title=[[The Selfish Gene]]
}}

Some argue that veneer theory presents a [[false dichotomy]]; the adaptations of a cultural overlay of pseudo morals, and de Waal's biologically-based morals might coexist, and are both evolutionarily advantageous. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dreifort|first1=Daniel|title=of dichotomies and morals|url=http://www.dirtyrag.com/articles/dd-veneer-theory.php|website=Dirty Rag|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics of the theory==
De Waal criticizes the veneer theory and sees our morality as a direct outgrowth of the social instincts human beings share with other animals. He argues that the advocates of the veneer theory don't have any indications or empirical evidence which support the theory, and that it is highly unlikely that humans can deny their genes and improve morality merely by choice. As an example he compares Huxley's theory with a school of piranhas deciding to become vegetarian.
De Waal bases his argument against the veneer theory on observations of behavior of humanity's relatives in his long work as primatologist. "Building blocks of morality"&lt;ref name="pap"/&gt; can be already observed in other primates, and by the principle of parsimony, it is quite possible that some sort of morality is evolutionarily ancient and shared with our ancestors. De Waal assumes that the evolutionary origins lie in emotions we share with other animals, ''e.g.'' [[empathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Waal |first=Frans |authorlink=Frans de Waal |year=2008 |title=Putting the Altruism Back into Altruism: The Evolution of Empathy |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |pmid=17550343 |volume=59 |pages=279–300 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093625}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human morality is according to him a product of [[social evolution]], and instead of Huxley's theory, this point of view {{mdash}} a continuity between human morality and animal social tendencies—is unitary and thus more compatible with the [[Neo-Darwinism|evolutionary theory]].
Other critics of the veneer theory are [[Edward Westermarck]] and [[E. O. Wilson]].

Psychologist [[Christopher Ryan]] and psychiatrist Cacilda Jethá also express similar concerns in their book [[Sex at Dawn]], where they criticize what they call the "neo-Hobbesian" narrative of human nature:

{{Quote
|text=Hobbes took the madness of his age, considered it “normal,” and projected it back into prehistoric epochs of which he knew next to nothing. What Hobbes called “human nature” was a projection of seventeenth-century Europe, where life for most was rough, to put it mildly. Though it has persisted for centuries, Hobbes’s dark fantasy of prehistoric human life is as valid as grand conclusions about Siberian wolves based on observations of stray dogs in Tijuana.
|author=[[Christopher Ryan]] |title=[[Sex at Dawn]]
}}

They also cite [[Stephen Jay Gould]] as a critic of this view:

{{Quote
|text=Why should our nastiness be the baggage of an apish past and our kindness uniquely human? Why should we not seek continuity with other animals for our 'noble' traits as well?
|author=[[Stephen Jay Gould]]
}}

'''William Harvey "Bill" Dana''' (November 3, 1930&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 2014) was an American [[aeronautical engineer]], [[U.S. Air Force]] [[aviator|pilot]], [[NASA]] [[test pilot]], and [[astronaut]] in the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]], and [[North American X-15]] programs.

==Early life and education==
Dana was born in [[Pasadena, California]] on November 3, 1930. He received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1952 and served four years as a pilot in the [[United States Air Force]]. He joined NASA on October 1, 1958, after receiving a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] from the [[University of Southern California]].

Dana married to his wife, Judi, in 1962, and they had four children.

==Test pilot and astronaut career==
[[File:X-15 Pilots - GPN-2000-000143.jpg|thumb|left|X-15 pilots (Dana is 1st from right)]]
From 1960 through 1962 he was a pilot astronaut in the U.S. Air Force [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] program. That program was canceled before the vehicle flew, but Dana later tested several other lifting-body space vehicle projects. He made one of the earliest flights in the plywood M2-F1, and flew the HL-10, the M2-F3, and the X-24B. He made the highest-ever flight in a lifting body, to 90,303 feet, in the HL-10. He also made the final powered flight of a lifting body, in the X-24B (1975).

Dana began as an [[engineer]] on the [[North American X-15]] program. He progressed to chase pilot, and finally as project pilot on the hypersonic research aircraft. He flew the rocket-powered vehicle 16 times, reaching a top speed of 3,897&amp;nbsp;mph. His peak altitude of 307,000 feet (nearly 59 miles high) technically qualified him for the [[Astronaut Badge]], although he was not formally recognized as an astronaut until 2005. He was the pilot on the final (199th) flight of the 10-year program.

In the late 1960s and in the 1970s, Dana was a project pilot on the manned [[lifting body]] program, which flew several versions of the wingless vehicles and produced data that helped in development of the [[Space Shuttle]]. He completed  one [[NASA M2-F1]], nine [[Northrop HL-10]], nineteen [[Northrop M2-F3]] and two [[Martin Marietta X-24B]] flights, for a total of 31 [[lifting body]] missions.

===NASA career===
Dana was Chief Engineer at NASA's [[Dryden Flight Research Center]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], from 1993 until 1998, when he retired after almost 40 years of distinguished service to NASA.&lt;ref&gt;Following his retirement, Dana continued to work with NASA as a contractor and a historian. ''Obituary'', [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]], May 12, 2014, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly an aerospace research pilot, Dana flew the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]] variable stability research aircraft and the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|Advanced Fighter Technology Integration/F-16]] aircraft, as well as many others.

Before his assignment as Chief Engineer, he was Assistant Chief of the Flight Operations Division, a position he assumed after serving since 1986 as Chief Pilot. He was also a project pilot on the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD|F-15 HIDEC]] (Highly Integrated Digital Electronic Control) research program, and a co-project pilot on the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F-18 Hornet]] High Angle of Attack research program.

As a research pilot, Dana was involved in some of the most significant aeronautical programs carried out at Dryden. For his service as a flight research pilot, he received [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1997. In 2000 he was awarded the [[Milton Orville Thompson|Milton O. Thompson]] Lifetime Achievement Award by the Dryden Flight Research Center.

==Death==
Dana died in Phoenix, Arizona, on May 6, 2014, following a long struggle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. He was 83 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/aerospace/la-fi-mo-bill-dana-death-20140507-story.html |title=Legendary NASA test pilot Bill Dana dies at 83 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 7, 2014 |first=W.J. |last=Hennigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=43179 |title=Aerospace Pioneer William H.

==Honors==
For his contributions to the lifting body program, Dana received the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]]. In 1976 he received the [[Andrew G. Haley|Haley]] Space Flight Award from the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) for his research work on the M2-F3 lifting body control systems.

A member of the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]], Dana is the author of several technical papers. In 1993, he was inducted into the [[Aerospace Walk of Honor]].

On August 23, 2005, NASA officially conferred on Dana his Astronaut Wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/X-15_wings.html |title=X-15 Pioneers Honored as Astronauts |website=NASA.gov |date=August 23, 2005 |quote=retired NASA pilot Bill Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''XMD''' is a classical [[molecular dynamics]] software designed to
simulate problems related to [[materials science]]. The code was
developed by Jon Rifkin of University of Connecticut and is being
distributed under [[GNU General Public License]].

Source code is available in C and can be compiled using [[POSIX]] thread
functions to take advantage of multi-CPU computers.

== Key features ==
*  Constant temperature simulations using velocity re-scaling algorithm
*  Constant pressure simulations using either Andersen's algorithm or a simple volume "rescaling" algorithm suitable for lattice constant versus temperature calculations
*  Efficient system relaxation (local minima) algorithm
*  Constrain selected atoms to remain fixed in space
*  Constrain selected atoms to remain in a line or plane
*  Apply a unique external force to individual atoms
*  Tether selected atoms to their initial positions with springs of various spring constants
*  Apply velocity damping coefficients to selected atoms
*  Uses pair potential, Embedded Atom Method potentials ([[Embedded atom model|EAM]]), Tersoff's Silicon-Carbide potential or Stillinger-Weber Si potential.
