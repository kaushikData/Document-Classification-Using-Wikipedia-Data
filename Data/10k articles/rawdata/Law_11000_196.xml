The '''1949 World Federalist California Resolution''' was a measure passed by the [[California]] legislature that called on the [[United States Congress]] to amend the [[United States Constitution]] to allow for U.S. participation in a federal [[world government]]. It was introduced at the request of [[United World Federalists]] leaders [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Bob Walker (activist)|Bob Walker]].

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was one of the first countries in the Balkans to adopt the  Freedom of Access to Information Act, at the State level in 2000, and then in 2001 in both of its entities, namely the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]]. However, according to some experts the law requires changes to address a series of shortcomings that have been identified over the years.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Report Network (BIRN) |issue=|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Analitika&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=December 2013 |title=Towards Proactive Transparency in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=http://www.analitika.ba/sites/default/files/publikacije/proaktivna_transparentnost_policy_memo_eng_4juni_web.pdf  |publisher=Analitika. Centre for Social Research |issue= Policy Memo |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Due to the specific circumstances and the way in which it was created, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, annex IV of [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Agreement]] did not pay much attention to the right to information.&lt;ref name=Internews&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mehmed HALILOVIĆ and Amer DŽIHANA |date=2012 |title=Media Law in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=http://www.internews.ba/sites/default/files/attachments/Media%20law%20in%20BiH%20eng.pdf |publisher=Internews in Bosnia and Herzegovina |access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of freedom of information legislation was initiated with a decision of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] in 1999. The Decision asked the State and the Entities to adopt such a legislation. The consultation process for drafting the law involved the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)]]’s legal experts and extensive public discussions with citizens and civil society groups. The Act was adopted by the Bosnia and Herzegovina State Government in October 2000, and the Republika Srpska Government in May 2001.&lt;ref name=OSCE2001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/bih/53670 |title=Freedom of Access to information Law fully adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina  |last= |first= |date=26 June 2001 |website=Osce.org |publisher= Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
The laws establish a general right of the public to access the information held by public authorities/organs “to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest”. Therefore, the laws establish a general obligation of making all relevant information public, except for some cases falling under the exceptions defined by the law.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Access to public information applies to information held by all public organs (legislative, judiciary, executive and administrative) and regardless of their format (written documents, digital data, audio or video records, etc.) as well as to legal persons owner or controlled by public bodies, such as public enterprises, public schools, universities, state agencies, etc. On the contrary, it does not apply to private organisations, private companies and the commercial sector.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The laws entitle every person, regardless of his or her citizenship, nationality, ethnicity, or place of residence, the right to access to public information. Journalists and media outlet do not have more rights compared with other requesters.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The prescribed period of time for obtaining the requested information is 15 days from the submission of the request.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Under the FOI laws, public authorities are both obliged to provide access to documents and records and to publish the most important information without a request ([[proactive disclosure]]). Rules for proactive publication apply to information on institutions’ budget, regular activities and decision-making.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

===Exceptions===
In line with international standards, access to information laws in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska establish that in some cases public information can be withheld on a legal basis. Specifically, three cases of exceptions are foreseen: first, when there is the possibility that disclosing information can cause a significant damage to legitimate functions of the government (national security, defence, monetary policy issues, prevention of crime, etc.); second, the exceptions can be applied to protect commercial interests; and, third, to protect personal interests and privacy of a third party.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; The application of these exceptions is not automatic: in effect, in order to reject the application on the basis of the exceptions established in the law, authorities have to make the [[public interest test]], meaning considering whether and how the disclosure of information is harming other protected interests.The public interest test is inspired by the most advanced international standards on the right of access to public information. Compared with similar laws in the [[Western Balkans]], only the laws of [[Access to public information in Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Access to public information in Croatia|Croatia]] prescribe such a test.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Exceptions are applied only after a case-by-case analysis of every case and specific circumstances related to each request. Labeling a whole category of information as exemption is forbidden.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

In Bosnia and Herzegovina some NGOs contribute to enforce the law on access to public information as well as to monitor its application and collect relevant data through the submission of FOI requests and the start of appeal procedures. This is the case, for instance, of the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), [[Transparency International]] (Bosnia and Herzegovina), or the Sarajevo-based [[Center for Investigative Journalism (CIN)]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Bosnia-Erzegovina/Il-difficile-accesso-alle-informazioni-in-Bosnia-Erzegovina-177818 |title=Il difficile accesso alle informazioni in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last=Mišeljić |first=Ljupko |date=16 February 2017|website=Balcanicaucaso.org|publisher= Media Centar Sarajevo/Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|access-date=16 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report prepared by the [[Association of journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the country’s Press Council, the vast majority of Bosnians (around 93%) believe that there are several limitations to the right of access to public information in practice.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13562/  |title=Media Freedom in Bosnia and Herzegovina |last= |first= |date=2016 |website=Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Programme South East Europe |access-date=27 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same, public opinion in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely not fully aware of their rights with regard to access to public information.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

When it comes to the application of the law, problems range from inconsistent interpretation of the law by different public bodies, unwillingness to apply it, to non-harmonisation of FOI laws with other laws.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;

Specifically, one of the major deficiency of freedom of information laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the weakness of the provisions concerning the appeal procedures in case the request is rejected. The FOI law of the Republika Srpska does not stipulate an appeal procedure at all.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Another problem concerns the lack of compliance with other existing laws that exclude or significantly reduce the right to free access to information in practice both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt; Also, experts have identified among the shortcomings hindering the application of FOI laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina the lack of an effective system for monitoring their application. Only a small number of public bodies comply with the obligation to publish the information on the number of received questions related to freedom of information on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Internews/&gt;

In 2013-16 in order to test the implementation of FOI laws, the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN) submitted a series of requests for accessing documents to different public bodies in the country at all level. Half of BIRN’s requests for information were rejected, while the remaining 50 per cent were only partially granted.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

Also, according to [[Transparency International]] - Bosnia and Herzegovina only 40% of public enterprises in Republika Srpska and 27% in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides the requested information within the timeframe established by the law. In 37% of cases examined by Transparency International the fulfillment of the procedure lasts more than one month, even if the law stipulates that the information requested must be provided in maximum 15 days.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt; is a Professor of Political and Social Theory in the Department of Sociology at [[The New School]], best known for his influential book ''Civil Society and Political Theory'', coauthored with [[Jean L. Cohen]]. He is also known for his work on [[critical theory]], [[constitutions]], and has been from 1994 to 2014 co-editor of the journal ''[[Constellations (journal)|Constellations]]'' with [[Nancy Fraser]].

==Education==
Arato first attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] in [[New York City]], completing his B.A. in history in 1966. Subsequently, Arato moved to [[The University of Chicago]] to complete his M.A. in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1975 with a dissertation entitled 'The Search for the Revolutionary Subject: The Philosophy and Social Theory of the Young Lukács 1910-1923' under the guidance of [[Leonard Krieger]] and [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]]. In preparation for his dissertation, Arato conducted preliminary research at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in the spring of 1970 under the guidance of [[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]] scholars [[Ágnes Heller]], [[György Markus]], and [[Mihály Vajda]].&lt;ref name=AratoCV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fehe.org/uploads/media/AndrewArato_CV.pdf |title=Andrew Arato Curriculum Vitae |format=PDF |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought==
A distinct chronology defines Arato's intellectual biography, which often parallels and was inspired by the evolution in thinking of opposition intellectuals in the former communist countries of Eastern Europe&lt;ref&gt;See the evolution Hungarian thinking detailed in Arato, “Marxism in Eastern Europe” in ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', edited by Tom Bottomore (Blackwell, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and, most especially, in Hungary, the country of Arato's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Arato’s close association with the Budapest School is recognized by [[Ágnes Heller]] and [[Ferenc Fehér]] in their 1987 book ''Eastern Left, Western Left''. Arato was involved in the evolution of thinking of Budapest intellectual circles “by virtue of his close contacts and active participation.” p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, much of his work was hammered out in conjunction with his longtime intellectual partner [[Jean L. Cohen]],&lt;ref&gt;Arato, ''From Neo-Marxism to Democratic Theory: Essays on the Critical Theory of Soviet-Type Societies'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1993). p. XIII&lt;/ref&gt;  and strongly influenced by the philosophical and sociological work of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;Arato, ''From Neo-Marxism to Democratic Theory: Essays on the Critical Theory of Soviet-Type Societies'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1993). p. X&lt;/ref&gt;

Arato's intellectual itinerary can be simplified into four stages: It begins with efforts to revitalize Marxism by drawing on a Hegelian Marxist philosophy of “[[Praxis (process)|praxis]].” In a second phase, Arato worked through the corpus of Western Marxian thinkers to construct a critical theory of state socialist societies. Phase three was marked by a turn to a [[post-Marxist]] emphasis on [[civil society]] as a moral and analytical category meant to further the project of democratization in both the East and West. Finally, in his latest work, Arato engages in comparative studies of recent constitution making and has developed a theory of “post-sovereign” constitution making.

===Praxis theory===
The first phase of Arato's academic work emphasized the recovery of an early humanistic Marxism. Such Hegelian Marxism highlighted the active constitution of the social order through “praxis,” that is, the collective action of interacting groups. Arato's philosophical investigations here paralleled the thought of critical intellectuals in the East and especially the “[[Budapest School (Lukács)|Budapest School]]” in a “renaissance of Marxism” during the 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See Arato, "Marxism," in ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', edited by John Eatwell, Murray Milgate and Peter Newman (London 1987) 389; and Marc Rakovsky, ''Towards An Eastern European Marxism'' (London: Alison and Busby, 1978) 130.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective was also manifested in the philosophical outlook of the American journal of radical theory ''Telos''. Arato served on ''Telos’s'' editorial board from 1971 to 1984.&lt;ref name="AratoCV" /&gt;

Arato's emphasis on social praxis and the concomitant categories of subjectivity, culture and alienation was displayed in his dissertation on the early 20th-century Marxian philosophy of [[György Lukács]].&lt;ref&gt;Also see his introduction to a special issue of ''International Journal of Sociology'' on the Marxian Theory of History (Spring, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; As Arato notes in his 1979 book, ''The Young Lukacs and the Origins of Western Marxism'', the elaboration of a critical [[Western Marxism]] with its emphasis on intentional collective action or praxis was also intended as a critique of the authoritarian communist governments in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Arato and Paul Breines, ''The Young Lukacs and the Origins of Western Marxism'' (Seabury Press, 1979). ix-xii. For an articulate survey of this Western Marxist perspective, see Richard Gombin, ''The Origins of Modern Leftism'' (Penguin, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Arato's praxis theory and Western Marxism in general privileged the active, democratic participation of groups and individuals in their supposedly collective self-determination, and they criticized orthodox communist parties with their claims to know the true interests of the working class and to be able to make the proper decisions for them in a form of “substitutionalism.” In contrast to the control of the communist state with its enforced passivity of working classes, “true socialism,” said Western Marxists, should be democracy – democracy extended from the political sphere to the economy and indeed to all social institutions. This implicit critique of state socialist societies, however, largely operated at the level of abstract social philosophy. As Hungarian critics Gyorgy Bence and Janos Kis noted, this rebirth of Marxian philosophy in the East “sidestepped the problem of basic class antagonism” intrinsic to the socialist dictatorships of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, ''Towards An Eastern European Marxism'', 132. Rakovsky is a pseudonym for Bence and Kis.

Mihály Vajda writes that this renaissance of Marxism in the East “cherished hopes” for reform of the socialist systems and hoped to find like-minded reformers in the ruling party. In the 1970s, critical intellectuals lost such hopes and distanced themselves from Marxism as a tool of critical analysis of socialist systems and as a political program. See Vajda, ''The State and Socialism'' (Allison &amp; Busby, 1981) 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding authoritarian state socialism===
In the second stage of his intellectual itinerary, Arato made this exact turn from social philosophy to the critical analysis of East European social formations during the late 1970s–1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Arato identifies a similar turn among Hungarian critical intellectuals toward analysis of social structure and dynamic after 1968. See his “Marxism in Eastern Europe”, 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

His operating procedure was somewhat scholastic. One after another, Arato examined the best of neo-Marxist analyses of state socialism written by such authors as [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Rudolf Bahro]], Habermas, and [[Iván Szelényi]]. He critically assessed the adequacy of their efforts to analyze the social dynamics, stratification, crisis potentiality and legitimating ideology of state socialist societies. In all this, Arato sought to model himself on Marx by analyzing and criticizing the exploitative, hierarchical dimensions of the social formation. He recognized, however, that the theoretical tools offered by Marx himself – that is, [[historical materialism]] – were often used by state socialist societies to veil their politically based class inequalities, not expose them.&lt;ref&gt;Arato, ''From Neo-Marxism to Democratic Theory: Essays on the Critical Theory of Soviet-Type Societies'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1993). Intro.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Arato argued that Marxian writers were typically trapped by the problematic of Marx's philosophy of history, which could only conceive of two possible modern industrialized social formations – either capitalism or a progressive socialist society. Instead, Arato, along with a number of East European theorists, sought to analyze state socialist societies as a new, hierarchical, exploitative social formation “sui generis”; he understood the communist societies as a unique social formation with its own particular mechanisms of control, exploitation and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;See Arato, “Understanding Bureaucratic Centralism,” ''Telos'' 35 (Spring 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Arato argued that this type of society could not be understood by focusing on market or economic relations, instead it rested on a type of prerogative political control operating through the bureaucratic state.

Arato's essays were collected in the 1993 volume ''From Neo-Marxism to Democratic Theory: Essays on the Critical Theory of Soviet-Type Societies''. Despite the richness of his efforts, Arato saw little connection between his exercises in social system analysis and active social movements aiming to transform state socialism. Indeed, he noted that his type of structural analysis blocked perception of what was new about the rising social movements in Eastern Europe and most especially Poland's [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarność]], which emerged in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Arato, “Marxism in Eastern Europe,” 357&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, Arato “disengaged” with his project of developing a critical theory of authoritarian socialism for a theory that seemed to better capture what was new and essential about the rising social movements and oppositions in Eastern Europe, while also offering a powerful tool to criticize the inadequacies of Western capitalist democracies, that is, the theory of civil society.

This transition, where Arato left his work to the gnawing criticism of mice (to repeat Marx's quip), paralleled similar shifts among East European critical intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Arato, “Marxism in Eastern Europe”&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time, this turn could be said to reflect intrinsic limits to his original project. Arato noted that abstract (ideal typical) models of social system dynamics often failed to incorporate considerations of national histories and cultural traditions, along with inherited social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Arato, “Understanding Bureaucratic Centralism,” 76–77.  And see Vajda, ''State and Socialism'', 6. 113–17.&lt;/ref&gt; And, it is precisely those contested national cultural traditions that form the symbolic resources for movements opposing the authoritarian socialist state (and also, in contrast, legitimating the rule of the communist state).&lt;ref&gt;Arato of course, recognized this and engaged in extensive analyses of specific national cultural traditions. See, for example, his “The Budapest School and Actually Existing Socialism,” ''Theory and Society'' V.16 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, such analyses of systems reproduction (dissecting the dynamics and instrumental logics of state and markets) typically ignores the normative and institutionalized categories of the lifeworld and civil society that might support an autonomous social domain of solidarity and open public communication, which is also the terrain of social movements.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Cohen, ''Class and Civil Society: The Limits of Marxian Critical Theory'' (University of Massachusetts Press: 1982) 201–03, 209-, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil society===
It is precisely to these ideal categories of social autonomy, or civil society, that Arato shifted in his third stage. Such a change in intellectual direction was clearly sparked by rising opposition movement of Solidarność in the exciting developments in Poland in 1980–81, resulting in Arato's early articulation of the category of civil society in his oft-cited 1981 essay “Civil Society vs. the State: Poland 1980-1981.”&lt;ref&gt;''Telos'' 47 (Spring 1981). At this time, Jean Cohen was defending an ideal of civil society in her dissertation, published in 1982 as ''Class and Civil Society'', 25–36 and see her “Why More Political Theory” in ''Telos'' 40 (Summer 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

By civil society, Arato (and writers in Poland, Hungary, but also France and South America&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barros "The Left and Democracy: Recent Debates in Latin America," ''Telos'' 68 (Summer 1986); Philippe Schmitter and Guillermo O’Donnell ''Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Tentative Conclusions'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;) meant a social space outside state or corporate control where groups and individuals could engage in something approximating free association and communication among equals. This social space ideally entailed whole sets of laws, rights, and institutions to help secure individual autonomy and public freedom.

In civil society's fully developed modern form, Arato wrote, such a realm is protected by legal rights, possesses channels to influence the separate institutions of economy and state, and has a developed organizational life and media organizations to enhance social communication and strengthen social relations.  Nowhere were all these requirements fully met and the ideal of civil society thus offered a basis for social movements seeking to enrich and extend its ideals everywhere.

For Arato, this new focus on civil society constituted, in part, a rejection of the traditional Marxian problematic for a post-Marxist one. He and intellectuals in Eastern Europe criticized Marx's advocacy of a radical democratic reunification of state and society in a supposedly collective free social order. They rejected Marx's idea of ending of the distinction of state and society (or state and market), along with his conception of an unalienated collective subject, totally undivided and in control of itself.  The experience of Eastern Europe and Russia suggested this utopian merging of government and society inevitably resulted in authoritarian forms of rule. It resulted either in the loss of independent freedom of civil society under the embracing control of the party-state or else it saw regression in economic rationality as the community or state subjected the economy to their traditional norms and political calculations.

Instead, partly for normative reasons and partly for strategic reasons (to prevent repression from the state or USSR invasion), opposition movements in Eastern Europe (and throughout the world) sought not to take over the government but only to strengthen the forms of freedom in a modern civil society, that is, forms of solidarity, free communicative interaction, and active democratic participation in autonomous publics and a plurality of associations. The goal—Arato argued for Eastern Europe, but soon extended this model to the West—should be the protection and indeed the strengthening of civil society and its democratization and institution building separate from the strategic instrumental logics and power hierarchies of the state and capitalist economy. In collaboration with Jean Cohen, Arato concluded that “the idea of the reconstruction and democratization of civil society could become the foundation of a critical theory of all modern societies, including the West.”&lt;ref&gt;Arato, ''From Neo-Marxism to Democratic Theory'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s into the 1980s and beyond, the problematic of civil society spread across Europe, Latin American and Asia as a powerful theory and ideal that could  guide social movements in obtainable advances in freedom. “For better or worse,” Arato noted, “Jean Cohen and myself led the discussion [of civil society] in the United States.”

Here too Arato drew heavily on the work of Habermas, especially Habermas's book on the rise and decline of the [[public sphere]]. Arato noted that Habermas's writings had a “uniquely important role in the rediscovery, critique and reconstruction of the early modern concept of civil society.”&lt;ref&gt;"Politics and the Reconstruction of Civil Society" in ''Zwischenbetrachtungen im Prozess der Aufklärung'' (Cambridge, 1989) 491.&lt;/ref&gt; But in addition, Habermas's later social theory articulated an ideal model of modern society's “differentiated” structure and the need to defend the separate institutions of communicative social interaction and the cultural traditions proper to the lifeworld.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas, ''Theory of Communicative Action'', Vol. 2 (Beacon Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Habermas's theory suggested to a tripartite model of society, where civil society was the institutional structure of society's cultural lifeworld and was opposed to the strategic and instrumental rationality embodied in the economy and state. With this three-part model of ideal social organization — state, economy and civil society — Arato could make the idea of civil society and its strengthening a critical tool in Western capitalist societies.

Between his initial 1981 and 1982 articles on Poland and civil society, a full decade passed before he and Jean Cohen issued their magnum opus: ''Civil Society and Political Theory''. Despite its late publication and its intimidating size at 794 pages, the volume quickly became a much-cited classic. In October 2010, Google Scholar listed over 2,600 publications citing the book.
During this time, Arato remained associated with the radical journal ''Telos''. However, the relevance and vitality of the category of civil society for the West became an object for vigorous dispute at ''Telos'', most especially by [[Paul Piccone]], the journal's pugnacious editor. Piccone elaborated his own perspective under the rubric of “artificial negativity,” a theory that failed to see any autonomous cultural dynamics in the current U.S. civil society outside of the state's manipulation and control of a supposedly atomized, narcissistic population of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Paul Piccone. "On Social Movements, Non-Liberals and Castoriadis," ''Telos'' 53 (Fall 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing debates, Arato and Cohen ended their long association with the journal in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Andrew Arato, Jean Cohen, Joel Whitebook and Jose Casanova, dated June 1, 1987 and published in ''Telos Newsletter'', Oct. 19, 1987. Cited in Patricia Nickel (ed.), ''North American Critical Theory after Postmodernism'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-sovereign constitution making===
1989 was an epochal year in world history, with the liberation of East European countries from Soviet dominance, the transformation of the USSR, and negotiated transformations of the governments and constitutions of Eastern Europe in 1989–90.

The unique nature of the transitions and the powerful intellectual and political issues of writing a new constitution soon became Arato's prime target of intellectual investigation. He closely followed the political debate surrounding the drafting of constitutions in Hungary, where he maintained continued with such critical intellectuals as Janos Kis, co-founder and first chair of the Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungary's liberal party until 1991. In 1996–97, Arato served as a consultant for the Hungarian Parliament on constitutional issues. In the ensuing years, he published commentary and analysis of constitutional issues in Nepal, Turkey, South Africa and Iraq after the U.S. invasion of that nation in 2003. His analysis of the creation of a new constitution in Iraq resulted in his 2009 book: ''Constitution Making under Occupation: The Politics of Imposed Revolution in Iraq.

Arato elaborated a theory of “post-sovereign” constitution making, which he considered a key political innovation occasioned by the construction of [[negotiated transition]]s from dictatorship to new democratic constitutions in Eastern Europe, but also in South Africa, Spain and other countries. He believed that this particular form of constitution making had pronounced advantages politically and normatively over the traditional model. He declared, “1989 did produce something dramatically new: a political paradigm of radical transformation ..., yielding a historically new, superior model of constitutional creation beyond the revolutionary democratic European models.”&lt;ref&gt;Arato, “From Revolutionaries to External Vanguards,” (2009) posted at http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/arato-from-revolutionaries-to-external-vanguards/.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arato, the post-sovereign model typically entailed a two-stage process of transition from [[dictatorship]] to [[constitutional democracy]]. First were initial roundtable negotiations with the power holders and all significant social voices. This negotiation established the ground rules for the subsequent stage, where an elected assembly wrote the new constitution. A [[constitutional court]] gave significant overview to the process ensuring that the [[constitutional assembly]] abided by the ground rules of the roundtable. Ideally, Arato argued, the process should be characterized by broad [[social inclusion]], equality, transparency and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Arato, “Redeeming the Still Redeemable: Post Sovereign Constitution Making,” ''International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society'' 22:4 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

By "post sovereignty," Arato meant that the creation of the constitution abandoned the mythology that it was being issued by the people themselves as ultimate sovereign authority, speaking directly in an unmediated form. Such a mythology, Arato said, often had authoritarian consequences, resulting in a leader or party claiming to represent the people without needing any special limits or rights to ensure that the populace could actually have a voice in political decision making. Such a process, besides remedying past deficiencies, would also address the conundrum of political legitimacy outlined by thinkers such as [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Giorgio Agamben]], who noted that democracies always contained an undemocratic, illegitimate, arbitrary, even violent moment in their founding.

{{for|the concept in trademark law|trademark distinctiveness}}
'''Arbitrariness''' is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arbitrariness|title=arbitrariness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as [[random]] decisions.  For example, during the [[1973 oil crisis]], Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even.  The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people.  Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their [[surname]] in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.

==Law== 
''Arbitrary'' comes from the Latin ''arbitrarius'', the source of ''arbiter''; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arbitrary Online Etymology Dictionary]: "'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‘capricious’ (1646) and ‘despotic’ (1642).”&lt;/ref&gt;  An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by  law.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Thomas.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p31MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=%22discretion+of+the+judge%22+and+arbitrary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tl9MMK-av4&amp;sig=Zd8y_5GB9g8c-GX0qg87BHllhqo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShbJSZylDcrJtgeM-IyUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA565,M1 The London Encyclopaedia]'', page 565 (1829): “Arbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the [[constitution]].  Article 9 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation]. The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has overturned laws for having "[[Rational basis review|no rational basis]]."  A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as [[refugee roulette]].

Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines 'Arbitrariness' as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any 'actions contrary to the order presented by a law'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |work=The Criminal Code Of The Russian Federation
  |title=Article 330. Arbitrariness
  |url=http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter32.html
  |quote=Arbitrariness, that is the unauthorized commission of actions contrary to the order presented by a law or any other normative legal act, 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Arbitrary actions are closely related to [[teleology]], the study of purpose.  Actions lacking a ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', a goal, are necessarily arbitrary.  With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike.  Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of ''arbitrary'' may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose; in the examples above, discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations.

[[Nihilism]] is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that ''every'' choice is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Bernd (1971). "Nihilism, Reason, and "The Good"." ''The Review of Metaphysics.'' '''25''' (2):292&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt; According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made.

Many brands of [[theism]], the belief in a [[deity]] or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that ''nothing'' is arbitrary.  In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that.  Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose.  This is somewhat related to the [[argument from design]], the argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe.

Arbitrariness is also related to [[ethics]], the philosophy of decision-making.  Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary.  [[Rationalism]] holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well.  All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one "feels" what is right.  Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general.

In [[semiotics]], the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the notion of [[Course in General Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness]] according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or ''signifier'') and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or ''signified'') as a mental concept or real object. 

Spontaneous arbitration...

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, arbitrary normally means "any;" for instance, an arbitrary division of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or an arbitrary [[permutation]] of a sequence.  Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases &amp;ndash; "you may select any choice possible, and this statement will still hold."  A simple example would be "Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an [[Even and odd numbers|even number]]."

Even further, the implication is that generality will hold even if you have an opponent choose the item in question.  In some ways ''arbitrary'' is here synonymous with ''worst-case''.&lt;ref&gt;Tel, Gérard (2000). ''Introduction to distributed algorithms.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P1300182 Paris V place Contrescarpe rwk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Place de la Contrescarpe]] in Paris, where the assault took place]]
The '''Benalla affair''' ({{lang-fr|affaire Benalla}}) is a political and judicial case involving Alexandre Benalla, who served as a security officer and deputy chief of staff to [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]]. On 18 July 2018, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' identified him in footage as the person who beat up a young protester during the 2018 [[May Day]] demonstrations in Paris while impersonating a police officer.

Following the publication of the report, the Paris public prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation on 19 July concerning "violence, usurpation of the functions of a police officer and using signs reserved for public authorities". On 20 July, the Élysée announced that Benalla would be dismissed. On 22 July, Benalla was placed under formal investigation additionally for "concealment of a violation of professional secrecy" and "concealment of the misuse of images from a video surveillance system". An accomplice, Vincent Crase, was also placed under formal investigation, as well as three police officers for illegally transmitting video surveillance to Benalla. Parts of the French political class media questioned the Élysée's responsibility in the case for its apparent concealment of the case from the public prosecutor.

Both the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] and [[Senate (France)|Senate]] launched parliamentary inquiries into the affair, with [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Gérard Collomb]], Paris police chief [[Michel Delpuech]], Department of Public Order and Traffic (DOPC) director [[Alain Gibelin]], [[Prime Minister (France)|Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Philippe]], and Élysée chief of staff [[Patrick Strzoda]] among those called to testify. Opposition lawmakers in the National Assembly also announced their intention to submit a [[motion of no confidence]] against the government.

== Background ==
[[File:Alexandre Benalla.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Alexandre Benalla in 2013]]
On 1 May 2018, violence during May Day demonstrations led to significant damage and the arrests of 283 people with 109 taken into custody in Paris, in addition to several injuries. The violence resulted in part from the interruption of the demonstrations by 1,200 "black bloc" protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Julia Pascual|author2=Cécile Bouanchaud|author3=Pierre Bouvier|title=1er Mai : 109 personnes en garde à vue après les violences en marge du cortège parisien|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2018/05/01/1er-mai-le-defile-parisien-perturbe-par-une-serie-de-violences-200-black-blocs-interpelles_5293042_3224.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=1 May 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandre Benalla (born 8 September 1991 in [[Évreux]]) was reportedly a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) activist in [[Eure]], his home department, before offering his services as a bodyguard with the PS, which assigned him to the entourage of [[Martine Aubry]] from 2008 to 2012.

From 2010 to 2013, Benalla began his career as a reservist gendarme in Eure under then-platoon commander [[Sébastien Lecornu]], who at the time was a member of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) and member of the cabinet of then-agriculture minister [[Bruno Le Maire]]. Both Lecornu and Le Maire were appointed as ministers in [[Second Philippe government|the government]] assembled after the election of Macron, with Lecornu serving as [[Secretary of State (France)|Secretary of State]] to the [[Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy|Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition]] and Le Maire becoming [[French Ministry for the Economy and Finance|Minister of Economy and Finance]].

His name appeared numerous times in the [[2017 Macron e-mail leaks]], dubbed "MacronLeaks", having procured several non-lethal weapons and riot shields.

Benalla seemed to maintain a close relationship with Macron as he was the only member of his cabinet to join a skiing trip at the end of 2017, the only other invitees being his security detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laurent Léger|title=Quand Benalla skiait avec Macron|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/fait-divers/quand-benalla-skiait-avec-macron_2026561.html|newspaper=L'Express|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case ==
On 18 July 2018, ''Le Monde'' revealed in an article that 26-year-old Alexandre Benalla, who served as a security officer to [[President of France]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] during the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential campaign]] and was later hired as deputy chief of staff to the president under François-Xavier Lauch, was the person who grabbed a young man by the neck during the May Day demonstrations before hitting him several times in a video taken at the [[Place de la Contrescarpe]] published on Facebook by a [[La France Insoumise]] activist. In the video, Benalla wore a police helmet despite not being a police officer. According to [[Patrick Strzoda]], Benalla asked him for permission to join the police during May Day to observe how a large demonstration was managed. After Strzoda was informed that Benalla had been seen in the videos, Benalla said that he was the individual shown in the videos and Strzoda informed Macron, then in Australia, of the situation. As a result, Benalla was temporarily suspended from 4 to 19 May before being reassigned to the security of events at the [[Élysée Palace]], including the celebration of the victory of the [[France national football team|national football team]] after winning the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] just days before the publication of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ariane Chemin|title=" Le Monde " identifie, sur une vidéo, un collaborateur de Macron frappant un manifestant, le 1er mai, à Paris|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2018/07/18/le-monde-identifie-sur-une-video-un-collaborateur-de-m-macron-frappant-un-manifestant-le-1er-mai-a-paris_5333330_823448.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these claims were questioned by journalists who uncovered photos after the supposed reassignment as part of Macron's entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Emmanuel Fansten|author2=Ismaël Halissat|title=Affaire Benalla : ces photos qui contredisent l'Elysée|url=http://www.liberation.fr/france/2018/07/20/affaire-benalla-ces-photos-qui-contredisent-l-elysee_1667906|newspaper=Libération|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second video, showing a different angle of the incident, was posted to Twitter on 19 July, showing Benalla grabbing a woman by the neck and dragging her away before leaving towards the other protester.&lt;ref name="Monde20180719"/&gt;

Benalla was accompanied by Vincent Crase, a reservist gendarme hired by [[La République En Marche!]], who likewise served as a security officer for Macron during the 2017 presidential campaign. Crase, like Benalla, received a 15-day suspension for his involvement in the May Day demonstrations, and remained employed by the party,&lt;ref name="Monde20180719"/&gt; but unlike Benalla had ended "any collaboration" with the office of the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marie-Alix Dagry|title=Affaire Benalla : Vincent Crase à son tour placé en garde à vue|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2018/07/19/01016-20180719ARTFIG00184-affaire-benalla-vincent-crase-le-deuxieme-collaborateur-de-macron-mis-en-cause.php|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third individual, Philippe Mizerski, was identified; Mizerski, a member of the Department of Public Order and Traffic (DOPC) in Paris was responsible for supervising Benalla's role as an "observer" but did not attempt to stop Benalla from assaulting the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garde à vue, procédure de licenciement, commission d'enquête : retrouvez le suivi de l'affaire Benalla|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/live/2018/07/20/en-direct-alexandre-benalla-a-ete-place-en-garde-a-vue-et-va-etre-licencie-par-l-elysee_5334037_3224.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior ministry, however, said that no immediate action had been taken against either of the two on 1 May despite having been aware of the incident,&lt;ref name="Monde20180719"/&gt; and [[France Inter]] revealed that Collomb himself was informed about the incident on 2 May before the Élysée took action to suspend Benalla on 3 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Cyril Graziani|author2=Yaël Goosz|title=INFO FRANCE INTER.

On 20 July, the Élysée announced that it had initiated a dismissal procedure against Benalla following the discovery of "new facts" of the case related to the suspension of three police officers – Laurent Simonin, Maxence Creusat, and Jean-Yves Hunault – for apparently passing on surveillance footage to Benella, presumably to help him prepare his defense in what Collomb described as a potentially "serious breach of ethics".&lt;ref name="licenciement"&gt;{{cite news|title=L'Élysée engage la procédure de licenciement d'Alexandre Benalla|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2018/07/20/01002-20180720ARTFIG00079-l-elysee-engage-la-procedure-de-licenciement-d-alexandre-benalla.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The footage, which was copied by the officers and sent to Benalla the evening the article in ''Le Monde'' was published, depicts another angle not shown by the other videos and should theoretically not have existed given that video footage older than a month was supposed to be automatically erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Salomé Legrand|author2=Noémi Marois|title=INFORMATION EUROPE 1 - Affaire Benalla : trois policiers suspendus pour avoir transmis les images de vidéosurveillance à Alexandre Benalla|url=http://www.europe1.fr/faits-divers/information-europe-1-affaire-benalla-trois-policiers-dont-deux-commissaires-suspendus-pour-avoir-duplique-une-video-interne-3715196|publisher=Europe 1|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining the footage, Benalla reportedly shared it with [[Ismaël Emelien]], a political advisor close to Macron, and other Élysée viewed this footage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla: le conseiller Ismaël Emelien a visionné les vidéos obtenues illégalement|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/affaire-benalla-l-elysee-a-eu-en-sa-possession-les-videos-obtenues-illegalement-1495324.html|publisher=BFM TV|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris prosecutor office took both Benella and Crase into custody in the morning.&lt;ref name="licenciement"/&gt; A photo obtained of Benalla's official car in a parking lot before it was removed on 19 July showed the vehicle equipped with police devices despite not belonging to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dominique Rizet|title=La voiture de fonction d'Alexandre Benalla était équipée d'accessoires policiers|url=https://www.bfmtv.com/police-justice/la-voiture-de-fonction-d-alexandre-benalla-etait-equipee-d-accessoires-policiers-1492363.html|publisher=BFM TV|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'' reported on 20 July that Benalla declared his official residence from 9 July as the [[Palais de l'Alma]] at 11 quai Branly, a dependency of the Élysée,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=François Krug|author2=Ariane Chemin|title=Alexandre Benalla est logé quai Branly, dans une dépendance de l'Elysée|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2018/07/20/alexandre-benalla-est-loge-quai-branly-dans-une-dependance-de-l-elysee_5334081_3224.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 180,000 euros earmarked to house Benalla, according to a report in ''[[L'Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Laurent Léger|author2=Benoist Fechner|title=Benalla, du pouvoir et des privilèges|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/alexandre-benalla-les-secrets-du-m-securite-du-president_2027183.html|newspaper=L'Express|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, Benalla was placed under formal investigation additionally for "concealment of a violation of professional secrecy" and "concealment of the misuse of images from a video surveillance system", in addition to Crase and the three suspended police officers.

Members of the majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] were reportedly "stunned" by the revelations.

In his first public interview since the story broke, Benalla said that he made a "mistake", that he was qualified to carry a weapon as a reservist gendarme, acknowledged tensions with the [[Groupe de sécurité de la présidence de la République|Security Group for the Presidency of the Republic]] (GSPR), that he requested housing of only 80 square meters as opposed the 300 reported by ''L'Express'', that he was invited by Simonin to observe the May Day protests, and that he did not request the video surveillance footage of the incident procured by three police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aurore Coulaud|title=Interview d'Alexandre Benalla au "Monde" : sa version et ses incohérences|url=http://www.liberation.fr/france/2018/07/26/interview-d-alexandre-benalla-au-monde-sa-version-et-ses-incoherences_1668949|newspaper=Libération|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMS messages obtained by ''Le Monde'' published on 26 July appeared to indicate that Simonin invited Benalla to the May Day protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Un échange de SMS montre comment M.

=== Parliamentary inquiries ===
On the evening of 19 July, the Law Committee of the National Assembly headed by [[Yaël Braun-Pivet]] voted to open a parliamentary inquiry into the case lasting one month with the agreement of all group presidents in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : l'Assemblée met en place une commission d'enquête|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2018/07/19/affaire-benalla-l-assemblee-met-en-place-une-commission-d-enquete_5333783_3224.html|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Monde|date=19 July 2018|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Gérard Collomb]] was to be called to testify before the National Assembly for its inquiry;&lt;ref name="licenciement"/&gt; however, the majority and opposition on 20 July failed to agree on a timetable, with the prior proposing 21 July and the latter 23 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benalla: la commission d'enquête échoue à se mettre d'accord sur un calendrier d'auditions|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2018/07/20/97001-20180720FILWWW00348-benalla-la-commission-d-enquete-a-l-assemblee-echoue-a-se-mettre-d-accord-sur-un-calendrier-d-auditions.php|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the committee agreed to hear Collomb on 23 July, followed by Paris police chief [[Michel Delpuech]] several hours later, though co-rapporteur [[Guillaume Larrivé]] of [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (LR) wished to also interview both Benalla and Crase as well as [[Christophe Castaner]], [[Alexis Kohler]], and Bruno Roger-Petit.&lt;ref name="JDD20180721"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anne-Charlotte Dusseaulx|title=Alexandre Benalla : le ministre Gérard Collomb sera auditionné lundi à l'Assemblée, mardi au Sénat|url=https://www.lejdd.fr/politique/alexandre-benalla-le-ministre-gerard-collomb-auditionne-lundi-a-lassemblee-mardi-au-senat-3715949|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Journal du Dimanche|date=21 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups disagreed on the publicity of the hearings, with the opposition calling for open hearings.&lt;ref name="Monde20180721"&gt;{{cite news|author=Manon Rescan|title=La mise sur pied de la commission d'enquête Benalla à l'Assemblée tourne au fiasco|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2018/07/21/la-mise-sur-pied-de-la-commission-d-enquete-benalla-a-l-assemblee-tourne-au-fiasco_5334302_3224.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=21 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the opposition also called for [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Philippe]] to speak before the National Assembly, he demurred, justifying his absence by citing his scheduled travel to watch the [[2018 Tour de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : réclamé à l'Assemblée, Philippe "continue son agenda" sur le Tour de France|url=http://www.europe1.fr/politique/affaire-benalla-reclame-a-lassemblee-philippe-continue-son-agenda-sur-le-tour-de-france-3715487|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Europe 1|date=20 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though numerous opposition politicians also called for Macron himself to testify, legal experts disagreed on whether such an intervention was permitted under the [[Constitution of France|constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : Emmanuel Macron peut-il être auditionné par l'Assemblée ?|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2018/07/23/25001-20180723ARTFIG00269-affaire-benalla-emmanuel-macron-peut-il-etre-auditionne-par-l-assemblee.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his testimony on 23 July, Collomb blamed the Paris police, saying that he was aware of Benalla's actions but did not alert the judiciary because it was not within his responsibility to do so. He said that he believed that appropriate action (i.e., the two-week suspension of Benalla) had been taken by the Élysée, and also said that he had never discussed the affair with Macron until the day before his testimony, instead saying that Macron was "preoccupied by the constitutional reform", triggering laughter among the deputies present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : les cinq éléments-clés de l'audition de Collomb à l'Assemblée|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2018/07/23/affaire-benalla-les-cinq-elements-cles-de-l-audition-de-gerard-collomb-a-l-assemblee_5334952_823448.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 40 of the code of criminal procedure, however, makes no hierarchical stipulations, and there exists no such limitation prohibiting officials from reporting crimes not committed by subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Maxime Vaudano|author2=Adrien Sénécat|title=Affaire Benalla : les six failles des réponses de Gérard Collomb|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/07/23/affaire-benalla-les-six-failles-des-reponses-de-gerard-collomb_5335003_4355770.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Delpuech, Laurent Simonin – one of the officers suspended for transmitting video surveillance footage to Benalla – granted permission to Benalla to observe the demonstration of the police while he himself was unaware until being informed of the incident at a later point, and pinned the transmission of these tapes upon "unhealthy cronyism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : ce qu'il faut retenir de l'audition du préfet de police Michel Delpuech à l'Assemblée|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2018/07/23/affaire-benalla-ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-de-l-audition-du-prefet-de-police-michel-delpuech-a-l-assemblee_5335058_1653578.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'' identified several contradictions between the testimony of Collomb and Delpuech, namely related to when and how the prior was informed about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jérémie Baruch|author2=Maxime Vaudano|author3=Adrien Sénécat|title=Affaire Benalla : les contradictions du ministre et du préfet sur la remontée des informations|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/07/23/affaire-benalla-les-contradictions-du-ministre-et-du-prefet-sur-la-remontee-des-informations_5335077_4355770.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Gibelin]], director of the DOPC, stated that Benalla had "no authorization" to be present as an observer at the demonstration, countering previous claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Benalla n'avait "aucune autorisation" et participait à des réunions malgré sa "suspension"|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/benalla-n-avait-aucune-autorisation-de-la-prefecture-de-police-23-07-2018-7830987.php|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Parisien|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though later rescinded his initial response indicating that the Élysée had lied about Benalla's suspension and affirmed that he had misheard the dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Arthur Berdah|author2=Christophe Cornevin|title=Suspension de Benalla : Alain Gibelin revient sur ses déclarations dans une lettre|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2018/07/24/25001-20180724ARTFIG00068-suspension-de-benalla-alain-gibelin-revient-sur-ses-declarations-dans-une-lettre.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking before both chambers on 24 July, Philippe argued that the penalty imposed upon Benalla was appropriate and said that the case did not constitute a state scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Arthur Berdah|author2=Pierre Lepelletier|author3=Loris Boichot|title=Pour Édouard Philippe, l'affaire Benalla n'est "pas une affaire d'État"|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2018/07/24/25001-20180724ARTFIG00210-pour-edouard-philippe-l-affaire-benalla-n-est-pas-une-affaire-d-etat.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following hearing, chief of staff Strzoda said that he was the individual who made the decision suspend Benalla, with the suspension implemented after Macron was later informed by Kohler while in Australia. He also said that he did not deem the information he received from the IGPN regarding Benalla sufficient to report under article 40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Affaire Benalla : ce qu'il faut retenir de l'audition du directeur de cabinet d'Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2018/07/24/affaire-benalla-ce-qu-il-faut-retenir-de-l-audition-du-directeur-de-cabinet-d-emmanuel-macron_5335449_823448.html|agency=Agence France-Presse|newspaper=Le Monde|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and categorically denied the "rumors" regarding benefits and privileges reportedly afforded to Benalla;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Salaire, voiture, logement : Patrick Strzoda relativise les avantages de Benalla|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/le-scan/2018/07/24/25001-20180724ARTFIG00276-salaire-voiture-logement-patrick-strzoda-relativise-les-avantages-de-benalla.php|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=24 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he refused to give the amount of his salary or the details of his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pierre Alonso|author2=Ismaël Halissat|title=Affaire Benalla : le bon soldat Strzoda|url=http://www.liberation.fr/france/2018/07/24/affaire-benalla-le-bon-soldat-strzoda_1668639|newspaper=Libération|quote=Etait-il rémunéré 10000 euros par mois? «C'est faux!» s'exclame le directeur de cabinet, tout en refusant de donner le montant du salaire de l'intéressé.

On 26 July, Larrivé announced that he suspended his participation in the investigation, considering it a farce faced against the Élysée's apparent efforts to hinder its progress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comment la commission d'enquête de l'Assemblée nationale a fini par exploser autour de l'affaire Benalla|url=https://www.francetvinfo.fr/politique/emmanuel-macron/agression-d-un-manifestant-par-un-collaborateur-de-l-elysee/comment-la-commission-d-enquete-de-l-assemblee-nationale-se-dechire-autour-de-l-affaire-benalla_2867627.html|agency=Agence France-Presse|publisher=franceinfo|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest of the opposition subsequently quit the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Manon Rescan|title=Affaire Benalla : l'opposition suspend sa participation à la commission d'enquête de l'Assemblée|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2018/07/26/affaire-benalla-le-corapporteur-lr-suspend-sa-participation-a-la-commission-d-enquete_5336339_823448.html|newspaper=Le Monde|date=26 July 2018|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the sources used by [[Medhātithi]], another major commentator on the Manu Smṛti.

==Dating and Historical Context==
Very little is known about the date or historical context in which Bhāruci was writing, but [[P. V. Kane]] argues that it cannot have been written after 1050 CE because Vijñāneśvara, the author of the {{IAST|[[Mitākṣarā]]}}, a famous commentary on the {{IAST|[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]]}}, mentions Bhāruci's commentary in his writing.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P. V., ''History of Dharmaśāstra'', (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part I, 566.&lt;/ref&gt;  Viśvarūpa, another commentator on the [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti| ''{{IAST|Yājñavalka Smṛti}}'']], also uses Bhāruci as a source.  [[Patrick Olivelle]] places Bhāruci in the 8th century CE,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Olivelle, Patrick, "Dharmaśāstra: A Literary History", 29.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[J. Duncan M. Derrett]] places him between 600-650 CE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  There are two known authors named Bhāruci placed in about the same period of time, one who wrote on ''Dharmaśāstra'' and one who was a jurist, and Kane posits that they were in fact the same person because it is unlikely that there were two famous writers with the same name writing at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P. V., ''History of Dharmaśāstra'', (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part I, 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==
The main content of Bhāruci's commentary deals with the duties of a king, particularly regarding whether or not the king can be a source of [[dharma]].  Bhāruci's view as discussed by Derrett was that the king did not have any legislative power, but he did have "the power to issue regulations and edicts of a temporary character or for the purpose of facilitating objects already inculcated by the ''dharmaśāstra''."&lt;ref&gt;[[J Duncan M Derrett|Derrett, J. Duncan M.]], "Bhāruci on the Royal Regulative Power in India", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 84, No. 4, (1964), 392.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kane agrees, stating that "the king is not the source of the rules of ''Dharma'', but it is śāstra that defines the rules binding on the different [[varnas]] (classes) and [[ashramas]] (stages of man's life)."&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P. V., ''History of Dharmaśāstra'', (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part I, 569-570.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caltec Citrus Company''' is a defunct business which in 1958 became involved in a legal battle with the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

The FDA carried out surveillance of the Caltec warehouse. At this time it discovered substances not usually found in 100% pure orange juice being carried in a rear door by Caltec employees. Among these materials were sugar and [[Vitamin C]]. The loss to consumers in watering down procedures has been estimated at $1 million in lost value.

Caltec was defended in court by attorney [[Percy Foreman]]. The corporation was fined $6,000, and a [[suspended sentence]] was given to the violating officials.&lt;ref&gt;''Turner, James S. 1970. ''The Chemical Feast''. Grossman Publishers. New York City. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">The '''Canada Consumer Product Safety Act''' was a Canadian act that passed into law by the [[Government of Canada]] on December 14, 2010. This law replaced Part I of the Hazardous Products Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/12/14/con-consumer-safety-act.html Consumer safety bill passes Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally introduced in the 2nd session of the [[39th Parliament of Canada]] as '''Bill C-52'''. It died in committee when the [[2008 Canadian federal election]] was called, but was reintroduced in the 2nd session of the [[40th Parliament of Canada]] as '''Bill C-6''' and was passed by both houses of Parliament but did not receive royal assent before Parliament was [[prorogation in Canada|prorogued]].  It was introduced for a third time in the 3rd session of the 40th Parliament as '''Bill C-36'''.

The legislative package proposes amendments to the Hazardous Products Act (HPA), and would move continue consumer products to be regulated under the proposed Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. These bills are a result of increased consumer concern over consumer products, such as children's toys, which have been the subject of recalls over the past few years. Canada's Hazardous Products Act has not been updated in over 40 years. Canada's regulatory system has not kept pace with the global economy and increasing amounts of international trade. The Minister of Health, for example, currently doesn't have the power to force recall of faulty or counterfeit products in Canada.

== Support for improving Consumer Product Safety ==
[[Health Canada]] consulted widely with industry and consumer groups over a period of several years before bringing forward the [[Consumer Product Safety Action Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthycanadians.ca/pr-rp/dpaper-papier_e.html Consumer Product Safety Action Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Health Canada regularly issues warnings, advisories and information updates to advise consumers of products on the market which contain toxic substances such as [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[arsenic]]; or are otherwise contaminated by dangerous and unhealthy substances. However under the previous legislation, the [[Minister of Health]] has no power to compel recall of these products. For example, Health Canada posted just over 300 recall notices in 2009. Roughly one third of these were for children's products. In 2009, about 1.5 million consumers were affected by crib recalls alone.

'''''Charlton v. Kelly''''', 229 U.S. 447 (1913), is a case pertaining to [[extradition]] of a U.S. citizen to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Charlton v.

==Opinion of the Court==

{{Courts of India}}
The '''Chief Justice of India''' (CJI) is the head of the [[judiciary of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://14.139.60.114:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/15149/1/015_Chief%20Justice%20Sinha-A%20Review%20of%20Some%20of%20his%20Decisions%20(145-152).pdf#page=5|title=Chief Justice Sinha - A Review of Some of His Decisions (page 5 of 8)|last=Narasimham|first=R L, Justice (CJ, Orissa H. C.)|date=|website=Indian Law Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Supreme Court of India]]. The CJI also heads their administrative functions.

As head of the supreme court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation of cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important matters of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livelaw.in/new-captain-ship-change-sailing-rules-soon/|title=New Captain Of The Ship, Change In Sailing Rules Soon?|last=Saxena|first=Namit|date=23 December 2016|work=|newspaper=Live Law|language=en-US|access-date=24 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Article 145 of the [[Constitution of India]] and the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the Chief Justice allocates all work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to him or her (for re-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by a larger bench of more judges.

On the administrative side, the Chief Justice carries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of court officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the supervision and functioning of the Supreme Court.

It has been an unbroken convention for decades now, to appoint the senior-most judge of the supreme court as the CJI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.criticaltwenties.in/lawthejudiciary/how-india-missed-getting-its-first-woman-chief-justice-india|title=How India missed getting its first woman Chief Justice India|last=Alok|first=|date=26 November 2010|website=Critical Twenties|publisher=|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present CJI is Justice [[Ranjan Gogoi]], and is the 46th CJI since January 1950, the year the Constitution came into effect and the supreme court came into being. He succeeded Justice [[Dipak Misra]] on 2 October 2018, and will remain in office till 17 November 2019, the day he retires on turning 65 years in age.

==Appointment==
Article 124 of the Constitution of India provides for the manner of appointing judges to the Supreme Court. Though no specific provision exists in the Constitution for appointing the Chief Justice, who, as a result, is appointed like the other judges&lt;ref name="Article 124, Constitution of India"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 124, Constitution of India|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/Constitution/S124.htm|publisher=Vakilno1.com|accessdate=11 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226003752/http://vakilno1.com/bareacts/Constitution/S124.htm|archivedate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
conventionally, the outgoing CJI recommends the name of the senior-most judge (i.e. by date of appointment to the Supreme Court) for appointment by the [[President of India]], as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Venkatesan|first1=J.|title=TS Thakur to succeed HL Dattu as new Chief Justice of India|url=http://www.asianage.com/india/ts-thakur-succeed-hl-dattu-new-chief-justice-india-412|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=Asian Age|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/88687/seniority-norm-cji-appointment-thakur-khehar/|title=Seniority as the Norm to Appoint India's Chief Justice is a Dubious Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The WIre|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal==
Article 124(4) of Constitution of India lays down the procedure for removal of a Judge of Supreme Court which is applicable to Chief Justice as well. Once appointed, the Chief Justice remains in the office until the age of 65 years. He can be removed only through a process of [[impeachment]] by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] as follows:

{{Quotation|A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.|Article 124(4), [[Constitution of India]]| &lt;ref name="Article 124, Constitution of India"/&gt;}} &lt;!-- You should not put quotation marks around the quote. --&gt;

==Acting President==
The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969 of India provides that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) shall act as the President of India in the event of the offices of both the President and the Vice President being vacant. When [[Zakir Husain (politician)|President Zakir Hussain]] died in office, the Vice President [[V. V. Giri]], acted as the President. Later, Mr. Giri resigned as the Vice President. The CJI, Justice [[Mohammad Hidayatullah]] then became the acting President of India. As per the convention, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court became the acting CJI. When the newly elected President took office a month later, Justice Hidayatullah reverted as the Chief Justice of India

==Remuneration==
The [[Constitution of India]] gives the power of deciding remuneration as well as other conditions of service of the Chief Justice to the [[Parliament of India]]. Accordingly, such provisions have been laid down in ''The Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958''.&lt;ref name="HC and SC Judges Salaries and Conditions of Service Amendment Bill 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=The High Court and Supreme Court Judges Salaries and Conditions of Service Amendment Bill 2008|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/1230018357/1230018357_The_High_Court_and_Supreme_Court_Judges__Salaries_and_Conditions_of_Service__Amendment_Bill__2008.pdf|publisher=PRS India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act 1958"&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act 1958|url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/SC%28salary_and_condition_of_services%29act_1958.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, India|accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104092701/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/SC%28salary_and_condition_of_services%29act_1958.pdf|archivedate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remuneration was revised in 2006-2008, after the sixth central pay commission's recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/vikas_doc/docs/1241592662~~1230018357_The_High_Court_and_Supreme_Court_Judges__Salaries_and_Conditions_of_Service__Amendment_Bill__2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1908 Children's Act''', also known as  '''Children and Young Persons Act''', part of the [[Prevention of Cruelty to, and Protection of, Children Act 1889|Children's Charter]] was a piece of government legislation passed by the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|Liberal government]], as part of the [[British Liberal Party]]'s [[liberal reforms]] package. The Act was informally known as the '''Children's Charter''' and surrounded controversy.

It established [[juvenile court]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/childrens-act/|title=1908 Children’s Act was created to protect the poorest children in society from abuse|publisher=Intriguing History|language=English|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the registration of [[foster parents]], thus regulating [[baby-farming]] and [[wetnurse|wet-nursing]] and trying to stamp out [[infanticide]].  Local authorities were also granted powers to keep poor children out of the [[poorhouse]]/[[workhouse]] and protect them from abuse.  The act also prevented children working in dangerous trades and prevented them from purchasing cigarettes and entering [[pubs]]. The act also prevented children from learning criminal "tricks of the trade" in adult prisons, where children were often sent to serve time if a crime had been committed. Instead the Children's Charter had allocated [[Borstals]]. It eventually led to many councils setting up [[social services]] and [[Orphanages]].

The '''Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons''', also known as the '''McKay Commission''', was an independent commission established in the United Kingdom to consider issues arising from [[devolution in the United Kingdom]] and their effect on the workings of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  In the statement made by the government when setting up the commission, it referred to the [[West Lothian Question]], a term coined in 1977 to refer to anomalies existing in the pre-devolution government of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
Commission on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-vote-office/5-DPM-Devolution.pdf|date=12 January 2012|website=parliament.uk|author=Mark Harper|author-link=Mark Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission, chaired by [[Sir William McKay]], considered changes to the procedures of the House of Commons in relation to legislation that only affects part of the UK. It started its work in February 2012 and reported in March 2013.  It recommended that future legislation affecting England but not other [[countries of the United Kingdom|parts of the UK]] should require the support of a majority of MPs sitting for English constituencies.&lt;ref name=bbcnews250313&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21920010  BBC News, ''England-only laws 'need majority from English MPs' '', 25 March 2013]. Retrieved 25 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|West Lothian question}}
The term "West Lothian question" refers to issues concerning the former ability of members of parliament from [[Westminster constituencies|constituencies]] in Northern Ireland, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] to vote on matters that affect only people living in England and therefore have no direct consequence on their constituents, whilst being unable to influence matters that affect their own constituencies. Anomalies of this kind are considered to have been made more apparent by the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution of power]] from [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] to the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]].

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] manifesto for the 2010 general election included a commitment to introduce the idea of "[[English votes on English laws]]" and the party had previously explored this issue through a taskforce led by [[Kenneth Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7481906.stm | title=Tories consider MP voting changes | work=BBC News | date=1 July 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Conservative [[Malcolm Rifkind|Sir Malcolm Rifkind]] has also written about the issue, proposing an English grand committee as a possible solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/party-leader-welcomes-rifkind-s-elegant-west-lothian-answer-1.843791 |title=Party leader welcomes Rifkind's 'elegant' West Lothian Answer |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=3 October 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] manifesto included a commitment to address the status of England as part of wider UK constitutional reforms. The 2010 [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|coalition agreement]] between the parties included a commitment to establish a commission to examine the West Lothian question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/files/2010/05/coalition-programme.pdf |title=Programme For Government |publisher=Programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=25 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100919110641/http://programmeforgovernment.hmg.gov.uk/files/2010/05/coalition-programme.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for a commission were announced in September 2011 and its membership was disclosed in January 2012.

==Membership==

The commission was set up with six members, described "independent, non-partisan" experts. The members were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired-gov.net/wg/wg-news-1.nsf/0/E0FF9F7AD70F18878025798900394E10?OpenDocument |title=Article |publisher=Wired-gov.net |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of reference for the commission were:

==Publication of report==
The report of the commission was published on 25 March 2013.&lt;ref name=bbcnews250313/&gt; Its main conclusions are:&lt;ref name=mckaycommission2501313&gt;[http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/news/the-mckay-commission-report-on-the-consequences-of-devolution-for-the-house-of-commons-published-25-march-2013/  The McKay Commission’s Report on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons published – 25 March 2013]. Retrieved 25 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Evidence suggests that people in England feel unhappy with present arrangements, which take too little account of their grievances. A response is necessary.
*"Decisions taken in the Commons which have a separate and distinct effect for England (or England-and-Wales) should normally be taken only with the consent of a majority of MPs sitting for constituencies in England (or England-and-Wales).
*"That principle should be clearly set out in a resolution of the House of Commons, and House procedure should be changed to encourage MPs to follow this approach.
*"A range of procedural changes is suggested, all of which would allow the English voice to be heard.  Some of them involve committees on bills, with majorities reflecting the party balance in England (or England-and-Wales).  Others take the form of motions on the floor of the House.  They are not a single package but a menu from which choices can be made to suit the circumstances of a particular bill.
*"A select committee on Devolution should be appointed, which would (among other things) assist the House to hold UK ministers to account for their responsibilities in connection with devolution and their relations with the devolved administrations.
*"Under the Commission's recommendations, no MPs would be prevented from voting on any bill, and the right of the House as a whole to make final decisions would be preserved. However, there would also be scope for additional roles for MPs from England (or [[England and Wales|England-and-Wales]])."

Sir William McKay said:&lt;ref name=mckaycommission2501313/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other than England should prevail. We expect that governments will prefer compromise to conflict.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on an extension of the conclusions of the [[Cockburn Commission]], it was introduced by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]].&lt;ref name="governments"&gt;[http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/curthoys105.htm Review of Governments, Labour, and the law in mid-Victorian Britain: the trade union legislation of the 1870s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516084033/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/curthoys105.htm |date=2006-05-16 }}, Mark Curthoys&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act held that a trade union could not be prosecuted for act which would be legal if conducted by an individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Lconspiracy.htm Conspiracy &amp; Protection of Property Act], Spartacus Education&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that labour disputes were civil matters, not for consideration by [[criminal court]]s.&lt;ref name="governments" /&gt;  One result of this was that [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] was decriminalised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/1850_1880.php Timeline:1850-1880], TUC history online, Professor Mary Davis, Centre for Trade Union Studies, London Metropolitan University&lt;/ref&gt;  The law also made certain forms of [[stalking]] illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callnetuk.com/home/dashmee/Act.htm Excerpt from the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act, 1875] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060401075219/http://www.callnetuk.com/home/dashmee/Act.htm |date=2006-04-01 }}, Unfair Discrimination in the Scottish State Education System&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 6 and 7 of this Act were repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by the [[Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act]], section 31 and Schedule.

The '''Constitutional Court of Colombia''' ({{lang-es|Corte Constitucional de Colombia}}) is the [[supreme court|supreme]] [[constitutional court]] of [[Colombia]]. Part of the [[Judiciary of Colombia|Judiciary]], it is the final [[appellate court]] for matters involving interpretation of the Constitution with the power to determine the constitutionality of laws, acts, and statutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15029">'''Constitutional review''', or '''constitutionality review''' or '''constitutional control''', is the evaluation, in some [[country|countries]], of the [[constitutionality]] of the [[law]]s. It's supposed to be a system of preventing violation of the rights granted by the constitution, assuring its efficacy, their stability and preservation.&lt;ref name="ARNE"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.concourts.net/The%20Constitutional%20Review%20sample.pdf|last=Mavcic|first=Arne|title=The Constitutional Review|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction ==
There are very specific situations in which the constitutional review differs from [[common law]] to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], as well as the judicial review in general.&lt;ref name="LAWNYU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-E-Ferejohn-Constitutional-Review-in-the-Global-Context.pdf|title=Judicial Review in Global Context|author=Ferejohn, John E.|publisher=NYU Law|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main article|judicial review}}

== Concept ==
In the countries that have written and [[Rigid Constitution|rigid constitutions]], they (the constitutions) represent the supreme norm of the [[juridical order]], sited on the top of the pyramid of norms. It's named as ''fundamental law'', ''supreme law'', ''law of the laws'', ''biggest law''. That biggest law asks for more difficult and [[legal procedure|formal procedures]] for updating than the other juridical norms (named ''sub-constitutional''). Although this is usually characterized as a civil law speciality, some of the concepts here can be [[inheritance (computer science)|inherited]] from common law countries which have written constitutions; for instance, USA, that, paradoxally, in timeline, was the first to adopt the diffuse review.

== Application ==
The judicial control of ''constitutionality'' applies to the [[normative act]]s too.&lt;ref name="VENICE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2010/CDL-AD(2010)039rev-e.pdf|title=Study on Individual Access to Constitutional Justice|publisher=Council of Europe - Venice Commission|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History: ''Marbury v. Madison'' - the first precedent ==
The first [[precedent]] in which the American [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] asserted its power of constitutional control was the ''Marbury v. Madison''.
{{main article|Marbury v. Madison}}
&lt;!-- The next six paragraphs are very confuse and require a complete reformulation

Em 1880, nas eleições presidenciais realizadas nos Estados Unidos, o então presidente federalista John Adams foi derrotado pela oposição republicana, perdendo representação tanto na esfera Legislativa quanto Executiva, sendo Thomas Jefferson o novo presidente. Com o intuito de manter sua influência política no Poder Judiciário, os federalistas, antes do término do mandato de John Adams, aprovaram uma lei de reorganização do Judiciário federal - ''The Circuit Court Act'', visando reduzir o números de Ministros da Suprema Corte, impedindo que o presidente sucessor, Thomas Jefferson, nomeasse novos Ministros após a aposentadoria dos atuais.

Em seguida, nova lei - the Organic Act of the District of Columbia autorizou o presidente a nomear quarenta e dois juízes de paz, sendo todos confirmados pelo Senado na véspera da posse de Thomas Jefferson. Como ainda era presidente, em seu último dia efetivo, John Adams assinou os atos de investidura dos novos juízes de paz nomeados, cabendo ao seu Secretário de Estado, John Marshall, entregá-los. Em meio às pressões de final de mandato e sem tempo de entregar todas as nomeações, John Marshall não conseguiu concluir a sua tarefa e alguns juízes nomeados ficaram sem receber o ato de investidura, pois havia sido nomeado como presidente da Suprema Corte.

Ao tomar posse, Thomas Jefferson indicou como seu Secretário de Estado James Madison, a quem caberia contuniar a entrega dos atos de investidura. No entanto, por designação do próprio presidente, o Secretário Madison recusou-se a entregas os atos faltantes. Dentre os juízes não empossados no cargo estava William Marbury, que buscou ver seu direito judicialmente garantido, por meios de propositura de ação judicial - ''writ of mandamus''. No meio tempo, os novos integrantes do Congresso, de maioria republicana, revogaram a lei de reorganização do Judiciário federal aprovada pelo presidente John Adams, extinguindo os cagos de juízes de paz criados e destituindo seus ocupantes. O pedido formulado por Marbury foi aprecidao pela Suprema Corte, já em meio a um contexto politicamente conturbado, pois o presidente da Corte era o antigo Secretário de Estado, Marshall.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"O caso Marbury v. Madison foi a primeira decisão na qual a Suprema Corte afirmou seu poder de exercer o controle de constitucionalidade, negando aplicação a leis que, de acordo com sua interpretação, fossem inconsitucionais. Assinale-se, por relevante, que a Constituição não conferia a ela ou a aqualquer outro órgão judicial, de modo explícito, competência dessa natureza.&lt;ref&gt;Barroso, Luís Roberto. O controle de constitucionalidade no direito brasileiro: exposição sistemática da doutrina e análise crítica da jurisprudência / Luís Roberto Barroso - 3. ed. rev. e atual. - São Paulo: Saraiva, 2008. pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ao julgar o caso, a Suprema Corte buscou demonstrar que a inconstitucionalidade da lei não era a única cabível, visto que poderia ser reconhecida a incompetência da Corte ou o descabimento do ''writ of mandamus'' por outras razões, atribuição que decorreria logicamente do sistema. No voto elaborado por Marshall, a argumentação para indeferir o pedido de Marbury vinha da discussão da natureza da categorias de atos do Executivo, ou seja, que não eram passíveis de revisão judicial, sendo estes atos de natureza política e atos que a Constituição ou a lei houvessem atribuído a sua exclusiva discricionariedade. Deste modo, Marshall ainda enunciou três grandes fundamentos que justificam o controle de constitucionalidade, como segue: (i) a supremacia da Constituição, (ii) a nulidade da lei que contrarie a Constituição e (iii) é o Poder Judiciário o intérprete final da Constituição. De todo o modo, a decisão da Suprema Corte foi alvo de inúmeras críticas, como a influência das circunstâncias políticas no julgamento do Judiciário, vejamos o argumento de Barroso.&lt;ref&gt;Barroso, Luís Roberto. O controle de constitucionalidade no direito brasileiro: exposição sistemática da doutrina e análise crítica da jurisprudência / Luís Roberto Barroso - 3. ed. rev. e atual. - São Paulo: Saraiva, 2008. pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ao estabelecer a competência do Judiciário para rever os atos do Executivo e do Legislativo à luz da Constituição, era o seu próprio poder que estava demarcando, poder que, aliás, viria a exercer pelos trinta e quatro longos anos em que permaneceu na presidência da Corte. A decisão trazia, no enatnto, um toque de inexcedível sagacidade política. É que as teses nela veiculadas, que em última análise davam poderes ao Judiciário sobre outros dois ramos de governo, jamais seriam aceitas passivamente por Jefferson e pelos republicanos do Congresso."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Control systems ==
Depending on how each country decides to organize his constitutional revies, it can be attributed to a different organ. In some countries, part of the review can be attribution of a political organ. For instance, In Brazil, the declaration of inconstitutionality in a concrete case by STF can be suggested to senate to give to this declaration global effects.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), pp. 302-303&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modelos de controle judicial ===
Há essencialmente dois modelos. Na "jurisdição constitucional difusa", (ou controle difuso), todos os órgãos do Poder Judiciário realizam o controle. Já na jurisdição concentrada, (ou controle concentrado), somente uns poucos órgãos do Judiciário tomam decisões a respeito da constitucionalidade de atos. Nesse modelo, quase sempre o controle é competência exclusiva de um só órgão, geralmente o órgão mais elevado do Judiciário.

O controle difuso é também chamado de "sistema aberto" e foi criado pelos [[Estados Unidos da América]]. O modelo concentrado é também tido por "sistema reservado" e foi adotado primeiramente na [[Áustria]], por inspiração de [[Hans Kelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vias de ação judicial ==
As vias de ação dizem respeito a dois modos possíveis de fiscalização da constitucionalidade por parte do(s) órgão(s) competente(s). Na via incidental, (ou concreta), o controle de constitucionalidade só ocorre quando surge uma controvérsia real. Quando, por exemplo, no meio de uma disputa jurídica, alguém pede que o juiz declare certa norma como sendo contrária à constituição. Na via principal, (ou abstrata), vai ocorrer uma análise ''em tese'': desprovida de ligação com qualquer caso concreto. O objetivo aí é somente proteger o ordenamento jurídico.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), pp. 303-305&lt;/ref&gt;

== Momento do controle judicial ==
Em relação ao tempo, o controle de constitucionalidade poderá ser preventivo ou repressivo. O ''controle preventivo'' pretende evitar que uma norma inconstitucional entre para o [[ordenamento jurídico]], visa evitar a própria produção da norma inconstitucional. O ''controle repressivo'' pretende verificar se uma lei, já incorporada ao ordenamento, está ou não de acordo com a Constituição.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

== Espécies de inconstitucionalidade ==
[[Ficheiro:Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal.jpg|thumb|300px|O [[Supremo Tribunal Federal]] brasileiro avaliando a constitucionalidade de uma norma.]]
Inconstitucionalidade é o conflito de um comportamento, de uma norma ou de um ato com a Lei Fundamental. Estes devem todos ser eliminados ante a supremacia constitucional. A inconstitucionalidade pode ser de tipos diversos.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), pp. 299-302&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconstitucionalidade por ação e por omissão===
Tanto o agir quanto o não agir podem ser inconstitucionais. Ao se fazer um ato ou editar uma lei contrários à Carta Maior está sendo cometida uma inconstitucionalidade por ação, ou inconstitucionalidade positiva, ou, ainda, inconstitucionalidade por ato comissivo. Já quando o poder político deixa de editar uma lei exigida pela Constituição, temos aí uma inconstitucionalidade omissiva, ou negativa.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconstitucionalidade material e formal===
Em Direito, quando se menciona o aspecto "material" de algum fenômeno está sempre se falando do conteúdo; já quando se fala em aspecto "formal" o enfoque é no mecanismo, no ritual. Aqui não é diferente. Inconstitucionalidade material ocorre quando o ''conteúdo'' de um ato jurídico é contrário à Lei Maior. Inconstitucionalidade formal, por sua vez, surge quando os ''procedimentos'' adotados na elaboração de um ato se chocam com a Constituição, ainda que seu conteúdo final possa ser compatível. O nível formal inclui não apenas vícios no procedimento em si, mas também vícios de [[competência]]: se uma norma for criada por alguém que a Lei Maior não disse ser competente para tanto, temos aí também uma inconstitucionalidade formal.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconstitucionalidade total e parcial===
Às vezes uma norma é totalmente incompatível com a Constituição, outras vezes essa incompatibilidade é apenas parcial. Quando uma norma é totalmente inconstitucional, ela deverá ser invalidada como um todo. Já quando somente parte dela é incompatível, há espaço para que apenas as partes conflitantes sejam desprovidas de efetividade, com o restante permanecendo no ordenamento jurídico.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), pp. 300-301&lt;/ref&gt;
A constituição em sentido material é o conjunto de normas que regulam a estrutura do estado e da sociedade e seus aspectos fundamentais. A constituição material é o cerne de uma constituição, que para existir não precisa estar organizada num documento escrito.

===Inconstitucionalidade direta e indireta===
Quando uma das [[normas primárias]] (que têm validade apoiada diretamente na Lei Fundamental) está em desacordo com a Constituição, temos a inconstitucionalidade direta. Já quando uma das [[normas secundárias]] está em desacordo com a norma primária que a fundamenta, isso é tido como uma inconstitucionalidade indireta ou reflexa. Desse modo, quando um decreto administrativo é contrário à lei que o fundamenta, isso é tido como inconstitucionalidade reflexa ou indireta. Mesmo que o próprio texto constitucional pareça estar sendo ofendido diretamente pelo ato normativo secundário, o fato é classificado como inconstitucionalidade indireta.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), pp. 301-302&lt;/ref&gt;
Nestes modos, é interesante ressaltar que apesar da distinção ambas as formas são meros modelos de inconstitucionalidade.

===Inconstitucionalidade originária e superveniente===
Um ato normativo tem inconstitucionalidade originária quando é oposto às normas constitucionais já vigentes no momento de sua criação. Por outro lado, há inconstitucionalidade superveniente quando o ato normativo era, à princípio, constitucional, mas uma alteração posterior na própria Constituição a torna incompatível com as novas normas da Constituição.&lt;ref&gt;Paulo e Alexandrino (2009), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 &amp; 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100: Edited with Notes, Critical and Explanatory''''' is a book about the [[criminal law consolidation Acts 1861]] written by  [[James Edward Davis]] and published by [[Butterworths]] in [[duodecimo]]&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John Foster. "Davis, James Edward". A Supplement to Allibone's Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors. J B Lippincott Company. Philadelphia. 1899. Volume 1. [https://archive.org/stream/asupplementtoal00alligoog#page/n476/mode/1up Page 460].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861. ''Davis' Criminal Law Consolidation Acts''&lt;ref&gt;The publishers catalogue contains an article on "Davis's Criminal Law Consolidation Acts" which claims that the title of that book is "The New Criminal Law Consolidation Acts, 1861; with an Introduction and practical notes, illustrated by a copious reference to Cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal". The reviews cited in the catalogue as being reviews of that book are, however, reviews of "The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 &amp; 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100: Edited with Notes, Critical and Explanatory".

==Criticism==
The [[Solicitors Journal]] said that it would "be unreasonable to expect that Mr." Davis' "edition of these statutes, published within three months from the publication of the Acts themselves, and the production of his unassisted labour, should contain the same amount of information and practical utility as might be expected to be found in a work prepared and matured at leisure. In the edition before us the public are provided with the Acts themselves, in a convenient form, with an index; and by means of reference to the corresponding clauses of those statutes upon which the work of consolidation has proceeded, the professional man is furnished with a clue by means of which he may ascertain what the law in any analogous case was up to the passing of these Acts. The Acts are printed in the order in which they received the [[Royal assent]], and an attempt has been made to distinguish by brackets those provisions which are introduced for the first time. It would, however, it is conceived, be unsafe for a practitioner to assume that the only alterations in the law made by these Acts are such as are made by the provisions marked as described; for in many instances, where no brackets occur, the subjoined note informs the reader that the section is ''nearly verbatim'', or that it is ''framed upon'' one or more statutes; and, obviously under such circumstances new words must occur, the operation of which upon the [[Statutory construction|construction]] of the clause it must be extremely difficult to foretell. These distinguishing marks, however, though they may not be placed with perfect accuracy, materially contribute to the value of the book. The book also contains a table of offences and an introduction. Of the explanatory notes, except so far as they contain references to other analogous Acts as above noticed, we cannot speak with satisfaction. No method appears to have been pursued in the manner in which the matter contained in them is introduced. Sometimes cases in illustration of the text of the section are inserted; and sometimes, though there is an equal necessity for the insertion of such illustrations, and equal facility for supplying them, the editor, either from indolence or caprice, entirely omits them. It is unreasonable, perhaps, to expect to find, in a work published as this is, a history of the multifarious laws digested by the Acts, or a complete compilation from [[law report|reports]] and text-books, of the leading decisions with reference to analogous legislation, or a description of the evidence and procedure in relation to the offences provided against; but though full information upon these points might not have been expected, it is only reasonable to suppose that such a work as the present will systematically point out those channels wherein such information may be readily obtained. To have furnished references to such sources of information would have been an easy task, and would have added greatly to the practical utility of the book. It is a task, however, which Mr. Davis has not undertaken. With the exception, therefore, of the words on the title-page, "with notes critical and explanatory," the book neither contains any express promise that the task undertaken by its editor shall be performed in any particular manner, nor statement that it has been prepared for any definite purpose and no one who may be disappointed by its contents can complain that more has been promised by its editor than has been performed."&lt;ref&gt;(1861) 5 [[Solicitors Journal]]  [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA836&amp;id=12QqAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=html 836]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Economic Stabilization Act of 1970''' (Title II of {{USStatute|91|379|84|799|1970|08|15}},&lt;ref&gt;later amended by {{USStatute|91|558|84|1468}} §201, {{USStatute|92|8|85|13}}} §2, {{USStatute|92|15|85|38}} §3, {{USStatute|92|210|85|743}}} §2, {{USStatute|93|28|87|27}}} §§1-8, and {{USStatute|102|572|106|4506}}} §102(a)&lt;/ref&gt; formerly codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1901?qt-us_code_temp_noupdates=1#qt-us_code_temp_noupdates 12 U.S.C. § 1904]) was a [[United States]] law that authorized the [[President of the United States|President]] to stabilize [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[wage]]s, [[Salary|salaries]], [[interest rate]]s, [[dividend]]s and similar transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Economic Stabilization Program|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/432.html#432.2.9|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It established standards to serve as a guide for determining levels of wages, prices, etc., which would allow for adjustments, exceptions and variations to prevent inequities, taking into account changes in [[economic growth|productivity]], [[inflation|cost of living]] and other pertinent factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Orders|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11790.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The nation was in recession, attributed to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[1970s Energy Crisis]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} combined with workforce shortages and the rise in healthcare cost. Nixon inherited high inflation, though unemployment was low. Seeking reelection in the 1972 presidential race, Nixon vowed to fight inflation; he acknowledged that this would result in job losses, but proposed that this was a temporary solution, but promised that more was to come in terms of change, hope and "manpower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixonomics|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Richard-M-Nixon-nixonomics.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was passed, inaugurating a policy of wage and [[price controls]]. Nixon wrote to Congress:
{{Cquote|"Our tactics for pursuing this objective are twofold: First, to accomplish much needed and long overdue reform of the manpower programs set up under the [[Manpower Development and Training Act]] and subsequent legislation and thus increase their effectiveness in enhancing the employability of jobless workers; and, second, to move toward a broader national manpower policy which will be an important adjunct of economic policy in achieving our Nation's economic and social objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Manpower Report of the President|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/#axzz1Gh8Nahyz|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nixon commented on the futile attempts to contain the economy in the 1960s, and promised to bring about change by proposing tax cuts over the course of his term to create new jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statements from President Nixon|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3273#axzz1GXb7qZQq|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Nixon proceeded with the tax cuts under the provisions of phase II of the Economic Stabilization Act as it was amended earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the Economic Stabilization Programs, 1971-1974|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/432.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon believed America needed a comprehensive manpower policy to reinvigorate the economy. Nixon and the proposed Act cited the [[New Frontier|Manpower Development and Training act of 1962]] to utilize the competence of America's workforce and the Manpower Revenue Sharing Act, to make training programs accessible to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Manpower Report of the President|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/#axzz1Gh8Nahyz|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties and obligations under this act==
The act provided for limitations on the exercise of Presidential authority and allowed delegation of the performance of any of the President's functions to appropriate officers, departments and agencies of the [[United States]] or to entities composed of members appointed to represent different sectors of the economy and the general public.

The act provided for disclosure of information, [[subpoena]] power, administrative procedure, [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]], injunctions and suits for damages and other relief. The Act specified [[original jurisdiction]] for judicial review of cases or controversies arising under the Act or regulations issued thereunder in the [[United States district court|district courts of the United States]], and directed that appeals of final decisions or permitted interlocutory appeals be brought in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]].

==Public benefits==
This act had special provisions, some of which increased the employment opportunities for minorities, under the local manpower programs. These programs completed two tasks in one. First, this program in addition to providing an equal opportunity for minorities, under the Economic Stabilization Act which lead to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Nixon:Domestic Policies|url=http://www.historyking.com/American-History/political-history/richard-nixon/Richard-Nixon-Domestic-Policies.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created opportunities for those who were unemployed and "transitional" jobs for those who lost jobs. Secondly this program fulfilled the "unmet needs" for public assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message to the Congress Transmitting Annual Manpower Report of the President  |publisher=American Presidency Project|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/#axzz1Gh8Nahyz|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of Energy under "power vested" by the act had to submit quarterly reports to the [[United States Congress]] in conjunction with the provisions of the [[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]] of 1973, to ensure the best prices for fuel in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives:Executive Order|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11790.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public did not just benefit from initiatives made in the workforce. In the attempt to save social security from suffering from the effects of the inflation, [[Supplemental Security Income]] was established, to provide unemployed Americans with a cushion. Since Nixon decoupled the dollar from the [[gold standard]], the dollar price of imports increased. The cost of imports allowed Americans to focus on American-made products to keep the money circulating throughout the American economy, resulting in a higher income for American workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Nixon:Domestic Policies|url=http://www.historyking.com/American-History/political-history/richard-nixon/Richard-Nixon-Domestic-Policies.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To lull the anxieties of unemployment and the anxieties about the promises of the Economic Stabilization Act in conjunction with bettering public service,the President signed the Emergency Employment Act in 1971. The Act made specific provision for small businesses and created nearly "150,000 new jobs" in the "[[public sphere]]" in such fields as "[[education]], [[environmental protection]], law enforcement, and other '[[public works]]'". The most prominent public work being the [[public transport|mass transportation systems]]. This Act, like the Economic Stabilization Act that influenced this one, required the President to issue periodic reports on all appropriations to [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks on Signing the Emergency Employment Act of 1971|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3074#axzz1Gh8Nahyz|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this act, the [[United States Congress]] convened to tackle the issue of rapid economic growth in metropolises and other urban environments. The goal was to provide efficient living for people living in these settings. The goal in more detail was to condense densely populated areas. The [[Housing and Urban Development]] department was established to provide good living and "attractive living environments" for these tenants and to conserve the energy and resources that are used in heavily populated urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing Codes|url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/42C59.txt|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Act provided people with low income with subsidized rent for affordable housing in privately owned buildings. This act was the "predecessor to the Section 8 rental subsidies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeHaven|first=Tad|title=Department of Housing and Urban Development  Timeline of Growth|url=http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/timeline|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenging the Stabilization Act==
In the case of {{cite court |litigants= Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally|vol= 337|reporter= F. Supp.|opinion= 737|pinpoint= |court= D.D.C.|date= 1971|url= http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/337/737/1469915/}}, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters sued defendant [[John B Connally]], the then chairman of the Cost of Living Council and the secretary of the [[United States Treasury]]. The Meat Cutters approached the court with two arguments, which were condensed into one. The Plaintiffs' primary concern was pursuing a twenty-five cent an hour increase on general wages. It was argued by the Plaintiffs that this was an agreement that was reached in April 1970 and demanded that the wage increase take effect September 6, 1971. The Plaintiffs' second argument was that this act was "unconstitutional and the [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] was invalid", because one of the stipulations of the act was that "prices, rent, wages and salaries shall be stabilized for a period of 90-days" as stated by President Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;''Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally'', at 743&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the salient argument because it was the first time that the act was opposed and the Executive Order was being questioned, since the Plaintiffs believed that the order did not do justice to the workers under unions and that the act imposed on the power of the unions, since they had to operate under a 90-day spending freeze. This freeze did not allow the unions to protect the union workers. This was due largely to the fact that the Pay Board and Price Commission, under both the act and the Executive Order, both monitored and controlled wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nixonomics|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Kennedy-Bush/Richard-M-Nixon-nixonomics.html|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] upheld the act, rejecting an argument that it was an [[Nondelegation doctrine|unconstitutional delegation]] of legislative authority, by citing previous cases such as {{ussc|name=Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover|link=Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover|volume=359|page=500|pin=507|year=1959}} for the "government's contention of adequacy of law" and  {{ussc|name=Field v. Clark|link=|volume=143|page=649|pin=692-693|year=1892}} for the "permissibility of legislative power within the Government's limits". These were two amongst many cases cited by the defense, all of which proved the legitimacy and flexibility of the Act and the Government's authority and range to enforce this Act.&lt;ref&gt;''Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Connally'', at 745&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative history==
Under a provision in the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, the Cost of Living Council was established as an independent agency. The purpose of this council was to stabilize the prices, rent, wages and salaries higher than the prices on or before May 25, 1970 and execute phases II-IV of the Economic Stabilization Program. These phases were set in place to ensure the success of this program. Phase I was the 90-day price and wage freeze that was authorized by President Nixon who delegated power to the Office of Emergency Preparedness which acted as the fiduciary agency that monitored business practices. Phase II required that the Cost of Living Council engage in wage and price controls. Phase III of this program required this council to enforce another price freeze to balance out economy. The IV and final phase consisted of a "voluntary compliance and gradual decontrol", this council had to ease off of these businesses and relinquish some control. By April 30, 1974 this council was "abolished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Stabilization Programs 1971-1974|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/432.html#432.2.2|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having the responsibility of chairman of first the Office of Economic Opportunity then the Cost of Living Council imposed on him, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was initially unhappy with his position as chairman of the council and the council's "success" and for a while opposed the idea of the council. He soon realized that his presence there would "be best" for his influence in both domestic and [[international commerce]] and appeared satisfied with the council prior to it being abolished in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pareene|first=Alex|title=RummyLeaks: "The President said that the Senate and the House were a joke"|url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/09/rumsfeld_nixon_congress|publisher=Salon|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President Nixon reported that "public support and cooperation" was there for the council when they were making the tough decisions. President Nixon also ensured the American people that the Cost of Living Council always "kept the public interest in mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Nixon|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3742#axzz1GXb7qZQq|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President in his quarterly statements usually claimed that Rumsfeld and his council were doing a great job, "providing encouraging evidence that the nation continues to make progress in the battle against inflation". Nixon continued to say in his report that "The national economy is now expanding significantly. This makes the success of the stabilization program more important than ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statements from President Nixon|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3421#axzz1GXb7qZQq|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1971 Nixon announced he had signed the [[Revenue Act of 1971]], which was an amendment to the Economic Stabilization Act and, as Nixon said, was to provide "tax cuts of some $15 billion over the next 3 years to stimulate the economy and provide hundreds of thousands of new jobs". This program was allowed to expire in 1974 and was viewed as a success by the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statements from President Nixon|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3273#axzz1GXb7qZQq|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], an '''employee stock purchase plan''' ('''ESPP''') is a [[Taxation in the United States|tax-efficient]]{{Citation needed|reason=Ordinary income rates apply to discount, regular capital gains rules apply to appreciation from original market price. It is a benefit, but how is it tax-efficient?|date=May 2018}} means by which employees of a corporation can purchase the corporation's [[stock]], often at a discount. Employees contribute to the plan through payroll deductions, which build up between the offering date and the purchase date. At the purchase date, the company uses the accumulated funds to purchase shares in the company on behalf of the participating employees. The amount of the discount depends on the specific plan but can be as much as 15% lower than the market price.&lt;ref name=Babenko&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babenko|first=Ilona|last2=Sen|first2=Rik|date=2014-03-14|title=Money Left on the Table: An Analysis of Participation in Employee Stock Purchase Plans|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2166012|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Depending on when the employee sells the shares, the disposition will be classified as either qualified or not qualified. If the position is sold two years after the offering date and at least one year after the purchase date, the shares will fall under a qualified disposition. If the shares are sold within two years of the offering date or within one year after the purchase date the disposition will not be qualified. These positions will have different tax implications.

The majority of publicly disclosed ESPPs in the United States are tax-qualified plans that follow the rules of Section 423 of the IRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stock Options Book, 13th edition|last=Baker|first=Alisa|publisher=The National Center for Employee Ownership|year=2012|isbn=978-1-932924-91-6|location=Oakland, California|pages=67-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation rates in the US in ESPPs is around 30%.&lt;ref name=Babenko /&gt;

The '''European Community number''' ('''EC number''') is a unique seven-digit identifier that was assigned to substances for [[regulatory]] purposes within the [[European Union]] by the European Commission. The ''EC Inventory'' comprises three individual inventories, EINECS, ELINCS and the NLP list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where R is a check digit and N represents integers. The check digit is calculated using the [[International Standard Book Number#Check digits|ISBN]] method. According to this method, the check digit R is the following sum [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 11:

:&lt;math&gt;R = (N_1 + 2 N_2 + 3N_3 + 4N_4 + 5N_5 + 6N_6) \mod 11&lt;/math&gt;

If the remainder R is equal to 10, that combination of digits is not used for an EC number. To illustrate, the EC number of [[dexamethasone]] is 200-003-9. N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 2, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; are 0, and N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is 3. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2 + 2\!\times\!0 + 3\!\times\!0 + 4\!\times\!0 + 5\!\times\!0 + 6\!\times\!3}{11} = \frac{20}{11} = 1 + \frac{9}{11}&lt;/math&gt;

The remainder is 9, which is the check digit.

There is a set of 181 ELINCS numbers (EC numbers starting with 4) for which the checksum by the above algorithm is 10 and the number has not been skipped but issued with a checksum of 1.

'''Evolutionary Governance Theory''' (EGT) is theoretical framework for analysing and explaining governance and its evolution. It is an approach that addresses the complex and non-linear nature of governance. EGT is different from other theoretical approaches in the sense that it recognizes that governance and its elements are constantly changing in interplay with each other. It places emphasis on the co-evolution between discourses, actors and institutions. Therewith it offers a perspective on the way institutions, markets and societies evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, Kristof, Beunen, Raoul, Duineveld, Martijn (2014) Evolutionary Governance Theory: an introduction. Springer, Heidelberg. {{ISBN|978-3-319-00983-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E. (2014) Do institutions for collective action evolve?. Journal of Bioeconomics, 16(1), 3-30.&lt;/ref&gt; It builds on a broad range of theoretical sources that includes [[Systems theory]], [[Post structuralism]], [[Institutional economics]], [[Actor–network theory]] and [[Development studies]]. EGT offers a framework for understanding how actors, subjects, objects, formal and informal institutions, and knowledge are in a continuous process of co-evolution, how different dependencies influence the course of evolution, and how different evolutionary pathways are created and influencing each other’s development. Within EGT social systems theory is compatible with a version of discourse theory, largely in line with the [[Michel Foucault]] tradition, while also offering a place for actors and their strategizing.&lt;ref&gt;Beunen, R., Van Assche, K., Duineveld, M. (2015) Evolutionary Governance Theory: theory and applications. Springer, Heidelberg. {{ISBN|978-3-319-12273-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary Governance Theory links up with the literature on social-ecological and complex-adaptive systems, with an emphasis on the processes and mechanisms that drive social evolution.

The '''Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003''' (abbreviated '''FACT Act''' or '''FACTA''', {{USPL|108|159}}) is a United States [[United States federal law|federal law]], passed by the [[United States Congress]] on November 22, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/2622 Library of Congress Congress.gov], searched for H.R. 2622 (108th Congress) Major Congressional Actions on September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 4, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031204-3.html White House fact sheet], December 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as an amendment to the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]]. The act allows consumers to request and obtain a free [[credit history|credit report]] once every twelve months from each of the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies ([[Equifax]], [[Experian]] and [[TransUnion]]). In cooperation with the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the three major [[Credit reporting agency|credit reporting agencies]] set up the website, [[AnnualCreditReport.com]], to provide free access to annual credit reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre34.shtm Facts for Consumers], Federal Trade Commission, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also contains provisions to help reduce [[identity theft]], such as the ability for individuals to place alerts on their credit histories if identity theft is suspected, or if deploying overseas in the military, thereby making fraudulent applications for credit more difficult. Further, it requires secure disposal of consumer information.

== Provisions ==
The FACT Act contains seven major titles: '''Identity Theft Prevention and Credit History Restoration''', '''Improvements in Use of and Consumer Access to Credit Information''', '''Enhancing the Accuracy of Consumer Report Information''', '''Limiting the Use and Sharing of Medical Information in the Financial System''', '''Financial Literacy and Education Improvement''', '''Protecting Employee Misconduct Investigations''', and '''Relation to State Laws'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress|title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003|accessdate=2009-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity Theft Prevention and Credit History Restoration ===
This title of the act contains provisions that deal mainly with the prevention of identity theft.  In particular, it establishes new regulations concerning 'fraud alerts' and 'active duty alerts', establishes new limitations on the printing of customers' credit card numbers on receipts, and prescribes that new regulations be established by certain government agencies regarding the detection of identity theft by [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and [[Creditor|creditors]].

==== Fraud alerts ====
The title requires that consumer reporting agencies, upon the request of a consumer who believes he is or about to be a victim of fraud or any other related crime, must place a fraud alert on that consumer's file for at least 90 days, and notify all other [[Consumer reporting agency|consumer reporting agencies]] of the fraud alert.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Consumers may request an extended fraud alert, in which case requires the reporting agency to disclose this fraud alert in any credit score that it issues for the consumer during a seven-year period. An extended alert also requires the reporting agency to exclude the consumer from any list distributed to third parties for the purpose of extending credit or offering insurance to that consumer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The title also provides for any [[active duty]] member to request an active duty alert, which requires the reporting agency to disclose such alert with any credit report issued within 12 months of the request and to exclude the active duty member from any list distributed to third parties for the purpose of extending credit or offering insurance for two years from the request.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress|title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|pages=117 STAT. 1955–117 STAT. 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Truncation of credit and debit card numbers ====
The act also prohibits businesses from printing more than 5 digits of any customer's card number or card expiration date on any receipt provided to the cardholder at the [[point of sale]] or transaction. This provision is enforced with statutory damages ranging from $100 to $1000 per violation, and when claims are aggregated in a [[class action]] (brought by all the customers of a retailer that failed to truncate credit card numbers) the amount of damages can be massive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel L. |year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision excludes receipts that are handwritten or imprinted, where the only method of recording the credit card number is by such means. The act did not become effective for three years after its enactment for any cash register manufactured before January 1, 2005 and did not become effective for one year after its enactment for any cash register manufactured after January 1, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress| title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|pages=117 STAT. 1959–117 STAT. 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Identification of possible identity theft (Red Flags rule) ====
The act established the '''[[Red Flags Rule]]''', which required the Federal banking agencies, the [[National Credit Union Administration]], and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to jointly create regulations regarding identity theft prevention applicable to financial institutions and creditors.  The Red Flags Rule also addresses how card issuers must respond to changes of address.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress| title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|pages=117 STAT. 1960–117 STAT. 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulations that were established as a result include:&lt;ref&gt;http://ftc.gov/opa/2007/10/redflag.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

*One that requires financial institutions or creditors to develop and implement an Identity Theft Prevention Program in connection with both new and existing accounts. The Program must include reasonable policies and procedures for detecting, preventing, and mitigating identity theft;
*Another that requires users of consumer reports to respond to Notices of Address Discrepancies that they receive; and
*A third that places special requirements on issuers of debit or credit cards to assess the validity of a change of address if they receive notification of a change of address for a consumer’s debit or credit card account and, within a short period of time afterward they receive a request for an additional or replacement card for the same account.

Another key item was the requirement that mortgage lenders provide consumers with a Credit Disclosure Notice that included their [[credit score]]s, range of scores, credit bureaus, scoring models, and factors affecting their scores.  This form is typically available from credit reporting agencies, and many will send this directly to the consumer on the lenders' behalf.

===== Confusion with the scope of the Red Flags rule =====

Financial institutions faced a mandatory deadline of November 1, 2008, to comply with the Red Flags Rule,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redflagsfactact.com Red Flags Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; section 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act. However, due to widespread confusion over coverage under the act, specifically whether the term "creditor" applies to particular businesses, members of Congress repeatedly requested that FTC postpone the deadline for compliance with Section 315 until after December 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://ftc.gov/opa/2010/05/redflags.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Business Alert issued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/alerts/alt050.shtm FTC Business Alert], Federal Trade Commission, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the Red Flags Rule applies to a very broad list of businesses including "financial institutions" and "creditors" with "covered accounts". A "creditor" is defined to include "lenders such as banks, finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies and telecommunications companies". However, this is not an all-inclusive list.

The regulations apply to all businesses that have "covered accounts". A "covered account" includes any account for which there is a foreseeable risk of identity theft. For example, credit cards, monthly billed accounts like utility bills or cell phone bills, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, medical insurance accounts, and many others. This significantly expands the definition to include all companies, regardless of size, that maintain, or otherwise possess, consumer information for a business purpose. Because of the broad definitions in these regulations, few businesses will be able to escape these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/redflagsrule/faqs.shtm#B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protection and restoration of identity theft victim credit history ===
&lt;!-- Add summary of second title here --&gt;

==== Summary of rights of identity theft victims ====
Provisions in this title require that the Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Agency, "prepare a model summary of the rights of consumers ... with respect to the procedures for 
remedying the effects of fraud or identity theft...".  Beginning sixty days after the summary of these rights were established, all reporting agencies are required to provide a copy of this summary to any consumer that contacts an agency and states that he believes he has been a victim of fraud or identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress| title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|page=117 STAT. 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Blocking of information resulting from identity theft ====
The Act also allows requires any reporting agency to block the reporting of any information in a consumer's file that the consumer identifies as information that originated from an alleged identity theft.  Such agency must block the information within four days of receiving proof, a copy of an identity theft report, the identification of the information by the consumer, and a statement from the consumer that the information is not a result of any transaction he participated in.

Agencies are not required to block any information (and may rescind any existing blocks) in the case that the block was found to be made in error or based on erroneous information as provided by the consumer, or that the consumer "obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress| title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|pages=117 STAT. 1964–1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coordination of identity theft complaint investigations ====
This section requires that all consumer reporting agencies develop a means of communicating to each other consumer complaints regarding fraud or identity theft, or requests for fraud alerts or blocks.  Furthermore, the section requires that each consumer reporting agency release a report each year to the Federal Trade Commission of fraud alert requests and complaints involving fraud or identity theft received by the reporting agency.  Finally, the section requires the Federal Trade Commission to set up a means by which consumers can contact the reporting agencies and creditors with a complaint involving identity theft or fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ159.108|volume=Public Law 108-159|publisher=108th Congress| title=FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF 2003| accessdate=2009-02-02|page=117 STAT. 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
After its enactment, some consumer advocacy groups criticized the FACT Act claiming that it preempts some stricter and already-existing state regulations, and provides exceptions that are 'far too generous' to new regulations regarding disclosure of personal information by banks as found in the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singletary|first=Michelle|title=Somewhat More Fair And Increasingly Accurate|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2003-12-11|page=Financial; E03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, an article in [[The Washington Post]] criticized the difficulty in retrieving the credit reports in some of the states that were first eligible under the act.&lt;ref name="Free but not Easy"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Free, But Not So Easy; Another Try at Helping You Get That Credit Report|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2005-03-15|page=Outlook; B04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-emption of state laws ===
Vermont, Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California had all established laws by 1994 requiring credit bureaus to provide a free credit report on demand. However, according to U.S. Pirg, "[w]ith the FACT Act, the financial industry won its primary goal: permanent [[federal preemption|preemption]] of stronger state credit and privacy laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uspirg.org/uspirg.asp?id2=13649|date=June 2004|title=Mistakes Do Happen: A Look at Errors in Consumer Credit Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, state laws are preempted in certain areas, such as the content of a consumer report, the responsibilities of "furnishers", responses of consumer reporting agencies to disputes over inaccurate information (although there is an exception for statutes in place before 1996), and duties of those who take an adverse action based on a report.&lt;ref&gt;More S. (2006). [http://www.arma.org/bookstore/files/Moye2.pdf Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act: More Protection for Consumers]. The Information Management Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Difficulty in obtaining credit reports ===
An article dated March 13, 2005 and published in the Washington Post stated that while "[r]esidents of six East Coast states—Maryland, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont—are already eligible for free reports from all three agencies as a result of state laws", the phone numbers provided to request these reports connected to automated systems that the article described as "maddening in their complexity and unforgiving if your circumstances vary from the system's programming." Furthermore, the article criticised automated systems for forcing consumers to "navigate a thicket of recorded information -- including sales pitches for their products, such as a credit 'score' (an evaluation of your creditworthiness) or a 'monitoring' service to help guard against identity theft".&lt;ref name="Free but not Easy" /&gt; Since 2012, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has published a list of consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). It enables consumers to see which CRAs might be important to them and gives them the contact information of each CRA in the list, so consumers can more easily order their personal consumer reports. Many of the CRAs in the list provide personal reports to consumers for free. The 2016 edition of the list is available on the CFPB's [http://www.consumerfinance.gov website] [http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201604_cfpb_list-of-consumer-reporting-companies.pdf here].

===The Red Flag rule as a cause of identity theft===
As the Red Flag rule widely defines creditors, many businesses (such as utilities)&lt;ref name="utility"&gt;{{cite web |title=Start or Install Service |url = http://www.consumersenergy.com/content.aspx?ID=1240}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now required to collect personal information (such as [[Social Security number|SSN]] and driver's license numbers) that they do not need and have no use for.   This policy is precisely contrary to the FTC's advice to consumers that they should disclose their social security number to companies only when absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="ftcGuide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deter Minimize Your Risk |author=ftc.gov |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/deter.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013103252/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/deter.html |archivedate=2011-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of the Red Flag rule has the unintended consequences of increasing the number of businesses that hold consumers' Social Security numbers, thereby putting consumers at greater risk for identity theft through data theft.

Although FLC is based in Canada, its outreach is global with researchers located in many countries around the world. FLC’s mandate is to ensure family fishermen’ access to justice, to [[Marine Environmental Protection|protect our marine environment]], to help coastal communities become more resilient, and to assist consumers in accessing safe and sustainable seafood through research, education, and legal representation. The FLC family comprises highly passionate individuals committed to environmental, social, and [[Justice (economics)|economic justice]].

FLC's research is primarily focused on [[fisheries law]], that is, the legal analysis of [[fisheries management]] schemes, seafood laws, and [[aquaculture]] regulations. Their research projects on [[fisheries management]] schemes studies [[catch share]]s (e.g. [[Individual fishing quota|Individual Transferable quotas]]); [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fisheries]]. [[RFMO]]s, TURFs, and MPAs. Their seafood studies focuses on [[sustainable seafood]], sustainable and ecolabelling certification schemes, labelling requirement, traceability, and regulatory affairs. Their aquaculture studies primarily focus on fish feed regulations. FLC publishes a quarterly update on legal developments in fisheries law and runs one of the only fisheries law blogs.

In addition to conducting research, FLC offers [[internships]] and volunteer opportunities for aspiring [[fisheries law]] advocates. These internships provide students interested in fisheries law with lectures and workshops, as well as numerous opportunities to engage in in-depth conversations with fishermen and leaders in coastal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soliman|first=Adam|title=New Not-For-Profit Research Center: The Fisheries Law Centre|url=http://aglaw-assn.org/2013/07/new-not-for-profit-research-center-the-fisheries-law-centre/|publisher=Ag Law News|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, FLC offers continuing legal education (CLE) courses across North America.

A '''floating charge''' is a [[security interest]] over a fund of changing assets (e.g. stocks) of a [[company (law)|company]] or other [[artificial person]]. Unlike a fixed charge, which is created over ascertained and definite property, a floating charge is created over property of an ambulatory and shifting nature. Examples of such property are receivables and stocks. The floating charge {{clarify|date=March 2016|reason=|text=The floating charge 'floats' or 'hovers' until the point at which it is converted into a ''fixed charge.'' Once it becomes a "fixed charge" the charge attaches to the specific assets of the business. }} This conversion of the floating charge into a fixed charge (called "crystallisation") can trigger common law jurisdictions]] it is an [[implied term]] in security documents creating floating charges that a cessation of the company's right to deal with the assets (including by reason of [[liquidation|insolvency proceedings]]) in the ordinary course of business leads to automatic crystallisation.  Additionally, security documents will usually include express terms that a default by the person granting the security will trigger crystallisation.

In most countries floating charges can only be granted by companies, [[Limited liability partnership|LLPs]] or similar entities with [[separate legal personality]]. If an individual person or a [[partnership]]&lt;ref&gt;Although not a [[limited liability partnership]] with separate legal personality.&lt;/ref&gt; was to try to grant a floating charge, then in most jurisdictions which recognise floating charges this would be [[void (law)|void]] as a [[general assignment]] in [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, under English law, a general assignment of book debts by a natural person is [[void (law)|void]] as regards book debts that were not paid before the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, unless the assignment has been registered under the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] if the person goes into bankruptcy. See section 344(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Floating charges take effect in [[Equity (law)|equity]] only, and consequently are defeated by a [[bona fide purchaser|''bona fide'' purchaser for value without notice]] of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, so this is only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised.

==History==

The floating charge has been described as "one of equity's most brilliant creations."&lt;ref&gt;By [[Roy Goode]] writing in Getzler &amp; Payne, ''Company Charges - Spectrum and Beyond'' at page 11, {{ISBN|0-19-929993-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded English case where a floating charge was recognised was ''[[In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co]]'' (1870) 5 Ch App 318.  The use of such floating charges increased in popularity and expanded rapidly until, as [[Robert Walker, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe|Lord Walker]] described it: "The floating charge had become a cuckoo in the nest of corporate insolvency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants='''Re Spectrum Plus Ltd'''|year=2005|court=UKHL|num=41}} at paragraph 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of the effect of floating charges grew, until [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten]] finally proclaimed in {{Cite bailii|litigants=[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]|year=1896|court=UKHL|num=1|parallelcite=[1897] AC 22}}:&lt;ref&gt;At [1897] AC 22, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|For such a catastrophe as has occurred in this case some would blame the law that allows the creation of a floating charge. But a floating charge is too convenient a form of security to be lightly abolished. I have long thought, and I believe some of your Lordships also think, that the ordinary trade creditors of a trading company ought to have a preferential claim on the assets in liquidation in respect of debts incurred within a certain limited time before the winding-up. But that is not the law at present. ''Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is.'' (emphasis added)}}

This led to a push back against the effect of floating charges in the form of the [[Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897]].

==Definition==

:"A floating security is an equitable charge on the assets for the time being of a going concern.  It attaches to the subject charged in the varying condition in which it happens to be from time to time.  It is the essence of such a charge that it remains dormant until the undertaking ceases to be a going concern, or until the person in whose favour the charge is created intervenes.  His right to intervene may of course be suspended by agreement.  But if there is no agreement for suspension, he may exercise his right whenever he pleases after default."

Later in ''[[Illingworth v Houldsworth]]'' [1904] AC 355 at 358 he stated:

:"...a floating charge is ambulatory and shifting in nature, hovering over and so to speak floating with the property which it is intended to affect until some event occurs or some act is done which causes it to settle and fasten on the subject of the charge within its reach and grasp."

A description was subsequently given in ''[[Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association]]'' [1903] 2 Ch 284, and despite [[Mark Romer, Baron Romer|Romer LJ]] clearly stating in that case that he did not intend to give a definition of the term floating charge, his description is generally cited as the most authoritative definition of what a floating charge is:

* it is a charge over a class of assets present and future;
* that class will be changing from time to time; and
* until the charge crystallises and attaches to the assets, the chargor may carry on its business in the ordinary way.

When conducting a recent review of the authorities, in keeping with that tradition, in ''[[National Westminster bank plc v Spectrum Plus Ltd]]'' [2005] UKHL 41, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] elected instead to describe the essential characteristic of a floating charge rather than define it, and they described it thus:

:"the asset subject to the charge is not finally appropriated as a security for the payment of the debt until the occurrence of some future event. In the meantime the chargor is left free to use the charged asset and to remove it from the security."

==Recharacterisation==
In ''[[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited|National Westminster bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others]]'' [2005] UKHL 41 the House of Lords finally brought some clarity to this area of the law.  The essential test of whether a charge was a fixed charge related to the chargor's power to continue to deal with the asset.  In order to preserve the status of a charge as a fixed one, the bank must exercise actual control over disposal of the asset.  If the chargor is able to deal with the asset, such as by drawing from the account in which charged funds are kept, or into which the proceeds of trade receivables are deposited, then the holder of the charge does not have effective control.  The judges held that as this is inconsistent with the status of the charge as fixed (if the chargor company is able to use the proceeds in the ordinary course of its business without the consent of the charge holder), the charge could only take effect as a floating charge.

==Nature of the chargee's interest==
Several authors&lt;ref&gt;WJ Gough, Company Charges (2nd edn, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the floating chargee, prior to crystallisation, may have no proprietary interest at all in the charged assets. However, this is inconsistent with cases (such as ''[[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited|Spectrum]]'') at the highest level which suggest a proprietary interest does exist.

Alternatively, the floating chargee may have an inchoate type of proprietary interest, with characteristics that are proprietary but of a lesser order than the proprietary interest of a chargee with a fixed charge. Some authors have suggested that there is an interest in a fund of assets,&lt;ref&gt;R Goode, Legal Problems of Credit and Security (3rd edn, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the nature and incidents of the interest remain unclear. This has received some judicial support, from [[Robert Walker, Baron Walker of Gestingthorpe|Lord Walker]] in ''[[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited|Spectrum]]'', for example.

Another possibility is that the holder of a floating charge may have the same quality of proprietary interest as a fixed chargee, but one that is subject to defeasance&lt;ref&gt;S Worthington, Proprietary Interests in Commercial Transactions (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; or overreaching&lt;ref&gt;R Nolan, 'Property in a Fund' (2004)120 LQR 108&lt;/ref&gt; by permitted dealings by the chargor with the charged assets.

==History==
Historically, floating charges are a fascinating concept in that they are legal devices created entirely by lawyers in private practice; there is no legislation and no judicial decision that was the genesis of a floating charge. In 1862 in an apparently unconnected decision of ''[[Holroyd v Marshall]]'' (1862) 10 HL Cas 191 it was held that equity would recognise a charge over [[after-acquired property]] as being effective to create a security interest over that property automatically upon its acquisition.

This decision lead to "a further manifestation of the English genius for harnessing the most abstract conceptions to the service of commerce."&lt;ref&gt;''Commercial Law'', [[Roy Goode]], 2nd ed., at page 731&lt;/ref&gt;  Documents came to be drafted that purported to grant security over all of the debtor's present and future property, but by contract expressly permitted the debtor to dispose of those assets, free from the charge, until such times as the debtor's business ceased.  This charge came to be known as the "floating charge".

The first case in which a floating security device was tested and upheld came a mere eight years after ''Holroyd v Marshall'' in ''[[In re Panama, New Zealand, and Australian Royal Mail Co]]'' (1870) 5 Ch App 318; a remarkably quick gestation by any reckoning. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] held that the effect of the document was that the secured creditor could not interfere with the running of the business and its dealings with its own assets until the [[winding up]] of the company, but the occurrence of that event entitled the secured creditor to realise its security over the assets and to assert its charge in priority to the [[unsecured creditor|general body of creditors]].

Any residual concern about the efficacy of such charges were comprehensively ousted by the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1897] AC 22.

==Flexibility==

Floating charges are enormously popular as a security device for two principal reasons.  From the [[secured creditor|secured creditor's]] perspective, the security will cover each and every asset of the chargor.  From the charger's perspective, although all of their assets are encumbered, because the security "floats", they remain free to deal with the assets and dispose of them in the [[ordinary course of business]], thereby obtaining the maximum credit benefit from the lender, but without the inconvenience of requiring the secured creditor's consent to dispose of [[stock in trade]].

However, in many jurisdictions, floating charges are required to be registered in order to [[perfection (law)|perfect]] them; otherwise they may be unenforceable on the bankruptcy of the debtor.  This registration requirement has often led to other property rights (such as rights under a defective [[retention of title clause]]), which have been [[re-characterization|re-characterized]] as a floating charge being held to be [[void (law)|void]] for non-registration.

==Remedies==

Broadly speaking, holding a floating charge gives the secured creditor two key remedies in the event of non-payment of the secured debt by the company.  Firstly, the secured creditor can crystallise the charge, and then sell off any assets that the charge then attaches to as if the charge was a fixed charge.  Secondly (and more frequently the case, to preserve the company as a going concern), if the floating charge encompasses substantially all of the assets and undertaking of the company, the secured creditor can appoint an [[administrative receivership|administrative receiver]] to take over the management and control of the business with a view to discharging the debt out of income or selling off the entire business as a going concern.

In countries that permit the making of an [[administration order]], the floating charge had another key benefit.  The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block the appointment of a court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the assets of the company.  Practice became such that companies were asked to give "lightweight" floating charges to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in ''Re Croftbell Ltd'' [1990] BCC 781.  In the [[United Kingdom]] the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other [[common law]] jurisdictions.

===Crystallisation===
Strictly speaking, it is not possible to enforce a floating charge at all - the charge must first crystallise into a fixed charge.  In the absence of any special provisions in the relevant document, a floating charge crystallises either upon the appointment of a [[receivership|receiver]] or upon the commencement of [[liquidation]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Crompton &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1914] 1 Ch 954: "...I think there can be no question at all that according to ordinary principles the winding up puts an end to the period of suspension; and the reason that it does that is that the effect of the winding up is to put an end to the floating nature of the security" at 963&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested, relying upon ''[[obiter dictum]]'' comments by Lord Macnaghten in ''[[Government Stocks and Securities Investments Co Ltd v Manila Rly Co]]'' that a charge should also crystallise upon the company ceasing to trade as a [[going concern]].&lt;ref&gt;Lingard, ''Bank Security Documents'', 3rd ed. at para 9.19&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this view is not yet supported by judicial authority.&lt;ref&gt;Although in ''[[Robson v Smith]]'' [1895] 2 Ch 118 Romer J did assert that a company could deal with assets subject to a floating charge until it is wound up ''or stops business''. However, in ''[[Re Woodroffes (Musical Instruments) Ltd]]'' [1986] Ch 366 Nourse J he referred to earlier authorities assuming the cessation of business would cause crystallisation rather than deciding it.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain countries, notably Australia and New Zealand, it was for a time very common to include "automatic crystallisation" provisions which would provide that the floating charge would crystallise upon an event of default automatically and without action from the chargee.  Automatic crystallisation provisions have been upheld in New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Manurewa Transport]]'' [1971] NZLE 909&lt;/ref&gt; but there are judicial comments suggesting they may not be recognised as effective in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Referred to by [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffmann]] in ''[[Re Brightlife Ltd]]'' [1986] 3 All ER 673 at 678&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United Kingdom there is some inferential support for the validity of automatic crystallisation provisions,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Evans v Rival Granite Quarries Ltd]]'' [1910] 2 QB 979 Buckley LJ referred to an event occurring which "is defined as bringing to an end the licence of the company to carry on business".  In ''[[Re Bond Worth]]'' [[Christopher Slade|Slade J]] referred to "some other agreed event" as affecting crystallisation.&lt;/ref&gt; but they have never been subject to full judicial consideration.

==Priority==

The main purpose of any security is to enable the secured creditor to have priority of claim to the bankrupt party's assets in the event of an [[insolvency]].  However, because of the nature of floating charge, the priority of floating charge holder's claims normally rank behind:

# holders of fixed security (such as a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[fixed charge]]);&lt;ref&gt;This was confirmed in ''[[Wheatley v Silkstone &amp; Haigh Moor Coal Co]]'' (1885) 29 Ch D 715; because the disposition by the chargor (in creating the mortgage or fixed charge) is permitted by the concept of the floating charge, the grant of a mortgage or charge takes the relevant asset out of the pool of assets caught by the floating charge.&lt;/ref&gt; and
# [[preferential creditor]]s, who are given priority by statute.&lt;ref&gt;See for example in the [[United Kingdom]] section 175(2)(b) of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The floating charge cannot normally be enforced until it has crystallised (and thus, effectively, become a fixed charge) and so most statutes provide that the priority of a fixed charge that was created as a floating charge is treated as a floating charge.&lt;ref&gt;See for example section 29(a)(a) of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the differences in priority of fixed charges and floating charges, security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be fixed charges as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the [[preferential creditor]]s.  A number of judicial decisions&lt;ref&gt;Commencing with the decision of Slade J in ''[[Siebe Gorman &amp; Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd]]'' [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142&lt;/ref&gt; gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over [[Accounts receivable|book debts]] (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be "[[recharacterisation|recharacterised]]" as a floating charge).  The position was definitively resolved in ''[[NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited]]'' when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts.  This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor.  Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as floating charges, regardless of what label the parties had given them.

==Criticisms==

Floating charges have been criticised as a "raw deal" for [[unsecured creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/11/18/20218724.pdf|title=Developing the Asian Markets for Non-Performing Assets: Developments in India|work=Forum for Asian Insolvency Reform (FAIR) MAXIMISING VALUE OF NONPERFORMING ASSETS|date=10–11 Nov 2003|author=Sumant Batra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' [1897] AC 22 [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Lord Macnaghten]] observed that the injustice of the case (as he saw it) was not caused by the introduction of the concept of [[limited liability]], but by the excessive security created by the floating charge.  In ''Re London Pressed Hinge Co Ltd'' [1905] 1 Ch 576 Buckley J observed that great mischief arose from the very nature of the floating charge as few of general unsecured trade creditors of the company would even be aware of its existence.

As most secured lenders will not usually have recourse to their security until the debtor company is in a parlous financial state, the usual position is that even all the remaining assets of the company are not enough to repay the debt secured by the floating charge, leaving the unsecured creditors with nothing.  This perception has led to a widening of the classes of preferred creditors who take ahead of the floating charge holders in a number of countries.  The introduction of a regime of [[voidable floating charge]]s for floating charges taken just prior to the onset of insolvency is a partial response to these criticisms.

Some countries have also sought to "[[ring fence]]" recoveries made for [[wrongful trading]] or [[fraudulent trading]] from the floating charge to create an artificial pool of assets available to the unsecured creditors.

===Voidable floating charges===
{{main|Voidable floating charge}}

Because of the potential for abuse of a security interest that catches all of a company's assets, many jurisdictions have enacted provisions in their insolvency legislation providing that a floating charge granted shortly prior to the company going into liquidation will be invalid, or invalid to the extent that it does not secure new loans made to the company.

===Registration===
In many jurisdictions, because of their dramatic effect on the availability of assets to unsecured creditors on an insolvency, floating charges are required to be registered.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 860 of the Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogous security interests==

===United States===

An analogous (but not identical) concept in the [[United States]] to the floating charge is the '''[[floating lien]]''', which was implemented by Article 9 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]].

The U.S. never adopted the floating charge directly because at the time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a [[fraudulent conveyance]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard McCormack, ''Secured Credit under English and American Law'', (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property.  As it had become clear that creditors and debtors were going to find ways to create enforceable ''de facto'' security interests in after-acquired property and general intangibles whether courts liked it or not, the UCC drafters in the 1940s (particularly [[Grant Gilmore]]) successfully argued that such interests should be legitimized and simplified in the form of the floating lien.

A critical difference between the floating charge and the floating lien is that UCC security interests, including floating liens, can be granted by ''any'' kind of debtor, including individuals or partnerships (and will thus have priority in bankruptcy), whereas the floating charge can be granted only by corporate entities.

===Quebec===

When the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] came into force in 1994 and superseded the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]], it abolished the ''charge flottante'' "floating charge" and created and introduced an analogous security device into [[Quebec law]] under the name ''hypothèque ouverte'', or "floating [[mortgage]]". As a mortgage, it
*can be taken over immovables and movables (that is, real and personal property);
*must be in due form, i.e. passed before a [[civil law notary|notary]] and registered;
*confers [[ius in re|rights]] ''[[in rem]]'': priority ranking, right of pursuit (that is, it runs with the land and cannot be defeated by a bona fide purchaser), creditor's consent required to dispose of subject;
*grants powers of recourse: repossession, judicial foreclosure, sale by mortgagee in possession, or administrative receivership.

The floating mortgage can be specific or general with respect to immovables and movables, separately or together. The mortgage is not perfected until it crystallises. Crystallisation occurs upon default of the mortgagor and registration of a notice of default, and the mortgage ranks from the date notice is filed. This means that a floating mortgage ranks lower than a fixed mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;Vilaysoun Loungnarath, Jr., ''L'Endettement de l'entreprise au Québec : paramètres juridiques'', [pdf]: https://www.usherbrooke.ca/droit/fileadmin/sites/droit/documents/RDUS/volume_26/26-1-loungnarath.pdf, accessed 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil law countries===

[[civil law (system)|Civil law]] countries generally allow for a commercial [[pledge (law)|pledge]] to be taken over the pooled movable [[asset]]s held or acquired for the use of a [[business]] or [[income]]-producing activity ([[going concern]]) and not for sale. The pool is restricted to movable ([[personal property|personal]]) [[property]] of a long-term nature and of value to the operation of the business, or in other words:
*[[inventory]] (UK: stock);
* [[fixed asset]]s
** movable tangibles: [[fixture (property law)#Trade fixtures|trade fixtures]], equipment, machinery, tools, furniture; and
** [[intangible asset|legal intangible]]s: company style (name), [[logo]]s, [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]], [[intellectual property]], [[lease]]s.

The pledge never crystallises like a floating charge; instead the pool is a ''universitas rerum'' and treated as a single movable security subject. The asset pool is referred to as a ''[[:fr:fonds de commerce|fonds de commerce]]'' (French), ''[[:es:Fondo de comercio|fondo de comercio]]'' (Spanish),  ''fondo di commercio'' (Italian), ''Geschäftsfonds'' (German), ''handelsfonds'' (Dutch), and so on.

Besides the class of assets secured, the civilian commercial pledge differs from a floating charge in that fixed assets are not always changing, and the creditor ranks prior to all secured and unsecured claims.&lt;ref&gt;Al Tamimi &amp; Company, ''Banking &amp; Security Law in the UAE'', [brochure], p. 24: http://www.tamimi.com/files/Legal%20Brochures/BaningandSecurityLaw.pdf, accessed 23 Sept. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial pledges exist in [[common law]] countries but are usually taken over working capital ([[current asset|floating asset]]s and [[investment]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4710">'''Green building in South Africa''' is overseen by The Green Building Council of South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbcsa.org.za/ Green Building Council of South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; (launched 2007) which has developed Green Star SA rating tools, based on those developed by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbcaus.org/ Green Building Council of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; tools, to provide the property industry with an objective measurement for [[green building]]s and to recognize and reward environmental leadership in the property industry. Each Green Star SA rating tool reflects a different market sector (e.g. office, retail, multi-unit residential, etc.). The first tool developed was Green Star SA - Office which was published in pilot form for public comment in July 2008, with final version 1 release at the Green Building Council of South Africa Convention &amp; Exhibition ’08 on 2–4 November 2008.

South Africa is in the process of incorporating an energy standard (SANS 204)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sabs.co.za/ SANS 204]&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to provide energy-saving practices as a basic standard in the South African context.

Green Building Media (launched in 2007) has also played an instrumental role in green building in South Africa, through their informational portal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuilding.co.za/ Green Building Journal of South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128083356/http://www.greenbuilding.co.za/ |date=2009-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as their monthly Green Building e-Journal of South Africa, which is sent to professionals within the [[built environment]]. They currently hold two annual events which focusing on [[sustainability]]; the Green Building Conference and a Retrofitting Seminar.

Dorah Modise is the CEO of the Green Building Council South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gbcsa.org.za/about/board-members/ GBCSA]&lt;/ref&gt; Ms Modise took over the reins from outgoing CEO Brian Wilkinson in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://propertywheel.co.za/2016/10/gbcsa-welcomes-dorah-modise-as-new-ceo/ PropertyWheel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==EDGE South Africa==
A new green building certification programme has been brought to South Africa thanks to the [https://www.gbcsa.org.za Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA)] and its partnership with World Bank Group member, the [[International Finance Corporation|International Finance Corporation (IFC)]].

The GBCSA in Cape Town (15 September 2014) the launch of the [http://www.edgebuildings.com “EDGE” rating system], to be utilised for homes in South Africa. The launch comes in the wake of the GBCSA’s hugely successful My Green Home education and awareness campaign for the greening of homes, in addition to a detailed market research study jointly led by IFC and the GBCSA on the potential need and impact of EDGE in the South African market.

[http://www.edgebuildings.com EDGE], which stands for “Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies,” seeks to help facilitate a transformation of the property sector in rapidly urbanising countries by influencing design considerations. To achieve the EDGE standard, minimum savings of 20% energy, water, and embodied energy in materials must be met.

The goal of [http://www.ifc.org/edge IFC’s EDGE programme] is to help build capacity for developers, banks, and governments to mainstream resource-efficient buildings in rapidly growing economies around the world. With EDGE, builders can assess the most cost-effective ways of bringing green features into their designs, financiers can offer better terms to developers and green mortgages for homeowners, and governments can do their part through incentives and improved regulations.

EDGE has been adapted for the local South African context, especially in light of the SANS 10400 Part XA energy efficiency building code. This code was promulgated for all new buildings in 2011.

Since 2009, IFC has invested more than $600 million in green buildings, including homes, commercial buildings, hotels, and hospitals, both directly and through financial partners. IFC has also provided regulatory advice to the governments of Colombia, Panama, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. As part of its climate strategy, IFC has developed EDGE to encourage resource-efficient building design by proving the business case for building green.

'''{{USBill|113|hr|1003}}''', long title "To improve consideration by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of the costs and benefits of its regulations and orders" is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]]. H.R. 1003 would broaden the items for the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) to consider when assessing costs and benefits of a proposed regulation.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt; Further, the bill would require the agency to adopt such a regulation only if it determines that the estimated benefits justify the estimated costs.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=1003sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1003 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1003|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 1003 would amend the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] to revise the requirement that the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC), before promulgating a regulation or issuing an order, consider the costs and benefits of the action.&lt;ref name="1003sum"/&gt; The bill would require the CFTC, through the Office of the Chief Economist, to: (1) assess the costs and benefits, both qualitative and quantitative, of an intended regulation; and (2) propose or adopt a regulation only on a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs.&lt;ref name="1003sum"/&gt;

The bill also lists additional mandatory considerations for the CFTC to evaluate in making a reasoned determination of the costs and the benefits, including the impact on market liquidity in the futures and swaps markets, as well as alternatives to direct regulation.&lt;ref name="1003sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
{{cbo summary}}&lt;ref name=cbo1003&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1003|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44051|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 1003 would broaden the items for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to consider when assessing costs and benefits of a proposed regulation.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt; Further, the bill would require the agency to adopt such a regulation only if it determines that the estimated benefits justify the estimated costs.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt;

Based on information from the CFTC, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1003 would cost $28 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt; Enacting H.R. 1003 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt;

H.R. 1003 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo1003"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
H.R. 1003 was introduced into the House by [[Mike Conaway|Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R, TX-11)]] on March 6, 2013.&lt;ref name=1003allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1003 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1003/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture]], which held hearing about the bill on March 14, 2013.&lt;ref name="1003allactions"/&gt;  Committee consideration and markup were held on March 20, 2013, when it was ordered to be reported by [[voice vote]].&lt;ref name="1003allactions"/&gt;  The House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] placed the bill on the House Schedule on September 13, 2013 for consideration under a suspension of the rules on September 17.&lt;ref name=leadersschedule&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule - Week of September 16, 2013|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/9-16-13.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=16 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930194454/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/9-16-13.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peteSept13&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=A closer look at next week...

==Debate and discussion==
H.R. 1003 was supported by several trad organizations including the [[Agricultural Retailers Association]], the [[Business Roundtable]], the [[National Association of Corporate Treasurers]], the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], and the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]]. Together they wrote a joint letter in support of the bill arguing that they support "the strong policy imperative for transparent economic analysis as part of the rulemaking process, even for independent regulators, and this legislation will ensure the CFTC balances the costs with the benefits before issuing rulemakings and orders."&lt;ref name=BusRoundLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Reps. Conaway &amp; Scott Supporting H.R. 1003|url=http://businessroundtable.org/resources/letter-to-reps.-conaway-scott-supporting-h.r.-1003|publisher=Business Roundtable|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Schott Stevens]], the President and CEO of the [[Investment Company Institute]] (ICI), Rep. Conaway sponsored H.R. 1003 in reaction to "significant criticism" of the CFTC's inadequate cost-benefit analysis.&lt;ref name=ICIletter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schott Steven|first1=Paul|title=Re: H.R. 1062, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act|url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/13_ici_sec_accountability_act.pdf|publisher=Investment Company Institute|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism was leveled both by Congress and by the CFTC's own commissioners.&lt;ref name="ICIletter"/&gt; According to Stevens, "given the significantly increased volume of rulemaking by the CFTC in recent years, we agree it is critical that the agency be required to conduct a thorough and thoughful analysis of the costs and benefits of its proposed regulations."&lt;ref name="ICIletter"/&gt;

Proponents of the bill argued that it would improve the quality of the rules passed by the CFTC by forcing the CFTC to do more through cost benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=CRSonCFTC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Rena S.|title=The Commodity Futures Trading Commission: Background and Current Issues|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43117.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=17 June 2014|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the bill feared it would make it easier for industry groups to challenge the rules made by the CFTC in court.&lt;ref name="CRSonCFTC"/&gt; They also expressed concern that the costs of such rules are often easier to quantify than the proposed benefits, which could lead to costs being overestimated.&lt;ref name="CRSonCFTC"/&gt;

Outside North America, such organizations are usually called [[police]] services. In North America, some of these services are called police, others are known as [[sheriff]]'s offices/departments, while investigative police services in the United States are often called [[Government agency|bureaus]], for example the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

==Jurisdiction==
[[Image:ACTPol-AFP officers &amp; patrol car.jpg|thumb|left|A [[police officer]] and a [[police car]] are traditional identifiers of a locally based law enforcement agency.]]

LEAs which have their ability to apply their powers restricted in some way are said to operate within a [[jurisdiction]].

[[Image:Europol-members-map.png|thumb |right |Non executive powers jurisdictional coverage of [[Europol]]]]LEAs will have some form of geographic restriction on their ability to apply their powers. The LEA might be able to apply its powers within a country, for example the [[United States|United States of America]]'s [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], within a division of a country, for example the [[Australia]]n state [[Queensland Police]], or across a collection of countries, for example [[international organization]]s such as [[Interpol]], or the [[European Union]]'s [[Europol]].

LEAs which operate across a collection of countries tend to assist in law enforcement activities, rather than directly enforcing laws, by facilitating the sharing of information necessary for law enforcement between LEAs within those countries, for example [[Europol]] has no executive powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Europol#Functions|Europol functions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a LEA’s jurisdiction is determined by the complexity or seriousness of the non compliance with a law. Some countries determine the jurisdiction in these circumstances by means of policy and resource allocation between agencies, for example in [[Australia]], the [[Australian Federal Police]] take on complex serious matters referred to it by an agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Federal Police Investigation Services|publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]]|url=http://www.afp.gov.au/services/investigation.html|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Federal Police Case Categorisation and Prioritisation Model|publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]]|url=http://www.afp.gov.au/services/operational_priorities/how_the_ccpm_is_applied.html|accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the agency will undertake its own investigations of less serious or complex matters by consensus, while other countries have laws which decide the jurisdiction, for example in the [[United States|United States of America]] some matters are required by law to be referred to other agencies if they are of a certain level of seriousness or complexity, for example cross state boundary kidnapping in the [[United States]] is escalated to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref name="usckidnappinf"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|18|1201}}(a)(1) {{See also|Federal Kidnapping Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation of jurisdiction based on the seriousness and complexity of the non compliance either by law or by policy and consensus can coexist in countries.

A LEA which has a wide range of powers but whose ability is restricted geographically, typically to an area which is only part of a country, is typically referred to as {{anchor|locpol}}'''local [[#police|police]]''' or '''[[Territorial police force|territorial police]]'''. Other LEAs have a jurisdiction defined by the type of laws they enforce or assist in enforcing. For example, [[Interpol]] does not work with political, military, religious, or racial matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpol Constitution Article 3|publisher=[[Interpol]]|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/LegalMaterials/constitution/constitutionGenReg/constitution.asp|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080224183329/http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/LegalMaterials/constitution/constitutionGenReg/constitution.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-02-24|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A LEA’s jurisdiction usually also includes the governing bodies they support, and the LEA itself.

===Organization and structure===
Jurisdictionally, there can be an important difference between international LEAs and multinational LEAs, even though both are often referred to as "international", even in official documents. An {{anchor|internat}}'''international law enforcement agency''' has jurisdiction and or operates in multiple countries and across [[Sovereign state|State]] borders, for example [[Interpol]].

A {{anchor|multinat}}'''multinational law enforcement agency''' will typically operate in only one country, or one division of a country, but is made up of personnel from several countries, for example the [[European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annex 11 of the Dayton/Paris Agreement |publisher=[[NATO]] |url=http://www.nato.int/ifor/gfa/gfa-an11.htm |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Establishment of EUPM personnel by country |publisher=[[European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] |url=http://www.eupm.org/Documents/Weekly.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-07 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512182026/http://www.eupm.org/Documents/Weekly.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; international LEAs are typically also multinational, for example [[Interpol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interpol member countries |publisher=[[Interpol]] |url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/Icpo/Members/default.asp |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but multinational LEAs are not typically international.

Within a country, the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies can be organized and structured in a number of ways to provide law enforcement throughout the country. A law enforcement agency’s jurisdiction can be for the whole country or for a division or sub-division within the country.

====Within divisions of a country====
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
{{See also|State police}}
LEA jurisdiction for a division within a country can typically be at more than one level, for example at the division level, that is state, province, or territory level, and for example at the sub division level, that is county, shire, or municipality or metropolitan area level. In Australia for example, each state has its own LEAs. In the United States for example, typically each state and county or city has its own LEAs.

As a result, because both Australia and the United States are federations and have federal LEAs, Australia has two levels of law enforcement and the United States has multiple levels of law enforcement, Federal, Tribal, State, County, City, Town, Village, special Jurisdiction and others.

====Division into operations areas====
Often a LEA’s jurisdiction will be geographically divided into operations areas for administrative and logistical efficiency reasons. An operations area is often called a '''command'''&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Police"&gt;{{cite web |title=Metropolitan Police Local Information|publisher=[[Metropolitan Police]] |url=http://www.met.police.uk/local |accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an '''office'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation Your Local FBI Office |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm |accessdate=2008-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815093807/http://www.fbi.gov/contact/fo/fo.htm |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State and Regional AFP Offices |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/contact.html#State |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the operations area of a LEA is sometimes referred to as a jurisdiction, any LEA operations area usually still has legal jurisdiction in all geographic areas the LEA operates, but by policy and consensus the operations area does not normally operate in other geographical operations areas of the LEA. For example, the [[United Kingdom]]’s [[Metropolitan Police]] is divided into 32 Borough Operational Command Units, based on the [[London borough]]s,&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Police"/&gt; and the [[New York City Police Department]] is divided into 77 precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Police Department Precincts|publisher=[[New York Police Department]] |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/precincts.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EnglandPoliceNumbered.png|thumb |right |[[List of police forces in the United Kingdom#England|Police agency division within England]]]]Sometimes the one legal jurisdiction is covered by more than one LEA, again for administrative and logistical efficiency reasons, or arising from policy, or historical reasons. For example, the area of jurisdiction of English and Welsh law is covered by a number of LEAs called '''constabularies''',  each of which has legal jurisdiction over the whole area covered by English and Welsh law, but they do not normally operate out of their areas without formal liaison between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom#Jurisdictions and territories]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of police forces in the United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary difference between separate agencies and operational areas within the one legal jurisdiction is the degree of flexibility to move resources between versus within agencies. When multiple LEAs cover the one legal jurisdicition, each agency still typically organises itself into operations areas.

In the [[United States]] within a state's legal jurisdiction, county and city police agencies do not have full legal jurisdictional flexibility throughout the state, and this has led in part to mergers of adjacent police agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Policing in the United States#Local policing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal and national====
When a LEA’s jurisdiction is for the whole country, it is usually one of two broad types, either federal or national.

=====Federal responsibilities=====
When the country has a [[federation|federal]] [[constitution]], a whole-of-country LEA is referred to as a {{anchor|fedlea}}'''federal law enforcement agency'''.

The responsibilities of a federal LEA vary from country to country. Federal LEA responsibilities are typically countering fraud against the federation, immigration and border control regarding people and goods, investigating currency counterfeiting, policing of airports and protection of designated national infrastructure, national security, and the protection of the country’s [[head of state]] and of other designated very important persons, for example the Protective Service of the [[Australian Federal Police]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protective Service |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/services/protective.html |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Protective Mission of the [[United States Secret Service]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Secret Service Protective Mission |publisher=[[United States Secret Service]] |url=http://www.secretservice.gov/protection.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806201356/http://www.secretservice.gov/protection.shtml |archivedate=2002-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).

A {{anchor|fedpol}}'''federal police agency''' is a federal LEA which also has the typical [[#police|police]] responsibilities of social order and [[public safety]] as well as federal law enforcement responsibilities. However, a federal police agency will not usually exercise its powers at a divisional level. Such exercising of powers is typically via specific arrangements between the federal and divisional governing bodies.

Examples of federal law enforcement agencies are the [[Australian Federal Police]] ([[Australia]]), [[Federal Police of Brazil]] ([[Brazil]]), [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] ([[India]]), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]], [[United States Park Police]] ([[United States]]), [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] ([[Canada]]), and the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] ([[Nigeria]]).

A federated approach to the organisation of a country does not necessarily indicate the nature of the organisation of law enforcement agencies within the country. Some countries, for example [[Federal Police (Austria)|Austria]] and [[Law enforcement in Belgium|Belgium]], have a relatively unified approach to law enforcement, but still have operationally separate units for federal law enforcement and divisional policing. The [[United States]] has a highly fractured approach to law enforcement agencies generally, and this is reflected in [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|American federal law enforcement agencies]].

=====Relationship between federal and federated divisions=====
In a federation, there will typically be separate LEAs with jurisdictions for each division within the federation. A federal LEA will have primary responsibility for laws which affect the federation as whole, and which have been enacted by the governing body of the federation.

Members of a federal LEA may be given jurisdiction within a division of a federation for laws enacted by the governing bodies of the divisions either by the relevant division within the federation, or by the [[federation]]'s governing body. For example, the [[Australian Federal Police]] is a federal agency and has the legal power to enforce the laws enacted by any [[Australia]]n state, but will generally only enforce state law if there is a '''federal aspect''' to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australian Federal Police Act |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/afpa1979225/s4aa.html |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically federal LEAs have relatively narrow police responsibilities, the individual divisions within the federation usually establish their own police agencies to enforce laws within the division. However, in some countries federal agencies have jurisdiction in divisions of the federation.

This typically happens when the division does not have its own independent status and is dependent on the federation. For example, the [[Australian Federal Police]] is the police agency with jurisdiction in [[Australia]]’s dependent territories, Jervis Bay Territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jervis Bay Governance and Administration |publisher=Australian Government Attorney General’s Department.|url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_JervisBay_JervisBayGovernanceandAdministration |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocos Islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cocos Islands Governance and Administration |publisher=Australian Government Attorney General’s Department |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_Cocos(Keeling)Islands_CocosIslandsGovernanceandAdministration |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212154903/http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_Cocos(Keeling)Islands_CocosIslandsGovernanceandAdministration |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic Territory, and Christmas Island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christmas Island Governance and Administration |publisher=Australian Government Attorney General’s Department |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_ChristmasIsland_ChristmasIs.GovernanceAdministration |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) is a federal agency and is the sole police agency for [[Canada]]’s three [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]], [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Yukon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policing in the Territories |publisher=Government of Yukon Department of Justice |url=http://www.justice.gov.yk.ca/pdf/Pan_Territorial_Police_Review.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228094809/http://www.justice.gov.yk.ca/pdf/Pan_Territorial_Police_Review.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this is a direct jurisdictional responsibility and is different from the situation when a governing body makes arrangements with another governing body's LEA to provide law enforcement for its subjects. This latter type of arrangement is described under [[#Establishment and constitution of law enforcement agencies|Establishment and constitution of law enforcement agencies]].

Some federations escalate non compliance with laws with divisional or federal laws which involve multiple divisions within the federation to a federal LEA. The [[United States]] for example escalates kidnapping&lt;ref name="usckidnappinf"/&gt; to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].

In [[Australia]], states liaise directly with each other when non compliance with laws crosses state boundaries. Some countries provide law enforcement on land and in buildings owned or controlled by the [[federation]] by using a federal LEA, for example the [[United States]]’s [[Department of Homeland Security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Code Title 40 Subtitle I Chapter 13 Section 1315 |publisher=[[United States Congress]] |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+40USC1315 |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for some aspects of federal property law enforcement.

Other countries, for example [[Australia]], provide law enforcement for federal property via federal LEAs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bills Digest No 152 2001-02&amp;nbsp;– Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/LIBRARY/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd152.htm |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the LEAs for the division of the federation in which the property is located.

Typically LEAs working in different jurisdictions which overlap in the type of law non compliance actively establish mechanisms for cooperation and even establish joint operations and joints task forces.&lt;ref name="usfbifaq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation About Us Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACT Policing&amp;nbsp;– Media Release&amp;nbsp;– Joint Drug Operation a Success |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]]|url=http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/2250/02092005_327.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-05|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airport Security&amp;nbsp;– Joint Airport Teams |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/national/airport_security |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Referring Matters to the AFP&amp;nbsp;– Information Required |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/services/referrals.html |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, members of a LEA working outside of their normal jurisdiction on joint operations or task force are sworn in as special members of the host jurisdiction.

=====National responsibilities=====
A {{anchor|natlea}}'''national law enforcement agency''' is a LEA in a country which does not have divisions capable of making their own laws. A national LEA will have the combined responsibilities that federal LEAs and divisional LEAs would have in a [[federation|federated]] country.

National LEAs are usually divided into [[#Division of law enforcement agency jurisdiction into operations areas|operations areas]].

A {{anchor|natpol}}'''national police agency''' is a national LEA which also has the typical [[#police|police]] responsibilities of social order and public safety as well as national law enforcement responsibilities. Examples of countries with national police agencies are [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]] and [[Nicaragua]].

To help avoid confusion over jurisdictional responsibility, some federal LEAs explicitly advise that they are not a national law enforcement agency, for example the [[United States]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] does this.&lt;ref name="usfbifaq"/&gt;

==Types==
LEAs can be responsible for the enforcement of laws affecting the behaviour of people or the general community, for example the [[New York City Police Department]], or the behaviour of commercial organisations and corporations, for example the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]], of for the benefit of the country as a whole, for example the [[United Kingdom]]’s [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]].

===Religious law enforcement===
A LEA can be responsible for enforcing [[Secularity|secular]] law or religious law, for example [[Sharia]] or [[Halakha]]. The significant majority of LEAs around the world are [[Secularity|secular]], their governing bodies separating religious matters from the governance of their subjects. Religious law enforcement agencies, for example [[Saudi Arabia]]’s [[Mutaween]], exist where full separation of government and religious [[doctrine]] has not occurred, and are generally referred to as police agencies, typically {{anchor|relpol}}'''religious police''', because their primary responsibility is for social order within their jurisdiction and the relevant social order being highly codified as laws.

===Internal affairs===
Often, a LEA will have a specific [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal unit]] to ensure that the LEA is complying with relevant laws, for example the [[United States]]’ [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s Office of Professional Responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Investigations |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/factsfigure/internal.htm |accessdate=2008-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109095200/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/factsfigure/internal.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries or divisions within countries, specialised or separate LEAs are established to ensure that other LEAs comply with laws, for example the [[Australia]]n state [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption]]. LEA internal self compliance units and external LEA compliance agencies coexist in many countries. Names given to LEA internal self compliance units are typically, Internal Affairs, Internal Investigations, Professional Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Borough Support Management Information Main Report&amp;nbsp;– March 2007

===Police agencies===
Many law enforcement agencies are [[police]] agencies that have a broad range powers and responsibilities. A {{anchor|police}}'''police''' agency, however, also often has a range of responsibilities not specifically related to law enforcement. These responsibilities relate to social order and public safety. While this understanding of policing, being more encompassing than just law enforcement has grown with and is commonly understood by society, it is recognised formally by scholars and academics.&lt;ref name="polref"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first= George F. |year=2004 |title=The American System of Criminal Justice |author2=Smith, Christopher E.  |publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; A police agency’s jurisdiction for social order and public safety will normally be the same as its jurisdiction for law enforcement.

===Military law enforcement===
Military organisations often have law enforcement units. These units within armed forces are generally referred to as {{anchor|milpol}} '''[[military police]]'''. This may refer to:

* {{anchor|provost}} a section of the [[military]] solely responsible for policing the [[armed forces]] (referred to as '''[[Provost (military police)|provosts]]''')
* {{anchor|gendarm}} a separate section of the [[armed forces]] responsible for policing in the armed forces and in the [[Ministry of Defence|ministry of defence]] such as the [[Żandarmeria Wojskowa]]
* a section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (such as the [[Romanian Gendarmerie]])
* the preventative police (with military status) of a [[Brazilian state]] ([[Military Police (Brazil)|Polícia Militar]])

[[Image:Officers_of_polish_military_police.jpg|thumb|right|Two military police officers and a [[four-wheel drive]] [[police car]] from the Żandarmeria Wojskowa ([[Poland]])]]

The exact usage and meaning of the terms ''Military'', ''military police'', ''provost'', and [[Gendarmerie|''gendarmie'']] varies from [[country]] to country.

Non-military law enforcement agencies are sometimes referred to as {{anchor|civpol}}'''civilian police''', but usually only in contexts where they need to be distinguished from military police. However, they may still possess a military structure and protocol.

In most countries, the term ''law enforcement agency'' when used formally includes agencies other than only police agencies. The term ''law enforcement agency'' is often used in the [[United States|United States of America]] to refer to police agencies, however, it also includes agencies with [[peace officer]] status or agencies which [[prosecute]] criminal acts. A county prosecutor or district attorney is considered to be the chief [[law enforcement officer]] of a county.

===Other responsibilities===
Other responsibilities of LEAs are typically related to assisting subjects to avoid non compliance with a law, assisting subjects to remain safe and secure, assisting subjects after a safety impacting event. For example:
*policing&lt;ref name="polref" /&gt;
**social order
***public incident mediation
***pre-empting anti social behaviour
***dangerous event public logistics
**public safety
***general search and rescue
***crowd control
*regulation
*services and facilities
*disaster victim identification
*education and awareness campaigns
**victim prevention and avoidance
**law compliance
**public safety

Many LEAs have administrative and service responsibilities, often as their major responsibility, as well as their law enforcement responsibilities. This is typical of agencies such as [[customs]] or [[tax]]ation agencies, which provide services and facilities to allow subjects to comply with relevant laws as their primary responsibilities.

====Private law enforcement====

[[Private police]] are law enforcement bodies that are owned or controlled by non-governmental entities. Private police are often utilized in places where public law enforcement is seen as being under-provided. For example, the San Francisco Patrol Special Police, which still exist today. It is argued that Private Law Enforcement may serve as a superior alternative to a government monopoly law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Stringham 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=Private Governance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stringham 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=Anarchy and the Law: The Political Economy of Choice|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers for The Independent Institute|isbn=978-1-41280-579-7|url=http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=67|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regulation====
{{Main article|Regulatory authority}}
Many LEAs are also involved in the monitoring or application of [[regulation]]s and codes of practice. See, for example, [[Australian Commercial Television Code of Practice]], [[building code]], and [[code enforcement]]. Monitoring of the application of regulations and codes of practice is not normally considered law enforcement. However, the consistent non-compliance by a subject with regulations or codes of practice may result in the revocation of a [[licence]] for the subject to operate, and operating without a licence is typically illegal. Also, the failure to apply codes of practice can impact other subjects’ safety and life, which can also be illegal.

==Establishment and constitution==
Typically a LEA is established and constituted by the governing body it is supporting, and the personnel making up the LEA are from the governing body’s subjects, for example the [[Australian Federal Police]] is established and constituted by virtue of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/afpa1979225 |title=Austlii.edu.au |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Definition, federal LEAs can only be established by the governing body of the relevant [[federation]], divisional and sub divisional LEAs can only be established by their relevant governing bodies, and national LEAs can only be established by the national governing body of a country.

For reasons of either logistical efficiency or policy, some divisions with a country will not establish their own LEAs but will instead make arrangements with another LEA, typically from the same country, to provide law enforcement within the division. For example, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) is a federal agency and is contracted by most of [[Canada]]'s [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and many municipalities to police those divisions, even though law enforcement in [[Canada]] is constitutionally a divisional responsibility. This arrangement has been achieved by formal agreement between those divisions and the RCMP and reduces the number of agencies policing the same geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization of the RCMP |publisher=[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] |url=http://www.rcmp.ca/about/organi_e.htm |accessdate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611002342/http://www.rcmp.ca/about/organi_e.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) is a federal agency and is the contracted police agency for the [[Australian Capital Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACT Policing |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/act.html |accessdate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127071930/http://www.afp.gov.au/act.html |archivedate=2010-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norfolk Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norfolk Island Policing |publisher=[[Norfolk Island]] Government |url=http://www.norfolk.gov.nf/police.htm |accessdate=2008-02-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071124142825/http://www.norfolk.gov.nf/police.htm |archivedate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circumstances where a country or division within a country is not able to establish stable or effective LEAs, typically police agencies, the country might invite other countries to provide personnel, experience, and organisational structure to constitute a LEA, for example the [[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]] which has a Participating Police Force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAMSI's Program Areas: Law and Justice |publisher=[[Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands]] |url=http://www.ramsi.org/node/16#law |accessdate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802135140/http://www.ramsi.org/node/16 |archivedate=August 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; working in conjunction with the Solomon Islands Police Force, or where the [[United Nations]] is already providing an administrative support capability within the country, the [[United Nations]] may directly establish and constitute a LEA on behalf of the country, for example for [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]] from 1999 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)|publisher=[[United Nations]]|url=https://www.un.org/peace/etimor/etimor.htm|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and law exemptions==
{{Main article|Law enforcement agency powers}}
{{POV section|date=May 2012}}
To enable a LEA to prevent, detect, and investigate non compliance with laws, the LEA is endowed with powers by its governing body which are not available to non LEA subjects of a governing body. Typically, a LEA is empowered to varying degrees to:
*collect information about subjects in the LEA's jurisdiction
*intrusively search for information and evidence related to the non compliance with a law
*seize evidence of non compliance with a law
*seize property and assets from subjects
*direct subjects to provide information related to the non compliance with a law
*arrest and detain subjects, depriving them of their liberty, but not incarcerate subjects, for alleged non compliance with a law
*lawfully deceive subjects
These powers are not available to subjects other than LEAs within the LEA's jurisdiction and are typically subject to judicial and civil overview.

Usually, these powers are only allowed when it can be shown that a subject is probably already not complying with a law. For example, to undertake an intrusive search, typically a LEA must make an argument and convince a judicial officer of the need to undertake the intrusive search on the basis that it will help detect or prove non-compliance with a law by a specified subject. The judicial officer, if they agree, will then issue a legal instrument, typically called a [[Search warrant]], to the LEA, which must be presented to the relevant subject if possible.

===Lawful deception and law exemption===
{{globalize/Australia | section |date=February 2010}}
Subjects who do not comply with laws will usually seek to avoid detection by a LEA. When required, in order for the LEA to detect and investigate subjects not complying with laws, the LEA must be able to undertake its activities secretly from the non complying subject. This, however, may require the LEA to explicitly not comply with a law other subjects must comply with. To allow the LEA to operate and comply with the law, it is given lawful exemption to undertake secret activities. Secret activities by a LEA are often referred to as '''covert operations'''.

To deceive a subject and carryout its activities, a LEA may be lawfully allowed to secretly:
*Create and operate false identities and personalities and organisations, often referred to as '''under cover''' operations or '''assumed identities''', for example [[Australia]]’s [[Australian Federal Police]] by virtue of Part 1AC of the Crimes Act 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482|title=CRIMES ACT 1914|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Allow and assist the illicit movement of licit and illicit substances and wares, sometimes partially substituted with benign materials, often referred to as '''controlled operations''', for example [[Australia]]’s LEAs by virtue of Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482|title=CRIMES ACT 1914|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Listen to and copy communications between subjects, often referred to as '''telecommunications interception''' or '''wire tapping''' when the communication medium is electronic in nature, for example the [[United States]]'s [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] by virtue of United States Code 18 Title 18 Part I Chapter 119 Section 2516,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+18USC2516|title=US Government Printing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Australia]]’s LEAs by virtue of Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taaa1979410/|title=TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION AND ACCESS) ACT 1979|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intrusively observe, listen to, and track subjects, often referred to as '''technical operations''', for example [[Australia]]’s LEAs by virtue of the  Surveillance Devices Act 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda2004210|title=SURVEILLANCE DEVICES ACT 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
to typically collect information about and evidence of non compliance with a law and identify other non complying subjects.

Lawful deception and utilisation of law exemption by a LEA is typically subject to very strong judicial or open civil overview. For example, the [[Australian Federal Police]]'s controlled operations are subject to open civil review by its governing body, the [[Parliament of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Controlled Operations Annual Report 2006-07 |publisher=[[Australian Federal Police]] |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/61384/ControlledOps07Senate.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-04 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090519180135/http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/61384/ControlledOps07Senate.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Controlled Operations Inspections Report 2005-06 |publisher=Commonwealth Ombudsman |url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/commonwealth/publish.nsf/content/publications_inspectionreports |accessdate=2008-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204100212/http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/commonwealth/publish.nsf/Content/publications_inspectionreports |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other exemptions from laws===
Law enforcement agencies have other exemptions from laws to allow them to operate in a practical way. For example, many jurisdictions have laws which forbid animals from entering certain areas for health and safety reasons. LEAs are typically exempted from these laws to allow dogs to be used for search and rescue, drug search, explosives search, chase and arrest, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Australian Federal Police Act 1979 |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/afpa1979225 |accessdate=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of exemption is not unique to LEAs. [[Guide dog|Sight assist dogs]] are also typically exempted from [[Guide dog#Accessibility|access restrictions]]. Members of LEAs may be permitted to openly display firearms in places where this is typically prohibited to civilians, violate various traffic laws when responding to crimes, or detain persons against their will to investigate suspected crimes.

[[Interpol]] is an international organisation and is essentially stateless, but must operate from some physical location. Interpol is protected from certain laws of the country where it is physically located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpol Headquarters Agreement|publisher=[[Interpol]]|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/LegalMaterials/constitution/hqagreement/hqagreement.asp|accessdate=2008-02-01 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011211054211/http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/LegalMaterials/constitution/hqagreement/hqagreement.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2001-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement agencies and society==
{{See also|Law enforcement and society|Crime fiction}}
Because the enforcement of laws has, by definition, a major impact on the society the laws apply to, the agencies which enforce the laws have a specific relevance to the societies in which they operate.

Some LEAs have been immortalised in history, literature, and popular media, for example the United Kingdom's [[Scotland Yard]], the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]

A small number of LEAs, particularly [[secret police]] forces which are unaccountable or have unrestricted powers, are not generally respected by their governing bodies’ subjects, due to the negative impact they have on the subjects.

Many fictional LEAs have been created in popular media and literature. See for example [[List of fictional secret police and intelligence organizations]] and [[List of fictional institutions#Police forces|List of fictional police forces]].

      <comment>Moving from [[Category:Electoral fraud]] to [[Category:Electoral fraud in the United Kingdom]] using [[c:Help:Cat-a-lot|Cat-a-lot]]</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="154800">In the [[United Kingdom]], an '''election petition''' is the only way that the result of an election can be questioned. The [[Parliamentary Elections Act 1868]] transferred the jurisdiction for determining an [[election petition]] from Parliament to the courts. The table lists all those petitions which came to trial.

==Glossary==
* '''Agent''': Anyone acting directly or indirectly on behalf of the candidates; not merely the [[election agent]] but anyone employed by them. Many cases turned on whether a person proved to have carried out illegal activity was an agent (voiding the election) or was acting independently.
* ''' 'Bribery, etc.' ''': It was routine for election petitions in the 19th century brought on grounds of bribery also to make accusations of treating and undue influence. Some petitions were apparently written using boilerplate text.
* '''Day''': Election Cases in 1892 and 1893. By Samuel H. Day. London: Stevens and Sons Ltd, 1894.
* '''Duly elected''': The court upheld the election, and declared the sitting Member the rightful winner. One of four possible outcomes of a petition trial; coloured green in the table.
* '''Fitzgerald''': The judgments of Mr Baron Fitzgerald, in the cases of the election petitions for the boroughs of Limerick, Belfast, and Cashel. 1869.
* '''HCP''': House of Commons Papers. Until 1911 the House of Commons published the judgments of most election courts in the sessional papers. The year of the session is given and the number of the paper, followed by the relevant pages in the case where multiple judgments are in a single paper.
* '''O'M &amp; H''': O'Malley and Hardcastle's Reports on Election Petitions. London: Stevens &amp; Haynes. 7 vols, 1870-1929.
* '''[[Personation]]''': One person knowingly voting in the name of another.
* '''Petitioner''': The person or people bringing the petition and challenging the election.
* '''Recriminatory case''': Where a petition was presented by a defeated candidate claiming to have been the rightful winner (and not that the election be declared void), it was open to the Respondent to bring forward accusations against their election campaign.
* '''Relief''': If certain aspects of election law have been broken through inadvertence, it is possible for those involved to be relieved from the consequences of breaking the law. The effect of relief is as if the breach of the law never occurred.
* '''Respondent''': The defendant in the case. The elected MP was always a respondent; if procedural irregularity was alleged, the Returning Officer could be added.
* '''Scrutiny of votes''': A process where the votes were recounted, the eligibility of each voter was checked, and ineligible votes struck off.
* '''Special case''': Where the dispute in an election petition concerned the law and not the facts, it was referred to three Judges of the High Court (England and Wales), the Court of Session (Scotland) or the High Court of Northern Ireland.
* '''[[Treating]]''': The act of giving free food and drink with intent to persuade the recipient to vote for a particular candidate.
* '''Undue election''': The court found that the person who was elected had not won the election, but that another candidate had the majority of lawful votes, and therefore declared the other candidate elected. One of four possible outcomes of a petition trial; coloured red in the table.
* '''Undue influence''': Any attempt to win votes by threats.
* '''Void election''': The court found that the election had not been conducted fairly, and annulled the result. This meant that the seat was vacant and another election had to be held to fill it. One of four possible outcomes of a petition trial; coloured purple in the table.
* '''Withdrawn''': The judges allowed the petitioner to withdraw the case, and the election result stood. As petitioners might be induced to withdraw a petition by a further act of corruption, the judges had to give permission on the basis that they were satisfied no corrupt consideration was involved. One of four possible outcomes of a petition trial; coloured yellow in the table.

Marks' subscription of 5gs. to help costermongers fight a ban on placing stalls was legitimate. Free drinks at a smoking concert were paid by the Irish Unionist Alliance and not by Marks. A campaign statement that Benn had "a skeleton in his cupboard" was not made by an agent of Marks. A recriminatory case failed when it accused Benn of false statements of fact failed because the leaflet in question was published before the Act came into force; the case did establish that Benn's payment for linen banners was illegal.

The editor of the ''Western Daily Mail'' had successfully pressed Harris to advertise in the paper; the bill had been paid by Harris's private secretary (not an agent) but when it was realised that it was election spending the money was refunded and then paid by the agent. Harris's statements accusing his opponent [[Sir Albert Spicer, 1st Baronet|Albert Spicer]] of living off the profits of cheap foreign labour and giving ammunition to the enemies of England were false statements of fact about Spicer's personal character. || 5 O'M &amp; H 166; HCP 1902 44

A separate court judgment shortly before the election had ordered the removal of freeholders of [[Haverfordwest]] from the electoral register of this constituency, but the election had taken place using the old register; because it was still current, the 28 freeholders who cast votes were entitled to do so. At that point the petitioners applied to withdraw the petition and Laurie also applied to withdraw a counter-petition alleging corruption; the court allowed both applications. || 5 O'M &amp; H 135; HCP 1902 42

Agar-Robartes had held a series of meetings from 1903 onwards to make himself known; the Judges disagreed about whether their costs were election expenses. Agar-Robartes had regularly gone to pubs around the constituency and bought everyone a round of drinks, sometimes with his election agent; this was corrupt treating. A garden party given by Agar-Robartes' parents had 4,000 attendees; Agar-Robartes' election agent used it to campaign for his election, so it too was corrupt treating. || 5 O'M &amp; H 225

He gave each voter between two and five shillings. When one of Fell's campaign workers was told about it, he challenged Baker, who denied doing so; Baker was allowed to continue using the cart. The Judges disagreed on whether Baker was an agent of Fell for the purposes of election law; they needed to agree to avoid the election. An almanac distributed by Fell on Christmas Day was not returnable as an election expense. Meetings and smoking concerts organised by Fell's local association from 1904, at which free drink was distributed, were not election expenses and did not constitute corrupt treating. A party for the retiring MP for the seat openly advertised in local newspapers where some whisky was given was not corrupt treating. || 5 O'M &amp; H 176; HCP 1906 169

An elderly voter who had been brought by car to vote but missed the lift back was given his railway fare back home, but after the polls had closed; this did not constitute bribery. A "mad freak of [a] man" named Tyrer who had seized some of Castlereagh's leaflets and gone out waving them, calling for support for Castlereagh, and throwing money down from a balcony was not authorised by the campaign. Castlereagh was not adopted as a candidate until 27 December 1905 and his spending before then was not election expenses. || 5 O'M &amp; H 200

A workman on the family estates was sacked in what the Judges suspected was a demonstration to other workers of the need for political loyalty. 400 allotment holders, who were being evicted by the estate which wanted building land, were allowed to stay after a campaign by a political supporter of Guest, but this action did not appear to be corrupt. Estate agents were outside polling booths watching voters; this was lawful. The Judge did not believe claims of direct bribery. A large number of cars were used to drive voters to the polls, including by Lady Wimborne; their cost was election expenses. Pamphlets defending the Guest family should have been counted for election expenses, which took the total over the maximum. || 6 O'M &amp; H 22; HCP 1910 158

Clerks working for Furness's firm were allowed to help on election day, a Saturday, but the work was voluntary and therefore their salary was not election expenses. £5 of postage stamps was not returned as election expenses, which took the amount over the maximum, but the Judges gave relief.

There may have been personated votes cast, but O'Sullivan's campaign was not involved. Speeches by O'Sullivan had not threatened violence against his opponents. A crowd led by an agent of O'Sullivan's had threatened a group of Murphy's supporters, preventing them from voting; other voters were intimidated against going to the polls.

An "eccentric and irresponsible person" had offered a bribe unconnected with Donelan. Personation was not proved. Donelan ought not to have supplied food to people attending his meetings but it was not corrupt. Donelan's campaign had paid for vehicles to convey voters to the polls and also hired special trains. The account book of the campaign spending was said to have been routinely destroyed; the Judges found that it was deliberately destroyed to prevent illegal payments being proved; the submitted return must have been false. || 6 O'M &amp; H 318; HCP 1911 204

A vote with "Up, Duke!" in addition to a cross in Duke's box was held bad because the voter might be identified. A voter who had moved into a house previously occupied by someone with the same surname, and voted in the name of the previous occupier, was entitled to do so because he was eligible to register. A voter who had voted twice in two different wards had one vote struck. A voter whose son was employed on election day was entitled to vote. Five people employed on St. Maur's campaign had voted and their votes were struck; a recriminatory case succeeded in striking off two votes from people employed by Duke's campaign and one whose son was employed.

However he took the Mayoralty before becoming a candidate, and the entertaining was not done with a corrupt intention to influence voters.

Only 12 ballot papers were exposed, and those accidentally. An unemployed voter was offered a job with the Dundalk Urban District Council by a councillor allied to Hazleton; this was bribery. Several voters were treated by police officers. Mobs under the control of agents of Hazleton threatened voters; this was undue influence. Campaign workers were illegally employed by the United Irish League rather than the agent. Two motor cars were apparently hired but there was no proof of the contract.

Several dubious ballot papers were held good. A voter said to have admitted he was employed by Lewisham's agent did not prove that he was, so his vote was good. The employment of a voter's 22-year-old son in the election did not invalidate his vote. A voter who was employed and who had cast a spoilt ballot did not mean that a good vote should be disallowed. People working for an advertising company contracted to post Lewisham's posters, and those paid as sandwich-board men, were not employed on the campaign and their votes were good. A voter paid for carrying a torch in a torchlight procession, and the organiser of the procession, had their votes struck. Other people who had worked on the campaign had their votes struck.

The return also omitted £6 6s. 6d. on hire of motor cars, the salary of a woman organiser, and the hire of a room for election work. £4 for the hire of cars on election day was illegal hiring.

The Judges found that the return was deliberately understated: an advertising bill of £91 2s. 0d. was returned as £72 17s. 7d.; printing costing £53 19s. 9d. was returned as £48 11s. 9d.; post cards costing £72 17s. 0d. were said to cost £40. The cost of distributing the post cards, £41 13s. 4d., was not returned when it ought to have been. A bill for printing from the ''Oxford Chronicle'', originally £181 9s. 0d., was dishonestly reduced to £118 6s. 0d; a special edition of the paper costing £20 was also election expenses. The agent had deducted £4 from a bill for stationery in respect of items returned unused on which a refund was given; he was not entitled to do so. Various other items, including £2 for rent of committee rooms, and £15 7s. for two women and a youth working on the election, were added. Some payments were not made through the election agent.

He promised a firework display and celebration if Moses won, while threatening to close the club if Moses lost. However, no voter gave evidence that they were influenced in their vote by his actions, and he was not acting as Moses' agent when he spoke to the boys, so it was not bribery. Moses had tried to stop Ballard distributing a circular in his support, so he was not responsible for it and it was rightly excluded from the return of election expenses. A taxi was hired to help take voters to the polls by a sub-agent, which was illegal, but the agent was unaware and the Judges granted relief to those involved as they had broken the law through inadvertence.

Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home|Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home]] KT || Expenses incurred without authority of election agent; False return of election expenses || Duly elected || The [[BBC]] and [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]] had made television [[Party political broadcast|broadcasts]] in which Douglas-Home had appeared as a party leader, on which they incurred costs. Because the broadcasts were aimed at the whole of the country, they were not aimed at promoting the election of Douglas-Home in the constituency, so the cost of the broadcasts were not election expenses. || ''Scots Law Times'', 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;186

The omission of Morgan from a list of candidates published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was unfortunate but only an irritation, and did not amount to a false statement of fact on the part of Maclean. Claims that [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|Viscount Whitelaw]] exercised undue influence in supporting Maclean were "an enormous impertinence" which should never have been made. || ''Cumberland and Westmorland Herald'', 24 December 1983 p.&amp;nbsp;1

The return of election expenses had not included £703.25 of printing and advertisements, £40 for minibus hire, and £88.12 for public address system hire. A discount given on advertising in the ''Irish News'', and spending on election surveys, were not election expenses. Bills settled through the treasurer of the constituency council were still made through the election agent; however not all bills were settled within the time limit. Both Hendron and Kelly applied for relief on the grounds that the breaches were inadvertent; in the circumstances of the pressure on Kelly and his ignorance of the law, the court granted relief on all items. || [1993] NI QBD 177

A special case determined that the possibility that the failure to stamp the ballot papers resulted from errors by the returning officer's staff meant that the result could not be certain. || ''The Times'', 2 October 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2

The presiding officer stopped issuing ballot papers at 10 PM, but was then confronted by the crowd and supporters of Gildernew who demanded to be able to vote. The presiding officer, described as "petrified" by one of the police on duty, gave way and allowed 15-20 people to vote before being ordered by the area electoral office to stop. Because the number of ballot papers issued was less than Gildernew's majority of 53, election was still conducted substantially according to law. || [http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2001/2001%20NIQB%2036/j_j_CARF3507.htm 2001 NI QB 36]

In another polling station there was an excess of 8 votes; the Judges rejected claims that they had been surreptitiously added, and decided that they had not been accurately recorded. Another box had missed a single vote, so there were only 3 unaccounted additional votes; there were innocent explanations which could explain them. Connor had not identified four votes which he contended ought not to have been counted for Gildernew, so the challenge could not be sustained. Two votes claimed to be on poor quality paper and therefore counterfeit could not be traced. When the third recount produced the same result as the second recount, the Returning Officer was right to refuse a fourth recount. As the 3 unaccounted additional votes were less than Gildernew's majority, the result would not have been affected. || [http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2010/2010%20NIQB%20113/j_j_MOR7979Final.htm 2010 NIQB 113]

All three statements were false statements of fact about Watkins which attacked his personal character, and Woolas did not believe them to be true. A rhetorical question asking whether Watkins' campaign had been funded by illegal and undeclared foreign donations was also a false statement of fact attacking Watkins' personal character, but Woolas may have had reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. Woolas subsequently sought a [[judicial review]] of the findings, and was granted permission to bring the action; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled that the statement that Watkins had reneged on a promise to live in the constituency concerned his political actions and did not therefore come under the Act, but upheld the other two statements and the avoidance of the election. || [https://web.archive.org/web/20101121175647/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/judgment-oldham-election-05112010.pdf 2010 EWHC 2702 (QB)]; [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120601204028/http%3A//www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/judgment%2Dwoolas%2D031210.pdf 2010 EWHC 3169 (Admin)]

The '''Lord Eliot Convention''', or simply the '''Eliot Convention''' or '''Eliot Treaty''' ({{lang-es|Convenio Lord Eliot}}), was an April 1835 agreement brokered by [[Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans]] between the two opposing sides of the [[First Carlist War]].  It had as its aim not to end the war itself but to end the indiscriminate executions by [[firing squad]] that had been committed by both sides. 

Edward Eliot had become Secretary of Legation at [[Madrid]] on 21 November 1821 and was styled ''Lord Eliot'' in 1826.&lt;!--not 1823, death of first earl?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;With the death of his uncle, his [[William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St Germans|father succeeded as second Earl of St Germans]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executions==
During the First Carlist War, which began in 1833, Carlist prisoners who did not accept [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] as their sovereign were executed by firing squad.  

Early Isabeline executions include that of [[Santos Ladrón de Cegama]] on October 14, 1833 at [[Pamplona]].  On December 4, 1833, [[Vicente Genaro de Quesada]], captain-general of [[Old Castile]], executed five Carlists by firing squad at [[Burgos]].  The prisoners were given four hours to prepare for death, though the [[archbishop of Burgos]] requested, on December 6, 1833, that in future prisoners be given twenty-four hours to prepare for death.  Quesada responded to this with: "...it would be pointless one way or another how much time we give before executing them" ("''...será inútil la menor o mayor concesión de tiempo para ejecutarlos''").&lt;ref&gt;''La Aurora de España''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Carlists also began to execute their prisoners in this way, because they wanted to perform reprisals against the enemy, and due to limited space at their disposal with which to house their prisoners.  Not being able to take their prisoners with them on mountain campaigns, for example, the Carlists executed their prisoners before moving to a new location.  Liberal soldiers found hiding in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Alegría de Álava]] (October 27, 1834), for example, were shot or bayoneted on sight.,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Walton (writer)|William Walton]], ''The Revolutions of Spain, from 1808 to the End of 1836'' (R. Bentley, 1837), 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the Liberal commander during that battle, [[Manuel O'Doyle]], was executed by firing squad on October 28, 1834.

A notorious incident was the execution of 118 Isabeline prisoners by the Carlists at the town of [[Heredia, Spain|Heredia]] (in [[Spain]], called ''Fusilamientos de Heredia'') by the order of [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]]. 

[[Baldomero Espartero|Espartero]] complained at [[Bilbao]] about the barbaric executions of the war, stating that it was prudent for the government to regulate the treatment of prisoners between the two opposing sides, in accordance with practices enacted between two opposing countries, "according to the general laws concerning the rights of men and of war."&lt;ref&gt;''Panorama'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==British intervention==
The issue was discussed by the [[British government]], which decided to send a commission to ensure that both sides reach an agreement to suppress these indiscriminate executions, and Lord Eliot and Colonel [[John Gurwood]] were appointed as commissioners.  One historian has written that "the reciprocal massacre of prisoners had several times occurred, and the deadliest hatred and revenge was manifestly encouraged by both parties; in short, so savagely was the Spanish contest carried on, that the duke of Wellington, from motives of humanity, sent Lord Elliott and Colonel Gurwood on a mission to Spain, to endeavour to put a stop to the cruelties practiced by the belligerents, and render the war less bloody and revengeful."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bill, ''The History of the World'' (1854), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;  

"They spoke perfect [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and appeared to be admirably prepared for the job for which they were appointed, due to their conciliatory manner and their understanding of the country [i.e. Spain], which one man had acquired through the course of his diplomatic career, while the other through the course of his military career."&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, p.232&lt;/ref&gt;  Lord Eliot was described as "a person of graceful demeanor, of gentle and elegant proportions, thirty-four years old, and of modest dress, without any adornment.  Colonel Gurwood accompanied him as secretary, and wore a uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Zaratiegui, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival of Lord Eliot and Gurwood at Spain==
Lord Eliot arrived on April 5, 1835 at [[Bayonne]], and got in touch with [[Francisco Espoz y Mina]], commanding general of the Isabeline forces and based at Pamplona.  Lord Eliot informed Espoz y Mina that he wished to communicate also with [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]], and requested that Isabeline forces not stop him from doing so.  Espoz y Mina had a British observer for the Isabeline army, a man named Wilde, escort Eliot and Gurwood across the border into Spain.  On the way to escort the two men, Wilde met with Zumalacárregui and had dinner with the Carlist general on April 20, 1835 at [[Eulate]].  This gave Wilde an opportunity to tell Zumalacárregui about Eliot and Gurwood and their mission.    

Eliot and Gurwood arrived at [[Segura (Guipúzcoa)|Segura]] on April 20, 1835 and met with Don Carlos.  Don Carlos sent them to the quarters of Zumalacárregui, who would negotiate the convention.  Eliot and Gurwood left Segura on April 23 and reached [[Alsasua]]; they were escorted by Colonel Serradilla.

==The agreement==
[[Image:Zumalacárregui-Magues.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Tomás de Zumalacárregui]]
Meanwhile, the [[battle of Artaza]] (April 20–22, 1835) had occurred, resulting in the defeat of the Isabeline troops under [[Gerónimo Valdés]], who took refuge at [[Estella - Lizarra|Estella]].  

Zumalacárregui stationed himself at the valley of [[Berrueza]] (''valle de la Berrueza'') and met with Lord Eliot there.  Zumalacárregui agreed fairly quickly to the accord.  The agreement was signed by Zumalacárregui on April 24 at [[Asarta, Spain|Asarta]]; this act thereby spared the lives of 27 Isabeline prisoners who were about to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, p.232.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lord Eliot wished to have an autograph of Zumalacárregui; the Carlist general, meanwhile, wrote that "at Asarta, located in the valley of Berrueza, celebrated for the various battles that have occurred there during this century, I had the honor to receive Lord Eliot on April 25, 1835, Lord Eliot - Tomás de Zumalacárregui."&lt;ref&gt;Zaratiegui, p.321.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a gift, Lord Eliot gave Zumalacárregui a [[telescope]] that [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] had used during the [[War of Spanish Independence]]; the telescope is conserved today at the Museo Militar in Madrid.    

The British commissioners traveled with Zumalacárregui from Asarta to Estella in search of the Isabeline general Gerónimo Valdés, in charge of the operations in the north of Spain after the resignation of Espoz y Mina, to sign the agreement.  On the way there, they stopped at a convent at [[Irache]]; Zumalacárregui reported that at Irache "there were some very beautiful nuns who made an excellent chocolate."&lt;ref&gt;Henningsen, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Eliot did not find Valdés at Estella, but found him instead at [[Logroño]].  Valdés was not happy with the text that had been signed by Zumalacárregui, and made changes that he considered prudent.  He signed the agreement at Logroño on April 27, 1835.  A Carlist colonel who had accompanied the British commissioners to Logroño brought back the new text to Zumalacárregui, who signed the newly worded agreement on April 28, 1835 at Eulate.
[[Image:Gerónimo Valdés.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jerónimo Valdés]]
The Convention contained the following nine stipulations:&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Hertslet]] (ed.), ''The Map of Europe by Treaty'' (Butterworths: 1875), 957-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

*1.	Preservation of Lives of Prisoners
*2.	Periodical exchange of Prisoners
*3.	Number of Prisoners exchanged to be equal.
*4.	Exchange according to Rank
*5.	Towns selected for detention of Prisoners to be respected.
*6.	Political Prisoners to be tried in conformity with the Laws.
*7.	Sick and Wounded to be respected
*8.	Stipulations to be binding in all Provinces of the Monarchy.
*9.	Strict observance of Convention.

Article Six specifically stated:

{{blockquote|During the present contest, no person, whoever he may be, civil or military, shall be deprived of life on account of his Political Opinions, without having been previously tried and condemned in conformity with the Laws, Decrees, and Ordinances in force in Spain.  This is only to be understood in reference to those who are not in reality Prisoners of War; for as regards them, the stipulations contained in the preceding Articles shall be binding.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hertslet (ed.), ''The Map of Europe by Treaty'' (Butterworths: 1875), 957-8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The treatment of prisoners of the First Carlist War was thus regulated.  The positive effects were immediate.  A soldier of the [[British Legion (1835)|British Legion]] wrote that:

{{blockquote|The British and [[Chapelgorris]] who fell into their hands [the Carlists], were mercilessly put to death, sometimes by means of tortures worthy of the North American Indians; but the Spanish troops of the line were saved by virtue, I believe, of the Eliot treaty, and after being kept for some time in prison, where they were treated with sufficient harshness, were frequently exchanged for an equal number of prisoners made by the Christinos.&lt;ref&gt;Charles William Thompson, ''Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment'' (Oxford University, 1836), 129.&lt;/ref&gt;}}   

[[Charles Frederick Henningsen]], who had served with the Carlists, dedicated his book, ''Twelve Months' Campaign with Zumalacárregui'', to Lord Eliot, whom he described as "one of the very few who have in any way interfered in the civil strife now desolating Spain, whose name will not be a curse to her people, but on whose head the blessings of all ranks of Spaniards will be showered."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Frederick Henningsen, ''The Most Striking Events of a Twelvemonth's Campaign with Zumalacarregui'' (E. L. Carey &amp; A. Hart, 1836), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, though “it was mutually agreed upon to treat the prisoners taken on either side according to the ordinary rules of war, a few months only elapsed before similar barbarities were practiced with all their former remorselessness.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bill, ''The History of the World'' (1854), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tables use readily available [[climate]] data and simple calculations to give design guidelines, in a manner similar to a [[spreadsheet]], as opposed to detailed [[Computer-aided design|thermal analysis or simulation]]. There are six tables; four are used for entering climatic data, for comparison with the requirements for [[thermal comfort]]; and two for reading off appropriate design criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jt8BvpULmK8C&amp;dq=%22using+the+mahoney+tables%22&amp;as_brr=3

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rough outline of the table usage is:

# '''Air [[Temperatures]]'''. The max, min, and mean temperatures for each month are entered into this table.
# '''[[Humidity]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]], and [[Wind]]'''. The max, min, and mean figures for each month are entered into this table, and the conditions for each month classified into a ''humidity group''.
# '''Comparison of Comfort Conditions and Climate'''. The desired max/min temperatures are entered, and compared to the climatic values from table 1. A note is made if the conditions create ''heat stress'' or ''cold stress'' (i.e. the building will be too hot or cold).
# '''Indicators''' (of humid or [[arid]] conditions). Rules are provided for combining the stress (table 3) and humidity groups (table 2) to check a box classifying the humidity and aridity for each month. For each of six possible indicators, the number of months where that indicator was checked are added up, giving a yearly total.
# '''Schematic Design Recommendations'''. The yearly totals in table 4 correspond to rows in this table, listing schematic design recommendations, e.g. 'buildings oriented on east–west axis to reduce sun exposure', 'medium-sized openings, 20%–40% of wall area'.
# '''Design Development Recommendations'''. Again the yearly totals from table 4 are used to read off recommendations, e.g. 'roofs should be [[Thermal mass (Building)|high-mass]] and well insulated'.

The '''Merchant Shipping Act 1988''' c.12 was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. It aimed to prevent foreign fishing fleets from fishing in British territorial waters. In the [[Factortame case]], its provisions in Parts I and II, Registration of British Ships, were disapplied by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] when they were found to conflict with [[European Community law]] and the [[Common Fisheries Policy]].  Part II dealt only with '''fishing vessels''' and was found to be repugnant by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The subsequent definition of British Ships is found in the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995]].

'''''Payne v. Tennessee''''', 501 U.S. 808 (1991), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case which held that testimony in the form of a [[victim impact statement]] is admissible during the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] phase of a [[trial]] and, in [[death penalty]] cases, does not violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Payne v. Tennessee|volume=501|page=808|pin=|year=1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Payne'' narrowed two of the Courts' [[precedent]]s: ''[[Booth v. Maryland]]'' (1987) and ''[[South Carolina v. Gathers]]'' (1989).

==Background==
Pervis Tyrone Payne was the [[defendant]] in this trial prosecuted in [[Tennessee]]. On Saturday, June 27, 1987, he attempted to [[rape]] an acquaintance of his, Charisse Christopher, and finally he murdered her and her two-year-old daughter, Lacie. Neighbors heard noises and yelling, and called the police.  Upon arriving, a police officer "immediately encountered Payne who was leaving the apartment building, so covered in blood that he appeared to be 'sweating blood'".

The police found "a horrifying scene." Forty-two stab wounds were on Charisse's body, and Lacie and Nicholas, Charisse's son, had suffered stab wounds as well. Payne fled to his girlfriend's house, and discarded his clothes, which were soaked in blood. Meanwhile, Nicholas Christopher held in his intestines while the emergency medical technicians transported him to the [[emergency room]]. There was significant physical evidence implicating the defendant: Payne's fingerprints on cans of malt liquor, the victims' blood soaked into his clothes, and his property left at the scene of the crime.

Dozens of witnesses, including the [[police]], friends, the neighbors, and [[expert witness|experts]], testified at the trial. The evidence that he perpetrated the attacks was "overwhelming," according to Chief Justice Rehnquist. Payne denied the charges, claiming he came upon the bloody victims. The district attorney stressed, in his closing arguments, the senselessness of the killings, the violence displayed by the defendant, and the innocence of the victims. The jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree [[murder]] and two counts of attempted murder and a related charge.

At the sentencing phase, the judge allowed both the [[public defender]] to adduce mitigating testimony from the defendant's friends and family, and the [[district attorney]] (DA) to introduce evidence from the grandmother/mother of the victims. Payne appealed to the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], and then asked for a ''[[writ of certiorari]]'' from the United States Supreme Court. ''Certiorari'' was granted, with the Court noting that it would have to reconsider its past precedent. The case was argued on April 24, 1991 and decided on June 27, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Facts are re-worded from the decision, ''q.v.'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=501&amp;page=808 Findlaw.com]. Retrieved September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court held that testimony on the form of a victim impact statement was admissible and constitutional in death penalty cases, thus expressly overruling two prior cases, ''[[Booth v. Maryland]]'' (1987) and ''[[South Carolina v. Gathers]]'' (1989).

Writing for the Court, [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]] provided a number of reasons for the decision:
# The sentencer has the right to consider all relevant evidence, within the rules of evidence.
# The principle that the punishment should fit the crime is relevant here, and this was a particularly aggravated and savage murder.
# ''Stare decisis'' is "not an inexorable command", and the Supreme Court, since ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803), has decided what the law ''is''.
# Because the defendant has the right to present mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase, the prosecution should be able to present aggravating evidence about the victim (Justice Stevens, in dissent, characterizes this argument as a non sequitur: the defendant has constitutional rights because he is on trial - the victim is not on trial and has no constitutional rights in the proceeding).
# The trial was fair in all respects, and mitigating evidence ought to be presented with damaging evidence when available.

[[John Paul Stevens|Justices Stevens]] and [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]] wrote dissenting opinions, with [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] joining each of them.&lt;ref name=Victims&gt;"Victims of Crime - Victims' Rights" on [http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/451/Victims-Crime-VICTIMS-RIGHTS.html Library Index website].

==Impact==
''Payne'' has had a significant, ongoing impact in victim's rights, [[criminology]], and the lives of the parties involved.

The case allowed victim impact statements in U.S. courts, and the overwhelming majority of states now allow such use in the sentencing phase of trials, and was a significant development in the victims' rights movement.&lt;ref name=Victims /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rehnquist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/12859/Payne-v-Tennessee.html Case Brief at JRank.org].

{{quote|Among the most significant products of the Victim's Rights Movement over the past decade has been the revival of the use of victim impact evidence—evidence relating to the victim's personal characteristics and the emotional impact of the crime on others--during capital sentencing. With its decision in Payne v.

Another scholar calls the verdict in ''Payne'' an example of "[[symbolic violence]]."&lt;ref name=Symbolic&gt;Wood, Jennifer K, "Refined raw: The symbolic violence of victims' rights reforms," ''[[College Literature]]'', Winter 1999, found at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_199901/ai_n8849488/pg_7 BNet FindArticles.com].

{{Quote|Rehnquist's reliance on this image of the perpetrator as a rabid animal that is foaming at the mouth helps to justify the violence of Payne's death sentence while it also obscures that violence. The majority opinion in Payne, like the prosecutor's arguments before the jury, hinges on contrasting little Nicholas to Pervis Payne, juxtaposing Nicholas's smallness and vulnerability to Payne's murderous and inhuman power. The smaller and more innocent the victim, the stronger and more guilty the defendant appears.|Jennifer K. Wood &lt;ref name=Symbolic /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7059">{{for|a son of Vakhtang V of Kartli|Prince Luarsab of Kartli (died 1698)}}
'''Luarsab''' ({{lang-ka|ლუარსაბი}}, died 1652) was a member of the [[Bagrationi dynasty]] of [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484–1762)|Kartli]], a great-grandson of King [[Luarsab I of Kartli|Luarsab I]] and relative of the childless King [[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]], who adopted him and made him heir apparent in 1639. Luarsab also married Rostom's niece by whom he had a son. Luarsab was killed while on a hunt. A homicide was immediately suspected. The suspect was [[Trial by combat|tried by single combat]] and wounded, but acquitted by virtue of being a victor in the duel.

== Family background ==
Luarsab was a son of Prince Teimuraz-Mirza of Kartli ({{floruit}} 1600) and his wife, an anonymous daughter of Prince David [[Bagration-Davitishvili]]. He had a brother, Vakhtang (Rostom-Mirza; died 1655). He was a scion of all three royal branches of the Bagrationi dynasty; through his father, Luarsab was a great-grandson of King Luarsab I of Kartli and, through his mother, he descended from the [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakhetian]] and [[House of Bagrationi of Imereti|Imeretian]] royal families. The 18th-century Georgian chronicler [[Prince Vakhushti]] erroneously identifies Luarsab as "son of Vakhtang, son of [[Simon I of Kartli|King Simon]]", who was Luarsab I's son.&lt;ref name="brosset1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brosset|first=Marie-Félicité|author-link=Marie-Félicité Brosset|title=Histoire de la Géorgie depuis l'Antiquité jusqu'au XIXe siècle.

== Biography ==
Luarsab was Muslim, living in [[Isfahan]], the capital of the [[Safavid dynasty|Iranian Safavids]]. In 1639, he was adopted and designated as heir apparent to the throne of Kartli by his father’s first cousin, the seasoned king Rostom, who had no children of his own. With the shah's approval, Luarsab was brought in Kartli, but the local nobility resented yet another Persian-educated Bagratid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayfield|first=Donald|author-link=Donald Rayfield|title=Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia|year=2012|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1780230303|page = 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luarsab was mortally wounded by a bullet while on a hunt in the Karaia grove and died in the presence of the mourning Rostom. The prince's remains were interred at [[Ardabil]].&lt;ref name="brosset1"/&gt;

Prince Luarsab was married to Tamar, daughter of Prince Adam-Sultan [[Andronikashvili]], member of the shah's elite ''[[Ghulam (slave soldier)|ghulam]]'' guard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maeda|first=Hirotake|title=Slave Elites Who Returned Home: Georgian Vali-king Rostom and the Safavid Household Empire|journal=Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko|year=2012|volume=69|page=107|url=http://toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/book_pdf/Periodical_list/MEMOIRS/Memoirs69/MEMOIRS69_04.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; by an anonymous princess, half-sister of King Rostom. Although Prince Vakhushti claims that with Luarsab's death "the line of the great king Luarsab became extinct",&lt;ref name="brosset1"/&gt; the prince had a son, Giorgi (fl. 1652) and a grandson, Khosro (fl. 1700).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ბაგრატიონები. სამეცნიერო და კულტურული მემკვიდრეობა|trans-title=Scientific and Cultural Heritage of the Bagrationis|year=2003|publisher=Neostudia|location=Tbilisi|isbn=99928-0-623-0|editor=Metreveli, Roin|language=Georgian, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Rostom suspected his heir's death was not an accident and requested an inquiry from Isfahan, but nothing came of this as the shah's government was preoccupied with the war in [[Kandahar]]. In the meantime, Prince Shiosh [[Baratashvili]] denounced Prince Baindur [[Tumanishvili]] as a possible murderer and had him publicly tried by single combat in [[Tbilisi]]. Tumanishvili was wounded, but won the duel and was thus acquitted. Baratashvili, also wounded and defeated, was cast in prison by Rostom, but was later pardoned and, the 18th-century Georgian ''Paris Chronicle'' says, Prince Luarsab "remained unavenged".&lt;ref name="brosset1"/&gt;

After the loss of his heir, Rostom intended to adopt the late Prince Luarsab's brother Vakhtang and, to the chagrin of many Georgians, give him Luarsab's widow in marriage. Vakhtang, serving to the shah as a prefect of [[Qazvin]] and having the example of his brother before him, was reluctant. Arriving in Isfahan in 1655, Rostom's envoy, [[Vakhtang V of Kartli|Bakhuta]], [[House of Mukhrani|Prince of Mukhrani]], found Prince Vakhtang already dead of illness. Within three years, the Prince of Mukhrani would become Rostom's new choice as heir apparent and would succeed him on the throne of Kartli as Vakhtang V.&lt;ref name="brosset1"/&gt;

==Plot==
''Punch'' is a record of the last six months of Park Jung-hwan's life. He is the chief of the anti-corruption investigation team for the [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea|Supreme Prosecutors' Office]]. To get to his position, Jung-hwan has made compromises to achieve what he thought of as the greater good, though it meant losing some of his soul in the process. But when he gets diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and told that he only has six months left to live, it makes Jung-hwan reexamine his life choices. He decides to pursue justice whatever the cost, even if it means sacrificing his life. This is his last attempt to make things right, one final "punch" against the crooked world. And his main goal is bringing down his boss [[attorney general|Prosecutor General]] Lee Tae-joon, whose friendly public face masks his unscrupulous morals and rampant corruption.

Helping Jung-hwan in his quest is his ex-wife, Shin Ha-kyung. Ha-kyung is an idealistic prosecutor for the Seoul District, and chose her profession over having a lucrative law career. She divorced Jung-hwan because he was obsessed with ambition and never had time for her and their young daughter, Ye-rin. But that doesn't mean she doesn't still care for him, though her concern is mixed with resentment.

In the United States, the '''putative father registry''' is a state level legal option for unmarried men to document through a notary public any woman they engage with in intercourse, for the purpose of retaining parental rights for any child they may father.&lt;ref name="usdhhs1"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/putative.cfm | work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | location=[http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/putative.pdf#Page=3&amp;view=Fit Paternity Registries] | title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers | date=30 June 2010 | first=Information Gateway | last=Child Welfare }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work= | location= | title=Because registries apply to minors under the age of 18 the words "male / female" have been used instead of "men / women" which would imply only adults | date= | first= | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==

In the United States, [[putative father]]s will be notified when actions to terminate their parental rights as part of [[Adoption in the United States|adoption]] proceedings are filed for a child they may have fathered and registered for.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S8JUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DzwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=putative-father-registry&amp;pg=2973%2C6304815 | work=The Rochester Sentinel | location=Indiana, USA | title=Public Notices, Legal Notice | date=28 December 2001 | first=Public | last=Notice }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Non marital fathers are not guaranteed notice of an adoption or any rights in contesting the decision by the mother, nor are they guaranteed the ability to adopt or gain [[child custody|custody]] of the child. Typically, the father is only guaranteed notification, and the right to appear in [[court]] to testify about their child's best interests where he has registered timely.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.limaohio.com/news/local_news/article_34caedec-10b9-11e2-a951-001a4bcf6878.html | work=The Lima News | location=Ohio, USA | title=Failure to name child costs father his case | date=7 October 2012 | first=Paul | last=E. Pfeifer }}&lt;/ref&gt; Registering timely with a state’s putative father registry guarantees notice. Timely legal establishment of paternity typically guarantees notice and an opportunity to be heard and may confer rights to consent or withhold consent to adoption. Prenatal support of the mother and fetus assures recognition of parental rights in 34 states.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Mary (2017) Prenatal Abandonment: ‘Horton Hatches the Egg’ in the Supreme Court and Thirty Four States. 24 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 53, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no [[federal law]] in place regulating putative father registries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Toward%20a%20national%20putative%20father%20registry%20database.-a089163072 | work=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy | location=The Free Library | title=Toward a national putative father registry database | date=22 June 2002 | first=Mary | last=Beck }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among all signatory countries only the United States refuses to ratify the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and registries are not regulated under the [[United Nations|U.N. Charter]]. Currently 33 states in the U.S. have putative father registries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} The number of children adopted without consent or notice to the biological father under the registry program started in the 1970s is unknown.

State putative father registries are intended to protect the non marital father from fraud by providing him with legal notice of a planned adoption of a child, provided he registers within a limited time-frame, usually any time prior to the birth or from 1 to 31 days after a birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gBFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sh8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=putative-father-registry&amp;pg=5860%2C872458 | work=Star News | location=North Carolina, USA | title=Registry sets post-adoption trap for Dads | date=19 March 2006 | first=Tamar | last=Lewin }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lack of knowledge of the pregnancy or birth is not an acceptable reason for failure to file; fraud by the birth mother typically does extend the father’s time to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work=[http://www.azdhs.gov/vitalrcd/pdf/notice_of_claim_of_paternity.pdf Arizona Putative Father Registry Form] | location=Arizona.gov, USA | title=Section 2(F) page 4 | date=30 October 2008 | first=Arizona | last=DHS  }} RSMo §192.016; RSMo §453.061 &lt;/ref&gt;

Some states require a putative father to file with multiple states, i.e. with the state possible conception might have occurred, state of residence (if different) and possible states the female might visit,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/article-11795-some-call-it-kidnapping.html?current_page=all | work=City Weekly | location=Utah, United States | title=How Utah adoption laws take babies from the nation's unmarried fathers | date=28 July 2010 | first=Jesse | last=Fruhwirth }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
or relocate to after the possible conception date that also have putative father registries.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work=[http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/field/docs/vs130.pdf Texas Putative Father Registry Form] | location=Texas.us, USA | title=Information sec. 5, page 2 | date= | first=Texas | last=DSHS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/national/19fathers.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0
 | work=New York Times | location=United States | title=Unwed Fathers Fight for Babies Placed for Adoption by Mothers | date=19 March 2006 | first=Tamar | last=Lewin }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To be valid at least one state requires a parent or guardian of the declarant to also sign when a minor under the age of 18 is documenting intercourse with a putative father registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= | work=[http://dcf.wisconsin.gov/forms/pdf/dcf_f_cfs0019a_e.pdf Wisconsin Declaration of Paternal Interest] | location=Wisconsin, USA | title=Wisconsin Department of Children and Families | year=2012 | first=State of | last=Wisconsin }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}

17 states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, West Virginia), as well as American Samoa, District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, do not have putative father registries.&lt;ref name="usdhhs1"/&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
A '''recommendation''' in the [[European Union]], according to Article 288 of the [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=EU}}&lt;/ref&gt;] (formerly Article 249 [[Treaty establishing the European Community|TEC]]), is one of two kinds of non-[[soft law|legal binding]] acts cited in the [[Treaty of Rome]].

Recommendations are without [[legal force]] but are negotiated and voted on according to the [[European Union legislative procedure|appropriate procedure]]. Recommendations differ from [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]], [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] and [[Decision (European Union)|decisions]], in that they are not binding for Member States. Though without legal force, they do have a [[political weight]]. The Recommendation is an instrument of indirect action aiming at preparation of legislation in Member States, differing from the Directive only by the absence of obligatory power.

==Common market==
According to the terms of the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] "In order to ensure the proper functioning and development of the common market, the Commission (…) formulate recommendations or deliver [[European Union opinion|opinions]] on matters dealt with in this Treaty, if it expressively so provides or if the Commission considers it necessary."

Concretely, recommendations can be used by the Commission to raze barriers of [[competition]] caused by the establishment or the modification of internal norms of a [[List of European Union member states|Member State]]. If a country does not conform to a recommendation, the Commission cannot propose the adoption of a Directive aimed at other Member Countries, in order to elide this distortion.

'''Robin Gross''' is founder and Executive Director of [[IP Justice]], an international civil liberties organization that promotes balanced intellectual property law and defends freedom of expression. 

Robin Gross has represented the Non-Commercial Users Constituency (NCUC) on the [[ICANN]] GNSO Policy Council since 2005, and she is a member of the Advisory Group to the United Nations [http://www.intgovforum.org Internet Governance Forum (IGF)].

Robin Gross also runs a boutique law firm [http://www.imaginelaw.com Imagine Law] in San Francisco that handles entertainment, intellectual property, and cyberspace legal issues of a transactional nature 

In 2005, Robin Gross taught international copyright law at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]], where she served on SCU's High Technology Legal Advisory Board from 2004-2006.  

Robin Gross began her legal career as the first [[intellectual property]] (IP) attorney for the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] in 1999.

She launched EFF's work on intellectual property issues and was the director of its Campaign for Audiovisual Free Expression. She defended in court [[2600 Magazine]], Norwegian [[Jon Johansen]], and other people that published the [[DeCSS]] code, challenging the anti-circumvention provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) as unconstitutional. She led the legal team who eventually won in the [[California Supreme Court]] upholding the right of Web publishers to post DeCSS against bogus trade secret claims.

While at EFF, she defended [[Streamcast]] (maker of [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] software) in a precedent setting case over the legality of P2P file-sharing software.  In another [[DMCA]] case, she defended [[Princeton University|Princeton]] scientists' right to publish technical information describing the weaknesses in the recording industry's technology to control digital music.  She successfully represented [[ReplayTV]] owners (including the founder of Craigslist) against [[Hollywood|Hollywood's]] claims that their use of digital [[VCR]]s was illegal.

Gross and IP Justice are active at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and participate in meetings related to the "Development Agenda".  In July 2005, she organized a campaign of over 138 international public interest [[NGO]]s to support the proposal for a "Development Agenda" at WIPO.  IP Justice is also active on issues regarding WIPO's proposed Broadcasting (&amp; Webcasting) Treaty.

In 2004, she organized an international campaign of over 50 civil liberties groups to reform the [[European Union]]'s [[Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights|Intellectual property Rights Enforcement Directive]]. The CODE Campaign was successful in removing the directive's ban on technical devices that bypass IP holders' restrictions, and got the criminal provisions deleted from the final directive.

At the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS)  in [[Geneva]] in 2003, she gave a keynote speech at the [[World Forum on Communications Rights]] and argued that in an information society, communication rights are human rights.

Later in 2004 she went to [[Chile]] where she advised [[Latin American]] policy makers on how to implement the [[US-Chile Free Trade Agreement]]'s IP chapter as harmlessly as possible and also went to Geneva to attend meetings to reform [[WIPO]].

At WSIS in [[Tunis]] in 2005, she addressed the WSIS plenary and called for reform of over-zealous intellectual property rights laws.  She also chaired two panel discussions &lt;!--at WSIS in Tunis--&gt; on the topics of the "World Intellectual Property Organization" and "P2P and Digital Rights".

She has been active against the IP Chapter of the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas Treaty]], and [[WIPO's proposed Broadcasting Treaty]] and is also engaged in the [[ICANN]] Non-Commercial User's Constituency.

In 2004, Managing Intellectual Property Magazine named Robin Gross one of the "Top 100 Most Influential People in Intellectual Property in the World".

[[File:Found foam insulation.jpg|thumb|Spray foam insulation extruding from a duct.]]
'''Spray foam''' is a chemical product created by two materials, [[isocyanate]] and [[polyol]] resin, which react when mixed with each other and expand up to 30-60 times its liquid volume after it is sprayed in place. This expansion makes it useful as a specialty packing material which forms to the shape of the product being packaged and produces a high thermal insulating value with virtually no air infiltration.

==History==
[[Otto Bayer]] (1902-1982) is credited with the invention of [[polyurethane]] in 1937. He succeeded in synthesizing polyurethane foam by exploring his basic idea that mixing small volumes of chemical substances could create dry foam materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bayer.com/en/otto-bayer.aspx|title=Otto Bayer – Important Personalities of Bayer's History|last=AG|first=Bayer|website=www.bayer.com|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyurethane]] was further developed for different applications, ranging from shoe soles and cushions to industrial uses. In the 1940s rigid foam was applied to airplanes,&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seymour | first1 = Raymond B. | authorlink2 = George B. Kauffman | last2 = Kauffman | first2 = George B. | year = 1992 | title = Polyurethanes: A Class of Modern Versatile Materials | url = | journal = [[J. Chem. Educ.]] | volume = 69 | issue = | page = 909 | doi=10.1021/ed069p909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1979 polyurethane began being used as building insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polyurethanes.org/en/what-is-it/timeline|title=Polyurethanes in Polyurethanes timeline|website=www.polyurethanes.org|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
===Thermal resistance===
[[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] is the term given to thermal resistance to heat flow.  The higher the R-value of an insulation product, the more effective the insulation properties. Spray polyurethane foam comes in a range of densities and cel structure. Low density foams are referred to as Open Cel SPF while higher density foams are referred to as Closed Cel foam.  1.8-2 pound polyurethane foam has the highest R-value of readily available spray foam insulation used in homes and buildings.&lt;ref name="toolbase"&gt;[http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/walls/sprayed-foam-insulation Insulation Alternatives: Sprayed Foam Insulation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane is a closed-cell foam insulation material that initially contains a low-conductivity gas in its cells.&lt;ref name="energysavers"&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11600 Polyurethane Insulation Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the high thermal resistance of the gas, spray polyurethane insulation typically has an initial R-value around R-3.4 to R-6.7 per inch.&lt;ref name="energysavers"/&gt;  In comparison, blown fiberglass typically has an R-Value of only R-3 to R-4 per inch.&lt;ref name="colorado"&gt;[http://www.coloradoenergy.org/procorner/stuff/r-values.htm Insulation Values For Selected Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;

Foam insulation blocks all three forms of heat transfer:

;Conductive heat transfer: The flow of thermal energy through a substance from a higher to a lower temperature region. Foam thermoset plastics reduce conductive heat transfer due in part to having very loose molecular bonds; In addition the cells of the installed spray foam are either filled with air in the case of open cell foam or [[pentafluoropropane|245fa]] in closed cell foam.

;Radiant heat transfer: The process by which heat energy in the form of light (usually IR unless the substrate is hot enough to glow in the visible range) is emitted more strongly by warm surfaces and absorbed by other materials especially those of low IR reflectivity (think matte black finish).  Radiant heat transfer does not require a medium. Foam insulation materials, such as spray foam insulation, are opaque to thermal radiation, like most solid materials.

;Convective heat transfer: Heat which is created elsewhere that is transported by means of a fluid, such as water or in our case air. Spray foam insulation's most important attribute is the ability to air seal creating a custom airtight envelope within the building structure. The added benefit to air sealing is the ability to block convective heat transfer from interior to exterior during heating months and vice versa during cooling months, as the heat cannot escape through gaps in the buildings envelope without the aid of air movement from infiltration as a means of transport.

==Applications==
{{See also|List of polyurethane applications}}

===Packaging applications===
Spray foam is a very specialized packing material, often required for use in shipping valuable [[Brittle|fragile]] items. Engineered packaging principles are designed to protect sculptures, vases, large fossils, lamp bases, busts, computers, furniture, chandeliers and other objects of unusual shape. By virtue of the liquid foam expanding by up to 30-60 times the volume of its liquid state, it efficiently protects almost any size, form and weight.

The custom fit of the molds, top and bottom, securely and uniformly cushions the object. There are many types of alternative materials that can be used to handle more specific needs.

===Building applications===
[[File:WALLTITE spray foam insulation being applied.jpg|thumb|Walltite insulation foam being sprayed]]
[[File:Chicago Closed Cell Spray Foam Insulation In Wall.jpg|thumb|Closed cell spray foam being applied by trained installer.]]
'''Spray foam insulation or spray polyurethane foam (SPF)''' is an alternative to traditional building insulation such as [[Glass wool|fiberglass]]. A two-component mixture composed of [[Polyurethanes|isocyanate]] and [[polyol]] resin comes together at the tip of a gun, and forms an expanding foam that is sprayed onto roof tiles, concrete slabs, into wall cavities, or through holes drilled in into a [[cavity wall|cavity]] of a finished wall.

"Spray foam" is also an informal term used to refer to various plastic foam materials that are used in building construction to provide [[thermal insulation]] and minimize [[Infiltration (HVAC)|air infiltration]]. [[Polyurethane]] and [[polyisocyanurate]] are two types of foam used in this application.

====Types====
Spray polyurethane foam (SPF) insulation can be categorized into two different types: light-density open-cell spray foam insulation and medium-density closed-cell spray foam insulation. Both types of SPF are thermoset cellular plastics comprising millions of small cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spray Applied Rigid Polyurethane Insulation Installer Training Program Manual|date=1 October 2014|publisher=CUFCA|page=5|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Spray Polyurethane Foam Application.jpg|thumb|Open cell spray polyurethane foam insulation being applied in wall cavities.]]

Open cell insulation can be crushed in your hand and has a lower insulation value.  Closed cell is rigid to the touch and each air cell is completely sealed.  While closed cell foam has a higher R-value, it is more costly to buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/homes/home-renovating/Block+moisture+make+stucco+last/7594628/story.html
|title=Closed-cell spray foam tops home insulation options
|publisher=Montreal Gazette
|accessdate=29 January 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medium-Density Closed-Cell Spray Foam (ccSPF)'''

Medium-density closed-cell foam insulation is often referred to as two pound (2&amp;nbsp;lb) foam. It is a rigid insulating material with a Long Term Thermal Resistance (LTTR) R-value that ranges between 5.1 - 6 per inch&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cufca.ca/technical_documents.php|title=Technical Documents {{!}} CUFCA|website=www.cufca.ca|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the required minimum thickness of 50&amp;nbsp;mm is installed, ccSPF is both a vapour barrier and an air barrier.

In Canada, the National Building Code references two standards that apply to the manufacturing and installation of ccSPF: the CAN/ULC S705.1 Material Standard and the CAN/ULC S705.2 National Application Standard. The installation standard requires that all installers of ccSPF in Canada be licensed and carry a photo ID card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cufca.ca/howto.php|title=What Foam Do I Ask For? / How Do I Know If I Received What I Asked For? {{!}} CUFCA|website=cufca.ca|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically the foam's natural colour is yellow, however in Canada all ccSPF that have CCMC listings are required to have a unique colour for field identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/ccmc/evaluations.html|title=CMC Registry of Construction Product Evaluations|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Council Canada|publisher=|access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light-Density Open-Cell Spray Foam (ocSPF)'''

Light-density open-cell SPF is commonly known as half-pound foam. It is a semi-rigid material with a sponge-like appearance that expands during installation and creates small, open cells that are filled with carbon dioxide. Due to its ability to expand during the application process, it fills cracks, crevices and voids and adheres to irregular surfaces or substrates to form an air sealing insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Low Density Semi-Rigid Open Cell Training Manual|last=|first=|publisher=CUFCA|year=2014|location=Canada|page=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the R value will vary, most ocSPF products have an R value of around 3.8 per inch. Unlike medium-density closed-cell SPF, ocSPF is not a vapour barrier. When installed at 5.5 inches or more, ocSPF does act as an air barrier. It is often used for interior walls because it provides sound reduction by blocking and absorbing air leakage. It is usually only recommended for indoor applications.

====Application methods====
=====Asia=====
A type of use quite familiar in South East Asian countries is applying the pu or pur foam by spraying it against the bottom of roof tiles under high pressure with a spray gun. A hard but flexible layer of rigid foam is then created and seals all the tiles to each other and to the steel structure.

This spraying method, especially very popular in Thailand, is used not only against heavy leaks but helps also as insulation against the enormous heat the roofs constantly face.

This tropic heat actually is the cause that the steel structure, which most roofs in that part of the world are built on, expands and contracts all the time. By doing so, the sun-battered steel structure causes the roof tiles to dislodge and slowly creates small openings between the roof tiles, through which rain water can run into, creating leaks that can cause much damage to plastered ceilings and electric wiring.

Polyurethane Foam provides a complete, seamless building envelope, creating a more comfortable indoor environment for the life of your home.

To avoid the expense re-roofing a house that is simply suffering from nail fatigue, and to obtain optimum insulation, an 85mm layer of polyurethane foam can be sprayed onto the underside of the slates or tiles of a pitched roof. This stabilises and weatherproofs the roof by fixing the nails, battens and roofing felt. As the foam is a superior insulant, coupled with just 100mm of insulation at joist level, your roof will also meet the stringent thermal performance standards required for a new home. A typical roof can be insulated using the polyurethane treatment for around half the cost of re-roofing.

The insulation at eaves level will leave your loft area comfortable for use and free from condensation. By installing the insulation at rafter level, it keeps the loft void warmer and prevents condensation build-up, which can otherwise occur when increasing insulation at ceiling level. The warmer, drier, cleaner roof space eliminates the risk of pipes and tanks freezing.

=====Europe=====
Some 150,000 properties have been treated with polyurethane foam insulation in the UK. There are systems which have British Board of Agreement approval for use in existing and new build applications and can show compliance to Building Regulations.

=====North America=====
The Canadian National Building Code references the CAN/ULC S705.2 National Application Standard which must be followed during all installations of 2lb medium density closed cell polyurethane foam. Every installer must be licensed in order to spray foam and hold valid photo ID issued by their Quality Assurance Program (QAP) provider showing their license is in good standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Foam Do I Ask For? / How Do I Know If I Received What I Asked For?|url=http://cufca.ca/howto.php|website=CUFCA: How To|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest QAP provider for spray foam installers and contractors in Canada is a non-profit organization called [[CUFCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CUFCA|url=http://www.cufca.ca/|website=CUFCA|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has adapted to using sprayfoam insulation and a new technology called [http://www.foamgods.com/products.html Wall Injection] to retrofit existing wall construction by drilling small holes between wall studs in the structures framing and filling the void with a less aggressive expanding water based foam. This allows existing home and business owners to conserve energy by creating a thermal envelope in their existing structure.

====Benefits====
Spray foam insulation, like other insulation, saves on energy costs and lowers utility bills. Studies by the [[US Department of Energy]] show that 40% of a home's energy is lost as the result of air [[infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] through walls, windows and doorways. Buildings treated with spray foam insulation insulate as much as 50% better than traditional insulation products.

Insulation properly deployed can be part of a system designed to protect against [[Damp (structural)|moisture]], which provides the benefit of reducing the chance of harmful [[mold]], [[mildew]] and rotting of wood.

In addition to building [[temperature]] and moisture control, spray foam insulation is often used to reduce noise. Foam insulation serves as a [[noise barrier|barrier]] to airborne sounds, and reduces [[airborne sound]] transfer through a building's roof, floor and walls compared an uninsulated structure.

In the United States, homes treated with spray foam insulation often qualify for state and federal tax deductions.&lt;ref name="energystar"&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=tax_credits.tx_index Federal Tax Credits for Consumer Energy Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

Insulation of all types stops a good deal of energy loss. Some types including spray foams also seal air leaks. Insulation can also save energy in hot climates by reducing air conditioning use.

==Blowing Agent Climate Impact==
Most closed-cell spray foam is now formed using [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) [[blowing agent]]s that have high global warming potential, partially or completely offsetting the climate benefits of the energy savings they can offer .  In the United States, HFCs are scheduled to be phased out by January, 2021.  A few spray foam suppliers have started supplying spray foam blown with 
[[hydrofluoroolefin]] (HFO) blowing agents without this problem as of early 2017.&lt;ref&gt;"Next Generation Spray Foams Trickle into the Market," Scott Gibson, Green Building Advisor, [http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/green-building-news/next-generation-spray-foams-trickle-market]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
{{medical citations needed|date=August 2016}}
Spray foam insulation is typically [[non-toxic]] only after it has cured. While curing spray foam emits a gas that causes blurred vision and trouble breathing. Using full face and respiratory protection while applying the product is recommended.&lt;ref name="HGTV"&gt;[http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/bp_insulation/article/0,2617,HPRO_20150_3457625,00.html Spray Foam Insulation: Installation, Tips and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isocyanates]] are powerful irritants to the eyes and gastrointestinal as well as the respiratory tracts. Direct skin contact with isocyanates can also cause marked inflammation. Some people say that their eyes feel like they have sand in them at the onset of problems. Some break out in a rash on their arms, chest, and neck.

Overexposure to isocyanates can sensitize workers, making them subject to asthma attacks if they are exposed again. Respiratory irritation may progress to a chemical bronchitis. Additional exposures can make the onset easier with less isocyanate necessary to start the attack.
	
Sporadic cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) have also been reported in workers exposed to isocyanates. The symptoms may seem like the flu, with fever, muscle aches, and headaches. Other symptoms may include a dry cough, chest tightness, and difficult breathing. Individuals with chronic HP often experience progressively more difficult breathing, fatigue, and weight loss. Individuals with acute HP typically develop symptoms 4–6 hours after exposure.&lt;ref name="toolbase"/&gt;

The '''Supreme People's Procuratorate''' also translated as the  '''Prosecutor General's Office''' ({{zh |s = 最高人民检察院 |p = Zuìgāo Rénmín Jiǎncháyuàn }}) is the highest national level agency responsible for both [[prosecution]] and investigation in the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], as [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]]s, have their own separate legal systems, based on [[common law]] traditions and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] legal traditions respectively, and are out of the jurisdiction of the SPP.

The office of the '''Procurator''' or '''Prosecutor General''' is influenced by similar institutions ([[public procurator]]) in both [[Japan]] and [[Socialist law|Socialist legal system]]s, and finds equivalence in most [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems, which often use an [[inquisitorial system]]. Its direct predecessor institution in China is the [[Supreme Prosecutor Office|Procuratorial Office]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China]], which in turn is descended from the Procuratorial Office of the Dali Yuan of the late [[Qing Dynasty]].

The current Prosecutor-General of the People's Republic of China is [[Cao Jianming]].

[[File:T Minobe.jpg|right|thumb]]
{{nihongo|'''Tatsukichi Minobe'''|美濃部 達吉|Minobe Tatsukichi|extra=May 7, 1873 – May 23, 1948}} was a Japanese statesman and scholar of [[constitutional law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Ōmi''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 638|page=638}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretation of the role of the monarchy in the pre-war [[Empire of Japan]] was a source of considerable controversy in the increasingly radicalized political environment of Japan in the 1930s.

His wife was the daughter of [[Dairoku Kikuchi]], and his son [[Ryokichi Minobe]] was governor of Tokyo (1967–1979).

== Biography ==
Minobe was born in [[Takasago, Hyōgo|Takasago city]], [[Hyōgo prefecture]] to a doctor of Chinese medicine. He graduated from the law school of [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1897, where one of his mentors was future [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Councilor]] [[Ichiki Kitokuro|Ichiki Kitokurō]]. He went to work for the [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Ministry]], and was sent for further studies to [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], returning to Japan in 1902 to take up a position as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University.

In 1912, Minobe published a work on constitutional interpretation, which came to be known as the “emperor organ theory”. Per Minobe, the “State”, or ''[[kokutai]]'' was supreme, and even the [[Imperial Family of Japan|emperor]] was only an “organ of the State” as defined through the constitutional structure, rather than a sacred power beyond the state itself. Minobe used the metaphor of the head of the human body to describe the role of the emperor. This thesis was influenced by the work of [[Germany|German]] [[Philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] [[Georg Jellinek]], whose work, ''Allgemeine Staatslehre'' (''General Theory of the State'') was published in 1900, and also by the British concept of a [[constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bix. ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''. pages 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; Minobe warned that the emperor’s right of supreme command over the military needed to be carefully limited by the [[Diet of Japan]] if Japan were not to end up with a dual government in which the military would become completely independent and above the [[rule of law]] and unaccountable to civilian authority.

From 1924 to 1927, Minobe was the Director of the Faculty of Law at Tokyo Imperial University. From 1911 for 34 years, he was also a counselor in the Bureau of Legislation where he participated in the enactment of several laws. He entered the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] by appointment in 1932.

Minobe’s interpretation of the constitution was generally accepted by bureaucrats and even imperial household until the 1930s, although it had been challenged from the beginning by imperial absolutists such as [[Yatsuka Hozumi]] and [[Shinkichi Uesugi]], who held that the emperor was, by definition, the personification of the State itself, and therefore politically unaccountable for his actions, however arbitrary, as defined in Article 3 the [[Meiji Constitution]]. 
[[Image:Tatsukichi Minobe at the Chaimber.jpg|right|thumb|Minobe before Diet, 1935]]
In the increasingly militant environment of the 1930s, Minobe’s liberal interpretation of the role of the emperor came under attack from military officers and ultranationalists increasingly disillusioned by [[liberal democracy]] and corruption in government, which they felt could only be addressed through a [[Shōwa Restoration]] in which the emperor would take personal [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] control. On February 18, 1935, Baron Takeo Kikuchi, a retired general and member of the House of Peers, launched a public campaign to demand that [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Keisuke Okada]] ban Minobe’s works, which he termed to be “traitorous thoughts”.&lt;ref&gt;Bix. ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''. page 287&lt;/ref&gt; Minobe addressed the Diet of Japan a week later in his own defense, while [[Uyoku dantai|right-wing groups]] and ''[[Kōdōha]]'' officers held a demonstration in downtown Tokyo denouncing him. In early March, Major General [[Genkuro Eto]] charged in the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the Diet of Japan that Minobe’s books, specifically ''Kenpo Satsuyo'' (Compendium of the Constitution) and ''Tsuiho kenpo seigi'' (Additional Commentaries on the Constitution) were works of [[lese-majeste]], and that Minobe should be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762237,00.html?iid=chix-sphere] ''Time Magazine'', April 22, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; Bowing to severe political pressure, Okada asked Minobe to resign from his posts later that month, banned some of his works, and initiated a government-sponsored campaign to discredit his works in favor of the tenets supporting the concept of the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] of the emperor, which quickly merged with [[emperor worship]] and national chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Bix. ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''. page 290-291&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[surrender of Japan]] after [[World War II]], Minobe was active as an advisor in the creation of the post-war [[Constitution of Japan]], as well as an advisor to the Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndl.go.jp/constitution/e/etc/figures.html] National Diet Library Bio&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1948.

The former [[Free imperial city]] [[Riga]] was added to [[Treaty of Vilnius (1561)|Polish-Lithuanian Livonia]]. Its freedoms and privileges were in part confirmed in the ''Corpus Privilegiorum Stephanorum'', but also limited. One of its [[burgomaster]]s was to be appointed ''Burggraf'', the Polish-Lithuanian official in town. Changes to the city's statutes required Royal approval. The [[Augsburg Confession]] was tolerated, but the city was deprived of the means to veto Royal interventions in its ecclesiastical affairs.

The '''Treaty of Titalia''' was signed between the [[Chogyal]] (monarch) of [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] and the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). The treaty, which was negotiated by Captain Barre Latter in February 1817, guaranteed security of Sikkim by the British and returned Sikkimese land annexed by the Nepalese over the centuries. It followed the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]], 1814-1816. In return, the British were given trading rights and rights of passage up to the [[Tibet]] frontier. The treaty was signed at Titalia, now known as [[Tetulia Upazila]], in the [[Rangpur District]] of present-day [[Bangladesh]]. In the Gazette of Sikkim, 1894 by [[Herbert Hope Risley|H.H. Risley]], it was written that "by the Treaty of Titalia, British India has assumed the position of Lord's paramount of Sikkim and a title to exercise a predominant influence in that State has remained undisputed."

==Provisions==

Signed by Captain Barre Latter as agent for the EIC and three Sikkimese officials, Nazir Chaina Tenjin, Macha Teinbah and [[Lama]] Duchim Longadoo, the primary purpose of the treaty under Article 1 was to return land previously seized by the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] of Nepal to Sikkim. This land, lying to the east of the [[Mechi River]] and the west of the [[Teesta River]] had been ceded to the EIC by the Gorkhas under the 1816 [[Treaty of Sugauli]] following the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] of 1814-16.

In exchange, the Sikkimese Chogyal agreed to abstain from aggression towards the Gorkhas and to allow the British to mediate any dispute with its neighbours. Further articles pledged military support to the British, that absconders from British justice, whether criminal or civil, would be arrested in Sikkim and finally that all EIC company goods shipped through Sikkim would thereafter be free from duty.

==Impact==
The treaty  effectively transformed  Sikkim  into  a channel for Anglo-Chinese diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commodities of Empire: Working Paper No.9|first1=Vibha|last1=Arora|chapter=Routing the Commodities of Empire through Sikkim (1817-1906)|url=https://commoditiesofempire.blogs.sas.ac.uk/files/2016/03/WP09.pdf|publisher=[[Open University]]|ISSN=1756-0098|year=2008|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Cigar Stores''' was a [[Chain store|chain]] of [[cigar]] stores in the United States that in its first quarter-century grew to nearly 3,000 shops. It eventually became part of the corporation that bought [[Marvel Comics]] and its parent company [[Magazine Management]] from their founder in 1968.

==History==
Brothers Charles A. Whelan and George J. Whelan founded a tobacco [[Wholesaling|wholesale]] firm in [[Syracuse, New York]], in 1901, eventually turning to retail. By 1926, the chain had nearly 3,000 stores.&lt;ref name=Time1926&gt;{{cite news |title=Salesmen |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 20, 1926|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711536,00.html|archivedate=May 22, 2018|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180522211155/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,711536,00.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially specializing in cigars, it eventually sold many other items, such as [[Mickey Mouse]] watches and [[shoe tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Business: Schulte &amp; Specialties |work=Time|date= November 29, 1937|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758501,00.html|archivedate= October 25, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025205605/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,758501,00.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain represented the interests of the Consolidated Tobacco Company, the tobacco trust that controlled the [[American Tobacco Company]] and others. In September 1903 a settlement was reached with the chain's competitors and all competition ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Consolidated Tobacco Company and affiliated corporations.

In August 1929, the chain and the affiliated Whelan Drug chain, founded by two of Charles' Whelan's sons, was sold to brothers George Kenan and Frederick Kenan Morrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milestones, Dec. 22, 1941|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 22, 1941|4=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,931998,00.html|archivedate=May 22, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180522211438/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,931998,00.html|deadurl=no|quote=Died.

As the [[Great Depression]] deepened, the real-estate [[subsidiary]] accumulated huge losses, so in September 1932 the [[holding company]] declared [[bankruptcy]].

Weather radios are typically equipped with a standby alerting function—if the radio is muted or tuned to another band and a severe weather [[news bulletin|bulletin]] is transmitted, it can automatically sound an alarm and/or switch to a pre-tuned weather channel for emergency weather information.

Weather radio services may also broadcast non-weather-related emergency information, such as in the event of a [[natural disaster]], a [[Child abduction alert system|child abduction alert]], or a [[terrorist attack]]. They generally broadcast in a pre-allocated [[very high frequency]] (VHF) range using [[FM broadcasting|FM]]. Usually a [[radio scanner]] or a dedicated weather [[radio receiver]] is needed for listening, although in some locations a weather radio broadcast may be re-transmitted on an [[AM radio|AM]] or [[FM radio|FM]] broadcast station, on [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] [[television station]]s, or local [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) [[cable TV]] [[cable channel|channel]]s or during weather or other emergencies.

==Weather radio receivers==

Weather radios are generally sold in two varieties: home (stationary) or portable use. Portable models commonly offer specialized features that make them more useful in case of an emergency. Some models use [[wind-up radio|crank power]], in addition to [[mains electricity]] and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], in case of a [[power outage]].

[[File:Sangean_DT-400W_(10711303835).jpg|thumb|Sangean DT-400W (10711303835)]]
Smaller hand-held weather receivers generally do not support the SAME alert type encoding, but allow hikers and other explorers to listen to weather reports without packing a heavy and bulky base station radio. Some models have a built-in [[flashlight]] and can double as a [[cellphone charger]]. Some also serve as a more general [[emergency radio]] and may include multiband and [[two-way communication]] capability. [[Scanner (radio)|"Scanner" radios]] designed to continuously monitor the VHF-FM public service band are already able to receive weather channels.[[Image:weatheradio.gif|right|thumb|A Gorman-Redlich CRW-S weather radio]]Besides SAME alerting capability, modern weather radio receivers may include visual alerting elements (e.g., multicolored LED indicator lights) and allow for the use of external devices (e.g., pillow [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrators]], bed shakers, [[strobe light]]s, and loud [[siren (alarm)|siren]]s, which attach via an accessory port) to alert those who are deaf or [[hearing impaired]]. 

== Global weather radio services ==
[[File:Wib2bx.jpg|thumb|110x110px|Wib2bx]]
Both private and commercial seagoing vessels need accurate weather reports, in order to avoid storms that might damage or capsize the vessel, or make paying passengers uncomfortable. One such service is [[Navtex]], which is a low-frequency [[facsimile]] radio service.

==North American weather radio services==
The United States, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda operate their government weather [[radio station]]s on the same [[marine VHF radio]] [[band (radio)|band]], using [[frequency modulation|FM]] transmitters.

WX10 was formerly used by the NWS for coordination during power outages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} All stations in United States, Canada, and Bermuda transmit a [[:File:1050Hz Tone.ogg|1050 Hz attention tone]] immediately before issuing a watch or warning, and this alone serves to activate the alarm feature on many older or basic alerting radios.
[[File:Emergency_Alert_System_Headers.ogg|thumb|FEMA-provided audio file of the SAME alert header, followed by the 1050 Hz Warning Alert Tone, followed by the SAME end-of-message (EOM) tone]]
All U.S. and newer Canadian stations transmit [[Specific Area Message Encoding|WRSAME]] codes a few seconds before the 1050&amp;nbsp;Hz attention tone that allow more advanced receivers to respond only for certain warnings that carry a specific code for the local area. SAME codes are defined for [[County|counties]], [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]], [[Territories of the United States|territories]], or marine zones, and are set using preassigned six-digit [[FIPS county code]]s (in the U.S.) or [[Canadian Location Code|CLC]] codes (in Canada). The SAME code protocol also includes an end-of-message (EOM) tone (three short data bursts of the binary 10101011 calibration then "NNNN", which some radios will use to mute the speaker after the alert broadcast has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reecominc.com/eom.htm|title=Radio Operations with E.O.M (End Of Message) Detection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/info/usingsame.html|title=Using NWR SAME|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|NOAA Weather Radio}}NOAA Weather Radio (NWR; also known as NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards) is an automated 24-hour network of about 133 [[Radio station|radio stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noaaweatherradio.org/|title=NOAA Weather Radio|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States]] that broadcast weather information directly from a nearby [[National Weather Service]] office. A complete broadcast cycle lasts about 3 to 8 minutes long, featuring weather forecasts and local observations, but is interrupted when severe weather advisories/warnings/watches are issued. It occasionally broadcasts other non-weather related events such as [[national security]] statements, natural disaster information, environmental and [[public safety]] statements (such as an [[AMBER Alert]]) sourced from the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Emergency Alert System]]. [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]] discontinued live streams of NWR broadcasts in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://help.wunderground.com/knowledgebase/articles/1143553-wu-feature-and-product-updates|title=WU feature and product updates – Customer Feedback for Weather Underground|website=help.wunderground.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922052214/http://help.wunderground.com/knowledgebase/articles/1143553-wu-feature-and-product-updates|archivedate=2017-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Bermuda Radio}}
'''Bermuda Radio''' (call-sign ZBR) is a weather [[radio station]] in [[Bermuda]] working under the [[Government of Bermuda]].

Bermuda has only one station dedicated purely for weather, on 162.55&amp;nbsp;MHz from [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], now operated by the [[Bermuda Weather Service]] with tropical weather forecasts from [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].  It has a second station, however, for marine conditions and forecasts, [[Bermuda Radio|ZBR]] (operated by the [[Bermuda Maritime Operations Centre]]), at 162.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreblue.com/communications/vhf-bm.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703213957/http://www.offshoreblue.com/communications/vhf-bm.php |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rccbermuda.bm/Documents/BMOC/broadcast.schedule.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719141917/http://www.rccbermuda.bm/Documents/BMOC/broadcast.schedule.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Mexico has since launched its own weather radio system, SARMEX (Sistema De Alerta De Riesgos Mexicano, or Mexican Hazard Warning System) for coverage of its cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dxinfocentre.com/wx-mex.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917182135/http://www.dxinfocentre.com/wx-mex.htm |archivedate=2015-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also implements the Mexican Seismic Warning System. Some Mexican alert radios also support activation by a two-tone alert for another type of risk warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cires.org.mx/sarmex_es.php|title=Sistema de Alerta de Riesgos Mexicano (Mexican Risk Alert System)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European weather radio services==

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the Deutscher Wetterdienst broadcasts marine weather reports and weather warnings via long and short wave transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwd.de/EN/specialusers/shipping/broadcast_en/_node.html|title=Broadcastings of transmitter Pinneberg|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial weather radio services==

The weather radio band is part of the [[marine VHF radio]] band reserved for governmental services.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} However, most standard AM and FM broadcast radio stations provide some sort of private weather forecasting, either through relaying public-domain [[National Weather Service]] forecasts, partnering with a meteorologist from a local television station (or using a meteorologist hired by the station, common when a radio station is a sister station of their TV counterpart or has a news and forecast-sharing agreement), affiliating with a commercial weather service company, or (in the most brazen cases) [[copyright infringement|copying]] a commercial service's public forecasts without payment or permission. (The first option is not available, or at least legally, in Canada, where [[Environment Canada]]'s forecasts are under [[crown copyright]].) 

[[Accuweather]] (through [[United Stations Radio Networks|United Stations]]) and [[The Weather Channel]] (through [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]]'s [[NBC Radio Network]]) both operate large national weather radio networks through standard AM and FM stations. Brookstone licensed Accuweather's data service for their popular 5 Day Wireless Weather Watcher Cast Forecaster.

Microsoft's [[MSN Direct]] was a popular data service that included weather forecasting sent over US FM radio signals from 2004 to 2012. It was used by Microsoft Spot watches and [[Oregon Scientific]] clocks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://socialcritic.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/has-your-weather-device-gone-blank-blame-msn-direct/ MSN Direct stops FM data network]&lt;/ref&gt;
