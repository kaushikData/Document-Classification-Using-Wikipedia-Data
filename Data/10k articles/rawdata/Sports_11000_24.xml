The '''1963 Chatham Cup''' was the 36th annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Otangarei United]], [[Blockhouse Bay (soccer)|Blockhouse Bay]], [[North Shore United]], [[Papatoetoe (soccer)|Papatoetoe]], [[Hamilton Technical Old Boys]], [[Kahukura (sport)|Kahukura]] (Rotorua), [[Eastern Union]] (Gisborne), [[Moturoa (soccer)|Moturoa]], [[Hastings United AFC|Hastings United]], [[Wanganui United]], [[St. Andrews FC|St. Andrews]] (Manawatu), [[Wellington Marist]], [[Nelson Rangers]], [[Nomads United|Christchurch Nomads]], [[Timaru Thistle]], [[Northern (soccer)|Northern]] (Dunedin), and [[Invercargill Thistle]]. It is known that unfancied side [[Otematata (soccer)|Otematata]], from [[Otago]]'s [[Maniototo]] district caused a surprise by reaching the last 16 stage.
==The 1963 final==
During the early 1960s North Shore were by far the strongest team in the country. This was their fourth final in five years, and with the Chatham Cup they completed a treble which included the Auckland regional league and the Rothmans Cup competition. They easily accounted for the Christchurch team of Nomads in the final, and with the exception of the tail-end of the first half dominated the match. The only goal of the first period came through Shore's Middleton (some sources say winger Peter Oden), but the lead was doubled ten minutes after the break through a header from Peter Maynard. McNicholl (some sources say Oden) added a third and North Shore coasted for the remainder of the match, allowing Nomads' Robin Muirson to gain a consolation goal for the southerners.&lt;ref name="ODTfinal"&gt;''Otago Daily Times'', Sept 2, 1963, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{HiltonNZAssoc}} p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barton Hall''' is an on-campus [[field house]] on the campus of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]].  It is the site of the school's indoor track facilities, [[ROTC]] offices and classes, and Cornell Police. It also served as the location of the former band room, once used by the [[Cornell Big Red Marching Band]] and the [[Cornell Big Red Pep Band]]. However, the summer of 2013 saw the completion of a  new building for the Big Red Bands adjacent to Schoellkopf Field. For a long time, Barton Hall was the largest unpillared room in existence. The interior of the building covers almost {{convert|2|acre|m2}}, and includes a 1/8 mile (200m) indoor track.&lt;ref name="infobase"&gt;{{cite web | title = Barton Hall | publisher = Cornell University | date = 2004-02-19 | url = http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Campus/Infobase/Infobase.php?kindex=54 | accessdate = 2006-09-05 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060913032929/http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Campus/Infobase/Infobase.php?kindex=54| archivedate= 13 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
The '''New York State Drill Hall''' was designed by the official State Architect of New York, [[Lewis Pilcher]].&lt;ref name="TAR" /&gt; It was built to provide military instruction to Cornell students, as required by Cornell's status as a land-grant institution.&lt;ref name="TAR" /&gt; Its drill shed originally contained 362 x 228 feet of open floor space, large enough to accommodate 1,000 men.&lt;ref name="TAR" /&gt; The building is made of local limestone with double trusses spaced 40 feet apart to support the roof.&lt;ref name="TAR" /&gt; The [[Architectural Record]] called the "splendid drill hall" a "notably modern achievement in American architecture."&lt;ref name="TAR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamlin |first1=Prof. A.D.F. |title=The State Architect and His Works |journal=The Architectural Record |date=January 1923 |volume=LIII |issue=1 |pages=27-43 |url=http://www.usmodernist.org/AR/AR-1923-01.PDF |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was built in 1914 and 1915 and was originally designed as a drill hall for the Department of Military Science. Upon its completion it was often referred to as the "New Armory".  In January 1940 it was named for Col. Frank A. Barton, Class of 1891. Colonel Barton was one of the first two Cornell students to receive an army commission in Cornell's Military Science Program,&lt;ref name="infobase"/&gt; and was the first ROTC commandant at Cornell from 1904 to 1908.&lt;ref name="facilities"&gt;{{cite web | title = Barton Hall | publisher = Cornell University | year = 2006 | url = http://cornellbigred.cstv.com/facilities/barton.html | accessdate = 2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, Barton Hall functioned as an airplane hangar&lt;ref name="infobase"/&gt; and it served the ROTC as an armory during World War II.

Barton Hall was well-known to all Cornellians.  In the days prior to online course registration, each student would come to Barton Hall at the start of the semester to register for classes. This process would involve placing punched cards into bins for each class positioned on tables throughout the hall. Student organizations would also recruit members at these events.  In the first part of the 20th century, "drill" was mandatory for all male students, and it would be conducted in Barton Hall.  Also, until 1974, graduation was conducted in Barton Hall, until it was moved outdoors to [[Schoellkopf Field]]. For many years, it also hosted graduation ceremonies for [[Ithaca High School (Ithaca, New York)|Ithaca High School]].

Barton Hall was home to [[Cornell Big Red men's basketball|Cornell Basketball]] between 1919 and 1990 when the new field house, later named Bartels Hall, was completed. In 1995, Barton received another major change with the construction of the H. Hunt Bradley Track Center under the south bleachers. The center includes a Hall of Fame/meeting room/study facility for track, an office, a library and a {{convert|1500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} weight room.&lt;ref name="facilities"/&gt;

===Occupations and Protests===
In the Spring of 1969 members of the Afro-American Society (AAS) occupied Willard Straight Hall, the Cornell Student Union, in protest against judicial sanctions against several black students and to demand a black studies program. Two days after the students left [[Willard Straight Hall]], a [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) meeting became a "student takeover of Barton Hall" and the Barton Hall Community was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1969: The Awakening of Cornell | publisher = Cornell University | year = 2006 | url = http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/dsoc375/studentproj/Website/chronology.html | accessdate = 2006-09-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912155852/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/dsoc375/studentproj/Website/chronology.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 1972, Barton Hall was again the site of anti-war protests, and one protestor threw a rock through a window.  The rock thrower was mistakenly identified as physics major James R. Bean, who was later suspended and placed on trial for first degree riot, a class E felony. Bean was acquitted after a four-day trial. Before the end of the trial, the District Attorney subpoenaed the defense witnesses to appear before the grand jury to further investigate the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=1&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19721002.2.1.3&amp;e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+Bean-all|title=Jury Finds Bean Innocent Of May 11 Riot Charge|work=Cornell Daily Sun|page=1|date=October 2, 1973|first=Jane|last=Danowitz|volume=89|number=24|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bean trial was a high point in political tensions between the town and the campus and marked an end to efforts to prosecute anti-war protestors off-campus.

===ROTC Training===
For many years, Barton Hall had a non-operational deck gun used in Navy ROTC Training which was fenced off from the general public.  On May 1, 1969, as a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], members of the Students for a Democratic Society broke into the fenced area and painted anti-war slogans on the gun .  In a departure from the practice of handling student disciplinary issues with the campus judicial system, eight of the protesters were prosecuted in the city courts for trespassing, but charges against them were dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=1&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19690505.2.1.2&amp;e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+gun+arrest-all|title=Barton Demonstrators Booked for Trespass|work=Cornell Daily Sun|page=1|volume=85|number=134|date=May 5, 1969|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1969, the week-long trial attracted great publicity because the defense called as witnesses a large number of administrators, trustees, President [[Dale Corson]], and former President [[James A. Perkins]] to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=18&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19691001.2.3.3&amp;e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+Trial-all|title=Hearings End In May Day Trial|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=October 1, 1969|accessdate=2010-12-16|page=3|first=Richard|last=Neubauer|volume=86|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Recaflex track features eight 42-inch lanes, one of the few indoor 200-meter tracks in the country with eight such lanes. Barton also contains a throwing cage with a cement circle and crusher dust landing sector surrounded by a {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} high chain link fence. The interior of the track has a Recaflex runway for the pole vault, two long and triple jump pits and multiple high jump areas. The track itself has a raised aluminum curb and a common finish line.

Barton Hall is also home to the three ROTC Detachments on campus: Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Each branch has a dedicated corner of the building where classes are held in their respective fields.  Lead labs and drill labs also occur in Barton Hall whether on the track floor or within the detachment buildings themselves.

'''''Boulevardier from the Bronx''''' is a 1936 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].

==Plot==
Big-city baseball team with a cocky chicken pitcher named Dizzy Dan plays an exhibition baseball game in Hickville.

The townsfolk of Hickville are at the train stop awaiting Dizzy Dan and the Chicago Giants baseball team. However, the train was stopped a little late, so the townspeople pushed the train depot over to cheer for their honored guest. 
A hen with a blue bonnet is swooned with Dizzy Dan, but her boyfriend Claude, carrying a gnarled bat for the match, grumbles at his girlfriend's idolizing.
Dizzy Dan plays the song Boulevardier from the Bronx to brag his likeness, with some clucking sounds.

Later, at the baseball match, Dizzy Dan is pitching. He lets the rest of his team back off as he prepares to pitch against a pig batter with a [[Babe Ruth]] Caricature. The first pitch was a strike (the ball sent the turtle catcher flying from the reaction), and Dizzy Dan cackles at the batter. Dan pitches again and Strike Two. At the third pitch, Dan struck the batter out, while the ingenious catcher uses a metal chimney pipe to return the ball back to the pitcher, with Dan cackling again.

At the next inning, Claude is pitching against a dachshund batter. He pitches, but nearly beans the batter for Ball One. Claude tries again, but the dachshund connects the hit. Claude tries to catch the ball, but many baseballs fell to the ground and ultimately dropped the chance for an out. The dachshund manages to stretch from base to base and has made a single run to the home base, leaving Claude scratching his head.

Later, Dizzy Dan is at bat while Claude is pitching. Dan arrogantly lets himself have two strikes and then he hits the ball, sending Claude to the back of the stadium wall, dropping the ball from the hard impact. The hen tries to tell Dan to run, but he is biding his time before he manages to complete a single run, along with a familiar cackle.

It's the last half of the inning and the Hickville team has 3 men on base and 2 outs (the score was 3–0, Giants). Dizzy Dan is pitching against Claude, who is getting really tensed in anger against the pitcher. Dan winds up and throws a fastball; Strike One. Dan then throws a slowball that is true to its name. Claude tries to swing it, but it curves for another strike; Dan cackles again. Then Dan pitches a hard fastball; that was when Claude makes a clean hit for a [[Grand slam (baseball)|Grand Slam]] Home Run, conclusively winning the game.

And Claude gives Dizzy Dan the last cackle.

''That's all, folks!''

==Notes==
*This short is a parody of [[St. Louis Cardinals]] pitcher [[Dizzy Dean]], and is loosely based on a song of the same name which was featured in the 1936 [[Warner Bros.]] [[musical film]] ''[[Colleen (1936 film)|Colleen]]''.
*This short is the first Merrie Melodies cartoon to feature the signature theme song, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]''.
*The scenes with a turtle playing catcher, the dachshund batter stretching from base to base, and a pig batter with the Babe Ruth caricature were reused in the 1940 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short, "[[Porky's Baseball Broadcast]]".
*The taunting cackle that Dizzy Dan and Claude uses, sounds similar to a horse. That particular sound was reused in later Looney Tunes cartoons and [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] cartoons.
*The hen with a blue bonnet appeared in two ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts, "[[Let It Be Me (1936 film)|Let It Be Me]]" and "[[A Star Is Hatched]]". She has an uncanny resemblance to [[Miss Prissy]] in the later cartoons.

'''East Lavant''' is one part, which along with '''Mid Lavant''' make up the [[village]] of Lavant in the [[Chichester (district)|Chichester]] [[Districts of England|district]] of [[West Sussex]], England. It lies just east of the A286 road {{convert|2.2|mi}} north of [[Chichester]]. It is in the [[civil parish]] of [[Lavant, West Sussex|Lavant]]. East Lavant has a collection of historic cottages and a public house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chichesterweb.co.uk/frameset.htm?11area.htm~main Chichester Web - The Chichester Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222154214/http://www.chichesterweb.co.uk/frameset.htm?11area.htm~main|date=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manor appears in [[Domesday]] as Loventone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=9328 A Vision of Britain through Time: Lavant Sussex].&lt;/ref&gt;

==St Mary's Church==
St Mary’s Church was founded in the 12th century. The North aisle was added in the 13th century - one of the columns separating the nave from the north aisle remains, the others are 19th-century. The lancet window is also original. The 15th century appears to have brought the five stalls with their [[misericord]]s.

The south tower was constructed in 1671 and the south west window nave window was inserted at the same date. Most of the north aisle, the arcade between the nave and the north aisle, much of the nave and chancel seems to have been rebuilt in 1863.

In 1628, an ecclesiastical case is preserved that relates to a game of [[cricket]] being played at East Lavant on a Sunday. Two defendants, Edward Taylor and William Greentree, were charged with playing cricket at the time of evening service. Taylor argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance. Doing penance involved confessing his guilt to the whole East Lavant congregation the following Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, pp. xxxiv–xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Royal Oak==
This restaurant is called "The Royal Oak".  It is believed to be haunted by a lady in white who appears in a front upper floor bedroom.  In the 1940s it drew national attention due to the famous "Drinking Pig".  A local farmer used to give one of his pigs, the runt of the litter, a drink of beer to build it up. A national paper heard the story and sent a reporter.  Unfortunately the beer had worked and the pig had been slaughtered.  The resourceful farmer merely found another pig and this appeared in the newspaper article.  Thus a fine picture of the pig and the farmer appeared in the paper, with the landlord, James Pafford and his family standing proudly behind the bar.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''The English Football Hall of Fame''' is housed at the [[National Football Museum]], in [[Manchester]], [[England]]. The Hall aims to celebrate and highlight the achievements of the all-time top English footballing talents, as well as non-English players and managers who have become significant figures in the history of the English game. New members are added each year, with an induction ceremony held in the autumn, formerly at varying locations, but exclusively at the Museum itself following its move to Manchester's [[Urbis|Urbis building]] in 2012.

The Hall is on permanent display at the Museum. An accompanying book, ''The Football Hall of Fame: The Official Guide to the Greatest Footballing Legends of All Time'', was first published in October 2005 by [[Robson Books]]. Authored by football historian Rob Galvin and the Museum's founding curator Mark Bushell, it is updated every year with the newest inductees, containing an in-depth profile about the career and reputation of each one, along with a select exhibit from the Museum which relates to their achievements.

==Selection panel==
Members of the Hall of Fame are chosen by a panel. Initially, this comprised ex-players [[Jimmy Armfield]], [[Trevor Brooking|Sir Trevor Brooking]], [[Jimmy Hill]], [[Mark Lawrenson]] and [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]], all of whom had become professional pundits and/or senior figures in football after retiring.

In subsequent years, former [[England national football team|England national team]] manager [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] and former England international [[Steve Hodge]] have also served stints on the panel, though it is now chiefly a grouping of eminent football historians. The current panel features Neil Carter, Tony Collins, Jeffrey Hill, Peter Holme, Dick Holt, John Hughson, [[Simon Inglis]], Alexander Jackson, Gary James, [[Graham Kelly (football administrator)|Graham Kelly]], Tony Mason, Kevin Moore, Martin Polley, Dil Porter, Dave Russell, Matthew Taylor, Jean Williams and John Williams.

All surviving inductees to the Hall are granted an additional place on the panel. Two players have been inducted as the 'Fans' Choice', following polls on the [[BBC Sport]] and [[Sky Sports]] websites.

==History==
Initially, there were three main categories of induction; a mass of 'Players' and 'Managers' from the men's game, together with one figure from the women's game ([[Alf Ramsey|Sir Alf Ramsey]] is noted as the only figure to date honoured in both of the main male categories). To be considered for induction, players must be either retired or at least 30 years of age. All inductees must also have played/managed for at least five years in England.

In 2007, two other regular categories were established. Chiefly, this was in recognition of football's central role in English culture, extending Hall of Fame honours to those who have contributed greatly to the English game outside the more obvious fields of play. The Community Champion category – sponsored by the [[Football Foundation]] – honours professional players who have donated their spare time and money to the [[grassroots]] level of the sport, while the Football for All Award – sponsored by [[The Football Association]] – is presented to pioneers of the various forms of football played by disabled people.

Since 2009, the Museum has also commemorated great teams from history alongside its awarding of individual players and coaches. The criteria for a team's induction is that they must have played at least a quarter of a century prior. 2013 saw the first induction of a [[Referee (association football)|referee]], while 2017 saw the first induction of a figure from the [[Football media coverage in England|football media]].

On occasional circumstances there will also be a presentation of a 'special award', usually to mark significant anniversaries. [[Jimmy Hill]] is to date the sole recipient of an honour styled as a Lifetime Achievement Award, in celebration of his unusual [[polymath]]ic career in the game.

==Other awards==
In 2004, [[Sepp Blatter]], then president of FIFA, was inducted to mark the world federation's centenary. He became the first figure outside the English game to be honoured by the Museum.

In 2007, the Football Foundation Community Champion award was created, with its inaugural holder being [[Niall Quinn]]. The following winners were [[Peter Beardsley]] (2008), [[Robbie Earle]] (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/robbie-earle/|title=ROBBIE EARLE|publisher=National Football Museum|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Graham Taylor]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/graham-taylor/|title=GRAHAM TAYLOR|publisher=National Football Museum|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award has been inactive since then.

Also in 2007, the Football for All Award was created, with its inaugural holder being Stephen Daley, a Northern Irish-born English footballer whose professional career was ended by loss of vision at 18, and later became the captain of the partially sighted England national team. In 2008, Steve Johnson, a regular member of the England squad for amputee football and the leader of [[Everton F.C.|Everton's]] charity venture, [[Everton in the Community]], won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/sport/football/news/southport-footballer-everton-fc-coach-6626612|title=Southport footballer and Everton FC coach Steve Johnson has been inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame|work=Southport Visiter|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ronnie Watson, a footballer who has learning disabilities, won the award. He had been training with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], in preparation for the 2008 European Learning Disability Championship, where he would captain the England LD side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2008/03/02/the-england-team-that-can-win-15550/|title=The England team that can win|work=Metro|date=2 March 2008|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, George Ferguson won the award. Ferguson is a long-time member of Everton's blind football team and secretary of the Visually Impaired Football League. 2013 saw [[David Clarke (Paralympic footballer)|David Clarke]], captain of Great Britain blind football team, win the award. From 2014 to 2017, members of the [[England national cerebral palsy football team|England cerebral palsy team]] were honoured, with [[Matthew Dimbylow|Matt Dimbylow]],&lt;ref name="england legends"/&gt; Gary Davies,&lt;ref name="men"/&gt; [[Martin Sinclair (footballer)|Martin Sinclair]]&lt;ref name="bbc16"/&gt; and Alistair Patrick-Heselton winning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/halloffame/alistair-patrick-heselton/|title=ALISTAIR PATRICK-HESELTON|publisher=National Football Museum|accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of a special award would happen sporadically over the years. In 2007, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]], the world's oldest football club was commemorated for reaching its 150th anniversary. In 2008, [[Michel Platini]], then president of UEFA, became the second figure outside the English game to be honoured by the Museum in an one-off European Hall of Fame ceremony. Two years later, [[Jimmy Hill]] was honoured with a special lifetime achievement award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22268587|title=Jimmy Hill: Match of the Day host who changed football|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Chris|last=Bevan|date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the special award was used three times. Firstly, to [[Civil Service F.C.|Civil Service]], the only surviving club of those represented at the official formation of the Football Association in 1863. Secondly, to [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], the first secretary of [[the Football Association]] and often considered to be its founding father, inducted to mark the governing body's 150th anniversary. Thirdly, to [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], the founder of the Football League was inducted to commemorate the organisation's 125th anniversary. In 2014, the [[Football Battalion]], a group of professional footballers and fans who fought in the [[Battle of the Somme]], were honoured.&lt;ref name="england legends"/&gt; In 2015, [[Sun Jihai]], the first Chinese player in the English game, was made "Anglo-Chinese Football Ambassador". His surprise induction was announced as part of the state visit to the United Kingdom by Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]]. The decision caused controversy on social media with Labour's shadow minister for sport [[Clive Efford]] suggesting that the award had been bought by the office of Prime Minister [[David Cameron]]. A spokesman for the museum explained that Sun had been recognised for his "ambassadorial role in enhancing the profile and popularity of English football to a Chinese audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/23/ex-man-city-chinese-players-hall-of-fame-honour-a-grubby-little-fix?CMP=share_btn_tw |title=Ex-Man City Chinese player's hall of fame honour 'a grubby little fix'  |first1=Helen |last1=Pidd |first2=Frances |last2=Perraudin |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=23 October 2015 |accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, two clubs were honoured: [[Cambridge University A.F.C.|Cambridge University]], for their unofficial claim to be the world's oldest club; some documents in their archive suggest a foundation year of 1856, the year before Sheffield began,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-37701939|title=Cambridge University FA rules football hall of fame honour|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for their status as the world's oldest club currently playing at a professional level; founded in 1862.&lt;ref name="notts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37862511|title=Nottingham Forest and Notts County inducted into football hall of fame|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team awards were introduced in 2008, as part of a one-off European Hall of Fame ceremony. [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s European Cup winning sides of 1968 and 1978 were the first teams inducted.

'''Eugene E. Stone III Stadium''' is a [[soccer]] stadium located in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] on the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]]. The 5,000 seat ground is home to the USC Gamecocks soccer teams since 1981, when the Gamecocks started the men's program in 1978.

The current grandstand was built in 1996 thanks to a [[USD]] 1m grant from Eugene E. Stone III, a Carolina graduate.

The nickname "the Graveyard" comes from the stadium's proximity to House of Peace cemetery.

The women's team plays in the [[Southeastern Conference]], while the men's team plays in [[Conference USA]] (men's soccer is not sanctioned by the SEC;  both SEC schools with the sport play in C-USA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">The '''flip flap''' (also known as the '''''elástico''''', '''''snakebite''''' and '''''la culebrita''''') is a [[dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] move, or [[Dummy (football)#Association football|feint]], in [[association football|football]], used to fool a defensive player into thinking the offensive player, in possession of the ball, is going to move in a direction they do not intend to. Players perform it by using the outside of their dominant foot to push the ball towards their dominant side, then quickly move the dominant foot around the ball and using the inside to push the ball to their non-dominant side. Although the footwork is the most distinctive aspect of the flip-flap, its success as a feint also relies heavily on the attacking player having an explosive acceleration from a stationary position.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt"/&gt;

==History==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="He ([[Sérgio Echigo]]) says now that he invented it, but I perfected it" |source=—[[Rivellino]] on the "flip flap".&lt;ref name="Pitch"&gt;"Football's Greatest - Rivelino". Pitch International LLP. 2012. Retrieved 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The move was invented by the Japanese-Brazilian football player [[Sérgio Echigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footballqatar.com/?p=272|title=Exclusive interview: Rivellino|publisher=footballqatar.com|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Brazilian playmaker [[Rivellino]] learned the move from Echigo, who was his Corinthians teammate in the youth team, and performed it to a global audience during the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name="Goldblatt"/&gt; Interviewed  on the television series ''Football's Greatest'' in 2012, Rivellino states; "He [Echigo] says now that he invented it, but I perfected it".&lt;ref name="Pitch"/&gt;

Rivellino was an idol to a number of Brazilians, and the trick was popularized in the late 1990s and 2000s by high-profile players such as [[Romário]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Ronaldinho]] among others.&lt;ref name="Goldblatt"&gt;David Goldblatt (2009). "The Football Book". p. 129. D Kindersley Ltd,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Rob|title=Ronaldo at 40: Il Fenomeno’s legacy as greatest ever No 9, despite dodgy knees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=17 September 2016|access-date=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Pogba, Rivellino and a short history of the elastico |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/07/paul-pogba-rivellino-and-a-short-history-of-the-elastico |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, especially Nigeria, the move has been referred to as a "Snakebite" or "Zigima" because of the in-and-out feet movement of the perpetrator. However, it is now more commonly called "The Gaúcho" – after Ronaldinho (Gaúcho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Anka |first1=Carl |title=Noughty Boys: Ronaldinho was a magician, we just stood there gawping |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b3cf523a-62e5-40af-91c5-49185d3f1579 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |agency=BBC |date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Free substitution''' is a rule in some sports that allows players to enter and leave the game for other players many times during the course of the game; and for coaches to bring in and take out players an unlimited number of times.

==Sports that allow free substitution==
* '''[[Basketball]]'''. Basketball allows unlimited substitution of players at dead balls, such as full times-out, out-of-bounds turnovers and fouls.  Players are allowed to go out and come in again many times, unless they are disqualified or [[Technical foul|ejected]].  Players are often substituted for, since it is physically difficult to play an entire basketball game (40 minutes in most competitions, 48 in the NBA).  Substitutions are also made if a player is getting too many [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal foul]]s and is in danger of disqualification.
* '''[[Gridiron football]]'''. Players can be changed during any [[dead ball]] situation.  Most college and pro football teams use 11 completely different players on offense and defense.  Often, substitution is made depending on the play being run; for example, a team might bring in a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] or [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] for a rushing play, or several [[wide receiver]]s for a passing play.  There are also major substitutions made for [[special teams]] plays such as punting or kicking a field goal. Players cannot be substituted during live ball play; if a player leaves the field during play without being forced, the player cannot return or be replaced until the next play. (Historically, gridiron-based codes had a [[one-platoon system]] in place that required all players to play all phases of the game. The one-platoon system was largely abolished in the 1940s but aspects of it remained in force in [[college football]] until the 1960s, at which time total free substitution was implemented.)
* '''[[Ice hockey]]'''. Players can be substituted for at any point in the game, even when the puck is in play. There are two exceptions: first, if a team ices the puck they may not make any changes until after the ensuing faceoff. Second, in the event a goaltender leaves the ice in favor of a [[extra attacker|sixth skater]] at any time during play, the [[empty net|goal must remain empty]] until the next stoppage of play. Almost all professional hockey teams use up to four [[line (ice hockey)|lines]] of forwards and three pairings of defensemen in rotation during any given game.

==Sports that do not allow free substitution==
* '''[[Substitute (football)|Association football]]''':  In association football, only a limited of substitutions are allowed (usually three, per [[IFAB]] rules).  Players may only be substituted during a stoppage in play.  Players who leave the game may not return, and if a team runs out of substitutions and loses a player, they must play the rest of the game [[short handed]]. A fourth substitution during extra time is being considered by [[FIFA]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/18/fifa-trial-fourth-substitute-extra-time-olympics&lt;/ref&gt; However, at many amateur levels, free unlimited substitution is allowed when the ball goes out of play.
* '''[[Baseball]] and [[softball]]''': In most leagues, as with association football, a player who is substituted for may not return to the game.  Baseball does not have a cap on the number of substitutions that can be made, although in practice they may not make more substitutions than the number of substitutes they have.  A player inherits the place in the batting order of the player for whom he is substituted, unless multiple people are substituted for at the same time (a [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]]). If a substituted player reenters the game, the umpire must determine who is the substituted player, and that player is ejected from the game. Many youth baseball leagues, such as [[Little League Baseball|Little League]], have a modified version of this rule, in which a player may return to the game one time after being replaced, and some recreational leagues allow unlimited substitution, with the caveat that players who return to the game must return to the same place in the batting order as they were before.
* '''[[Rugby football]]''': Both [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] follow a similar procedure to association football. Limited exceptions to this rule exist in both codes, most notably the [[blood replacement]].
* '''[[Volleyball]]''': Under [[Fédération Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] rules, which are followed by almost all leagues worldwide, teams are limited to six substitutions per set, which can only take place in dead-ball situations. The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] follows this substitution rule in the men's National Collegiate division ([[NCAA Division I|Division I]]/[[NCAA Division II|II]]), but allows 12 substitutions per set in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] men's play and 15 per set in women's play for all divisions. Substitutions involving the libero, a specialist player who can only play in the back row, are not counted against the limit under FIVB rules, but the libero can only be replaced by the player whom he or she replaced (with exceptions in case of injury). The NCAA rules on the libero follow FIVB rules except that in NCAA women's play, the libero is allowed to serve in the same spot in the rotation as the player she replaced.

==Sports with hybrid systems==
* '''[[Interchange (Australian rules football)|Australian rules football]]''':  The most notable sport whose substitution rules have aspects of both free and limited substitution is Australian rules football. In the top-level [[Australian Football League]], each team has a playing squad of 22, of whom 18 are on the field and four are so-called "interchanges". At all levels of the game, players may be interchanged at any time, including during gameplay, but must enter and exit the field through the ''interchange area'', a 15-metre stretch of the boundary line between the teams' benches (with exceptions in case of injury). In the AFL, each team is limited to 90 substitutions per match. Other leagues have different limits on the number of interchanges and the number of substitutions allowed.

'''John Fashanu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|æ|ʃ|ə|n|uː}}, born 18 September 1962) is an English television presenter and former professional [[association football|footballer]] of [[Nigerian]] (paternal) and [[Guyana|Guyanese]] (maternal) descent. In his former career, he was a [[striker (football)|centre-forward]] from 1978 until 1995, most notably in an eight-year spell at [[Wimbledon F.C.]] in which he won the [[FA Cup]] in 1988 and scored over 100 goals in all competitions.

He also played for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Miramar Rangers]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He scored 134 league goals in a career lasting 17 years. He was also capped twice at senior level by [[England national football team|England]], but failed to score on either occasion.

Following his football career he went on to co-host British television show ''[[Gladiators (UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' in the 1990s, and between 2003 and 2004 he managed his own Sunday league football side ''[[Fash FC]]'' on [[Bravo (UK TV Channel)|Bravo]].

==Early life==
Fashanu was born in [[Kensington]], London, the son of Pearl Gopal, a nurse from [[British Guyana]] and Patrick Fashanu, a Nigerian [[barrister]] living in the UK. When his parents split up he was sent, together with his older brother [[Justin Fashanu|Justin]] to a [[Barnardo's]] home. When he was five, he and his brother were fostered by Alf and Betty Jackson and were brought up in [[Shropham]] near [[Attleborough]], [[Norfolk]].

==Football career==

===Early career===
Fashanu's footballing career began at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1979, and he turned professional two years later – just as his brother Justin was transferred to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] from the relegated [[Carrow Road]] club.

Norwich were promoted straight back to the First Division in [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]], but Fashanu managed just five league appearances and scored once. He managed two appearances in the [[1982–83 in English football|1982–83]] First Division campaign – which would be his last for the club.

He had brief loan spell with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and also played in the English off-season in New Zealand with [[Miramar Rangers]], with whom he played in the final of the local equivalent of the FA Cup, the [[1982 Chatham Cup|Chatham Cup]] (he remains the only player to have played in the final of both the English and New Zealand major cup competitions). He joined [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] on a free transfer on 23 September 1983, when they were in the Third Division. He scored seven goals from 26 league games that season, and managed four from 10 league games the following campaign before his £55,000 transfer to Third Division promotion challengers [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 30 November 1984. It was an exciting first season at [[The Den]] for Fashanu, who scored four goals in 25 games but helped the Lions reach the FA Cup quarter-finals (where they lost at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in a game marred by fans who invaded the pitch) and secure promotion to the Second Division. He managed eight goals from 25 games in [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]], before leaving to join [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].

===Wimbledon===
Fashanu made a £125,000 move to Second Division promotion contenders [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in March 1986, when they were pushing for a third promotion in four seasons as they looked to complete a rapid rise from the Fourth Division to the First. At the time, he was the club's record signing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm#1985-86 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930110421/http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm#1985-86 |date=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashanu's four goals from the remaining nine league games helped Wimbledon seal the final promotion place and they were a First Division side a mere nine years after being elected to the [[Football League]] - only the second club in [[Football League]] history to be promoted three divisions in four seasons.

Fashanu and his colleagues settled well into the First Division, surprising all the observers by finishing sixth in the league (briefly topping the table in early September) and finishing above traditional big clubs including [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Fashanu was Wimbledon's top scorer with 11 league goals, and would be a regular goalscorer in the top flight for the Dons for a further seven seasons.

In 1988, Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the [[FA Cup]], beating Liverpool in a final that was billed as a "rags versus riches" affair, although the two clubs were separated by just six places in the First Division - as Liverpool had been the dominant side in English football for some 15 years whereas Wimbledon had played just two seasons in the First Division and only 11 as a Football League club. He performed well in the league, scoring 14 goals.

He also scored Wimbledon's goal as Liverpool defeated them 2–1 in that year's Charity Shield. Fashanu claimed two [[England national football team|England]] [[cap (sport)|cap]]s – against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in a friendly tournament in May 1989.

During his time at Wimbledon, Fashanu scored 126 goals. His best season was [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]], when he was the First Division's second highest scorer with 20 goals as his side finished seventh.

He received criticism during the ([[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]]) when a clash with [[Gary Mabbutt]], then Spurs captain, in an aerial challenge left the Spurs defender with a broken skull and eye socket.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-mabbutts-skull-fractured-in-fashanu-clash-referee-asks-to-view-the-match-video-1506861.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Football: Mabbutt's skull fractured in Fashanu clash: Referee asks to view the match video | first=Clive | last=White | date=26 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashanu had already established a reputation by that point of being an aggressive and physical striker, and this was seen as another example of that behaviour. At that time synonymous with Wimbledon's "Crazy Gang" which had built up a reputation for this sort of play, also exhibited by the likes of [[Vinnie Jones]] and earlier on by [[Eric Young (footballer, born 1960)|Eric Young]].&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

===Aston Villa===
On 4 August 1994, just before the start of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]], Fashanu was sold to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for £1.35million. However, injury restricted him to just 13 games and 3 goals for a Villa side who narrowly avoided relegation that season. He managed a goal on his Villa debut when they drew 2–2 at [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on the opening day of the Premier League season, his other two goals coming in successive games against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and then Nottingham Forest in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesv/villa95.html |title=Premiership Review 1994/95 Aston Villa |publisher=Rsssf.com |date=1995-06-26 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashanu's last game was on 4 February 1995 away at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in a Premiership game that they lost 1–0. In a tackle with [[Ryan Giggs]] he snapped his knee ligaments and was stretchered off.&lt;ref name="442int"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/john-fashanu-one-one | title=John Fashanu One on One | publisher=www.fourfourtwo.com | accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the season, Fashanu retired as a result of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39849 |title=Football photographic encyclopedia, footballer, world cup, champions league, football championship, olympic games &amp; hero images by |publisher=Sporting-heroes.net |date= |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 he hit the front pages as well as the back when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' published allegations of [[match fixing]] against Fashanu, fellow Wimbledon player [[Hans Segers]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] goalkeeper [[Bruce Grobbelaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jan/19/football.uknews|title=The big gamble that so nearly paid off|first=Vivek|last=Chaudhary|date=19 January 2001|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3100083.stm|title=Paper stands by Fashanu fixing story|date=27 July 2003|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three players were eventually cleared of the allegations in a subsequent court case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/football-stars-cleared-over-match-fixing-charges-1244249.html|title=Football stars cleared over match fixing charges|date=8 August 1997|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Fashanu represented England at full International level gaining two [[cap (sport)|caps]] – against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in the [[1989 Rous Cup]], due to his good form at club level for his then club [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. He was also eligible to play for Nigeria and since retiring he has expressed regret in not being able to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ng/news/4093/nigerian-football/2015/01/26/8321842/john-fashanu-expresses-regret-at-not-playing-for-nigeria|title=John Fashanu expresses regret at not playing for Nigeria - Goal.com|website=www.goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-football career ==
Following retirement from the game through injury, Fashanu became a television presenter. He presented the UK edition of ''[[Gladiators (UK TV series)|Gladiators]]'' alongside [[Ulrika Jonsson]] in the 1990s. In 2003, he came second in the second series of ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!]]''. Later that year he presented ''Fash's Football Challenge'', a reality television show that followed Fashanu managing an amateur football team. Also in 2003, he fronted a six-part series for [[ITV1]] based on the American format ''[[Man vs. Beast]]'', however following protests from animal rights groups, the series was never broadcast. He also released a video "Focus on Fitness with Fash". He is now host of ''[[Deal or No Deal Nigeria]]'', airing on [[M-Net|M-Net Africa]].

Since retirement Fashanu has also maintained his sporting connections, becoming involved with the [[Nigeria Football Association]], and as chairman of Welsh football team [[Barry Town F.C.|Barry Town]] for one year, vacating this post in 2003.

In 2000, he also compiled, all with an investigator, a report on corruption in Nigeria in the 1980s and 1990s that came to be known as the Fashanu Report.&lt;ref name="AllAfrica.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200007030508.html | title=Nigeria: Senate backs debt buy-back to reduce external debts |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com|Daily Independent]] | date=2 July 2000 | first= | last= | accessdate = 24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he became the manager of his own Sunday league football team [[Fash FC]] as part of a television reality show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382421/|title=Football Challenge (2003– )|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|1|1}}

In September 2005 Wimbledon Old Players’ Association was launched. John is involved in the Wimbledon Old Players' Association, an organisation set up by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association. He said: "It’s going to be great to be back as part of the Wimbledon family. As an ex-Wimbledon player, I know all about the heroics of the likes of [[Roy Law]] and [[Dickie Guy]] in the old days, as well as what the new boys have been doing at [[AFC Wimbledon]]".

In 2007, ''[[The Times]]'' named him 22nd out of the 50 worst footballers to have played in the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2025420.ece |title=The 50 worst footballers|publisher=Timesonline.co.uk|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=2015-10-10}} {{subscription required|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Fashanu, who in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200004100236.html | title=Nigeria: Tracking The Fashanu Report |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com|Daily Independent]] | date=10 April 2000 | first= | last= | accessdate = 24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; accused [[Bob Minton]] and [[Ibrahim Babangida]] of stealing money from Nigeria, apologised saying "I can say it again and again, that there was nothing like debt buy-back or any billions stacked away in any account anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200908190485.html | title=Nigeria: Fashanu in Public Court |publisher=[[AllAfrica.com|Daily Independent]] | date=18 August 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate = 24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minton said that Fashanu was given false information by the [[Church of Scientology]] to attack him.&lt;ref name="AllAfrica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thenewsng.com/nation/season-of-apologies/2009/08 | title=Season of Apologies |publisher=[[Alternative Press in Nigeria|The News Nigeria]] | date=17 August 2009  | first= | last= | accessdate = 24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx1-H3HrKtM |title=Scientology: The Nigeria Debate |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2015-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chess]], particularly in [[chess endgame|endgames]], a '''key square''' (also known as a ''critical square'') is a square such that if a player's [[king (chess)|king]] can occupy it, he can force some gain such as the [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] of a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] or the capture of an opponent's pawn.  Key squares are useful mostly in endgames involving only kings and pawns.  In the [[king and pawn versus king endgame]], the key squares depend on the position of the pawn and are easy to determine.  Some more complex positions have easily determined key squares while other positions have harder-to-determine key squares.  Some positions have key squares for both [[White and Black in chess|White and Black]].
{{AN chess|pos=toc}}

==King and pawn versus king==
{{main|King and pawn versus king endgame}}

In an endgame with a king and pawn versus a king, the key squares are relative to the position of the pawn.  Assume that White has the pawn.  If the white king can occupy a key square, he can force the promotion of the pawn but accurate play is required.  Whether or not the white king can reach a key square depends on the position of the pieces and which player is to move {{harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2007|pp=20–22}}.

|Dots are key squares for a rook pawn.  In addition, Black stops the pawn if the black king gets to any of the squares marked with "&lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;".
}}
An advanced {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} generally has two key squares: the two squares on the adjacent {{chessgloss|file}} that touch the promotion square, i.e. b7 and b8 for a white a-pawn, and g7 and g8 for a white h-pawn. The key squares are indicated by the black dots in the position in the diagram. If White's king can reach either of the two key squares, he can keep Black's king away and the pawn will promote. If the Black king can reach any of the squares marked with a dot or an "&lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;", it stops the pawn – either by blocking the pawn or preventing the white king from reaching a key square {{Harvcol|Silman|2007|pp=105–6}}.

{{clear}}
Pawns other than rook pawns have more key squares. If the pawn is on the second, third, or fourth {{chessgloss|rank}}, there are three key squares – the square two squares in front of the pawn and the squares to the left and right of that square. The key squares are indicated by the black dots in the diagrams above.  If the pawn is on the fifth or sixth rank, there are six key squares: the square in front of the pawn and the squares to the left and right, as well as the square two squares in front of the pawn, and the squares to the left and right of it, see the middle diagram.  When the pawn is on the seventh rank, the key squares are the squares on the seventh and eighth rank that touch the pawn's square (see the diagram on the right).

An easy way to remember the key squares is to note that if the pawn is not beyond the midpoint of the board, there are three key squares that are two ranks ahead.  If the pawn is on the fifth or sixth rank there are six key squares on the two ranks in front of the pawn.  If the pawn is on the seventh rank, the adjoining squares on the seventh and eighth ranks are key squares {{harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2007|pp=16–18}}.

There is an exception to the key squares rule with a {{chessgloss|knight pawn}} on its sixth rank, the defending king in the corner, and the defender to move.  In the diagram, with the white king on either the square indicated or the square marked by "&lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;", the position is [[stalemate]] if Black is to move.

|Key squares for blocked pawns (white dots for the white king; black dots for the black king)
}}
In a position with a blocked pair of pawns (opposing pawns on the same {{chessgloss|file}}, the key squares for a player's king extend for three files on either side of the opponent's pawn.  In this position, the first king to reach one of his key squares will win the opponent's pawn and protect his own.  Even though the white king is farther away from the pawns, White wins if he moves first:
:'''1. Kg3{{chesspunc|!}} Kb7'''
:'''2. Kf4 Kc7'''
:'''3. Ke5 Kd7'''
:'''4. Kd5 Kc7'''
:'''5. Ke6''' 
The white king reaches a key square.
:'''5... Kc8'''
:'''6. Kd6 Kb7'''
:'''7. Kd7 Kb8'''
:'''8. Kc6 Ka7'''
:'''9. Kc7 Ka8'''
:'''10. Kxb6''' and White wins (see [[king and pawn versus king endgame]]) {{harvcol|de la Villa|2008|pp=172–73}}.

|White to move, does not go directly to a key square
}}
When both kings can reach a key square, a position of [[mutual zugzwang]] may occur.  The first king to attack the opposing pawn must save a square for attack and defense (the squares marked "&lt;big&gt;×&lt;/big&gt;").  With White to move:
:'''1. Kd7!''' 
The only winning move; all other moves lose.  For instance, if 1.Kd6{{chesspunc|??}} then 1...Kf5 puts White in [[zugzwang]] and Black wins.
:'''1... Kf5'''
:'''2. Kd6!''' 
Now Black is in zugzwang.
:'''2... Kg6'''
:'''3. Kxe6''' and White wins {{harvcol|de la Villa|2008|p=173}}.

In this example, White would win if his king could get to any of the key squares (marked by the white dots). But Black is able to prevent this and [[draw (chess)|draw]] the game – with or without the move.  For example:
:'''1. Kd2 Kd5'''
:'''2. Ke3 Ke5''' 
The only move to draw.
:'''3. Kf3 Kf5'''

}}

With a king and pawn versus a lone king, it is important to get the attacking king to ''any'' key square and the path to a key square is not always direct.  For instance, in the diagram, the key squares for the white king are b5, c5, and d5.  Black can prevent the white king from reaching a key square directly, for example:
:'''1. Kd2 Ke7''' 
:'''2. Kd3 Kd7 
:'''3. Kc4 Kc6''' 
Taking the [[Opposition (chess)|opposition]]; however, the white king can reach a key square (b5) by going on the other side of the pawn:
:'''1. Kc2! Ke7'''
:'''2. Kb3 Kd6'''
:'''3. Kb4 Kc6 
:'''4. Kc4''' 
Opposition, and Black is in [[zugzwang]].
:'''4... Kd6'''
:'''5. Kb5''' 
or 
:'''4... Kb6'''
:'''5. Kd5'''
and the white king has occupied a key square and has a winning position {{harvcol|Müller|Lamprecht|2007|p=20}}.

The '''La Crosse Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in downtown [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], built in 1980. The arena can seat between 5,000 and 7,500, depending on the type of event.

The Center is also a convention center. In addition to the arena, which offers {{convert|21600|sqft|m2|-1}} of exhibit space, two locker rooms, and three dressing rooms, there is {{convert|14935|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} North Hall, which can open up to the arena to be used in combination; and a {{convert|38740|sqft|m2|0|adj=on}} South Exhibit Hall. All three venues total {{convert|75275|sqft|m2|0}} of exhibit space.  The complex also contains {{convert|9432|sqft|m2|0}} of space in five meeting rooms, which can be divided into nine meeting rooms.

While both exhibit halls and the arena are used for trade shows, conventions, meetings and banquets, the arena is also used for sporting events, [[concerts]], [[circus]]es, ice shows, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Parlin|first=Geri|title=Show Time: La Crosse Center's Success Due to Expansion and Crowds|url=http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_676253f8-5aac-11e1-91b0-001871e3ce6c.html|work=[[La Crosse Tribune]]|accessdate=October 8, 2012|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the center is home to countless exhibits and shows. One noteworthy event is the annual Bi-State Classic high school wrestling tournament. The center holds ten full-size wrestling mats and up to 55 wrestling squads.

The most recent change to the La Crosse Center was a fifty-foot skywalk spanning over Second Street in downtown La Crosse.  The skywalk links a five floor parking ramp with the east end of the convention center.

The La Crosse Center is situated less than 300 feet (91.44 meters) from the banks of the [[Mississippi River]], and Riverside Park in Downtown La Crosse.

==Tenants==
The La Crosse Skating Sirens began competing at the La Crosse Center in 2009. The Skating Sirens are a nationally "bouting" women's flat-track roller derby team.

==Manufacturing conditions==
Mikasa manufactures products in [[Thailand]] and has been accused of [[workplace bullying|workplace brutality]] and [[human rights]] violations in some factories. The [[International Trade Union Confederation]], published a report alleging "systematic anti-union campaigns" by Mikasa.&lt;ref name="ituc"&gt;2007 Annual Survey of violations of trade union rights - Thailand: Violations in 2006, International Trade Union Confederation, 2007, [http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=THA&amp;IDLang=EN survey07.ituc-csi.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195904/http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=THA&amp;IDLang=EN |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report detailed various allegations:
{{cquote|Supervisors intensively monitored and penalised union leaders through discriminatory transfers and disciplinary procedures for trumped up infractions. Union committee members were prevented from working overtime, compelled to take unpaid leave, separated from their fellow workers, and publicly humiliated by senior managers, in one case destroying their work then ordering them to fix it. When three union committee members publicly protested against the factory’s actions against workers, the management sued them in court for defamation.

When a union committee member who was pregnant [[miscarriage|miscarried]] during her day shift at the factory, she requested the factory to send her to a local hospital. Management refused, and instead sent her to the medical room at the factory, where she was forced to wait until the evening when a friend from another factory came and took her to hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name="ituc" /&gt;}}
Through such practices, the ITUC argued, Mikasa succeeded in either firing or forcing the resignation of the entire union committee (except the union president), essentially destroying the [[labor rights|right of its workers to organize]].

A separate report, by the Thai Labor Campaign alleged that new Mikasa factory workers received only 173 [[baht]] per day ([[USD|$]]4.36 per day) in 2006.&lt;ref name="tlc"&gt;The Life of Football Factory Workers in Thailand, Junya Lek Yimprasert, Thai Labor Campaign, June 30, 2006, [http://www.cleanclothes.org/documents/Life_football_workers_of_thailand.pdf PDF from CleanClothes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613061029/http://cleanclothes.org/documents/Life_football_workers_of_thailand.pdf |date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morphettville Racecourse''' is the main [[horse racing]] [[race track|track]] for the [[Australian]] state of [[South Australia]]. It is situated in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Morphettville, South Australia|Morphettville]], and is about 10&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Adelaide city centre]]. It is home to the [[South Australian Jockey Club]].

==History==
After years of using grounds at the East Parklands ("The Old Adelaide Racecourse", later known as [[Victoria Park, Adelaide|Victoria Park]]) rented from the Adelaide City Council, a group which became the [[South Australian Jockey Club]] began using a racecourse ("Thebarton Racecourse" or "The Butchers' Course") at present-day [[Mile End, South Australia|Mile End]] formed on grazing land owned by [[E. M. Bagot]] and [[Gabriel Bennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106516117 |title=Fifty Years of Racing (19) |newspaper=[[The Daily Herald (Adelaide)]] |volume=9, |issue=2594 |location=South Australia |date=13 July 1918 |accessdate=30 July 2017 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}} Much of Seth Ferry's account is at variance with contemporary news reports.&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[River Torrens]] from 1859 to 1869, when the course was abandoned due to insufficient patronage. After five or six years of existence in name only, the SAJC acquired, thanks to the generosity of Sir [[Thomas Elder]], its own freehold property at Morphettville ("The Bay of Biscay Course") and held its first meeting there on 3 January 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31963998 |title=South Australian Jockey Club |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The South Australian Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1858 - 1889)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=4 January 1876 |accessdate=2 January 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakaway group, which became the [[Adelaide Racing Club]], continued to hold race meetings at "The Old Racecourse".

In 2008, firstly [[Victoria Park, Adelaide|Victoria Park]], and then in 2009 [[Cheltenham Park Racecourse|Cheltenham Park]] were discontinued as racing facilities in South Australia, and now races are conducted only at Morphettville.

==Race courses==
The course proper at Morphettville is a long, flat course with a circumference of 2,307&amp;nbsp;metres. The track is 32&amp;nbsp;metres wide and features wide turns with a camber of 4% that provide every chance for strong finishers. A retractable winning post with hydraulics enables the SAJC the flexibility to alternate the running of races with minimal damage to both tracks especially with races taking place mid week and increased racing through the winter months. It was installed in 2009, and is a world first.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The second track, known as "The Parks", was official opened in June 2009. The Morphettville Parks track has a circumference of 2100&amp;nbsp;metres, and the track is 25&amp;nbsp;m wide and 5% chamber on the turns. It provides a fair chance for all runners. A chute through the centre of the course that runs between the 850&amp;nbsp;m and 1,550&amp;nbsp;m points provides for 1250, 1300 and 1400&amp;nbsp;metre starts.

==Wetlands==
The Morphettville Racecourse Wetland was an initiative of the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board and the [[South Australian Jockey Club]]. It was constructed by the Board and the Jockey Club during 2001/2002.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naturalresources.sa.gov.au/files/sharedassets/adelaide_and_mt_lofty_ranges/nrm_education/morphettville-wetland-fact.pdf|title=Morphettville Racecourse Wetlands|last=|first=|date=2017-09-19|website=Natural Resources South Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wetland covers an area of 3.5&amp;nbsp;hectares, in the middle of the racecourse on the corner of Anzac Highway and Morphett Road. Costing $2.4 million to construct, it includes 100,000 plants, with the soil excavated being used to raise the level of the racecourse track.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The catchment area for the wetland includes stormwater flow from two drains in Bray Street, south of the racecourse. Water enters a sediment pond where floating litter is collected in a net and large materials settle out. The water is then piped into the wetland, where it travels through a series of deep and shallow marshes. An aquifer storage and recovery system (ASR) has been constructed at the wetland. The water flowing out of the wetland is ideal for irrigation as it has very low salinity. During winter months, water is captured and pumped into a tertiary limestone aquifer below the racecourse. During the summer months, the water in the aquifer is recovered and used for irrigation. Up to 600&amp;nbsp;megalitres of water a year is recharged into the aquifer, which exceeds the amount required to irrigate the racecourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Access==
The racecourse is just off Anzac Highway, Morphett Rd, Morphettville. Entry is via Morphett Rd entrance or Tramway entrance. The [[Glenelg Tram]] operates throughout the day from North Tce, and Victoria Square (Adelaide), through to Moseley Square (Glenelg). The tram stops on Morphett Road adjacent to the Morphettville Racecourse (Stop 12). A taxi rank is located inside the Members' Car Park, where taxis will make pick ups and drop offs throughout the day. Car parking at Morphettville can be found at the following locations: Morphett Road Adjacent to the Members' entrance on the opposite side of the road to the racecourse. Anzac Highway, Morphettville Junction car park, entrance to the racecourse over the tram line.

'''Mount Vernon Sports Stadium''' was a former sports and greyhound racing stadium on Daldowie Road, [[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon]], in the south-east of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.

The sports stadium was built on the site of the Daldowie Colliery on the south side of the [[Argyle Line|Argyle railway line]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/267143/662998/12/100954|title=OS Plan 1956-1965|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Andrew Beattie of Forest Street, [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] gained planning permission from the Lanarkshire council in early 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =294|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The build cost over £3,500 and the stadium could accommodate 4,000 spectators. The greyhound racing was independent (unlicensed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furby|first=R|title=Independent Greyhound Racing|page =85|year=1968|publisher=New Dominion House}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first race took place on 10 October 1927. Race distances included 260, 450, 620 and 815 yards. The track was a leading independent track and offered prize money levels that matched or surpassed many [[National Greyhound Racing Club]] licensed tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =294|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading race events held at Mount Vernon were the Mount Vernon Derby and Mount Vernon St Leger. 

The track closed in 1990 and was demolished in 2007 with the site now consisting of grassland sitting next door to a waste recycling centre and a dogs trust.

'''Papi fut''' or '''Papi futbol''' is a popular [[Central America]]n variety of [[association football|football]] played on specially constructed outdoor courts also usable for regulation [[basketball]]. It is similar to [[FIFA]] football, but goals must be scored from within the goal area. There is also frequently a rule that a ball over head height counts as out-of-bounds.
This game can also be played at indoor facilities and inclusively in artificial grass courts, very common in countries like Costa Rica, where it is commonly referred to as Futbol 5 ("5" as a reference to the number of players per team that the game consists of).

'''Pride Park Stadium''', commonly known as '''Pride Park''', is an [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Derby]], England, that is the home ground of [[English Football League]] club [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. With a capacity of 33,597, it is the [[List of English football stadiums by capacity|16th-largest]] football ground in England and the 20th-largest stadium in the United Kingdom. Located on [[Pride Park]], a business park on the outskirts of Derby city centre, the stadium was built as part of the commercial redevelopment of the area in the 1990s. Derby County have played at the ground since it opened in 1997 as a replacement for their former home, the [[Baseball Ground]]. Due to sponsorship, the venue was officially known as the '''iPro Stadium''' between 2013 and 2016.

Pride Park has hosted two full international matches, [[England national football team|England]] vs. [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in 2001 and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] vs. [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in 2010, and several [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] matches. It was also the venue of the 2009 [[FA Women's Cup]] Final.

==History==

===Planning and development===
Before moving to the Pride Park Stadium, [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] had played at the [[Baseball Ground]] since 1895. Although at its peak the ground had held over 40,000 (the record attendance being 41,826 for a match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="BBGArticle"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-derbys-muddy-oasis-of-sulphur-and-spectacle-1260743.html| publisher =The Independent| title =Derby's muddy oasis of sulphur and spectacles | date = 10 May 2010 | location=London | first=Jon | last=Culley}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Taylor Report]], actioned after the [[1988–89 in English football|1989]] [[Hillsborough Disaster]] had seen the legal requirement for English football stadia to become all-seater by [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] &lt;ref name="PPArticle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beehive.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&amp;ID=11165&amp;PageID=65873 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926231650/http://beehive.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&amp;ID=11165&amp;PageID=65873 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |title=From a tip to super stadium in 46 Weeks |publisher= This Is Derbyshire|date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in its capacity dwindling to just 17,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then-ambitious [[Football League Championship|second tier club]].&lt;ref name="BBGArticle"/&gt; An additional problem came with the ground's wooden components (considered unacceptable in the wake of the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] in [[1984–85 in English football|1985]]) and, in February 1996, chairman [[Lionel Pickering]] made the decision to move the club to a new stadium, having originally planned to rebuild the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt;

The club originally planned to build a purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at [[Pride Park]], with 4,000 car parking spaces, restaurant and conference facilities, a fitness centre, a supporters club and new training ground. A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a £46 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; [[Peter Gadsby]], however, the club's associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company, felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new Chairman [[Lionel Pickering]] to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000,&lt;ref name="PPSOS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prideparkstadium.com/web/pridepark/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074458/http://www.prideparkstadium.com/web/pridepark/history |archivedate=30 August 2010 |title=Pride Park Stadium – History |publisher= Pride Park Stadium |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; However, despite signing a construction agreement with [[Taylor Woodrow]], Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park [[business park]], settling with [[Derby City Council]] for a smaller site than previously agreed.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a £16&amp;nbsp;million state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]].

Derby City Council were paid £1.8&amp;nbsp;million for the land and the club's four directors – Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid £2.5&amp;nbsp;million towards a package deal to pay for the stadium.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt;  The stadium itself was based upon [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]'s [[Riverside Stadium]], which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; After toying with the idea of naming the new ground "The New Baseball Ground", it was settled that the club's new home would be called The Pride Park Stadium.

===Construction===
Engaging the same architects as Middlesbrough (The Miller Partnership)&lt;ref name="PPS2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mortimer|first= Gerald |title= Derby County: The Complete Record|publisher=Breedon Books|year= 2006|page=56|isbn= 1-85983-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby's plans predominantly followed those of the Riverside Stadium, with the first stage being a detached main stand facing a horseshoe running unbroken round the other three sides, with the possibility of the corners being filled in later and the ground's capacity being increased if and when necessary by raising the horseshoe roof.&lt;ref name="PPS1"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mortimer|first= Gerald |title= Derby County: The Complete Record|publisher=Breedon Books|year= 2006|page=55|isbn= 1-85983-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|width=20%|align=left|quote="From my youth I only remember this area as railway sidings and a municipal tip and what has happened to Pride Park is wonderful for Derby. So many businesses were attracted to the site once we had moved. I still get a buzz when I arrive for a home game – it’s a dramatic sight, a true county landmark."|source=- Lionel Pickering &lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt;}}

Pickering laid the foundation stone in November 1995&lt;ref name="PPS2"/&gt; and, after decontamination, the first of the more than 1,000 pre-cast concrete piles&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; was sunk in September 1996.&lt;ref name="PPS2"/&gt; This was followed by 6,500 tonnes of concrete and more than 2,100 tonnes of steelwork as the ground began to take shape.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; Tapping into the excitement amongst supporters, the club set up a visitors centre which included a computer-generated tour of the stadium taking shape&lt;ref name="PPS2"/&gt; and attracted more than 75,000 fans.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt; The opportunity was also made available for supporters to buy special bricks – on to which they could engrave a message of their choosing – which would be set around the outside of the completed stadium.&lt;ref name="PPArticle"/&gt;

The weather of the 1996 winter was not kind to the contractors but extra urgency was provided  by the news that the stadium was to be opened by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]].&lt;ref name="PPS2"/&gt; This news – the first time the Queen had opened a new football stadium – ensured that the workers, at one point behind schedule, had to pull out all of the stops to get the stadium completed in time. The pitch stood at {{convert|105|m}} long and {{convert|68|m}} wide, meeting the requirements for an international venue, and measured {{convert|5|yd|spell=in}} longer and {{convert|4|yd|spell=in}} wider than the pitch at the Baseball Ground. It also came with a {{convert|3|m|spell=in|adj=on}} grass margin.

===Opening===
[[Image:PPS-EastStand01.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The East Stand.]]
The Queen opened the stadium on 18 July 1997 in front of 30,000 spectators. By this time the south west corner, which stood between the main stand and the horseshoe, had been completed. The interest from potential corporate clients had been so high that Pickering pressed the board to go the full distance with the stadium, raising the final initial costs of completing the stadium to £22&amp;nbsp;million. Work was still in progress on the remaining corner on the opening day, leaving [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] to jokingly ask Taylor Woodrow contract manager Ross Walters, "Haven't you been paid yet?"&lt;ref name="PPS3"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mortimer|first= Gerald |title= Derby County: The Complete Record|publisher=Breedon Books|year= 2006|page=57|isbn= 1-85983-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overture to the opening ceremony came two weeks later, on 4 August 1997, with the first ever game at Pride Park Stadium being played against [[Football in Italy|Italian]] side [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], the match ending in a 1–0 defeat with [[Vincenzo Montella]] scoring the only goal of the game. The attendance of 29,041 was the highest for a Derby County home game in 20 years.&lt;ref name="Sampgame"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Leaving-grand-old-Baseball-Ground-heartbreaking/story-16881086-detail/story.html| publisher =''Derby Telegraph''| title =Leaving grand old Baseball Ground was heartbreaking but we're set for the future with our shiny new stadium| date =12 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001856/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Leaving-grand-old-Baseball-Ground-heartbreaking/story-16881086-detail/story.html| archivedate =24 September 2015| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preseason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~1056118,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009174504/http://www.dcfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~1056118,00.html |archivedate=9 October 2007 |title=Europeans at Pride Park |publisher= dcfc.co.uk|date=21 June 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fixture kicked off a tradition of pre-season friendlies being held against European teams at the ground, with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (twice), [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]] all visiting the stadium over the next six years.&lt;ref name="preseason"/&gt;

The first competitive fixture to be completed at the new stadium came on 30 August 1997 and ended in a 1–0 win against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in front of 27,232, with [[Stefano Eranio]] scoring the only goal from the penalty spot.  The stadium's inaugural competitive fixture against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] was called off with the score at 2–1 after the floodlights went out in the 11th minute of the second half. Referee [[Uriah Rennie]] abandoned the match following a delay of more than half-an-hour while engineers tried unsuccessfully to restart two failed generators. Gadsby said, "We had 11 maintenance people on duty including six electricians but nobody has yet worked out why both generators failed. There was a bang of such strength that it fused them both."&lt;ref name="Firstgameaband"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-derbys-big-night-ends-in-the-dark-1245444.html| publisher =The Independent| title = Derby's big night ends in the dark | date = 14 August 1997 | location=London | first=Phil | last=Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved to be the only major problem with the new stadium, which delivered everything which had been promised of it and went on to gain international recognition.&lt;ref name="PPS3"/&gt; Later additions to the ground raised the capacity to 33,597 and a final cost of £28&amp;nbsp;million.

===Ownership issues===
Although the financing of the stadium's construction was carefully structured so that the club paid and owned the ground without encroaching on funds reserved for the development of the team, the club's eventual relegation from the top flight in [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2002]] saw it enter financial crisis&lt;ref name="relegation"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2716241.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| title = Derby counting the cost| date = 2 February 2003 | first=Paul | last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually it was temporarily entered into [[receivership]] by [[The Co-operative Bank]], who instantly installed a new board composed of [[John Sleightholme]], [[Jeremy Keith]] and Steve Harding, for the cost of £1 each. Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to £30&amp;nbsp;million plus and an unpopular&lt;ref name="unpop"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mortimer|first= Gerald |title= Derby County: The Complete Record|publisher=Breedon Books|year= 2006|page=58|isbn= 1-85983-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the "mysterious"&lt;ref name="affront"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mortimer|first= Gerald |title= Derby County: The Complete Record|publisher=Breedon Books|year= 2006|page=39|isbn= 1-85983-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panama]]-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of £1&amp;nbsp;million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as "an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]".&lt;ref name="affront"/&gt; The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were dubbed "The Three Amigos" and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby's support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed "The League of Gentlemen" by the local press, led by former board member [[Peter Gadsby]], in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4954484.stm|title=Derby takeover deal is completed|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, [[Murdo Mackay]], [[Jeremy Keith]] and finance director Andrew McKenzie were charged with taking a secret commission worth £440,625 from the club and were sentenced to a combined seven-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite news |title=Two guilty of club takeover fraud |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/8119183.stm |work=BBC News |date=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2009, the club still owed £15&amp;nbsp;million on the mortgage of the Pride Park Stadium&lt;ref name="debts"&gt;{{cite web| title=Appleby: Rams' finances in fine health| publisher=[[derbytelegraph.co.uk]]| url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/finances-fine-health/story-11596332-detail/story.html| date=21 August 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033920/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/finances-fine-health/story-11596332-detail/story.html| archivedate=24 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later revealed to be due to be paid off in 2016.&lt;ref name="Glickinterview"&gt;{{cite web| title=Glick insists owners have a long-term goal as he answers fans' questions on Rams future| publisher=derbytelegraph.co.uk| url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Glick-insists-owners-long-term-goal-answers-fans-questions-Rams-future/story-11608260-detail/story.html| date=11 October 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923230911/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Glick-insists-owners-long-term-goal-answers-fans-questions-Rams-future/story-11608260-detail/story.html| archivedate=23 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three squares would also be introduced which would be named after legendary figures associated with the club – all-time leading goalscorer [[Steve Bloomer]], the club's greatest manager [[Brian Clough]] and former chairman [[Lionel Pickering]], who had died in 2006. The club insisted no money would be taken away from the team to pay for the development.&lt;ref name="Plaza"/&gt; On 9 November 2007, [[Derby City Council]] agreed to let the plans go ahead. Following promotion to the Premier League in the 2006–07 season, the club announced plans to expand the capacity of the stadium up to 44,000 for the start of the 2008–09 season, if the club successfully survived.

These plans have been scaled down from the planned £20&amp;nbsp;million pound development proposed in 2007.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-15147480| publisher = BBC News| title = Derby County submits plans for new Pride Park plaza| date = 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby County CEO Tom Glick said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which will be introduced in the [[The Football League|Football League]] from 2012, as revenue from the plaza will be reinvested back into the club.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2 statement"/&gt;

This planned development also coincides with a plan from the city council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed plaza.&lt;ref name="Plaza 2"/&gt;

On 12 January 2012, [[Derby City Council]]'s planning control committee gave planning permission for the development,&lt;ref name="2012 planning permission"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/press-release-planning-consent-approved-256826.aspx| publisher = dcfc.co,uk| title = Council Gives Planning Consent| date = 12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derby County chief executive Tom Glick said that the club had moved to the next stage of the development, finding a development company to build the plaza.&lt;ref name="2012 planning permission"/&gt;

It was announced on 3 May 2013 that the first phase was to be launched after the last game of the [[2012–13 in English football|2012–13 season]] when Derby County faced [[Millwall F.C.|Milwall]]. Located in the north east corner of the stadium and close to the DCFC megastore, the initial phase will provide a mixture of retail and restaurant units totalling 7,000sq.ft. The development is being undertaken jointly by the club and Cedar House Investments, part of former chairman [[Peter Gadsby]]'s Ark Capital group of companies. John Vicars, chief operating officer at Derby County, welcomed the launch by saying, "We see this development attracting perhaps a convenience retailer, and a restaurant to complement the facilities already available on Pride Park and to provide a greater choice. With the opening of the new multi-use sports arena and [[velodrome]] adjacent to the club, there will be even greater demand for these facilities." [[Peter Gadsby]] said: "The area is already a proven destination for leading occupiers including [[Greggs]], [[Frankie &amp; Benny's]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and [[Starbucks]]. I am particularly keen that this scheme will add to the success of Pride Park and provide further amenities for the 10,000 people that are working in the area. It is good news that this phase of the development will create a further 25 jobs."&lt;ref name="First Phase"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/the-plaza-pride-park-first-phase-805700.aspx|title=The Plaza @ Pride Park: First Phase|date=3 May 2013|publisher=dcfc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A phase 2 of the plaza will be considered once the velodrome has opened and will add further to the vitality and vibrancy of Pride Park. Derby-based FHP have been appointed as [[letting agent]]s for the scheme.

===Renaming the stadium===
On 7 December 2013, Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium in a £7&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship deal with global sports' drink company iPro.&lt;ref name="iPro"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2506858/Derby-Pride-Park-The-iPro-Stadium.html?ico=sport^headlines|title=Derby re-name Pride Park 'The iPro Stadium' with club set to net £7m|last=Moxley|first=Neil|date=13 November 2013|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club announced the cancellation of the sponsorship deal on 18 November 2016, reverting the stadium's name back to Pride Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/2016-17/derby-countys-home-to-revert-back-to-pride-park-stadium-3421938.aspx|title=Derby County’s Home To Revert Back To Pride Park Stadium|last=Media|first=DCFC|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records ==
The highest attendance at Pride Park Stadium for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 in a Premier League match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 18 March 2000.

{{wide image|pridepark.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panorama taken from the South Stand.}}

In a testimonial for Ted McMinn, on 1 May 2006, former players of both Derby County and Rangers contested a match at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium in which a record 33,475 spectators attended – around 10,000 of them being Rangers fans.

==Non-Derby County matches==
As one of the largest football grounds in the Midlands, Pride Park has also hosted some notable matches not connected to Derby County.

Pride Park has hosted one [[England national football team|full England]] international; a 4–0 friendly victory over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] on 25 May 2001, when the national side toured the country during the building of the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. The match also holds the record for the highest attendance at the stadium: a full-house of 33,598.

The ground has hosted six [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] matches. The results were as follows;

Partly as a result of Derby's successful hosting of international U21 football, Pride Park was selected as a host venue as part of the English bid to host the 2013 European U21s Championship.&lt;ref name="U212013"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Pride-Park-line-host-Europe-21-champs/story-11627649-detail/story.html|publisher =derbytelegraph.co.uk|title =Pride Park in line to host Europe Under-21 champs|date =19 October 2010|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150924002338/http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Pride-Park-line-host-Europe-21-champs/story-11627649-detail/story.html|archivedate =24 September 2015|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We only had 13 days to sell the tickets and a big crowd just wasn't on the cards. But I think we've proven that we can turn it around, operationally. The promoter, Kentaro, has seen that. So we have done ourselves a favour in terms of bringing something else like this back again and we will continue to pursue things like this."&lt;ref name="glickpleased"/&gt;

Away from international football, on 4 May 2009 Pride Park hosted the 39th [[FA Women's Cup|FA Women's Cup Final]], which saw [[Arsenal L.F.C.|Arsenal]] run out 2–1 victors over [[Sunderland A.F.C. Women|Sunderland]] to win the cup for a record fourth consecutive time, in front of a crowd of 23,291.&lt;ref name="womenFA"&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/04/womens-fa-cup-final-arsenal-sunderland|publisher =theguardian|title =Arsenal give Vic Akers the right send-off with the wrong performance|date = 4 May 2009 | location=London | first=Tony | last=Leighton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable non-football events==
Although primarily a football venue, Pride Park Stadium has also hosted events away from sport. It first hosted singer [[Rod Stewart]] on 26 June 2005 while touring his ''[[Stardust: The Great American Songbook, Volume III]]'' album.&lt;ref name="rodstewart"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2005/04/12/rod_stewart_pride_park_event_feature.shtml|publisher =BBC.co.uk|title =Rod to perform at Pride Park|date = 20 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], who played at the ground as part of the [[Stadium Arcadium tour|tour]] for their ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' album on 5 June 2006.&lt;ref name="RHCP"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.nme.com/news/red-hot-chili-peppers/22798|publisher =NME.com|title =Red Hot Chili Peppers debut new tracks in London |date = 14 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RHCP2"&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/image_galleries/red_hot_chili_peppers_derby_pride_park_gallery.shtml|publisher =BBC.co.uk|title =Events: Red Hot Chili Peppers|date = 6 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monster Jam]] came to Pride Park Stadium on 28 &amp; 29 May 2011. {{cn|date=October 2017}}

The '''Quadricentennial Pavilion''' (originally '''UST Sports Complex''') is a 5,792-seat multi-purpose [[gym]]nasium of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (UST) located at the site of the former old Engineering Complex and adjacent football field in front of the Roque Ruaño Building.

The Quadricentennial Pavilion is one of the building construction projects of the University for its celebration of 400th year of foundation in 2011.&lt;ref name="UST400"&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/2011/639-ust-starts-new-gymnasium-construction-due-at-400th-anniversary.html UST starts new gymnasium construction due at 400th anniversary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927182549/http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/2011/639-ust-starts-new-gymnasium-construction-due-at-400th-anniversary.html |date=September 27, 2011 }}, retrieved 28 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The new sports complex replaced the old UST Gymnasium which was built in 1933.&lt;ref name="DemolishedGym"&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20110516/78_year_old_gymnasium_demolished_paves_way_for_construction_of_alumni_center 78-year-old gymnasium demolished; paves way for construction of alumni center]. Retrieved 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:UST Engineering Sports Complex 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The UST Engineering Complex in 2008, which would be later the site of the Quadricentennial Pavilion.]]
Since 1933, the university only had the old UST Gymnasium, which was considered then as the biggest gymnasium during its time, as venue to hold practices for its athletes, as well as to hold non-sporting events.

In recent years, the student population increased to 40,000, prompting university officials to recognize the need for a new sporting facility within the campus.

A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 29, 2008 after the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gave its "blessing" to the project as UST is a [[pontifical university]], directly under the supervision of the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="VaticanOKs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abulencia|first1=Charizze|last2=de Paz|first2=Mary Athena|title=Vatican OKs sports complex|url=http://varsitarian.net/news/20090715/vatican_oks_sports_complex|accessdate=28 January 2010|publisher=The Varsitarian|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the sports complex lies on the former site of the Engineering Sports Complex that has an open field for softball and football, outdoor basketball courts, a tennis court, a covered basketball court with bleachers, and a canteen.

It was originally named as the UST Sports Complex, but the [[Regent|Council of Regents]] announced on October 18, 2011 that the new building will be called the Quadricentennial Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20111118/ust_sports_complex_is_now_quadricentennial_pavilion |title=UST Sports Complex is now 'Quadricentennial Pavilion' |author=Robillos, A.J. |date=2011-11-18 |work=[[The Varsitarian]] |accessdate=2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Fr. [[Rolando de la Rosa|Rolando V. de la Rosa]], the former [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas|Rector of the University]], described the then yet to be built facility as more than just a place for events and ceremonies as it will serve as a monument to "the unique and unparalleled holistic" sports development program of the university. The facility was planned to be the home of the UST varsity players and the [[UST Growling Tigers|Growling Tigers]] starting academic year of 2012.&lt;ref name="getsNewGym"/&gt;

==Architecture and design==
[[File:Qpavfacade.jpg|thumb|200px|Facade of the building.|left]]
The Quadricentennial Pavilion was designed by chief architect Carmelo Casas, who also designed the UST Carpark Building. The first architectural plan for the facility was made in 2007.&lt;ref name="new Tigers lair"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Quadricentennial Pavilion: A closer look at the new ‘Tigers’ lair’|url=http://www.varsitarian.net/supplement/neo_centennial_supplement/20120507/the_quadricentennial_pavilion|accessdate=11 May 2012|publisher=The Varsitarian|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years before the groundbreaking of the facility in July 2008, Millenium Sports Universal Co. coordinated with Casas in the planning and design stage where they were tasked to create a sporting facility of at least 5,000 seating capacity.&lt;ref name="ThumbsUp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/thedeanscorner/articlescontent.aspx?articleid=776775&amp;publicationsubcategoryid=69 |title=Thumbs up for new UST gym |last=Henson |first=Joaquin |date=2 February 2012 |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure has four storeys with its first floor being elevated to address potential flooding. The dimensions of the sports facility is 65.98 x 76 square-meter&lt;ref name="UST400"/&gt; and stands on a {{convert|11784.33|sqm|sqft}} lot. A double wall design, by devising two walls separated by a space, was employed for the interior walls of the structure for noise insulation. To minimize solar exposure to the sports venue's interior, louvers were utilized as part of the building's façade. This feature was also used to highlight to emphasize the building's exterior.&lt;ref name="new Tigers lair"/&gt;

The project manager the facility was Asian Technicon Managers &amp; Consultants, Inc.&lt;ref name="asiantechnicon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Projects - Special Category - Others - UST Sports Complex|url=http://www.asiantechnicon.com/completed/special-category.html|website=Asian Technicon|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3379">The '''Ratzeburg Test''' was a test used to gauge the suitability of individuals for international competitive junior [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] prior to the use of [[Indoor rower|indoor rowing machines]] for selection. The test was originally developed by the "Academy of Ratzeburg rowing", Germany in 1971. It was employed by the Great Britain Junior rowing team selectors in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

== Elements of the Test ==
Each element of the test was supervised by one of the GB junior rowing selection team. All parts of the test were completed in succession during an afternoon. The sequence was a timed 3,000 metre run on an athletic track, then a weight lifting test, followed by a gym circuit test.
	
The weight lifting test consisted of successive [[Power_clean#power_clean|power clean]] lifts at increasing weight until failure. At a given weight, recorded in pounds, a maximum of 3 failures were allowed.

The circuit test counted the number of repetitions performed in one minute for each of the followin exercises:
 	
:Number of Squat Thrusts. 	
:Number of Sit ups with 20&amp;nbsp;lbs on chest. 	
:Number of Squat jumps of 1 foot over maximum vertical reach. 	
:Number of Sit ups with 20&amp;nbsp;lbs on chest (again). 	
:Number of Squats with 20&amp;nbsp;lbs. 
:Number of Power Cleans of 90&amp;nbsp;lbs.
If any repetition did not meet the standard required it would not be included in the circuit repetitions  count.

== Ratzburg Test Index Calculation ==

The subject’s height was measured in centimetres from the floor up to the clavicle (just below the neck) and the subjects weight in kilograms.
 	
Participants were required to score a minimum index value of 20.0 in order to pass to the next stage in the selection process.

Each element of the test had a specific “constant value”. Each empirical value of an element taken for a subject had the respective constant value subtracted to emphasize better scores.
:Subject_Height_Constant = 125 	
:Subject_Weight_Constant = 50
:Power_Clean_Constant = 25
:Circuit_Reps_Constant = 50 	
:Run_Time_Constant = 450

The calculation was performed as follows:	

Ratzburg Test Index Value =
 	
(
(Subject_Height_Value – Subject_Height_Constant) x
 	
(Subject_Weight_Value – Subject_Weight_Constant) x
 	
(Power_Clean_Value    – Power_Clean_Contant) x
 
(Circuit_Reps_Value   – Circuit_Reps_Constant)
)
 	
Divided by
	
( Run_Time_Value – Run_Time_Constant) x 1,000



==Critique==
The test penalised lightweight rowers who would provide a lower weight value into the calculation. This encouraged participants to attempt to increase body weight during the winter season, only losing the weight again after the testing period had completed.

It did however allow those who were physically appropriate for international rowing to be recognised, and created a focus on all round physical fitness in the winter training period rather than only specific rowing fitness.

'''Rodney Parade''' is a [[stadium]] in the city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[South Wales]], owned and operated by the [[Welsh Rugby Union]]. It is located on the east bank of the [[River Usk]] in [[Newport city centre]]. The ground is on Rodney Road, a short walk from the city's central [[Newport bus station|bus]] and [[Newport railway station|railway]] stations via [[Newport Bridge, Newport|Newport Bridge]] or [[Newport City footbridge]]. There is no spectator car park at the ground but a number of [[multi-storey car park]]s are nearby.

Rodney Parade is the home ground of [[Dragons (rugby union)|Dragons]] regional [[rugby union]] team and rugby union club [[Newport RFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro12rugby.com/club/newport-gwent-dragons/|title=Dragons|date=1 August 2016|website=pro12rugby.com|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the home ground of [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] [[Association Football|football]] club, and is the second-oldest sports venue in the [[Football League]], after [[Deepdale]]. However, stadium capacity is reduced for football matches.

Newport [[squash (sport)|Squash]] Club has four courts at Rodney Parade.

Rodney Parade has two covered stands: the two-tier Hazell Stand (west) and the Bisley Stand (east) which are along the touchlines of the pitch. The upper tier of the west stand is seated with 1,996 seats, including 40 Press seats and the lower tier is a standing [[Terrace (stadium)|terrace]]. The east stand is all-seated with a 2,526 capacity including 144 seats in 13 hospitality boxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newportgwentdragons.com/page.aspx?p=268|title=Rodney Parade Bisley Stand|website=newportgwentdragons.com|accessdate=13 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823002037/http://www.newportgwentdragons.com/page.aspx?p=268|archivedate=23 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; food/drink outlets and a gantry for television cameras. The cameras are therefore pointing westward and often show the sun setting over Newport city centre.

The North Terrace is uncovered standing and adjoins the uncovered standing terrace on the west touchline alongside the west stand. The south end of the stadium houses players' changing rooms, a media centre and the small uncovered Sytner stand with 222 seats for away football fans. Away football fans are also sited in block F of the east stand giving a total capacity of 1,300 for away football fans. A large video screen was erected at the south end in December 2013.

The hospitality suite is located in the north end of the east stand on the upper level.

The rugby ticket office and club shop is located at the north end of the East Stand accessed via the main gate to the ground (Gate 4) off Grafton Road. The Newport County ticket office is a separate building just inside Gate 4.

To the north of the North Terrace is a floodlit grass training area. Further north, parallel to Grafton Road, is the Rodney Hall function room and the rugby clubhouse/office facilities.

==History==
In 1875, the Newport Athletic Club was created, and two years later they secured the use of land at Rodney Parade from [[Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar]] for their cricket, tennis, rugby and athletics teams. In October 1879 Newport RFC played Cardiff RFC in a floodlit game at Rodney Parade; the first ground to have floodlights installed in Wales.[10] Newport rugby club enjoyed six highly successful seasons, having been unbeaten for six consecutive seasons. Newport sustained their first defeat in the 1870s, they were again unbeaten in seasons 1891-2 and 1922-3. [[Monmouthshire County Cricket Club]] played at Rodney Parade from 1901 to 1934. Newport RFC provided internationals for every one of the four home countries at Rodney Parade, as well as South Africa. Newport were once scheduled for a regular fixture, against Bristol - a team drawn from Welsh, English, Irish and Scottish internationals. The powerful All Blacks of 1924, and the strong Springboks of 1960 were considered fortunate to evade defeat at Rodney Parade.

The cricket ground which was on the south of the site no longer exists as the new Maindee primary school was built on the site in 1993 and [[Newport Cricket Club]] relocated to [[Newport International Sports Village]].

Following the [[introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales]] the [[Dragons (rugby union)|Newport Gwent Dragons]] regional team were formed on 1 April 2003 and shared Rodney Parade with Newport RFC for the 2013-14 season onwards.

On 4 September 2007 it was announced that the Rodney Parade site was due to be redeveloped into a 15,000-capacity stadium by the beginning of the 2010-11 rugby union season. The redevelopment was backed by [[Newport City Council]], [[Newport Unlimited]], Newport RFC and Newport Gwent Dragons.  The application received planning consent on 11 March 2009. The plan included construction of covered stands at the north and south ends and to provide cover on the currently uncovered stretch of the west touchline terrace. In August 2010 it was announced that the target finish date for the first phase had been put back to the beginning of the 2011–12 rugby union season with the full redevelopment planned to take several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/8330800.Work_to_start_on_Rodney_Parade_development/?ref=mr|title=Work to start on Rodney Parade development|website=South Wales Argus|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new east stand was opened in October 2011 and named the Bisley Stand for sponsorship purposes.

In May 2012 it was agreed that [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] football club would relocate from [[Newport Stadium]] and play its home fixtures at Rodney Parade in an initial three-year deal, the first time that the stadium would host association football matches on a regular basis. In February 2013 Newport County agreed a further 10-year lease to play at Rodney Parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21607160|title=Newport County extend Rodney Parade stay|date=28 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 Newport Athletic [[Bowls]] Club relocated from Rodney Parade to [[Caerleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/10364182.___Community_destroyed__as_Newport_bowls_club_turfed_out_after_100_years/?ref=mr|title=‘Community destroyed' as Newport bowls club turfed out after 100 years|website=South Wales Argus|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summers of 2013 and 2014 new drainage and irrigation systems were installed under the grass playing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-23587323|title=Warning over Rodney Parade pitch|first=Neil|last=Prior|date=12 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, serious drainage problems occurred at the end of 2016. Newport County's matches against [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] on 3 September and [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]] on 10 December were abandoned at half-time because the pitch was waterlogged and the [[English Football League]] stepped in to help identify the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Rob|title=Newport County to get Rodney Parade pitch help from Football League|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/38291057|accessdate=2016-12-13|work=BBC Sport|date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 sale of the ground to the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] was agreed following a vote of [[Newport RFC]] Shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39855860 WRU buy Rodney Parade].&lt;/ref&gt; The deal included the WRU wholly owning both the ground and the regional rugby union team which was renamed from Newport Gwent Dragons to Dragons. The takeover was completed on 27 June 2017 and work started to install a [[hybrid grass]] pitch for the 2017-18 rugby and football season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/football/newportcounty/15385323.Tough_start_fine_by_Exiles_boss_as_pitch_work_is_set_to_begin/#comments-anchor|title=Tough start fine by Exiles boss as pitch work is set to begin|website=South Wales Argus|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silver Stadium''' was a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] located at 500 Norton Street in [[Rochester, New York]]. It was the home stadium for the [[Rochester Red Wings]] of the [[International League]] from 1929 to 1996, and for the [[New York Black Yankees]] of the [[Negro National League (1933–48)|Negro National League]] for their final season in 1948. The ballpark also briefly hosted professional football as it was the home field for the [[Syracuse Braves|Rochester Braves]] ([[AFL II|second American Football League]]) in 1936 and the [[Brooklyn Tigers (AFL)|Rochester Tigers]] (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937.

The facility opened May 2, 1929, as '''Red Wing Stadium'''. It was renamed Silver Stadium on August 19, 1968, for [[Morrie Silver]], then the president of [[Rochester Community Baseball, Inc.]] Silver Stadium hosted its final event, a [[Governors' Cup]] playoff game between the [[Columbus Clippers]] and the Red Wings, on September 10, 1996, and was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998. The site is now an industrial and office park.

==History==
Silver Stadium cost $415,000 to construct and opened on May 2, 1929, as Red Wing Stadium. At the time, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 15,000. The park was built in the middle of a thriving urban residential neighborhood, which like most suffered a decline in the latter half of the century. Plentiful parking for automobiles, not a huge concern at the time it was built, became an issue as more and more fans drove their cars to the ballpark.

In late 1956, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], then the major league affiliate of the [[Rochester Red Wings]] and also the owners of Red Wing Stadium and the Red Wings, were exploring the possibility of removing the franchise from their minor league system. In response, Morrie Silver,&lt;ref name="msilver"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redwingsbaseball.com/history/RWHOF_SilverMorrie.php |title=Morrie Silver |publisher=Rochester Red Wings |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Rochester businessman, spearheaded an effort to purchase both assets from the Cardinals. A total of 8,222 stockholders, including Silver, came together to form [[Rochester Community Baseball, Inc.]] (RCB) The effort was ultimately successful as RCB purchased both assets on February 27, 1957, ensuring that the team would remain in Rochester for the 1957 season and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/documents/2008/01/28/342589/1/Silver.pdf|title=Morrie Silver - Hall of Fame Inductee (2008)|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Wing Stadium was renamed Silver Stadium in Silver's honor on August 19, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Date given on base plate of 2007 Red Wings bobblehead promotion commemorating the 1968 stadium renaming&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rochester Red Wings 1980s logo.gif|right]]
[[Major League Baseball]] mandated changes to minor league ballparks in the 1990s to both upgrade the field of play and the facilities that the players used. Even though it was renovated in the mid-1980s, Silver was deficient in a number of these areas. Like most old ballparks of its era, it did not have any corporate luxury suites. The official story is that public sentiment in Rochester was in favor of building a new ballpark somewhere closer to the downtown area, with plenty of parking and access to expressways. However, at various times, proposals were made to build the new stadium in one of Rochester's [[suburb]]s, namely [[Greece (town), New York|Greece]], [[Avon (town), New York|Avon]] and [[Victor (town), New York|Victor]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Ground was broken on [[Frontier Field]], a new stadium located in downtown Rochester next to [[Eastman Kodak]]'s world headquarters, in 1995. Frontier Field opened on July 11, 1996, allowing Silver Stadium to close on September 10, 1996. Silver Stadium was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998, and the site is now an industrial and office park.

==Events==
The [[Rochester Red Wings]] of the [[International League]] moved from the Bay Street Ball Grounds to Red Wing Stadium following the 1928 season. Red Wing Stadium opened May 2, 1929, with a regular season game between the Red Wings and the [[Reading Keystones]]. Rochester lost, 3–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/~bennettb/1996.html|title=On A Silver Diamond: The Story of Rochester Community Baseball from 1956–1996|first=Brian A.|last=Bennett|publisher=Triphammer Publishing|year=1997|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wings continued to play at the facility until the 1996 season. On August 30, 1996, the Red Wings lost, 8–5, to the [[Ottawa Lynx]] in the final regular season game at Silver Stadium. Rochester also lost the final game ever at Silver Stadium, game two of the [[Governors' Cup]] Finals on September 10, 1996, by a margin of 4–0 to the [[Columbus Clippers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fki67yr2ANkC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=silver+stadium+1996#PPA120,M1|title=Baseball in Rochester |first=Scott |last=Pitoniak |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|year=2003|page=120|accessdate=March 4, 2009|isbn=9780738511696}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Wings moved to [[Frontier Field]] for the 1997 season.

The [[New York Black Yankees]] of the [[Negro National League (1933–48)|Negro National League]] played at Red Wing Stadium in 1948. The season was the last in the team's history.

Outside of baseball, the ballpark briefly hosted professional football as Red Wing Stadium was the home field for the [[Syracuse Braves|Rochester Braves]] ([[AFL II|second American Football League]]) in 1936 and the [[Brooklyn Tigers (AFL)|Rochester Tigers]] (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937.

The largest attendance at the stadium was 31,000, for a concert by [[The Grateful Dead]] on June 30, 1988, eclipsing their previous record of 30,100, on July 2, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochester Democrat and Chronicle'', July 3, 1987 and ''Rochester Times-Union'', July 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stadio Franco Ossola''' (also called '''Luigi Ganna Velodrome''') is a sports [[stadium]] and [[velodrome]] currently in use by the football team [[A.S. Varese 1910]].

Constructed in 1925, and originally named the ''Stadio del Littorio'', the stadium was renamed in September 1950 in memory of [[Franco Ossola]], an Italian from [[Varese]] and player for [[Torino F.C.]] who died in 1949 in the [[Superga air disaster]].

The cycling track was used for the [[UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in [[1971 UCI Track Cycling World Championships|1971]] and is named after [[Luigi Ganna]], the winner of the first [[Giro d'Italia]] in [[1909 Giro d'Italia|1909]], who was born in nearby [[Induno Olona]].

Originally, the stadium could accommodate up to 23,000 spectators, but the capacity has been reduced to comply with safety standards, so much so that now the north stand, which houses the home fans, is not usable.

In recent years, plans have been drawn up to create a new 10,000 seater stadium to replace the existing one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4575">'''Steven 'Steve' Beaglehole''' is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] who is currently working at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]  with youth squads. He managed [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] from 1991 to 1993.

==Playing career==

Beaglehole's playing career included appearances for England at Under-18 and Under-19 level and he turned out in the reserves for Barnsley and Sheffield United.

==Coaching career==

Beaglehole holds a degree in Sports Science and is also a qualified Physical Education teacher. He became the youngest person to obtain the 'A' licence badge at the age of 21.

His managerial experience included leading the [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], his hometown team, between 1991 and 1993.  He joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in October 2000 to work in the Academy and has worked with [[Jon Rudkin]] to recruit some strong young players.

After holding youth team coaching positions at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], Beaglehole became reserve team coach at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], where he worked with Alan Hill, the former Leicester Academy Director.

He was promoted from youth coach after the departure of boss [[Billy Bremner]] and was one of the youngest managers in the league, younger even than some of his players. In his only full season in charge, the team finished five places higher in Division Three so progress had been made. One of his highlights there was guiding the team to the FA Youth Cup Final against Arsenal.

==Leicester City==

Beaglehole worked as a youth coach under [[Martin O'Neill]] at Leicester in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-team-built-Martin-O-Neill-s-image/story-27757153-detail/story.html "Leicester City were a team built in Martin O'Neill's image. Did we fear him? We absolutely did."]&lt;/ref&gt; Beaglehole remained at the club under subsequent managers and jointly took over as caretaker manager for one game, alongside [[Jon Rudkin]] and [[Mike Stowell]], following Martin Allen's brief spell as manager in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Leicester-City-squad-strongest-15-years/story-27730892-detail/story.html Leicester City squad is the 'strongest in 15 years']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6969388.stm Allen ends brief Leicester reign]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudkin, Stowell and Beaglehole would take charge of a further 3 games between [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] leaving the club on 24 October 2011 and [[Nigel Pearson]] returning as manager on 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/15438896 Sven-Goran Eriksson leaves his role as Leicester boss]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaglehole was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland's [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Under-21]] and Under-19 teams on 12 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7450797.stm IFA appoints new coaching staff]&lt;/ref&gt;  He will continue as youth team and reserve team coach at Leicester City.

From the start of the 2012-2013 season Beaglehole took charge of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] new 'development squad' which takes part in the Under-21 Professional Development League 2 North division. The team won 9 out of their first 12 games before Christmas 2012, sitting top of the league going into the new year. The team eventually went on to comfortably win the league with a game to go, but subsequently lost the national play-off semi-final to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. Beaglehole and [[Jon Rudkin]] then took a team of under-21 and under-18 players to the end of season [[HKFC International Soccer Sevens]] tournament, winning the competition thanks to a 2-0 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the final.

'''Vasil Levski National Stadium''' ({{lang-bg|Национален стадион „Васил Левски“}}), named after [[Bulgaria]]n [[Folk hero|national hero]] and revolutionary [[Vasil Levski]], is the country's second largest stadium. The stadium has 44,000 seats and is located in the centre of [[Sofia]], on the territory of the city's oldest and most famous park - the [[Borisova gradina]].
The [[Bulgaria national football team]]'s home matches and the [[Bulgarian Cup]] finals are held at the venue, as well as [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] competitions. It was used as the home venue for Levski Sofia's Champions League games, and is often used for [[Eternal derby of Bulgarian football|important derbies]] between the big clubs from Sofia, instead of their own home stadiums.

==History==

Vasil Levski National Stadium was officially opened in 1953, extended in 1966 and renovated in 2002.

Prior to their demolition by the Communist authorities during the 1940s and 50s, two other stadiums stood on the ground where the current national stadium lies. One of those was [[Levski Sofia]]'s club stadium, called [[Levski Field]] (Bulgarian: ''Igrishte Levski'', completed 1934), and the other - the [[Yunak Stadium]] (built 1928), which lay partially to the southwest. The latter used to host national football team matches with its capacity of about 15,000 seats. Levski were compensated for their loss with a place in the suburbs of Sofia where they were allowed to build a new stadium - the present day [[Georgi Asparuhov (stadium)|Georgi Asparuhov]].

The Vasil Levski stadium was completed in 1953 with an announced capacity of 42 000.&lt;ref&gt;''Naroden Sport'', Issues 964, 3 July 1953. The stadium did not have individual seating at the time, hence the higher capacity despite the smaller size of the stands.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, only the lower tier of stands was built (roughly half the height of the current stands), and, due to the uneven lie of the land, the western end of the pitch and stands were below ground level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostbulgaria.com/?p=157 V. Levski and Druzhba stadiums (1960s)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227124447/http://www.lostbulgaria.com/?p=157 |date=2013-12-27 }}, ''Lost Bulgaria''. The Vasil Levski stadium is shown before the construction of the higher tier of stands and the floodlights. Retrieved Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The upper tier was built about a decade later, with the current floodlight towers built in the late 1960s.

[[File:Vassil levski national stadium.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Inside the stadium]]

The Vasil Levski stadium was used for athletics competitions immediately after its official opening on 5 July 1953. The first football match played there after its opening was a friendly between [[Levski Sofia#History|Dinamo Sofia]] and [[:de:FC Wien|FC Wien]] and, a month later, it also began being used for league games. The first international was a world cup qualifier on 6 September against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Naroden Sport'', Issues 967 &amp; 983, from 13 Jul and 7 Sept 1953. The very first match was actually a friendly between the Bulgarian national side and the visiting French workers' team [[:fr:FSGT|FSGT]], played in April (''Naroden Sport'', Issue 945, 1 May 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vassil Levski National Stadium in Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|280px|right]]

The stadium offers also [[judo]], [[artistic gymnastics]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[aerobics]], [[fencing]] and [[table tennis]] halls, as well as a general physical training hall, two conference halls and three restaurants.
It hosted the [[Eurobasket 1957|1957]] [[EuroBasket|European basketball championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_,qVPP9zLJKY121Ltl7u2L2.coid_h2pBsksyJ-cCHE,whyz0T3.articleMode_on.html|title=EuroBasket History - The 50’s - FIBA Europe|author=|date=|website=www.fibaeurope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the proposed venue for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Sofia's bid for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

In July 2011 plans were announced to build a new, state of the art 40000-seater national stadium in the Sofia suburbs, but was later scrapped.

==Concert venue==
The stadium has hosted music shows by a number of regional and world stars.

The most successful concert in Bulgaria ever and thus at the Vasil Levski stadium was held by [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] superstar [[Lepa Brena]] on 24 July 1990 in front of 110,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91682 |title=Serbia's Pop Folk Legend Lepa Brena to Thrill Bulgarian Fans in April |publisher=Novinite.com |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110110617/http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91682 |archivedate=January 10, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6_L4R-YWGs|title=YouTube|author=|date=|website=www.youtube.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407032948/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6_L4R-YWGs |archivedate=2017-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record remains unbroken to date. The curiosity of the concert was the way [[Lepa Brena]] arrived at the stadium - by landing from the helicopter directly to the stage.

[[United States|American]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[Metallica]] held one of the most successful concerts in [[Bulgaria]] in the stadium as part of their [[2008 European Vacation Tour]], attracting 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://188.40.98.135/~novinite/view_news.php?id=95513 |title=Legendary ???Metallica???

American [[superstar]] [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had a very successful concert here as part of the second European second leg of her [[Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour]] on August 29, 2009. She performed in front of 54,000 people &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madonna.com/news/title/madonna-takes-a-bow-as-final-show-of-recordsmashing--sticky--sweet-tour-ends-in-israel- |title=Madonna HOME |publisher=Madonna.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929040613/http://madonna.com/news/title/madonna-takes-a-bow-as-final-show-of-recordsmashing--sticky--sweet-tour-ends-in-israel- |archivedate=2010-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} and was warmly welcomed by her numerous fans. After the show, the grass was badly damaged, which caused some discontent amongst football fans, national team players, coaches and staff.

On 14 May 2010, [[Australia]]n [[rock band]] [[AC/DC]] played the [[Bulgaria]]n capital [[Sofia]], in front of nearly 60,000 fans as part of their [[Black Ice World Tour]].

A festival, under the name ''Sofia Rocks'', part of [[Sonisphere Festival#Sonisphere 2010|Sonisphere Festival]] took place on the Vasil Levski National Stadium. The festival was held over 2 days on the 22nd and 23 June with live performances by world-renowned bands such as [[Rammstein]], [[Metallica]], [[Manowar]] and [[Alice in Chains]] among others.

'''Wade Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] park located near the intersection of Grand Avenue and 34th Avenue West in the [[West Duluth]] neighborhood of [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. The stadium was built in 1941 and holds 4,200 people. It is the home of the [[Duluth Huskies]] of the [[Northwoods League]] and The [[College of St. Scholastica]] baseball team who have won 19 straight Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) regular season and 18 straight post-season titles. "The Wade", as it is sometimes called by fans, was also the home of the [[Duluth–Superior Dukes]] of the reincarnated [[Northern League (baseball, 1993–2010)|Northern League]] from 1993 until 2002, and the home of Dukes of the [[Northern League (baseball, 1902&amp;ndash;71)|original Northern League]] from 1941 until 1970. One of a dying breed of [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) constructed stadiums, "The Wade" is noted for its short distances (especially from home plate to center field), its high fences, and the cool, damp weather generated by nearby [[Lake Superior]].

==History==

[[File:Wade Stadium Arial.jpg|thumb|Wade Stadium]]

During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] used the WPA to fund projects to boost employment.  One of these projects was the removal of the brick roadbed from Grand Avenue, which was then paved with asphalt.  During the fall of 1940, road crews removed 381,000 bricks from the surface of Grand Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Duluth Huskies website, accessed 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another WPA crew used these bricks to build Wade Stadium.

The decision to build Wade Stadium originated with a 1938 study commissioned by Walter Chantigney, chairman of Duluth's Citywide All-Sports committee.  The study found that the Duluth Duke's existing stadium, [[Athletic Park (Duluth)|Athletic Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Now known as Wheeler Athletic Complex.&lt;/ref&gt; was obsolete.  According to the study: 

 {{quote|Duluth does not have a suitable stadium for professional baseball. The present athletic park, privately owned and used by Duluth's professional team, has too small a capacity, the seats are unsuitable, the sanitary facilities are seriously inadequate and the playing field is smaller than regulation size. . . .}}

Chantigney gathered more than 7,500 signatures to place a construction bond measure on the November, 1938, ballot.  After voters approved the bond measure, money was gathered over the next two years from bond sales, the state of Minnesota, and the WPA.  The site selected for the new stadium was located directly across Grand Avenue from Athletic Park.

A construction budget totaling $163,232 was set.  But, due to cost overruns, the final cost of the stadium was $230,880.  During construction, the project received several bailouts.  One bailout came from Duluth's newly elected mayor, Edward H. Hatch, who purchased the materials needed to finish construction.

The stadium's original name was Duluth All-Sports Municipal Stadium. It was renamed Wade Municipal Stadium in 1954 in honor of former Duluth Dukes owner Frank Wade, who died in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;http://zenithcity.com/frank-wades-legacy-beyond-the-brick-walls/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenancy===
The Duluth Dukes played their first game in the new stadium on July 16, 1941.  Their first opponent was their local rival, the [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] Blues. When the Blues folded in 1955, the Dukes (known as the White Sox during the 1956–59 seasons) became the Duluth–Superior Dukes. The original Dukes played in Wade Stadium from 1941 through the 1970 season. The only break came during the 1943&amp;ndash;45 seasons when the [[Northern League (baseball, 1902&amp;ndash;71)|Northern League]] suspended play due to World War II. The stadium was the home of three teams in the [[Twin Ports League]], the only Class E league in the history of baseball, in 1943.

When television began carrying [[Major League Baseball]] games in the 1950s, [[minor league baseball]] suffered from a drop in [[advertising]] revenue. Many of the smaller minor leagues around the country folded. The Northern League became one of these casualties when it was announced prior to the 1971 season that it was ceasing operations. After the original Northern League disbanded, the stadium was rarely used over the next twelve years. It was being threatened with demolition when the newly created [[Northern League (baseball, 1993–2010)|Northern League]] awarded Duluth a franchise in 1993. The Stadium has had a tenant every year since. When the Dukes moved out of the Stadium in 2002, the void was filled almost immediately by the Huskies.

{{coord|51|28|41.73|N|3|10|57.29|W|type:landmark|display=title}}The '''Welsh Sports Hall of Fame''' (WSHOF) is a charitable organisation created to commemorate the sporting achievements and preserve the artefacts of Welsh [[Sportsperson|athlete]]s. It was established in 1980 from the memorabilia collection of Welsh radio commentator G. V. Wynne-Jones. Since 1990, inductees to the exclusive "Roll of Honour" have been chosen annually by a trustees committee comprising representatives from athletics, media, universities and museums. The organisation has also given awards to individuals for outstanding contribution to Welsh sport. In 2018 an extra award was added to commemorate the former chairman, Rhodri Morgan. The first 'Rhodri' was awarded to the City of Cardiff for their outstanding service and commitment to sporting excellence.

==The WSHOF Roll of Honour Citation==

"Inclusion in the Roll of Honour is for those people who, by their achievement and by their example and conduct, in and beyond the sporting arena, have brought distinction to themselves and credit to Wales."

The Hall of Fame exhibition was on permanent exhibition at the Sports Council for Wales, South Glamorgan County Council, the [[Museum of Welsh Life]] until 2009, when it moved to the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshsportshalloffame.co.uk/exhibitions.html Welsh Hall of Fame exhibitions] welshsportshalloffame.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee of trustees is chaired by [[Laura McAllister|Prof Laura McAllister]] CBE, who took over from the former First Minister, [[Rhodri Morgan]], in 2018 . The WSHOF committee consists of Prof [[Laura McAllister]] (chair – appointed 2018), Jeff Andrews (secretary), Dave Cobner, Rob Cole, Carolyn Hitt, Peter Jackson, Dylan Jones, [[Nicky Piper]], Dave Roberts, Clive Williams., Andrew Weeks, Phil Davies, Andrew Walker.

[[Lynn Davies]] CBE was appointed as President of the WSHOF in 2018.

[[Image:Lab coat and scrubs.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A white coat]]

A '''white coat''' or '''laboratory coat''' (often abbreviated to '''lab coat''') is a knee-length overcoat/[[Smock-frock|smock]] worn by professionals in the [[medicine|medical]] field or by those involved in [[laboratory]] work. The coat protects their street clothes and also serves as a simple uniform. The garment is made from white or light-colored [[cotton]], [[linen]], or cotton [[polyester]] blend, allowing it to be washed at high temperature and making it easy to see if it is clean.

Similar coats are a symbol of learning in Argentina and Uruguay, where they are worn by both students and teachers in state schools. In [[Tunisia]] and [[Mozambique]], teachers wear white coats to protect their street clothes from chalk.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Like the word "[[suit (clothing)|suit]]", the phrase "white coat" is sometimes used as a [[synecdoche]] to denote the wearer, such as a scientist working in a high-tech company.

== Medicine ==
White coats are sometimes seen as the distinctive dress of both [[physician]]s and [[surgeon]]s, who have worn them for over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, "Dressed to Heal: The Changing Semiotics of Surgical Dress", ''Fashion Theory'', (2015), pp.1-23. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653 doi=10.1080/1362704X.2015.1077653]&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the [[quackery]] and [[Medieval medicine|mysticism]] of nineteenth century medicine.  To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists, and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist, the white laboratory coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones VA | year = 1999 | title = The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit? | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/5/478 | journal = JAMA | volume = 281 | issue = | page = 478 | doi=10.1001/jama.281.5.478-jms0203-5-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[white coat ceremony|white coat ceremonies]] have become popular amongst those starting [[medical school]].

The modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andre Picard |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/why-do-physicians-wear-white-lab-coats/article4384866/ |title=Why do physicians wear white lab coats? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hochberg|first1=Mark|title=The Doctor's White Coat--an Historical Perspective|journal=Virtual Mentor: American Medical Association Journal of Ethics|date=April 2007|volume=9|issue=4|pages=310–314|pmid=23217976|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2007/04/mhst1-0704.html|accessdate=26 November 2014|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2007.9.4.mhst1-0704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patient perceptions ===
A study conducted in the United Kingdom found that the majority of patients prefer their doctors to wear white coats, but the majority of doctors prefer other clothing, such as [[scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3706783.stm | title=Doctors 'should wear white coats' | publisher=BBC News | date=2004-05-13 | accessdate=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that psychiatrists were among the least likely to wear white coats and when they are worn, they are typically worn over the scrubs. Some medical doctors view the coats as hot and uncomfortable, and many feel that they spread infection.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=== White coat hypertension ===
Some patients who have their blood pressure measured in a clinical setting have higher readings than they do when measured in a home setting. This is apparently a result of patients feeling more relaxed when they are at home. The phenomenon is sometimes called "[[white coat hypertension]]," in reference to the traditional white coats worn in a clinical setting, though the coats themselves may have nothing to do with the elevated readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pierdomenico S, Mezzetti A, Lapenna D, Guglielmi M, Mancini M, Salvatore L, Antidormi T, Costantini F, Cuccurullo F | title='White-coat' hypertension in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension: evaluation of prevalence by ambulatory monitoring and impact on cost of health care. | journal=Eur Heart J | volume=16 | issue=5 | pages=692–7 | year=1995 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.eurheartj.a060975 | pmid=7588903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychiatry ===
The term is also used as verbal shorthand for psychiatric [[orderly|orderlies]] or other personnel and may be used, in a usually jocular manner, to imply someone's [[lunatic|lunacy]] or [[paranoia]].

=== White versus black ===
[[File:Tie-dyed lab coat.jpg|thumb|A tie-dyed lab coat]]
Until the mid-1920s, students who were examining cadavers would wear black lab coats to show respect for the dead. Black lab coats were used in early biomedical and microbiology laboratories. The "whiteness" and "pureness" concepts that were established in medicine pervaded that environment at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries and physicians changed the black for the white coat.&lt;ref&gt;Hochberg, M., S. History of medicine The doctor’s white coat—an historical perspective. American Medical Association Journal of Ethics April 2007, Volume 9, Number 4: 310-314.[http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2007/04/pdf/mhst1-0704.pdf History of medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White coat ceremony ===
{{main article|White coat ceremony}}
A [[white coat ceremony]] is a relatively new ritual that marks one's entrance into [[medical school]] and, more recently, into a number of related health-related schools and professions. It originated at [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]] in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/18/local/me-23619|title=For New Medical Students, White Coats Are a Warmup|last=WARREN|first=PETER M.|date=1999-10-18|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and involves a formal "robing" or "cloaking" in white lab coats.

=== Controversy ===
Studies have shown that doctor's coats worn in hospitals can harbor contagions including [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treakle|first1=Amy|title=Bacterial contamination of health care workers' white coats.|journal=American Journal of Infection Control|date=March 2009|volume=37|issue=2|pages=101–105|pmid=18834751|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2008.03.009|pmc=2892863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the UK [[National Health Service]] started banning long-sleeved coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Clare|title=Death of the doctor's white coat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6998877.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the American Medical Association investigated banning coats with long sleeves to protect patients, but did not institute a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yao|first1=Laura|title=AMA: White Coats Need More Study|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/06/16/ama-the-white-coats-are-going-the-white-coats-are-going/|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2011 investigating the effectiveness of the NHS ban showed no statistical difference in contamination levels between residents wearing long-sleeved coats and those wearing short-sleeved scrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burden|first1=Marisha|last2=Cervantes|first2=Lilia| last3=Weed|first3=Diane| last4=Keniston|first4=Angela| last5=Price|first5=Connie| last6=Albert|first6=Richard|title=Newly cleaned physician uniforms and infrequently washed white coats have similar rates of bacterial contamination after an 8-hour workday: A randomized controlled trial|journal=Journal of Hospital Medicine|date=February 2011|volume=6|issue=4|pages=177–182|doi=10.1002/jhm.864|pmid=21312328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to reduce the contamination of healthcare uniforms, [[ASTM International]] is developing standards to specifically address liquid penetration resistance, liquid repellency, bacterial decontamination, and [[antimicrobial]] properties of such uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Subcommittee: F23.40|title=New Specification for Healthcare Worker Protective Uniforms|url=http://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/WORKITEMS/WK38455.htm|website=ASTM International|publisher=ASTM International|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In laboratory work ==
When used in the laboratory, lab coats protect against accidental spills, e.g., acids. In this case they usually have long sleeves and are made of an absorbent material, such as cotton, so that the user can be protected from the chemical. Some lab coats have buttons or elastic at the end of the sleeves, to secure them around the wrist so that they do not hang into containers of chemicals. Short-sleeved lab coats also exist where protection from substances such as acid is not necessary, and are favoured by certain scientists, such as microbiologists, avoiding the problem of hanging sleeves altogether, combined with the ease of washing the forearms (an important consideration in microbiology).

=== Howie coats ===
[[File:LGVH Team 2009c.jpg|thumb|Viral &amp; Human Genomics Laboratory (Facultad de Medicina UASLP) team members using Howie lab coats.]]
For added safety, a variant of the lab coat, called a "Howie" style lab coat is often adopted. It is called such after a 1978 report commissioned by the UK department of Health and Social Security to codify standard clinical laboratory practices, chaired by [[Sir James Howie|J.&amp;nbsp;W. Howie]]. Among the codified standards was protective clothing; the type of wrap-around full coverage lab coat that had been in use in the UK for over a hundred years was nicknamed the "Howie-Style" coat to indicate its compliance with the provisions of this report. It has the buttons on the left flank, elasticated wrists and a [[mandarin collar]], and is quite similar to a [[chef's uniform]].  It is designed to minimize pathogen contact with street clothes.

== Use as a school uniform ==
[[Image:Delantales blancos 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children is a national symbol of learning.]]
White coats which resemble lab coats are worn by students and teachers of most public primary schools as a daily uniform in countries like [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Spain]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Morocco]]. It also was formerly worn during past decades in [[Paraguay]] and [[Chile]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
