      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39163">The '''acoustoelastic effect''' is how the [[Sound velocity#Speed of sound in solids|sound velocities]] (both [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] and [[Shear wave|shear]] wave velocities) of an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic material]] change if subjected to an initial static [[Stress (physics)|stress]] field. This is a non-linear effect of the [[constitutive relation]] between [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] and [[finite strain]] in a [[Continuum mechanics|material of continuous mass]]. In classical [[Elasticity (physics)#Linear elasticity|linear elasticity]] theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship is commonly known as the generalised [[Hooke's law]]. The linear elastic theory involves second order [[Elastic modulus|elastic constants]] (e.g. [[Lamé's first parameter|&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[Shear modulus|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;]]) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory&lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt;) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the sound velocities of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.

The acoustoelastic effect was investigated as early as 1925 by Brillouin.&lt;ref&gt;Brillouin, L., "Les tensions de radiation; leur interprétation en mécanique classique et en relativité", ''Journal de Physique et Le Radium'', (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the propagation velocity of acoustic waves would decrease proportional to an applied hydrostatic pressure. However, a consequence of his theory was that sound waves would stop propagating at a sufficiently large pressure. This paradoxial effect was later shown to be caused by the incorrect assumptions that the elastic parameters were not affected by the pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, S., "Wave propagation in initially-stressed elastic solids", ''Acta Mechanica'', (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1937 Murnaghan &lt;ref name="Murnaghan"&gt;Murnaghan, F., "Finite Deformations of an Elastic Solid", ''American Journal of Mathematics'', (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; presented a mathematical theory extending the linear elastic theory to also include [[Finite strain theory|finite deformation]] in elastic [[isotropic]] materials. This theory included three third-order elastic constants &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In 1953 Huges and Kelly &lt;ref&gt;Huges, D. S., Kelly, J. L., "Second-Order Elastic Deformation of Solids", ''Physical Review'', (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; used the theory of Murnaghan in their experimental work to establish numerical values for higher order elastic constants for several elastic materials including [[Polystyrene]], [[Armco]] iron, and [[Pyrex]], subjected to [[Hydrostatic pressure#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] and [[Compression (physics)|uniaxial compression]].

== Non-linear elastic theory for hyperelastic materials ==
The acoustoelastic effect is an effect of finite deformation of non-linear elastic materials. A modern comprehensive account of this can be found in.&lt;ref name="ogden"&gt;Ogden, R. W., ''Non-linear elastic deformations'', Dover Publications Inc., Mineola, New York, (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; This book treats the application of the non-linear elasticity theory and the analysis of the mechanical properties of solid materials capable of large elastic deformations. The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a [[compressible]] isotropic [[hyperelastic material]], like [[polycrystalline]] steel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anisotropy and Isotropy|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Structure/anisotropy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; is reproduced and shown in this text from the non-linear elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.&lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt;

:'''Note''' that the setting in this text as well as in &lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt; is [[isothermal]], and no reference is made to [[thermodynamics]].

=== Constitutive relation – hyperelastic materials (Stress-strain relation) ===
A hyperelastic material is a special case of a [[Cauchy elastic material]] in which the stress at any point is [[material objectivity|objective]] and determined only by the current state of [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages [[Deformation (mechanics)]] and [[Finite strain]]). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy elastic material has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar [[Elastic energy|elastic potential]] function. The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the [[Strain energy density function]].

The constitutive relation between the stress and strain can be expressed in different forms based on the chosen stress and strain forms. Selecting the [[Stress (mechanics)#Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor|1st Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{P}&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[transpose]] of the [[Continuum mechanics#Balance laws|nominal stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{P}^T=\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt;), the constitutive equation for a compressible hyper elastic material can be expressed in terms of the [[Finite strain theory#Finite strain tensors|Lagrangian Green strain]] (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E}&lt;/math&gt;) as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{P} = \boldsymbol{F}\cdot\frac{\partial W}{\partial \boldsymbol{E}} \qquad \text{or} \qquad P_{ij} = F_{ik}~\frac{\partial W}{\partial E_{kj}}, \qquad i,j=1,2,3 ~,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Finite strain#Deformation gradient tensor|deformation gradient tensor]], and where the second expression uses the [[Einstein summation convention]] for index notation of [[tensors]]. &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hyperelastic material#First Piola.E2.80.93Kirchhoff stress|strain energy density function]] for a [[hyperelastic material]] and have been defined per unit volume rather than per unit mass since this avoids the need of multiplying the right hand side with the [[Density|mass density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; of the reference configuration.&lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt;

Assuming that the scalar strain energy density function &lt;math&gt;W(\boldsymbol{E})&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated by a [[Taylor series|Taylor series expansion]] in the current strain &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E}&lt;/math&gt;, it can be expressed (in index notation) as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  W \approx C_0 + C_{ij}E_{ij} + \frac{1}{2!}C_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl} + \frac{1}{3!}C_{ijklmn}E_{ij}E_{kl}E_{mn}+\cdots
 &lt;/math&gt;
Imposing the restrictions that the strain energy function should be zero and have a minimum when the material is in the un-deformed state (i.e. &lt;math&gt;W(E_{ij}=0)=0&lt;/math&gt;) it is clear that there are no constant or linear term in the strain energy function, and thus:
:&lt;math&gt;
  W \approx \frac{1}{2!}C_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl} + \frac{1}{3!}C_{ijklmn}E_{ij}E_{kl}E_{mn}+\cdots,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is a fourth-order tensor of second-order [[Hooke's law#Matrix representation .28stiffness tensor.29|elastic moduli]], while &lt;math&gt;C_{ijklmn}&lt;/math&gt; is a sixth-order tensor of third-order elastic moduli.
The symmetry of &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}=E_{ji}&lt;/math&gt; together with the scalar strain energy density function &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; implies that the second order moduli &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; have the following symmetry:
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{ijkl}=C_{jikl}=C_{ijlk},
 &lt;/math&gt;
which reduce the number of independent elastic constants from 81 to 36. In addition the power expansion implies that the second order moduli also have the major symmetry
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{ijkl}=C_{klij},
 &lt;/math&gt;
which further reduce the number of independent elastic constants to 21. The same arguments can be used for the third order elastic moduli &lt;math&gt;C_{ijklmn}&lt;/math&gt;. These symmetries also allows the elastic moduli to be expressed by the [[Voigt notation]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}=C_{IJ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{ijklmn}=C_{IJK}&lt;/math&gt;).

The deformation gradient tensor can be expressed in component form as
:&lt;math&gt;
  F_{ij}=\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_j} + \delta_{ij},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement of a material point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; from coordinate &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; in the reference configuration to coordinate &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration (see [[Finite strain#Deformation gradient tensor|Figure 2]] in the finite strain theory page). Including the power expansion of strain energy function in the constitutive relation and replacing the Lagrangian strain tensor &lt;math&gt;E_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; with the expansion given on the [[Finite strain#Finite strain tensors|finite strain tensor]] page yields (note that lower case &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; have been used in this section compared to the upper case on the [[Finite strain#Finite strain tensors|finite strain]] page) the '''constitutive equation'''
:&lt;math&gt;
  P_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial X_l} + \frac{1}{2}M_{ijklmn}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial X_l}\frac{\partial u_m}{\partial X_n} 
  + \frac{1}{3}M_{ijklmnpq}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial X_l}\frac{\partial u_m}{\partial X_n}\frac{\partial u_p}{\partial X_q}+\cdots,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  M_{ijklmn} = C_{ijklmn} + C_{ijln}\delta_{km} + C_{jnkl}\delta_{im} + C_{jlmn}\delta_{ik},
 &lt;/math&gt;
and higher order terms have been neglected
&lt;ref name="norris97"&gt;Norris, A. N., "Finite-Amplitude Waves in Solids", in ''Nonlinear Acoustics'', Acoustical Society of America, (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="norris07"&gt;Norris, A. N., "Small-on-Large Theory with Applications to Granular Materials and Fluid/Solid Systems", ''Waves in Nonlinear Pre-Stressed Materials'', '''495''' of CISM Courses and Lectures, Springer, Vienna, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
(see &lt;ref name="eldevik"&gt;Eldevik, S., "Measurement of non-linear acoustoelastic effect in steel using acoustic resonance", PhD Thesis, University of Bergen, (in preparation)&lt;/ref&gt; for detailed derivations).
For referenceM by neglecting higher order terms in &lt;math&gt;\partial u_k / \partial X_l&lt;/math&gt; this expression reduce to
&lt;math&gt;
  P_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial X_l},
&lt;/math&gt;
which is a version of the generalised Hooke's law where &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of stress while &lt;math&gt;\partial u_k / \partial X_l&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of strain, and &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is the linear relation between them.

=== Sound velocity ===
Assuming that a small dynamic (acoustic) deformation disturb an already statically stressed material the acoustoelastic effect can be regarded as the effect on a small deformation superposed on a larger [[Finite strain|finite deformation]] (also called the small-on-large theory).&lt;ref name="norris07" /&gt; Let us define three states of a given material point. In the reference (un-stressed) state the point is defined by the coordinate vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{X}&lt;/math&gt; while the same point has the coordinate vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the static initially stressed state (i.e. under the influence of an applied pre-stress). Finally, assume that the material point under a small dynamic disturbance (acoustic stress field) have the coordinate vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x'}&lt;/math&gt;. The total displacement of the material points (under influence of both a static pre-stress and an dynamic acoustic disturbance) can then be described by the displacement vectors
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{u}=\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)} + \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}=\boldsymbol{x'}-\boldsymbol{X},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{u}^{(0)} = \boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{X}, \qquad \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}=\boldsymbol{x'} - \boldsymbol{x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
describes the static (Lagrangian) initial displacement due to the applied pre-stress, and the (Eulerian) displacement due to the acoustic disturbance, respectively. 
[[Continuum mechanics#Balance laws|Cauchy's first law of motion]] (or balance of linear momentum) for the additional Eulerian disturbance &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; can then be derived in terms of the intermediate Lagrangian deformation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; assuming that the small-on-large assumption
:&lt;math&gt;
  |\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}|&lt;&lt;|\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)}||
&lt;/math&gt;
holds.
Using the Lagrangian form of [[Continuum mechanics#Balance laws|Cauchy's first law of motion]], where the effect of a constant body force (i.e. gravity) has been neglected, yields
:&lt;math&gt;
  \operatorname{Div} \boldsymbol{P}^T  = \rho_0\ddot{\boldsymbol{x}'}.
 &lt;/math&gt;
:'''Note''' that the subscript/superscript "0" is used in this text to denote the un-stressed reference state, and a dotted variable is as usual the [[Time derivative|time (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) derivative]] of the variable, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Div}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Divergence#Application in Cartesian coordinates|divergence]] operator with respect to the Lagrangian coordinate system &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''right hand side''' (the time dependent part) of the law of motion can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho_0 \ddot{\boldsymbol{x}'} &amp;= \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} (\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)} + \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)} + \boldsymbol{X}) \\
    &amp;=\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}}{\partial t^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
under the assumption that both the unstressed state and the initial deformation state are static and thus &lt;math&gt;\partial^2 / \partial t^2(\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)}) = \partial^2 / \partial t^2(\boldsymbol{X}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

For the '''left hand side''' (the space dependent part) the spatial [[Continuum mechanics#Lagrangian description|Lagrangian]] partial derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt; can be expanded in the [[Continuum mechanics#Eulerian description|Eulerian]] &lt;math&gt;x_j&lt;/math&gt; by using the [[chain rule]] and changing the variables through the relation between the displacement vectors as &lt;ref name="norris07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial}{\partial X_j} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} + u^{(0)}_{k,j}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} + \cdots
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the short form &lt;math&gt;u^{(0)}_{k,j} \equiv \partial u^{(0)}_k / \partial x_j&lt;/math&gt; has been used. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial X_j} \approx \frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + u_{p.j}^{(0)}\frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial x_p}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Assuming further that the static initial deformation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; (the pre-stressed state) is in [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] means that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname(Div)\boldsymbol{P}^{(0)}=\boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and the law of motion can in combination with the constitutive equation given above be reduced to a linear relation (i.e. where higher order terms in &lt;math&gt;u_{m,n}^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;) between the static initial deformation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt; and the additional dynamic disturbance &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}(\boldsymbol{x}, t)&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref name="norris97" /&gt; (see &lt;ref name="eldevik" /&gt; for detailed derivations)
:&lt;math&gt;
  B_{ijkl}\frac{\partial^2 u_k^{(1)}}{\partial x_j \partial x_l} = \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 u_i^{(1)}}{\partial t^2},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;
  B_{ijkl} = C_{ijkl} + \delta_{ik}C_{jlqr}u_{q,r}^{(0)} + C_{rjkl}u_{i,r}^{(0)} + C_{irkl}u_{j,r}^{(0)} + C_{ijrl}u_{k,r}^{(0)} + C_{ijkr}u_{l,r}^{(0)} + C_{ijklmn}u_{m,n}^{(0)}.
 &lt;/math&gt;
This expression is recognised as the [[Wave Equation|linear wave equation]]. Considering a [[plane wave]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{u}^{(1)}(\boldsymbol{x}, t) = \boldsymbol{m}\, f(\boldsymbol{N}\cdot\boldsymbol{x} - ct),
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lagrangian unit vector in the direction of propagation (i.e. parallel to the wave number &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{k}=k\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt;normal to the wave front, ), &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector referred to as the polarization vector (describing the direction of particle motion), &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the phase wave speed, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a twice [[Differentiable function|continuously differentiable function]] (e.g. a [[Sinusoidal|sinusodial]] function). Inserting this plane wave in to the linear wave equation derived above yields
&lt;ref name="ogden07"&gt;Ogden, R. W., "Incremental Statics and Dynamics of Pre-Stressed Elastic Materials", ''Waves in Nonlinear Pre-Stressed Materials'', '''495''' of CISM Courses and Lectures, Springer, Vienna, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N})\boldsymbol{m} = \rho_0 c^2 \boldsymbol{m}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N})&lt;/math&gt; is introduced as the acoustic tensor, and depends on &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref name="ogden07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  [\boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N})]_{ik} = B_{ijkl} N_j N_l.
 &lt;/math&gt; 
This expression is called the [[Linear elasticity#Plane waves and Christoffel equation|propagation condition]] and determines for a given propagation direction &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{n}&lt;/math&gt; the velocity and polarization of possible waves corresponding to plane waves. The wave velocities can be determined by the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]]&lt;ref name="ogden07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \operatorname{det}(\boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N}) - \rho_0 c^2 \boldsymbol{I}) = 0,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[determinant]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]].

For a hyperelastic material &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N})&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric (but not in general), and the eigenvalues (&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;) are thus real. For the wave velocities to also be real the eigenvalues need to be positive.&lt;ref name="ogden" /&gt; If this is the case, three mutually orthogonal real plane waves exist for the given propagation direction &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt;. From the two expressions of the acoustic tensor it is clear that&lt;ref name="ogden07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_0 c^2 = \boldsymbol{Q}(\boldsymbol{N}) \boldsymbol{m}\cdot\boldsymbol{m} = B_{ijkl} N_j N_l m_i m_k,
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the inequality &lt;math&gt;B_{ijkl} N_j N_l m_i m_k &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; (also called the strong ellipticity condition) for all non-zero vectors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}&lt;/math&gt; guarantee that the velocity of homogeneous plane waves are real. The polarization &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}=\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a [[longitudinal wave]] where the particle motion is parallel to the propagation direction (also referred to as a compressional wave). The two polarizations where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}\cdot\boldsymbol{N}=0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to [[transverse wave]]s where the particle motion is orthogonal to the propagation direction (also referred to as shear waves).&lt;ref name="ogden07" /&gt;

== Isotropic materials ==

=== Elastic moduli for isotropic materials ===

For a second order isotropic tensor (i.e. a tensor having the same components in any coordinate system) like the Lagrangian strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E}&lt;/math&gt; have the invariants &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E}^q&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] operator, and &lt;math&gt;q\in\left\{1,2,3,\dots\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. The strain energy function of an isotropic material can thus be expressed by &lt;math&gt;W(\boldsymbol{E})=W(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E}^q),\, k\in \left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, or a superposition there of, which can be rewritten as&lt;ref name="norris07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  W = \frac{\lambda}{2}(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E})^2 + \mu \operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E}^2 + \frac{C}{3}(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E})^3 + B(\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E})\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E}^2 + \frac{A}{3}\operatorname{tr}\boldsymbol{E}^3+\cdots,
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda, \mu, A, B, C&lt;/math&gt; are constants. The constants &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elastic modulus|second order elastic moduli]] better known as the [[Lamé parameters]], while &lt;math&gt;A, B,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are the third order elastic moduli introduced by,&lt;ref name="LandauLifshitz"&gt;Landau, L. D., Lifshitz, E. M., ''Theory of Elasticity'', (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; which are alternative but equivalent to &lt;math&gt;l, m,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; introduced by Murnaghan.&lt;ref name="Murnaghan"/&gt;
Combining this with the general expression for the strain energy function it is clear that&lt;ref name="norris07" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_{ijkl} &amp;= \lambda \delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + 2\mu \delta I_{ijkl}, \\
  C_{ijklmn} &amp;= 2C \delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}\delta_{mn} + 2B(\delta_{ij}I_{klmn} + \delta_{kl}I_{mnij} + \delta_{mn}I_{ijkl}) +\frac{1}{2}A(\delta_{ik}I_{jlmn} + \delta_{il}I_{jkmn} + \delta_{jk}I_{ilmn} + \delta_{jl}I_{ikmn}),
\end{align}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_{ijkl} = \frac{1}{2}(\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk})&lt;/math&gt;. Historically different selection of these third order elastic constants have been used, and some of the variations is shown in Table 1.

== Acoustoelasticity for uniaxial tension of isotropic hyperelastic materials ==

A [[cuboid]]al sample of a [[Compressibility|compressible]] solid in an unstressed reference configuration can be expressed by the Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;X_i \in [0,L_i],\, i=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, where the geometry is aligned with the Lagrangian coordinate system, and &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the sides of the cuboid in the reference configuration. Subjecting the cuboid to a [[Stress (mechanics)#Uniaxial normal stress|uniaxial tension]] in the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;-direction so that it deforms with a pure homogeneous strain such that the coordinates of the material points in the deformed configuration can be expressed by &lt;math&gt;x_1=\lambda_1 X_1,x_2=\lambda_2 X_2,x_3=\lambda_3 X_3&lt;/math&gt;, which gives the
elongations
:&lt;math&gt;
  e_i \equiv l_i/L_i - 1 = \lambda_i - 1
 &lt;/math&gt; 
in the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;-direction. Here &lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt; signifies the current (deformed) length of the cuboid side &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and where the ratio between the length of the sides in the current and reference configuration are denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \lambda_i \equiv l_i/L_i
 &lt;/math&gt;
called the principal stretches. For an isotropic material this corresponds to a deformation without any rotation (See [[Finite strain#Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor|polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor]] where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{RU}=\boldsymbol{VR}&lt;/math&gt; and the rotation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{R}=\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;). This can be described through [[Finite strain#Spectral representation|spectral representation]] by the principal stretches &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; as eigenvalues, or equivalently by the elongations &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For a uniaxial tension in the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;-direction (&lt;math&gt;P_{11}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we assume that the &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; increase by some amount. If the lateral faces are [[Stress (mechanics)#Uniaxial normal stress|free of traction]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P_{22}=P_{33}=0&lt;/math&gt;) the lateral elongations &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_3&lt;/math&gt; are limited to the range &lt;math&gt;e_2,e_3 \in (-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;. For isotropic symmetry the lateral elongations (or contractions) must also be equal (i.e. &lt;math&gt;e_2=e_3&lt;/math&gt;). The range corresponds to the range from total lateral contraction (&lt;math&gt;e_2 = e_3 = -1&lt;/math&gt;, which is non-physical), and to no change in the lateral dimensions (&lt;math&gt;e_2 = e_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;). It is noted that theoretically the range could be expanded to values large than 0 corresponding to an increase in lateral dimensions as a result of increase in axial dimension. However, very few materials (called [[auxetic]] materials) exhibit this property.

=== Expansion of sound velocities ===
[[Image:Onde compression impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|305px|Plane longitudinal (pressure) pulse wave]]
[[Image:Onde cisaillement impulsion 1d 30 petit.gif|thumb|305px|Shear (transverse) plane wave]]

If the strong ellipticity condition (&lt;math&gt;B_{ijkl} N_j N_l m_i m_k &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) holds, three orthogonally polarization directions (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}&lt;/math&gt; will give a non-zero and real sound velocity for a given propagation direction &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The following will derive the sound velocities for óne selection of applied uniaxial tension, propagation direction, and an orthonormal set of polarization vectors. For a uniaxial tension applied in the &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;-direction, and deriving the sound velocities for waves propagating orthogonally to the applied tension (e.g. in the &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;-direction with propagation vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}=[0,0,1]&lt;/math&gt;), one selection of orthonormal polarizations may be
:&lt;math&gt;
  \{\boldsymbol{m}\} = 
    \begin{cases}
      \mathbf{m}_1 = \mathbf{\hat{x}}_1 = [1,0,0] &amp; \| \, \textrm{to} \, \textrm{applied} \, \textrm{tension}\\
      \mathbf{m}_2 = \mathbf{\hat{x}}_2 = [0,1,0] &amp; \perp \textrm{to} \, \textrm{applied} \, \textrm{tension}\\
      \mathbf{m}_3 = \mathbf{\hat{x}}_3 = [0,0,1] &amp; \| \, \textrm{to} \, \mathbf{N}
    \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
which gives the three sound velocities
:&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_0 c^2_{33} = B_{3333}, \qquad \rho_0 c^2_{31} = B_{1313}, \qquad \rho_0 c^2_{32} = B_{2323},
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the first index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of the sound velocities &lt;math&gt;c_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; indicate the propagation direction (here the &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;-direction, while the second index &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; indicate the selected polarization direction (&lt;math&gt;j=i&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to particle motion in the propagation direction &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; – i.e. longitudinal wave, and &lt;math&gt;j\neq i&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to particle motion perpendicular to the propagation direction – i.e. shear wave).

Expanding the relevant coefficients of the acoustic tensor, and substituting the second- and third-order elastic moduli &lt;math&gt;C_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_{ijklmn}&lt;/math&gt; with their isotropic equivalents, &lt;math&gt;\lambda,\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt; respectively, leads to the sound velocities expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \rho_0 c^2_{33} = \lambda + 2\mu + a_{33}e_1, \qquad
  \rho_0 c^2_{3k} = \mu + a_{3k}e_1, \quad k=1,2
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
    a_{33} = - \frac{2\lambda(\lambda + 2\mu) + \lambda A + 2(\lambda - \mu)B - 2\mu C}{\lambda + \mu}
 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
    a_{31} = \frac{(\lambda + 2\mu)(4\mu + A) + 4\mu B}{4(\lambda + \mu)}
 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
    a_{32} = - \frac{\lambda(4\mu + A) - 2\mu B}{2(\lambda + \mu)}
 &lt;/math&gt;
are the acoustoelastic coefficients related to effects from third order elastic constants.&lt;ref name="abiza"&gt;Abiza, Z., Destrade, M., Ogden, R. W., "Large acoustoelastic effect", ''Wave Motion'', '''49'''(2):364-374, (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement methods ==
[[File:TOFD setup.png|thumb|An acoustic setup with transmitter and receiver transducers.]]
[[Image:UT principe.svg|thumb|An acoustic setup based on pulse-echo]]

To be able to measure the sound velocity, and more specifically the change in sound velocity, in a material subjected to some stress state, one can measure the velocity of an acoustic signal propagating through the material in question. There are several methods to do this but all of them use one of two physical relations of the sound velocity. The first relation is related to the time it takes a signal to propagate from one point to another (typically the distance between two [[Ultrasonic sensor|acoustic transducers]] or two times the distance from one transducer to a reflective surface). This is often referred to as [[Speed of sound#Single-shot timing methods|"Time-of-flight"]] (TOF) measurements, and use the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
  c=\frac{d}{t}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance the signal travels and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time]] it takes to travel this distance. The second relation is related to the inverse of the time, the [[frequency]], of the signal. The relation here is
:&lt;math&gt;
  c=f\lambda
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the signal and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wave length]]. The measurements using the frequency as measurand use the pheonomenon of [[acoustic resonance]] where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; number of wave lengths match the length over which the signal resonate. Both these methods are dependent on the distance over which it measure, either directly as in the Time-of-flight, or indirectly through the matching number of wavelengths over the physical extent of the specimen which resonate.

=== Example of ultrasonic testing techniques ===
In general there are two ways to set up a transducer system to measure the sound velocity in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The sound velocity measurement can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter and when it is recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a ''pulse-echo'' system. Here one transducer is placed in the vicinity of the specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal. See [[ultrasonic testing]] for some measurement systems.

=== Longitudinal and polarized shear waves ===
[[File:Reflection at an interface.png|thumb|Diagram showing the mode conversion that occur when a longitudinal wave impinge on an interface at non-normal incidence]]

As explained above, a set of three orthonormal polarizations (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{m}&lt;/math&gt;) of the particle motion exist for a given propagation direction &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{N}&lt;/math&gt; in a solid. For measurement setups where the transducers can be fixated directly to the sample under investigation it is possible to create these three polarizations (one longitudinal, and two orthogonal transverse waves) by applying different types of transducers exciting the desired polarization (e.g. [[piezoelectric]] transducers with the needed [[Crystal oscillator|oscillation mode]]). Thus it is possible to measure the sound velocity of waves with all three polarizations through either time dependent or frequency dependent measurement setups depending on the selection of transducer types. However, if the transducer can not be fixated to the test specimen a coupling medium is needed to transmit the acoustic energy from the transducer to the specimen. Water or gels are often used as this coupling medium. For measurement of the longitudinal sound velocity this is sufficient, however [[Speed of sound#Dependence on the properties of the medium|fluids]] do not carry shear waves, and thus to be able to generate and measure the velocity of shear waves in the test specimen the incident longitudinal wave must interact at an oblique angle at the fluid/solid surface to generate shear waves through [[Reflection seismology#Reflection and transmission at non-normal incidence|mode conversion]]. Such shear waves are then converted back to longitudinal waves at the solid/fluid surface propagating back through the fluid to the recording transducer enabling the measurement of shear wave velocities as well through a coupling medium.

== Applications ==

=== Engineering material – stress estimation ===
As the industry strives to reduce maintenance and repair costs, [[non-destructive testing]] of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and as a means to measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure [[Residual stress#Measurement techniques|stress in a material]]. However, techniques using [[Interferometry|optical]] measurements, [[Magnetic field#Measurement|magnetic]] measurements, [[X-ray diffraction]], and [[neutron diffraction]] are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall [[structural integrity]].
Since the sound velocity of such non-linear elastic materials (including common construction materials like [[aluminium]] and [[steel]]) have a stress dependency, one application of the acoustoelastic effect may be measurement of the stress state in the interior of a loaded material utilizing different acoustic probes (e.g. [[Ultrasonic testing#See also|ultrasonic testing]]) to measure the change in sound velocities.

=== Granular and porous materials – geophysics ===
[[seismology]] study the propagation of elastic waves through the Earth and is used in e.g. [[earthquake]] studies and in [[Earth's interior|mapping the Earth's interior]]. The interior of the Earth is subjected to different pressures, and thus the acoustic signals may pass through media in different stress states. The acoustoelastic theory may thus be of practical interest where nonlinear wave behaviour may be used to estimate geophysical properties.&lt;ref name="norris07" /&gt;

=== Soft tissue – medical ultrasonics ===

The '''Altar Stone''' is a recumbent central [[megalith]] at [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], dating to Stonehenge phase 3i, around 2600 BC. It is made of a purplish-green micaceous [[sandstone]] and is thought to have originated from outcrops of the [[Senni Beds]] formation of the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in [[Wales]], though this is currently in debate.&lt;ref&gt;R.A.Ixer and P.Turner. 2006. A detailed re-examination of the petrography of the Altar Stone and other non-sarsen sandstones from Stonehenge as a guide to their provenance.

Stone 55 (a [[sarsen]] megalith) lies on top of Stone 80 perpendicularly, and is thought to have fallen across it. The Altar Stone weighs approximately six tons and (if it ever was upright) would have stood nearly two metres tall. Some believe that it always was recumbent &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=John|first1=Brian|title=The Stonehenge Bluestones|publisher=Greencroft Books|isbn=978-0905559-94-0|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes classed as a [[bluestone]], because it does not have a local provenance. 

Its name probably comes from a comment by [[Inigo Jones]] who wrote: "...whether it might be an Altar or no I leave to the judgment of others’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=John|title=Stonehenge|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1416576464|page=424|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LME6n_cdzVwC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=stonehenge+%22altar+stone%22+name+Inigo+Jones&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fKffU6fuLqaM7Aa4_IHgDA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=stonehenge%20%22altar%20stone%22%20name%20Inigo%20Jones&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3093">Energy and nutrients derived from aquatic ecosystems and transferred to terrestrial ecosystems are termed '''aquatic-terrestrial''' subsidies or, more simply, aquatic subsidies. The most common examples of aquatic subsidies involve [[organism]]s that move across habitat boundaries and deposit their nutrients as they decompose in terrestrial habitats or are consumed by terrestrial predators, such as spiders, lizards, birds, and bats.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, D.E. &amp; Smits, A.P. (2017). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-016-0050-7 Subsidies of aquatic resources in terrestrial ecosystems]. Ecosystems, 20(1),78-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, C. V., Fausch, K. D., &amp; Carl Saunders, W. (2005)[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01328.x/abstract Tangled webs: reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey link streams and riparian zones]. Freshwater Biology, 50(2), 201-220.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is exemplified by aquatic insects that develop within streams and lakes before emerging as winged adults and moving to terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Nakano, S., &amp; Murakami, M. (2001). [http://www.pnas.org/content/98/1/166.full Reciprocal subsidies: dynamic interdependence between terrestrial and aquatic food webs]. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(1), 166-170.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish removed from aquatic ecosystems by terrestrial predators are another important example. Conversely, the flow of energy and nutrients from [[terrestrial ecosystems]] to [[aquatic ecosystems]] are considered terrestrial subsidies; both aquatic subsidies and terrestrial subsidies are types of [[cross-boundary subsidies]]. 

==Ecological importance of aquatic subsidies==
While the magnitude of aquatic subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems is low compared to those moving in the reverse direction (from terrestrial to aquatic habitats), aquatic subsidies are generally of higher nutritional quality because they come from animal, rather than plant-based or detrital, sources.&lt;ref&gt;Bartels et al. (2012). [https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/11-1210.1 Reciprocal subsidies between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems structure consumer resource dynamics]. Ecology, 93(5), 1173-1182.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their nutritional value, however, aquatic subsidies are increasingly recognized as important sources of environmental contaminants to terrestrial food webs.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, D.M., Fritz, K.M., Otter, R.R. (2008).[https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/08-0354.1 The dark side of subsidies: adult stream insects export organic contaminants to riparian predators.]. Ecological Applications, 18(8), 1835-1841.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, aquatic animals can accumulate pollutants in their tissues and exoskeletons (such as metals and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]]) and move them to riparian and terrestrial systems as they emerge or are consumed by terrestrial predators.

The [[petrochemical]] complex of '''Augusta-Priolo''' (called ''Polo petrolchimico siracusano'' in Italian) is a vast industrialized coastal area in eastern [[Sicily]] including the territory of the municipalities of [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]], [[Priolo Gargallo]] and [[Melilli]]. Main industrial activities are [[oil refining]], processing of oil derivatives and [[energy production]]. The complex, whose beginnings date back to 1949, has produced significant environmental problems for the coastline and the entire area, which accordingly is sometimes dubbed "Trinacria nera" (black Sicily or black triangle) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinacria Nera - The history of the triangle of death|author=Roman Herzog|year=2005|url=http://www.radioparole.it/en/trinacrianera.html|publisher=Radioparole - independent radio documentary productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the companies in the region are [[ExxonMobil]], [[Sasol]], [[Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone|ERG]], [[Polimeri Europa]] and [[Eni|Syndial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/264813/Human-Health-in-Areas-with-Industrial-Contamination-Eng.pdf|title=Human Health in Areas with Industrial Contamination|publisher=WHO|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meter communicates to its collection point using 900 MHz [[mesh network]] topology.]]
'''Automatic meter reading''' ('''AMR''') is the technology of automatically collecting consumption, diagnostic, and status data from [[water meter]] or [[energy meter]]ing devices (gas, electric) and transferring that data to a central database for billing, troubleshooting, and analyzing.
This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. This timely information coupled with analysis can help both utility providers and customers better control the use and production of electric energy, gas usage, or water consumption.

AMR technologies include handheld, mobile and network technologies based on telephony platforms (wired and wireless), radio frequency (RF), or powerline transmission.

==Technologies==

=== Touch technology===
With touch-based AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer or data collection device with a wand or probe. The device automatically collects the readings from a meter by touching or placing the read probe in close proximity to a reading [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] enclosed in the touchpad. When a button is pressed, the probe sends an interrogate signal to the touch module to collect the meter reading. The software in the device matches the serial number to one in the route database, and saves the meter reading for later download to a billing or data collection computer. Since the meter reader still has to go to the site of the meter, this is sometimes referred to as "on-site" AMR. Another form of contact reader uses a standardized infrared port to transmit data. Protocols are standardized between manufacturers by such documents as [[ANSI C12.18]] or [[IEC 61107]].

=== AMR Hosting ===
AMR Hosting is a back-office solution which allows a user to track his/her [[electricity]], [[water]], or [[gas]] consumption over the Internet. All data is collected in near real-time, and is stored in a database by data acquisition software. The user can view the data via a web application, and can analyze the data using various online analysis tools such as charting load profiles, analyzing tariff components, and verify his/her utility bill.

=== Radio frequency network===
[[Radio frequency]] based AMR can take many forms. The more common ones are handheld, mobile, satellite and fixed network solutions. There are both two-way RF systems and one-way RF systems in use that use both licensed and unlicensed RF bands.

In a two-way or "wake up" system, a radio signal is normally sent to an AMR meter's unique serial number, instructing its [[transceiver]] to power-up and transmit its data. The meter transceiver and the reading transceiver both send and receive radio signals. In a one-way “bubble-up” or continuous [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] type system, the meter transmits continuously and data is sent every few seconds. This means the reading device can be a receiver only, and the meter a transmitter only. Data travels only from the meter transmitter to the reading receiver. There are also hybrid systems that combine one-way and two-way techniques, using one-way communication for reading and two-way communication for programming functions.

[[Radio frequency|RF]]-based meter reading usually eliminates the need for the meter reader to enter the property or home, or to locate and open an underground meter pit. The utility saves money by increased speed of reading, has less liability from entering private property, and has fewer missed readings from being unable to access the meter.

The technology based on RF is not readily accepted everywhere. In several Asian countries, the technology faces a barrier of regulations in place pertaining to use of the radio frequency of any radiated power. For example, in India the radio frequency which is generally in [[ISM band]] is not free to use even for low power radio of 10 [[milliwatt|mW]]. The majority of manufacturers of electricity meters have radio frequency devices in the frequency band of 433/868&amp;nbsp;MHz for large scale deployment in European countries. The frequency band of 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz can be now used in India for outdoor as well as indoor applications, but few manufacturers have shown products within this frequency band. Initiatives in radio frequency AMR in such countries are being taken up with regulators wherever the cost of licensing outweighs the benefits of AMR.

==== Handheld ====
In handheld AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer with a built-in or attached receiver/transceiver (radio frequency or touch) to collect meter readings from an AMR capable meter. This is sometimes referred to as "walk-by" meter reading since the meter reader walks by the locations where meters are installed as they go through their meter reading route.  Handheld computers may also be used to manually enter readings without the use of AMR technology as an alternate but this will not support exhaustive data which can be accurately read using the meter reading electronically.

==== Mobile ====
Mobile or "drive-by" meter reading is where a reading device is installed in a vehicle. The meter reader drives the vehicle while the reading device automatically collects the meter readings. Often, for mobile meter reading, the reading equipment includes navigational and mapping features provided by [[GPS]] and mapping software. With mobile meter reading, the reader does not normally have to read the meters in any particular route order, but just drives the service area until all meters are read. Components often consist of a laptop or proprietary computer, software, RF receiver/transceiver, and external vehicle [[antennas]].

==== Satellite ====
Satellite transmitters can be installed in the field next to existing meters. The satellite AMR devices communicates with the meter for readings, and then sends those readings over a fixed or mobile satellite network.  This network requires a clear view to the sky for the satellite transmitter/receiver, but eliminates the need to install fixed towers or send out field technicians, thereby being particularly suited for areas with low geographic meter density.

==== RF technologies commonly used for AMR ====
* Narrow Band (single fixed radio frequency)
* [[Spread Spectrum]]
** [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS)
** [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (FHSS)

There are also meters using AMR with RF technologies such as cellular phone data systems, [[ZigBee]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wavenis]] and others. Some systems operate with U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) licensed frequencies and others under [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]], which allows use of unlicensed radio frequencies.

==== Wi-Fi ====
[[WiSmart]] is a versatile platform which can be used by a variety of electrical home appliances in order to provide wireless [[TCP/IP]] communication using the 802.11 b/g protocol.

Devices such as the Smart Thermostat permit a utility to lower a home's power consumption to help manage power demand.

The city of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] became one of the first cities in the [[United States]] to implement citywide [[Wi-Fi]], which had been free until May 31, 2007, mainly to facilitate AMR after a meter reader was attacked by a dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201400236 EarthLink Dedicates Wi-Fi Network In Corpus Christi]&lt;/ref&gt; Today many{{Which|date=January 2010}} meters are designed to transmit using Wi-Fi, even if a Wi-Fi network is not available, and they are read using a drive-by local Wi-Fi hand held receiver.

The meters installed in Corpus Christi are not directly Wi-Fi enabled, but rather transmit narrow-band burst [[telemetry]] on the 460&amp;nbsp;MHz band.  This narrow-band signal has much greater range than Wi-Fi, so the number of receivers required for the project are far fewer. Special receiver stations then decode the narrow-band signals and resend the data via Wi-Fi.

Most of the automated utility meters installed in the Corpus Christi area are battery powered.  Wi-Fi technology is unsuitable for long-term battery-powered operation.

=== Power line communication ===
[[Power line communication|PLC]] is a method where electronic data is transmitted over power lines back to the substation, then relayed to a central computer in the utility's main office. This would be considered a type of fixed network system—the network being the distribution network which the utility has built and maintains to deliver electric power. Such systems are primarily used for electric meter reading. Some providers have interfaced gas and water meters to feed into a PLC type system.

== Brief history==
In 1972, [[Theodore George “Ted” Paraskevakos]], while working with [[Boeing]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security, fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities. This technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system, now known as [[Caller ID]].

In 1974, Mr. Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|3,842,208}} (Sensor Monitoring Device)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he launched Metretek, Inc.[https://web.archive.org/web/20010223154025/http://www.metretekfl.com/], which developed and produced the first fully automated, commercially available remote meter reading and load management system. Since this system was developed pre-Internet, Metretek utilized the [[IBM Series/1|IBM series 1 mini-computer]].  For this approach, Mr. Paraskevakos and Metretek were awarded multiple patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4,241,237}} and {{US Patent|4,455,453}} and Canadian Patent # 1,155,243 (Apparatus and Method for Remote Sensor Monitoring, Metering and Control)&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary driver for the automation of meter reading is not to reduce labor costs, but to obtain data that is difficult to obtain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual meter reading made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of walk-by and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings of the meters. Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a "...time-based rate schedule ''(to)'' enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and '''communications technology'''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303163112/http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }} US Congress, Energy Policy Act of 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The trend now is to consider the use of advanced meters as part of an [[Advanced Metering Infrastructure]].[[Image:First Automatic Meter Reading and Load Management System.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The First Commercially Available Remote Meter Reading and Load Management System - Metretek, Inc. (1978)]]

=== Advanced AMR and AMI ===
Originally AMR devices just collected meter readings electronically and matched them with accounts. As technology has advanced, additional data could then be captured, stored, and transmitted to the main computer, and often the metering devices could be controlled remotely. This can include events alarms such as tamper, leak detection, low battery, or reverse flow. Many AMR devices can also capture interval data, and log meter events. The logged data can be used to collect or control time of use or rate of use data that can be used for water or energy usage profiling, time of use billing, demand forecasting, [[demand response]], [[Volumetric flow rate|rate of flow]] recording, [[leak detection]], flow monitoring, [[Water conservation|water]] and [[Energy Conservation|energy conservation]] enforcement, remote shutoff, etc. [[Advanced metering infrastructure]], or AMI is the new term coined to represent the networking technology of fixed network meter systems that go beyond AMR into remote utility management. The meters in an AMI system are often referred to as [[smart meter]]s, since they often can use collected data based on programmed logic.

The Automatic Meter Reading Association (AMRA) endorses the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) resolution to eliminate regulatory barriers to the broad implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The resolution, passed in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/res.to.remove.regulatory.barriers.to.the.broad.implementation.of.advanced.metering.infrastructure.pdf Resolution to Remove Regulatory Barriers To the Broad Implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure] (from [http://www.naruc.org/resolutions.cfm?action=doit&amp;AdoptedDate=2007-02-21&amp;committeeID=50&amp;criteria= NARUC Committee on Energy Resources and the Environment Resolutions of 2007-02-21])&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged the role of AMI in supporting the implementation of dynamic pricing and the resulting benefits to consumers. The resolution further identified the value of AMI in achieving significant utility operational cost savings in the areas of outage management, revenue protection and asset management. The resolution also called for AMI business case analysis to identify cost-effective deployment strategies, endorsed timely cost recovery for prudently incurred AMI expenditures and made additional recommendations on rate making and tax treatment of such investments.

===Benefits of advanced metering===
Advanced metering systems can provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers. Benefits will be recognized by the utilities with increased efficiencies, outage detection, tamper notification and reduced labor cost as a result of automating reads, connections and disconnects. Retail providers will be able to offer new innovative products in addition to customizing packages for their customers.  In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more flexible billing cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles.  With timely usage information available to the customer, benefits will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions.

In many cases, smart metering is required by law (e.g. Pennsylvania's Act 129 (2008)).

The benefits of smart metering for the utility.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

* Potentially reduced reliability (more complicated meters, more potential for interference by third parties)&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;
* Increased security risks from network or remote access&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

=== Notable deployments ===
Construction practices, weather, and the need for information drive utilities in different parts of the world towards AMR at different rates.

By using a combination of AMR and energy analytics reports, [[Spar (retailer)|SPAR]] were able to reduce energy consumption by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stark.co.uk/resources/case-studies/spar/|title=SPAR - Stark's energy management helps exceed cost reduction targets - Stark|work=Stark|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
AMI in Australia has grown from both government policy which sought to rectify observed market inefficiencies, and distribution businesses who looked to gain operational efficiencies.  In July 2008, there was a mandated program being planned in Victoria for the deployment of 2.6 million meters over a 4-year period.  The anticipated peak installation rate of AMI meters was 5,000 per day across Victoria.  The program governance was provided by an industry steering committee.

In 2009 the Victorian Auditor General undertook a review of the program and found that there were "significant inadequacies" in advice to Government and that project governance "has not been appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itnews.com.au/News/160398,auditor-general-slams-victorian-smart-meters.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The Victorian government subsequently announced a moratorium of the program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/9853.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810042218/http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/9853.html |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''auxochrome''' (from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|αὐξάνω}} ''auxanō'' "increase" and {{wikt-lang|grc|χρῶμα}} ''chrōma'' "colour") is a group of atoms attached to a [[chromophore]] which modifies the ability of that chromophore to [[Absorption (light)|absorb light]]. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the [[chromogen]].&lt;ref name="Prince"&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Organic Chemistry | publisher=Jai Sai Publications | first=M. | last=Vishwanathan | location=Kollam, Kerala | page=2/30}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[hydroxyl group]] (−OH), the [[amino group]] (−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[aldehyde]] group (−CHO), and the [[methyl mercaptan]] group (−SCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gronowitz|first=Salo J. O.|journal=Arkiv för Kemi|volume=27|page=239|date=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auxochrome is a [[functional group]] of atoms with one or more [[lone pair]]s of electrons when attached to a chromophore, alters both the [[wavelength]] and intensity of [[Absorption (light)|absorption]]. If these groups are in direct [[Conjugation (organic chemistry)|conjugation]] with the [[Pi-bond|pi]]-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one [[lone pair]] of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]].

==Effects on chromophore==

It increases the color of any [[organic compound]]. For example, [[benzene]] does not display color as it does not have a chromophore; but [[nitrobenzene]] is pale yellow color because of the presence of a [[nitro group]] (−NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which acts as a chromophore. But [[p-Nitrophenol|''p''-hydroxynitrobenzene]] exhibits a deep yellow color, in which the [[hydroxyl|−OH]] group acts as an auxochrome. Here the auxochrome (−OH) is conjugated with the chromophore −NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similar behavior is seen in [[azobenzene]] which has a red color, but [[p-Hydroxyazobenzene|''p''-hydroxyazobenzene]] is dark red in color.

The presence of an auxochrome in the [[chromogen]] molecule is essential to make a [[dye]]. However, if an auxochrome is present in the meta position to the chromophore, it does not affect the color.

An auxochrome is known as a compound that produces a [[bathochromic shift]], also known as red shift because it increases the wavelength of absorption, therefore moving closer to [[infrared light]]. [[Woodward's rules|Woodward−Fieser rules]] estimate the shift in wavelength of maximum absorption for several auxochromes attached to a [[conjugated system]] in an organic molecule.

An auxochrome helps a dye to bind to the object that is to be colored.  [[Electrolytic dissociation]] of the auxochrome group helps in binding and it is due to this reason a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] substance takes an [[acid]]ic dye.

==Explanation for the colour modification==
A molecule exhibits colour because it absorbs colours only of certain frequencies and reflects or transmits others. They are capable of absorbing and emitting light of various frequencies. Light waves with frequency very close to their [[natural frequency]] are absorbed readily. This phenomenon, known as [[resonance]], means that the molecule can absorb radiation of a particular frequency which is same as the frequency of electron movement within the molecule. The chromophore is the part of the molecule where the energy difference between two different [[molecular orbitals]] falls within the range of the [[visible spectrum]] and hence absorbs some particular colours from visible light. Hence the molecule appears coloured. When auxochromes are attached to the molecule, the natural frequency of the chromophore gets changed and thus the colour gets modified. Different auxochromes produce different effects in the chromophore which in turn causes absorption of light from other parts of the spectrum. Normally, auxochromes which intensify the colour are chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Dye Spectrum | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaGZ6a_ZXEcC&amp;pg=PA52-IA2&amp;dq=Chromophore+intitle:New+intitle:Scientist&amp;hl=ml#v=onepage&amp;q=Chromophore&amp;intitle%3ANew&amp;intitle%3AScientist&amp;f=false | journal=New Scientist |date=May 1989 | volume=122 | issue=1665 | pages=52 | ISSN=0262-4079 | publisher=Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

There are mainly two types of auxochromes:

* [[Acid]]ic: [[Carboxyl|−COOH]], [[Hydroxyl|−OH]], [[Sulfonate|−SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H]]
* [[Base (chemistry)|Basic]]: [[Amino group|−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Secondary amine|−NHR]], [[Tertiary amine|−NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1265">'''Bonny Light oil''' is a high grade of [[Nigerian]] [[crude oil]] with high [[API gravity]] (low [[specific gravity]]), produced in the [[Niger Delta Basin (geology)|Niger Delta basin]] and named after the prolific region around the city of [[Bonny, Rivers|Bonny]].

The very low [[sulfur]] content of Bonny Light crude makes it a highly desired grade for its low corrosiveness to [[Oil refinery|refinery]] infrastructure and the lower [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]] of its byproducts in refinery effluent.

Other grades of [[Nigerian]] crude oil are [[Qua Iboe crude oil]], [[Brass River crude oil]], and [[Forcados crude oil]]. The [[Cabinda crude oil]] is a common grade of crude oil produced in [[Angola]]. The Bonny Light is in high demand specifically by American and European refineries. It is therefore a major source of income for the oil-rich nation.

The national government of Nigeria runs and takes part in the petroleum industry of Nigeria through the NNPC corporation. Libya's NOC also owns a 36% stake in NNPC which is valued at $112 Billion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4213">In [[materials science]], the '''Burgers vector''', named after Dutch physicist [[Jan Burgers]], is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], often denoted as '''b''', that represents the [[Magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and direction of the lattice distortion resulting from a [[dislocation]] in a [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;Callister, William D. Jr. "Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering," [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc. Danvers, MA. (2005)/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Vector de Burgers.PNG|250px|thumbnail|right|Burgers vectors]]
The vector's magnitude and direction is best understood when the dislocation-bearing crystal structure is first visualized ''without'' the dislocation, that is, the ''perfect'' crystal structure. In this [[perfect crystal]] structure, a rectangle whose lengths and widths are integer multiples of "a" (the [[Crystal structure#Unit cell|unit cell]] edge length) is drawn ''encompassing'' the site of the original dislocation's origin. Once this encompassing rectangle is drawn, the dislocation can be introduced. This dislocation will have the effect of deforming, not only the perfect crystal structure, but the rectangle as well. The said rectangle could have one of its sides disjoined from the perpendicular side, severing the connection of the length and width line segments of the rectangle at one of the rectangle's corners, and displacing each [[line segment]] from each other. What was once a rectangle before the dislocation was introduced is now an open geometric figure, whose opening defines the direction and magnitude of the Burgers vector. Specifically, the breadth of the opening defines the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and, when a set of fixed coordinates is introduced, an angle between the termini of the dislocated rectangle's length line segment and width line segment may be specified.

When calculating the Burgers vector practically, one may draw a rectangular clockwise circuit from a starting point to enclose the dislocation (see the picture above). The Burgers vector will be the vector from the START to the END of the circuit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~maelabs/mae324/glos324/burgersvector.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The direction of the vector depends on the plane of dislocation, which is usually on one of the closest-packed crystallographic planes.  
The magnitude is usually represented by the equation (For BCC and FCC lattices only):
::&lt;math&gt;
\|\mathbf{b}\|\ = (a/2)\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is the unit cell edge length of the crystal, ||'''b'''|| is the magnitude of Burgers vector and ''h'', ''k'', and ''l'' are the components of the Burgers vector, '''b''' = &lt;math&gt;(a/2) \langle h k l \rangle &lt;/math&gt; , and the coefficient a/2 is owing to the fact that in BCC and FCC lattices, the shortest lattice vectors could be as expressed &lt;math&gt;(a/2) \langle h k l \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. Comparatively, for simple cubic lattices, '''b''' = &lt;math&gt;a \langle h k l \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and hence the magnitude is represented by
::&lt;math&gt;
\|\mathbf{b}\|\ = a\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

In most metallic materials, the magnitude of the Burgers vector for a dislocation is of a magnitude equal to the interatomic spacing of the material, since a single dislocation will offset the crystal lattice by one close-packed crystallographic spacing unit.

In [[Dislocation#Edge dislocations|edge dislocations]], the Burgers vector and [[Crystallographic_defect#Line_defects|dislocation line]] are perpendicular to one another. In [[Dislocation#Screw dislocations|screw dislocations]], they are parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, Charles, "Introduction to Solid State Physics," 7th edition, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc, (1996) pp 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burgers vector is significant in determining the [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of a material by affecting [[Solid solution strengthening|solute hardening]], [[precipitation hardening]] and [[work hardening]].

The '''CIS Tower''' is an office skyscraper on Miller Street in [[Manchester]], England. It was completed in 1962 and rises to 387 feet (118 m) in height. The Grade II [[listed building]], which houses the [[Co-operative Banking Group]], is Manchester's second-[[Tallest buildings in Manchester|tallest building]] and the tallest office building in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower remained as built for over 40 years until maintenance issues on the service tower required an extensive renovation which included covering its facade in [[Solar panel|photovoltaic panels]].

==Background==
[[File:CIS Tower tiled in 2002.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The mosaic-clad tower in 2002]]
The tower was designed as a prestige headquarters to showcase the Co-operative movement in Manchester.&lt;ref name="Mod Soc"&gt;{{Citation  |title=marvellous modern icons  |url=http://www.manchestermodernistsociety.org/icon.html  |publisher=Manchester Modernists Society  |date=31 October 2011  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705145949/http://manchestermodernistsociety.org/icon.html  |archivedate=5 July 2012  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 the company proposed building an office tower block, construction began the following year and was completed in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=CIS Tower  |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=118 |publisher=Skyscraper News|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was designed by [[Gordon Tait]] of Burnett, Tait &amp; Partners and Co-operative's own architect, G. S. Hay. In the 1990s, it was granted Grade II [[listed building]] status by [[English Heritage]]. The tower, described as "the best of the Manchester 1960s office blocks",&lt;ref name = "LaB"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Co-operative Wholesale Society and the Co-operative Insurance Society Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/manchester/buildings-in-focus/the-cws-and-cis-buildings.html|publisher=Looking at Buildings|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was listed for its "discipline and consistency". It is part of a group with New Century House and its Conference Hall on Corporation Street.&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE |num=1270494 |desc=Co-operative Insurance Society (CIS) building, Miller Street, Manchester |grade=II|accessdate=23 August 2013|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower's design was influenced by [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]]'s [[Inland Steel Building]] in Chicago after a visit by the architects in 1958.&lt;ref name = "Mod Soc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{Citation|title=History of the solar tower|url=http://www.goodwithmoney.co.uk/history-of-the-solar-tower|publisher=The Co-operative Bank|date=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021238/http://www.goodwithmoney.co.uk/history-of-the-solar-tower|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, at 387 feet, the CIS Tower overtook the [[Shell Centre]] as the [[List of tallest buildings in the United Kingdom|tallest building in the United Kingdom]], a title it retained for a year until it was replaced by the [[Millbank Tower]] in London. In 2006 the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] became the tallest building in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Green light for high living |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/3218247.stm|publisher=The BBC|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The office tower building rises above a five-storey [[podium]] block. It has a steel frame and glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]]s with metal window frames. Black [[vitreous enamel]] panels demarcate the floor levels. The building materials, glass, enamelled steel and aluminium, were chosen so that the building could remain clean in the polluted Manchester atmosphere.&lt;ref name = "LaB"/&gt; The tower's concrete service shaft, which rises above the office tower, has two bands of vents at the top and was clad in a mosaic made up of 14 million centimetre-square, grey [[tessera]]e&lt;ref name=NHLE/&gt; designed to shimmer and sparkle.&lt;ref name = "Hist"/&gt; The projecting [[reinforced concrete]] service shaft houses lifts and emergency stairs.&lt;ref name = "Air con"&gt;{{Citation |title=Part-3 Air Conditioned Office Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-458645-cooperative-insurance-society-manchester|format = PDF|page = 12 |publisher=Heritage Group Website for CIBSE|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ground floor is set back behind six pillars. A green [[bronze]]-like, abstract [[mural]] sculpted by [[William George Mitchell]] made from [[fibreglass]] covers the entrance hall's rear wall.&lt;ref name=NHLE/&gt; The building has 700,000 square feet of floor area with clear open spaces on the office floors.&lt;ref name = "Air con"/&gt; Interiors were designed by [[Misha Black]] of the [[Design Research Unit]]. The executive areas are delineated by the use of [[teak]] and cherry wood [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s.&lt;ref name = "LaB"/&gt;

==Renovation==
Within six months of construction some of the mosaic tiles on the service tower became detached owing to cement failure and lack of [[expansion joint]]s in the concrete. Although the tower was granted listed building status in 1995, falling tiles were an ongoing problem. [[English Heritage]] had to be consulted as alterations could change the building's appearance.&lt;ref name="20CSoc"&gt;{{citation |title=CIS Tower, Manchester April 2003 |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/reports/2003/cis-tower-manchester.html |publisher=The Twentieh Century Society |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813062133/http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/reports/2003/cis-tower-manchester.html |archivedate=13 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 CIS consulted [[Solarcentury]] with a view to replacing the deteriorating mosaic with 575.5&amp;nbsp;kW of blue [[building-integrated photovoltaic]] (PV) cells which would provide a permanent [[green energy]] solution, generating approximately 180,000 kWh (average of 20&amp;nbsp;kW) of electricity per year. The work was completed by [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] and at that time was the largest commercial solar façade in Europe. The PV cells made by [[Sharp Electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=CIS Tower, Manchester |url=http://www.sharpmanufacturing.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/sukm/hs.xsl/-/html/cis-tower-manchester.htm |publisher=Sharp Manufacturing |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; began feeding electricity to the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] in November 2005.&lt;ref name = "MEN"&gt;{{Citation |title=Solar power tower hits city |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/214468_solar_power_tower_hits_city |publisher = Manchester evening News |date=22 February 2003 |accessdate= 24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Clyde Wind Farm''' is a  350 [[megawatt]] (MW) [[wind farm]] near [[Abington, South Lanarkshire|Abington]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]].

==Planning==
The 152-turbine project by [[Scottish and Southern Energy]] was approved by the [[Scottish Parliament]] in July 2008, and is capable of powering 200,000 homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sse.com/Clyde SSE Clyde Project website]&lt;/ref&gt; SSE was given planning permission to build a wind farm with turbines built on either side of the [[M74 motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/07/21/eawind121.xml | title=Europe's largest onshore wind farm is to be built in Scotland costing £600m | first=Simon | last=Johnson | work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | date=2008-07-21 | accessdate=2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Construction of the wind farm, which was budgeted for £600 million, began in early 2009 and finished in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7517176.stm | title=Green light for massive wind farm | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2008-07-21 | accessdate=2008-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welcon Towers Ltd won the contract to supply the towers for all 152 turbines for the £600 million Clyde Wind Farm.  Jesper Øhlenschlæger, chief executive officer of Welcon Towers parent company Skykon, said: ‘The Clyde project is a very important business win for our Campbeltown manufacturing.  Scotland has become the most positive and the most interesting renewable wind power market in Europe. The Clyde Wind Farm project represents a landmark phase in Scotland’s renewable energy strategy.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.campbeltowncourier.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/5284/Well_done_Welcon.html | title=Well Done Welcon | publisher=[[The Campbeltown Courier]] | date=2009-11-27 | accessdate=2009-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm was opened at a ceremonial ribbon cutting by [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sharecast.com/cgi-bin/sharecast/story.cgi?story_id=20363821 | title=Salmond opens SSE's Clyde wind farm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension==
In July 2014 it was announced that Scottish ministers had approved an extension to the Clyde Wind Farm.&lt;ref name="bbc14"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-28446762 | title=Ministers approve two wind farm projects in Scotland | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2014-07-23 | accessdate=2014-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension will see 54 extra turbines, capable of generating an additional 162MW. This will bring the total generating capacity of the wind farm to 512MW.&lt;ref name="bbc14"/&gt;

'''Cobalt sulfide''' is the name for [[chemical compound]]s with a formula Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.  Well-characterized species include minerals with the formula CoS, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the sulfides of cobalt are black, [[semi-conductor|semiconducting]], insoluble in water, and [[Non-stoichiometric compound|nonstoichiometric]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;John D. Donaldson, Detmar Beyersmann "Cobalt and Cobalt Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_281.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minerals and hydrometallurgy==
Cobalt sulfides occur widely as minerals, comprising major sources of all cobalt compounds.  Binary cobalt sulfide minerals include the [[cattierite]] (CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[linnaeite]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see image in table) is isostructural with iron [[pyrite]], featuring disulfide groups, i.e. Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.  Linnaeite, also rare, adopts the [[spinel]] motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemistry of the Elements |last=Greenwood |first=Norman N. |authorlink= |author2=Earnshaw, Alan |year=1984 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-08-022057-6 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; compound is known as a very rare cobaltpentlandite (the Co analogue of [[pentlandite]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindat.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed metal sulfide minerals include [[carrollite]] (CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[siegenite (Co&lt;sub&gt;3−x&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

Cobalt sulfide minerals are converted to cobalt via roasting and extraction into aqueous acid.  In some processes, the cobalt salts are further purified by precipitated when aqueous solutions of cobalt(II) ions are treated with [[hydrogen sulfide]].  Not only is this reaction useful in the purification of cobalt from its ores, but also in [[qualitative inorganic analysis]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Applications and research==
In combination with molybdenum, the sulfides of cobalt are used as catalysts for the industrial process called [[hydrodesulfurization]], which is implemented on a large scale in [[Oil refinery|refineries]].  Synthetic cobalt sulfides are widely investigated as electrocatalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathew|first=Simon|last2=Yella|first2=Aswani|last3=Gao|first3=Peng|last4=Humphry-Baker|first4=Robin|last5=Curchod|first5=Basile F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Complex metal hydrides''' are salts wherein the anions contain [[hydride]]s.  In the older chemical literature as well as contemporary [[Solid state chemistry|materials science]] textbooks, a "[[metal hydride]]" is assumed to be nonmolecular, i.e. three-dimensional lattices of atomic ions.  In such systems, hydrides are often interstitial and [[nonstoichiometric compound|nonstoichiometric]], and the bonding between the metal and hydrogen atoms is significantly [[ionic bonding|ionic]].  In contrast, complex metal hydrides typically contain more than one type of metal or metalloid and may be soluble but invariably react with water.  They exhibit ionic bonding between a positive metal ion with molecular [[anion]]s containing the hydride.  In such materials the hydrogen is bonded with significant [[covalent]] character to the second metal or metalloid atoms.&lt;ref name=Holle&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In general, complex metal hydrides have the formula M&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M'&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where M is an alkali metal cation or cation complex and M' is a metal or metalloid.  Well known examples feature [[group 13 element]]s, especially boron and aluminium including [[sodium aluminium hydride]], NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (also known as sodium alanate), [[lithium aluminum hydride]], LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[lithium borohydride]], (LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  Complex metal hydrides are often soluble in [[ether]]ial [[solvent]]s.  Other complex metal hydrides are numerous.  Illustrative examples include the salts [MgBr([[THF]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;FeH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Potassium nonahydridorhenate|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ReH&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Holle/&gt;

A '''delta-wye transformer''' is a type of [[three-phase]] [[electric power]] [[transformer]] design that employs delta-connected windings on its primary and wye/star connected windings on its secondary. A [[neutral wire]] can be provided on wye output side.  It can be a single three-phase transformer, or built from three independent single-phase units.  An equivalent term is '''delta-star transformer'''. 

[[Image:DeltaWyeTransformer.svg|thumb|One possible ''delta-wye transformer'' configuration.&lt;ref name="International Standard IEC 60076-1 Edition 2:1993 consolidated with amendment 1:1999"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex D - Three-phase transformer connections|url=http://212.175.131.171/IEC/iec60076-1%7Bed2.1%7Den_d.pdf#page=43|publisher=IEC|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Delta-wye transformers are common in commercial, industrial, and high-density residential locations, to supply three-phase [[Electric power distribution|distribution systems]].

An example would be a distribution transformer with a delta primary, running on three 11 kV phases with no neutral or earth required, and a star (or wye) secondary providing a 3-phase supply at 415 V, with the domestic voltage of 240 available between each phase and the earthed (grounded) neutral point.

The delta winding allows third-harmonic currents to circulate within the transformer, and prevents third-harmonic currents from flowing in the supply line. &lt;ref name=TANDD&gt; ''Electrical Transmission and Distribution Reference Book,Westinghouse Electric Corporation'', 1964, Chapter 5, table 15&lt;/ref&gt; Delta connected windings are not common for higher transmission voltages (138 kV and above) owing to the higher cost of insulation compared with a wye connection. &lt;ref&gt; Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', Mc Graw Hill 1978, page 17-39 &lt;/ref&gt;

Delta-wye transformers introduce a 30, 150, 270 or 330 degree phase shift.&lt;ref name="Annex D - Three-phase transformer connections"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEC Standard 60076-1 Edition 2:1993 consolidated with amendment 1:1999|url=http://212.175.131.171/IEC/iec60076-1%7Bed2.1%7Den_d.pdf#page=43|publisher=IEC|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus they cannot be paralleled with wye-wye (or delta-delta) transformers. However, they can be paralleled with identical configurations and some different configurations of other delta-wye (or wye-delta with some attention) transformers.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1932">A '''deposit-refund system''' (DRS), also known as '''deposit-return system''', '''advance deposit fee''' or '''deposit-return scheme''', is a surcharge on a product when purchased and a rebate when it is returned. A well-known example is when [[container deposit legislation]] mandates that a refund is given when [[reusable packaging]] is returned. Deposit-refund system are a [[Market-based environmental policy instruments|market-based instrument]] to address [[Externality|externalities]]. As with [[Pigovian tax]]es a DRS aims to limit pollution of various types by creating an incentive to return a product.&lt;ref name = Walls&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-11-47.pdf|title=Deposit-Refund Systems in Practice and Theory |last=Walls |first=Margaret |date=November 2011 |work=RFF DP 11-47 |publisher=Resources for the Future |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While most commonly used with beverage containers it can be used on other materials including liquid and gaseous wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fullerton |first=Don |first2=Ann |last2=Wolverton |title=Two Generalizations of a Deposit-Refund System |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |year=2000 |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=238–242 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.2.238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposit-refund systems are used on products such as batteries, tyres, [[Automotive oil recycling|automotive oil]], [[consumer electronics]] and shipping [[pallet]]s.

There are three potential advantages of a DRS: it reduces illegal dumping by giving a financial incentive, it makes monitoring and enforcement easier, and evading the costs is difficult.&lt;ref name = Walls/&gt;

Deposit-refund systems can be both voluntary or mandated by legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9247">'''Dielectric absorption''' is the name given to the effect by which a [[capacitor]], that has been charged for a long time, discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero [[volt]]s after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage", or "battery action". For some [[dielectric]]s, such as many [[polymer]] films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage, but it can be as much as 15% for [[electrolytic capacitor]]s. The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf | title=Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors, by Ken Kundert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[Image:Diel.png|thumb| The random orientations of molecular dipoles in a dielectric are aligned under the influence of an electric field by applying a voltage to the electrodes.]]
[[Image:Dielektrische Absorption.png|thumb|right| Circuit model for explaining a time-delayed voltage build-up by parallel RC-timers]] 

Charging a capacitor (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an [[electric field]] to be applied to the [[dielectric]] between the electrodes. This field exerts a [[torque]] on the molecular [[dipole]]s, causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called [[Dielectric#Dipolar polarization|oriented polarization]] and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in [[dielectric losses]] (see [[dissipation factor]]). The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a [[time constant]] that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a [[hysteresis]] response of the polarization to the external field.

When the capacitor is discharging, the strength of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles is returning to an undirected state in a process of [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]]. Due to the hysteresis, at the zero point of the electric field, a material-dependent number of molecular dipoles are still polarized along the field direction without a measurable voltage appearing at the terminals of the capacitor. This is like an electrical [[remanence]]. The oriented dipoles will be discharged spontaneously over time and the voltage at the electrodes of the capacitor will [[exponential decay|decay exponentially]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://sound.whsites.net/articles/capacitors.htm#2.1 | title=Elliot sound products, 2.1 - Dielectric Absorption}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete discharge time of all dipoles can be days to weeks depending on the material. This "reloaded" voltage can be retained for months, even in [[electrolytic capacitor]]s, caused by the high insulation resistance in common modern capacitor dielectrics. The discharge of a capacitor and the subsequent reloading can be repeated several times.

==Measurement==
Dielectric absorption is a property which has been long known. Its value can be measured in accordance with the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard. The capacitor shall be charged at the DC voltage rating for 60 minutes. Then the capacitor shall be disconnected from the power source and shall be discharged for 10&amp;nbsp;s. The voltage regained on the capacitor terminals (recovery voltage) within 15 minutes is the dielectric absorption voltage. The size of the dielectric absorption voltage is specified in relation to the applied voltage in percent and depends on the dielectric material used. It is specified by many manufacturers in the data sheets.&lt;ref&gt;WIMA, Characteristics of Metallized [[film capacitor]]s in Comparison with Other Dielectrics {{cite web |url=http://www.wima.de/EN/characteristics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105021659/http://www.wima.de/EN/characteristics.htm |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/FilmCapacitors/PDF/PDF__GeneralTechnicalInformation,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_GeneralTechnicalInformation.pdf# |title=Film Capacitors, TDK Epcos, General technical information |access-date=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201110951/http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/FilmCapacitors/PDF/PDF__GeneralTechnicalInformation,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_GeneralTechnicalInformation.pdf# |archive-date=2012-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/General/dielectr.pdf AVX, Dielectric Comparison Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.holystonecaps.com/PDF/TechNotes/200712181125470.Capdielectriccomp3.pdf# |title=Holystone,  Capacitor Dielectric Comparison, Technical Note 3 |access-date=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201110951/http://www.holystonecaps.com/PDF/TechNotes/200712181125470.Capdielectriccomp3.pdf# |archive-date=2012-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations and safety==
The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as [[sample and hold]] circuits, [[Operational amplifier applications#Integration and differentiation|integrators]], [[charge amplifier]]s or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, polyester film capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used.&lt;ref&gt;National Semiconductors, Understand Capacitor Soakage to Optimize Analog Systems [http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123210736/http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html# |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keith-snook.info/capacitor-soakage.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50&amp;nbsp;V for 400&amp;nbsp;V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to [[semiconductor device]]s, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.

Another effect of dielectric absorption is sometimes described as "soakage". This manifests as a component of leakage current and it contributes to the loss factor of the capacitor. This effect has been known of only recently:{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}} it is now a proportionately greater part of leakage current due to the significantly improved properties of modern capacitors.&lt;ref name=AVX-DA /&gt;

For double-layer capacitors, there are no figures from manufacturers available.

Instead, the dwarf designation refers to the size in which it will begin to produce the coveted or harvestable coconut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DWARF COCONUT PALM TREES|url=http://www.palmco.com/dwarf-coconut-palm-trees-for-sale.html|website=Palmco|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malayan Dwarf===
The ''Malayan Dwarf'' is a variety of dwarf coconut. The palm is classified based on the nut color: ivory yellow nuts, apricot red nuts, and green nuts.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The palm's resistance to the [[Lethal Yellowing]] disease is the characteristic that makes it to be one of the important dwarf  types in the world.&lt;ref name=pk&gt;P.K. Thampan. 1981. Handbook on Coconut Palm. Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of the Malayan Dwarf's resistance to lethal yellowing was in 1956 at [[Round Hill, Jamaica]], where the Malayan Dwarfs affected by the disease was only a very small percentage.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

==Hybrid varieties==
The [[Maypan coconut palm]] is a ''Dwarf''x''Tall'' hybrid between the Malayan Dwarf and ''[[Panama Tall]]''.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The ''Dwarf''x''Tall'' hybrid between the Malayan Dwarf (yellow) and ''West African Tall'' is locally known as ''Mawa'', in Ivory Coast, Mawa is known as ''[[Port-Bouet-121]]''.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7774">{{distinguish|Fermi level}}
The '''Fermi energy''' is a concept in [[quantum mechanics]] usually referring to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states in a quantum system of non-interacting [[fermion]]s at [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]].
In a [[Fermi gas]], the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero kinetic energy, whereas in a metal, the lowest occupied state is typically taken to mean the bottom of the [[conduction band]].

Confusingly, the term "Fermi energy" is often being used for referring to a different yet closely related concept, the [[Fermi level|Fermi ''level'']] (also called [[electrochemical potential]]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The use of the term "Fermi energy" as synonymous with [[Fermi level]] (a.k.a. [[electrochemical potential]]) is widespread in semiconductor physics. For example:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0rf9_2ckeYC&amp;pg=PA49 ''Electronics (fundamentals And Applications)''] by D. Chattopadhyay, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmg13dHPKg8C&amp;pg=PA113 ''Semiconductor Physics and Applications''] by Balkanski and Wallis.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy, at least as they are used in this article:
* The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero, while the Fermi level is defined for any temperature.
* The Fermi energy is an energy ''difference'' (usually corresponding to a [[kinetic energy]]), whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level including kinetic energy and potential energy.
* The Fermi energy can only be defined for [[Fermi gas|non-interacting fermions]] (where the potential energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas the Fermi level (the electrochemical potential of an electron) remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium.

Since the Fermi level in a metal at absolute zero is the energy of the highest occupied single particle state,
then the Fermi energy in a metal is the energy difference between the Fermi level and lowest occupied single-particle state, at zero-temperature.

==Context==
{{main|Fermi gas}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], a group of particles known as [[fermion]]s (for example, [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same [[quantum state]]. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle [[stationary state]]s, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the '''Fermi energy''' is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.

As a consequence, even if we have extracted all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near [[absolute zero]] temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This speed is known as the '''Fermi velocity'''. Only when the temperature exceeds the related '''Fermi temperature''', do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.

The Fermi energy is an important concept in the [[solid state physics]] of metals and [[superconductor]]s. It is also a very important quantity in the physics of [[Superfluid|quantum liquid]]s like low temperature [[helium]] (both normal and superfluid &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He), and it is quite important to [[nuclear physics]] and to understanding the stability of [[White dwarf|white dwarf stars]] against [[gravitational collapse]].

==Formula and typical values==
The Fermi energy for fermions [[spin-½]] in a three-dimensional (non-[[Special relativity|relativistic]]) system is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_0} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{2/3} &lt;/math&gt; ,
where ''N'' is the number of particles, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the [[rest mass]] of each fermion, ''V'' the volume of the system and &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; the reduced [[Planck constant]].
===Metals===
Under the [[free electron model]], the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density &lt;math&gt;N/V&lt;/math&gt; of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; electrons/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter. This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order of  2 to 10 [[electronvolts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/fermi.html|title=Fermi Energies, Fermi Temperatures, and Fermi Velocities|last=Nave|first=Rod|date=|website=[[HyperPhysics]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White dwarfs===
Stars known as [[white dwarfs]] have mass comparable to our [[Sun]], but have about a hundredth of its radius.  The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV.

===Nucleus===
Another typical example is that of the [[nucleon]]s in the nucleus of an atom. The [[Nuclear size|radius of the nucleus]] admits deviations, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 [[MeV]].

== Related quantities ==
Using this definition of above for the Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful.

The '''Fermi temperature''' is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;T_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{E_{\mathrm{F}}}{k_{\rm B}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.usu.edu/torre/3700_Spring_2015/Lectures/08.pdf|title=PHYS 3700: Introduction to Quantum Statistical Thermodyamics|last=Torre|first=Charles|date=2015-04-21|website=Utah State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.

Other quantities defined in this context are '''Fermi momentum'''

: &lt;math&gt; p_{\mathrm{F}} = \sqrt{2 m E_{\mathrm{F}}} &lt;/math&gt;,

and '''Fermi velocity'''

: &lt;math&gt; v_{\mathrm{F}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{F}}}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

These quantities are the [[momentum]] and [[group velocity]], respectively, of a [[fermion]] at the [[Fermi surface]].

The Fermi momentum can also be described as&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{F}} = \hbar k_{\mathrm{F}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;k_{\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the '''Fermi wavevector'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Solid State Physics|last=Ashcroft|first=Neil W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. David|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1976|isbn=978-0-03-083993-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These quantities are ''not'' well-defined in cases where the [[Fermi surface]] is non-spherical.

The '''Foldy–Wouthuysen transform''' is widely used in [[high energy physics]]. It was historically formulated by [[Leslie Lawrance Foldy]] and [[Siegfried Adolf Wouthuysen]] in 1949 to understand the nonrelativistic limit of the [[Dirac equation]], the equation for [[spin-1/2|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foldy|first1=L.

==A canonical transform==
The FW transformation is a unitary transformation of the [[orthonormal]] basis in which both the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and the state are represented. The [[eigenvalue]]s do not change under such a unitary transformation, that is, the physics does not change under such a unitary basis transformation. Therefore, such a unitary transformation can always be applied: in particular a unitary basis transformation may be picked which will put the Hamiltonian in a more pleasant form, at the expense of a change in the state function, which then represents something else. See for example the [[Bogoliubov transformation]], which is an orthogonal basis transform for the same purpose. The suggestion that the FW transform is applicable to the state ''or'' the Hamiltonian is thus not correct.

Foldy and Wouthuysen made use of a [[canonical transformation|canonical transform]] that has now come to be known as the ''Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation''.  A brief account of the history of the transformation is to be found in the obituaries of Foldy and Wouthuysen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=R. W.|last2=Krauss|first2=L.

==Description==

The Foldy–Wouthuysen (FW) transformation is a unitary transformation on a [[fermion]] [[wave function]] of the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\psi \to \psi '=U\psi &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where the unitary operator is the 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 matrix:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;U=e^{\beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \theta} = \mathbb{I}_4 \cos \theta + \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta =e^{\boldsymbol{\gamma} \cdot \hat{p} \theta} = \mathbb{I}_4 \cos \theta + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Above,

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{p}^i \equiv \frac{p^i}{|p|}&lt;/math&gt;

is the unit vector oriented in the direction of the fermion momentum. The above are related to the [[Dirac matrices]] by {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''α&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''γ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}. A straightforward series expansion applying the [[commutativity]] properties of the Dirac matrices demonstrates that {{EquationNote|2}} above is true. The inverse

:&lt;math&gt;U^{-1}=e^{-\beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \theta} = \cos \theta - \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

so it is clear that {{math|''U''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''U'' {{=}} ''I''}}, where {{math|''I''}} is a 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 [[identity matrix]].

==Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation of the Dirac Hamiltonian for a free fermion==

This transformation is of particular interest when applied to the free-fermion Dirac Hamiltonian operator

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_0 \equiv \alpha \cdot p + \beta m&lt;/math&gt;

in biunitary fashion, in the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\hat{H}_0 \to \hat{H}'_0 &amp;\equiv U \hat{H}_0 U^{-1} \\&amp;= U (\alpha \cdot p + \beta m) U^{-1} \\&amp;= (\cos \theta + \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta ) (\alpha \cdot p + \beta m) (\cos \theta - \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta ) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Using the commutativity properties of the Dirac matrices, this can be massaged over into the double-angle expression:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\hat{H}'_0 &amp;= (\alpha \cdot p + \beta m) (\cos \theta - \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin \theta )^2 \\&amp;= (\alpha \cdot p + \beta m) e^{-2\beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \theta} \\&amp;= (\alpha \cdot p + \beta m) (\cos 2\theta - \beta \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \hat{p} \sin 2\theta ) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

This factors out into:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}'_0= \alpha \cdot p \left(\cos 2\theta - \frac{m}{|p|} \sin 2\theta \right) + \beta (m \cos 2\theta + |p| \sin 2\theta)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

==Choosing a particular representation: Newton–Wigner==

Clearly, the FW transformation is a ''continuous'' transformation, that is, one may employ any value for {{mvar|θ}} which one chooses.  Now comes the distinct question of choosing a particular value for {{mvar|θ}}, which amounts to choosing a particular transformed representation.

One particularly important representation, is that in which the transformed Hamiltonian operator {{math|''Ĥ''′&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is diagonalized.  Clearly, a completely diagonalized representation can be obtained by choosing {{mvar|θ}} such that the {{math|''α'' · ''p''}} term in {{EquationNote|5}} is made to vanish. Such a representation is specified by defining:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tan 2\theta \equiv \frac{|p|}{m}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

so that {{EquationNote|5}} is reduced to the diagonalized (this presupposes that {{mvar|β}} is taken in the Dirac–Pauli representation (after [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]]) in which it is a diagonal matrix):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}'_0= \beta (m \cos 2\theta + |p| \sin 2\theta)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

By elementary trigonometry, {{EquationNote|6}} also implies that:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = \frac{|p|}\sqrt{m^2+|p|^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 2\theta = \frac{m}\sqrt{m^2+|p|^2} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

so that using {{EquationNote|8}} in {{EquationNote|7}} now leads following reduction to:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}'_0= \beta \sqrt{m^2+|p|^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}


Prior to Foldy and Wouthuysen publishing their transformation, it was already known that {{EquationNote|9}} is the Hamiltonian in the Newton–Wigner (NW) representation (named after [[Theodore Duddell Newton]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]) of the [[Dirac equation]]. What {{EquationNote|9}} therefore tells us, is that by applying a FW transformation to the Dirac–Pauli representation of Dirac's equation, and then selecting the continuous transformation parameter {{mvar|θ}} so as to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, one arrives at the NW representation of Dirac's equation, because NW itself already contains the Hamiltonian specified in ({{EquationNote|9}}).  See this [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.3209&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf link].

If one considers an on-shell mass—fermion or otherwise—given by {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''p&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and employs a [[Minkowski metric]] tensor for which {{math|diag(''η'') {{=}} (+1, −1, −1, −1)}}, it should be apparent that the expression
:&lt;math&gt; p^0 = \sqrt{m^2 + |p|^2} &lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to the {{math|''E'' ≡ ''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} component of the energy-momentum vector {{mvar|p&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so that {{EquationNote|9}} is alternatively specified rather simply by {{math|''Ĥ''′&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''βE''}}.

==Correspondence between the Dirac–Pauli and Newton–Wigner representations, for a fermion at rest==

Now let us consider a fermion at rest, which we may define in this context as a fermion for which {{math|{{abs|''p''}} {{=}} 0}}.  From {{EquationNote|6}} or {{EquationNote|8}}, this means that {{math|cos 2''θ'' {{=}} 1}}, so that {{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0, ±π, ±2π}} and, from {{EquationNote|2}}, that the unitary operator {{math|''U'' {{=}} ±''I''}}. Therefore, any operator {{mvar|O}} in the Dirac-Pauli representation upon which we perform a biunitary transformation, will be given, for an at-rest fermion, by:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;O \to O' \equiv U O U^{-1} = (\pm I) (O) (\pm I) = O&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

Contrasting the original Dirac–Pauli Hamiltonian operator

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_0 \equiv \alpha \cdot p + \beta m&lt;/math&gt;

with the NW Hamiltonian {{EquationNote|9}}, we do indeed find the {{math|{{abs|''p''}} {{=}} 0}} "at rest" correspondence:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_0 = \hat{H}'_0= \beta m&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

==The velocity operator in the Dirac–Pauli representation==

Now, let us consider the velocity operator.  To obtain this operator, we must commute the Hamiltonian operator {{math|''Ĥ''′&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with the canonical position operators {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, i.e., we must calculate

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v_i}\equiv i\left[\hat{H}_0,x_i\right]&lt;/math&gt;

One good way to approach this calculation, is to start by writing the scalar [[rest mass]] {{mvar|m}} as

:&lt;math&gt;m=\gamma^0\hat{H}_0+\gamma^jp_j&lt;/math&gt;

and then to mandate that the scalar rest mass commute with the {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Thus, we may write:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;0=[m,x_i]=\left[\left(\gamma^0\hat{H}_0+\gamma^jp_j\right),x_i\right]=\left[\gamma^0\hat{H}_0,x_i\right]+i\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

where we have made use of the Heisenberg canonical commutation relationship {{math|[''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} −''iη&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to reduce terms. Then, multiplying from the left by {{math|''γ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} and rearranging terms, we arrive at:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\hat{x}_i}{dt}=\hat{v_i}\equiv i\left[\hat{H}_0,x_i\right]=\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

Because the canonical relationship

:&lt;math&gt;i\left[\hat{H}_0,\hat{v}_i\right] \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

the above provides the basis for computing an inherent, non-zero acceleration operator, which specifies the oscillatory motion known as [[zitterbewegung]].

==The velocity operator in the Newton–Wigner representation==

In the Newton–Wigner representation, we now wish to calculate

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i'\equiv i\left[\hat{H}'_0,x_i\right]&lt;/math&gt;

If we use the result at the very end of section 2 above, {{math|''Ĥ''′&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''βp''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then this can be written instead as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i'\equiv i\left[\hat{H}'_0,x_i\right]=i \beta \left[p_0,x_i\right] &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

Using the above, we need simply to calculate {{math|[''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'']}}, then multiply by {{mvar|iβ}}.

The canonical calculation proceeds similarly to the calculation in section 4 above, but because of the square root expression in {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sqrt|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{abs|''p''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, one additional step is required.

First, to accommodate the square root, we will wish to require that the scalar square mass {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} commute with the canonical coordinates {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which we write as:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;0 \equiv \left[m^2,x_i\right] = \left[\left(p^0p_0+p^jp_j\right),x_i\right] = \left[p^0p_0,x_i\right]+2ip_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

where we again use the Heisenberg canonical relationship {{math|[''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} −''iη&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  Then, we need an expression for {{math|[''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} which will satisfy {{EquationNote|15}}.  It is straightforward to verify that:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;i\left[p_0,x_i\right]=\frac{p_i}{p^0}=v_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

will satisfy {{EquationNote|15}} when again employing {{math|[''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'',''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} −''iη&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Now, we simply return the {{mvar|iβ}} factor via {{EquationNote|14}}, to arrive at:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\hat{x}_i'}{dt}=\hat{v}_i'\equiv i\left[\hat{H}'_0,x_i\right] = \beta \frac{p_i}{p^0} = \beta v_i &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

This is understood to be the velocity operator in the Newton–Wigner representation. Because:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;i\left[\hat{H}'_0,\hat{v}_i'\right]=i\left[\beta p_0,\beta v_i\right]=0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

it is commonly thought that the [[zitterbewegung]] motion arising out of {{EquationNote|12}} vanishes when a fermion is transformed into the Newton–Wigner representation.

==The velocity operators for a fermion at rest==

Now, let us compare equations {{EquationNote|13}} and {{EquationNote|17}} for a fermion at rest, defined earlier in section 3 as a fermion for which {{math|{{abs|''p''}} {{=}} 0}}.  Here, ({{EquationNote|13}}) remains:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i\equiv i\left[\hat{H}_0,x_i\right]=\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|19}}}}

while {{EquationNote|17}} becomes:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i'\equiv i\left[\hat{H}'_0,x_i\right] = \beta \frac{p_i}{p^0} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|20}}}}

In equation {{EquationNote|10}} we found that for a fermion at rest, {{math|''O''′ {{=}} ''O''}} for any operator.  One would expect this to include:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}_i'=\hat{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|21}}}}

however, equations {{EquationNote|19}} and {{EquationNote|20}} for a {{math|{{abs|''p''}} {{=}} 0}} fermion appear to contradict {{EquationNote|21}}.

In the traditional scheme the purpose of expanding the optical Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{H} = - \left( n^2 (r) - \hat{p}_\perp^2 \right)^\frac12&lt;/math&gt;

in a series using

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hat{p}_\perp^2}{n_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;

as the expansion parameter is to understand the propagation of the quasi-paraxial beam in terms of a series of approximations (paraxial plus nonparaxial). Similar is the situation in the case of charged-particle optics.  Let us recall that in relativistic quantum mechanics too one has a similar problem of understanding the relativistic wave equations as the nonrelativistic approximation plus the relativistic correction terms in the quasi-relativistic regime. For the Dirac equation (which is first-order in time) this is done most conveniently using the Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation leading to an iterative diagonalization technique. The main framework of the newly developed formalisms of optics (both light optics and charged-particle optics) is based on the transformation technique of Foldy–Wouthuysen theory which casts the Dirac equation in a form displaying the different interaction terms between the Dirac particle and an applied electromagnetic field in a nonrelativistic and easily interpretable form.

In the Foldy–Wouthuysen theory the Dirac equation is decoupled through a canonical transformation into two two-component equations: one reduces to the [[Pauli equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osche|first=G.

There is a close algebraic analogy between the [[Helmholtz equation]] (governing scalar optics) and the [[Klein–Gordon equation]]; and between the [[Matrix representation of Maxwell's equations|matrix form of the Maxwell's equations]] (governing vector optics) and the [[Dirac equation]]. So it is natural to use the powerful machinery of standard quantum mechanics (particularly, the Foldy–Wouthuysen transform) in analyzing these systems.

The suggestion to employ the Foldy–Wouthuysen Transformation technique in the case of the Helmholtz equation was mentioned in the literature as a remark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fishman|first1=L.|last2=McCoy|first2=J.

It was only in the recent works, that this idea was exploited to analyze the quasiparaxial approximations for specific beam optical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sameen Ahmed|last1=Khan|first2=Ramaswamy|last2=Jagannathan|author3-link=Rajiah Simon|first3=Rajiah|last3=Simon|date=2002|title=Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation and a quasiparaxial approximation scheme for the scalar wave theory of light beams|pages=physics/0209082|arxiv=physics/0209082|bibcode=2002physics...9082K}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foldy–Wouthuysen technique is ideally suited for the [[Lie algebra]]ic approach to optics. With all these plus points, the powerful and ambiguity-free expansion, the Foldy–Wouthuysen Transformation is still little used in optics. The technique of the Foldy–Wouthuysen Transformation results in what is known as nontraditional prescriptions of Helmholtz optics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sameen Ahmed|last1=Khan|year=2005|title=Wavelength-dependent modifications in Helmholtz Optics|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95–125|doi=10.1007/s10773-005-1488-0|arxiv=physics/0210001|bibcode=2005IJTP...44...95K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maxwell optics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sameen Ahmed|last1=Khan|date=2006|contribution=Wavelength-Dependent Effects in Light Optics|title=New Topics in Quantum Physics Research|editor1-first=Volodymyr|editor1-last=Krasnoholovets|editor2-first=Frank|editor2-last=Columbus|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|pages=163–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. The nontraditional approaches give rise to very interesting wavelength-dependent modifications of the paraxial and aberration behaviour. The nontraditional formalism of Maxwell optics provides a unified framework of light beam optics and polarization. The nontraditional prescriptions of light optics are closely analogous with the quantum theory of
charged-particle beam optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Jagannathan|first2=R.|last2=Simon|author3-link=George Sudarshan|first3=E. C.

The '''Hatgyi Dam''' ({{lang-my|ဟတ်ကြီးဆည်}}) is a planned [[hydropower]] [[gravity dam]] to be constructed on the [[Salween River]] in southeastern [[Myanmar]]. The dam site is in Myanmar’s [[Karen State]]. The dam project is being funded by the [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT), [[China]]'s [[Sinohydro Corporation]], and Myanmar's Ministry of Electric Power and International Group of Entrepreneurs (IGE). The dam is expected to produce 1,100 to 1,500 megawatts of power, the majority of which will be sent to [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="karen rebels"&gt;{{cite news|title=Democratic Voice of Burma: Karen rebels ordered to leave area near Thai-backed dam|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2013/05/03/democratic-voice-of-burma-karen-rebels-ordered-to-leave-area-near-thai-backed-dam/|accessdate=2013-05-03|newspaper=Burmanet News|date=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam site is also within the Kahilu Wildlife Sanctuary.&lt;ref name="salween watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Dam and Water Diversion Plans|url=http://www.salweenwatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=60#1|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas surrounding the Hatgyi Dam site are ethnically diverse and ecologically rich. At least 13 different indigenous groups live along the Salween river,&lt;ref name="karen rebels" /&gt; and over ten million people are supported by the Salween River basin. The Salween's waters are nutrient-rich and support local vegetation and farmlands.&lt;ref name="dammed by peace"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cambell|first=Charlie|title=Salween River Dammed by Peace|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/human-rights/salween-river-dammed-by-peace.html|accessdate=2014-05-03|newspaper=The Irrawady|date=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The dam is being funded by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), a Thai government owned company which has built dams since 1964,&lt;ref name="karen farmers" /&gt; China's Sinohydro Corporation, and Myanmar's Ministry of Electric Power and International Group of Entrepreneurs (IGE), with Sinohydro holding the majority of shares, EGAT being the second largest shareholder, and Myanmar holding the fewest shares. IGE is owned by Nay Aung, son of [[Aung Thaung]], the central advisor for Myanmar's [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]].&lt;ref name="ethnic armed groups"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maw|first=Khin Sett|title=Ethnic armed groups oppose Hatgyi dam project|url=http://elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5319:ethnic-armed-groups-oppose-hatgyi-dam-project&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384|accessdate=2014-05-03|newspaper=Eleven Myanmar|date=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the generated energy will be sent to Thailand,&lt;ref name="karen rebels" /&gt; which is looking to secure cheap energy supplies to replace its high reliance on natural gas. Currently, 70 percent of Thailand's energy comes from natural gas, the supply of which is expected to last only thirty years.

== History ==
=== 1998-2007 ===
The project began in 1998 with a feasibility study titled, "Preliminary Feasibility Study of Hutgyi Hydropower Project in the Union of Myanmar". The study recommended the construction of a "a low height, run-of-river dam having a capacity of 300 MW". In November 2005, however, Thailand's energy minister cited a newer feasibility which stated that the dam could handle a capacity of up to 1,200 megawatts of power.&lt;ref name="salween watch" /&gt;

In 2004, survey work began on the project. However, when two EGAT employees were killed in May of that year, one from a grenade and the other from a landmine, the project was halted. In December 2005, in preparation for a series of dam investments along the Salween River, a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MOU) was signed between Myanmar's Hydro Electric Power Department and Thailand's EGAT. In June of the following year, another memorandum of understanding was signed, which this time included Sinohydro, in addition to Myanmar and EGAT. Shortly thereafter, work commenced on road repairs near the dam site. In these MOUs, Myanmar and Thailand agreed to keep all data and joint studies on the dam "strictly confidential".&lt;ref name="salween watch" /&gt;

Work on the project once again stalled when an EGAT staff member was killed in 2007. Work resumed on the project in 2008.&lt;ref name="karen farmers" /&gt; Looking at the concurrent developments in the region's ethnic conflicts, the Karen National Liberation Army Peace Council (KNLAPC), which was founded by the commander of the [[Karen National Liberation Army]]’s 7th Brigade, signed a peace agreement with Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in February 2007.

=== 2008-2010 ===
In 2008, another MOU was signed, this time between Myanmar and Sinohydro, which established Sinohydro as the majority shareholder in the dam project. June 2009 saw another uptick in violence, as the DKBA and the army began an offensive against the KNU. Because of this offensive, around 4,000 Karen villagers were forced to flee their homes.&lt;ref name="karen farmers" /&gt; This was the largest refugee influx from Karen to Thailand in over a decade.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt;

Across the border during the same year, Thailand's Office of the Prime Minister formed a subcommittee to look into and monitor the potential human rights impacts of the Hatgyi project.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt; In 2010, the subcommittee recommended more extensive studies on the local impacts of the dam project, focusing especially on the impact of the project on Thailand. The recommendation claimed the existing environmental impact assessment (EIA) did not focus enough on the implications of the project for Thailand.&lt;ref name="dammed by peace" /&gt; Nothing ever came of these recommendations, however.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt;

Since the 1990s, when it broke off from the Christian-dominated Karen National Union, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army had been cooperating with the Myanmar Army. However, in 2010, Saw La Pwe formed an anti-government breakaway faction of the DKBA.&lt;ref name="karen rebels" /&gt;

=== 2011-present ===
Public hearings regarding the construction of the dam were held in the [[Sop Moei District]] of northern Thailand in 2011. Attendance was high.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt; In December of that year, the Karen National Union reluctantly agreed to allow further surveys to be conducted for the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investors Haste to Build Big Dams is Undermining Fragile Peace Process in Karen State| url=http://www.burmapartnership.org/2012/03/investors-haste-to-build-big-dams-is-undermining-fragile-peace-process-in-karen-state/|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January of the following year, a temporary ceasefire was signed between the national army and the KNU. Only two months later, however, there was a noticeable build-up of army troops in the area around the dam site.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt;

Around this time, Jin Honggen, economic and commercial counselor at China's Myanmar embassy, related the concern of many Chinese investors at the lack of progress in a variety of investment projects, including the Hatgyi Dam. He stated that, "some Chinese companies in Myanmar, especially those investing in resource fields, are worrying their interests can't be secured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jincui|first=Yu|title=Wooing old customers anew|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/746784.shtml|accessdate=2014-05-03|newspaper=Global Times|date=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-February 2013, Myanmar's deputy minister of electric power told parliament that the Hatgyi Dam was one of six dams whose construction had been approved.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt; Less than two months later, in April, local villagers first reported visible evidence of the project getting underway, claiming that EGAT was setting up water measurement posts at the Hatgyi Dam site.&lt;ref name="knu protests"&gt;{{cite news|last=Su Nyar|first=Saw Khar|title=KNU protests as EGAT marks Salween River Hat Gyi dam site|url=http://karennews.org/2013/05/knu-protests-as-egat-marks-salween-river-hat-gyi-dam-site.html/|accessdate=2014-05-03|newspaper=Karen News|date=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Myanmar's military presence in the area was as high as ever, as witnesses reported the presence of eight army battalions near the dam site.&lt;ref name="tension"&gt;{{cite web|title=China-backed dams escalating ethnic tension in Myanmar|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5823-Chinese-dams-escalating-ethnic-tension-in-Myanmar|accessdate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the DKBA was forced to evacuate the dam area in May.&lt;ref name="karen rebels" /&gt; As of September 2014, troop deployments to the dam site continued in order to increase security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Troops deployed near Thanlwin dam site|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7657:troops-deployed-near-thanlwin-dam-site&amp;catid=44:national&amp;Itemid=384|publisher=Eleven Myanmar|accessdate=16 November 2014|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
=== Impact on local populations ===
Concerns about the impact of the dam on local populations have largely revolved around the displacement of numerous villages due to flooding, and the lack of involvement of local communities in the decision-making process.

In 2013, the Karen National Union explained to local villagers that nine Karen villages would be flooded and damaged as a result of the Hatgyi Dam.&lt;ref name="knu protests" /&gt; Karen Rivers Watch (KRW) pegs the number of displaced villages at 21.&lt;ref name="above water" /&gt; EJ Atlas estimates the potential affected population to range from 1,000 to 30,000 local residents, with listed impacts including displacement, loss of livelihood, and loss of culture.&lt;ref name="ej atlas" /&gt; Saw Kyaw Phoe of Mae Par Village explained: "If the dam is built, our village, the whole area, including our paddy farms and our gardens will be flooded. I, myself, will have no place to live."&lt;ref name="karen farmers" /&gt;

An open letter written by Karen Rivers Watch in 2011 stated that the dam would only exacerbate problems associated with the displacement of war-torn communities, with very little benefit actually being received by the local community, as the majority of the power generated by the dam would be exported.&lt;ref name="open letter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burma Partnership; An Open Letter in Support of the President of Myanmar's Decision on the Suspension of the Myitsone Dam Project and a Call for a Review of the Hatgyi Dam Project in Kayin (Karen) State|url=http://www.burmapartnership.org/2011/10/an-open-letter-a-call-for-a-review-of-the-hatgyi-dam-project-in-kayin-karen-state/|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Sein Twa, director of the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network (KESAN) pointed out that, "Local people do not want any dams on the Salween River, especially in Karen State, without the free, prior and informed consent of impacted communities." &lt;ref name="tension" /&gt; Along those lines, the aforementioned KRW open letter expressed that there had been "little consultation with affected communities" and that the majority of the local populations opposed the dam.&lt;ref name="open letter" /&gt;

The higher military presence in the area associated with the construction and maintenance of the Hatgyi Dam has also been a source of concern and criticism. Naw Paw Gay, of the KRW, explained that, "the presence of the Burmese troops will lead to more human rights abuses." Saw Kyaw Phoe, meanwhile, while commenting on the negative implications of increased troops in the area to protect the dam, related that the Myanmar army would, "force villagers to carry their food ration and ammunition and to lead Burmese troops through land mined areas."&lt;ref name="karen farmers" /&gt;

=== Disruption of peace negotiations ===
[[International Rivers]] claims that the dam project has been obstructing peace negotiations between the Karen National Union and the Myanmar Army.&lt;ref name="briefing" /&gt;  Likewise, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army's tactical operations commander Colonel Saw Maung Kyar explained that, "problems will get worse if [the government] starts increasing the military forces by using the dam as an excuse." Meanwhile, the joint secretary of the Karen National Union, P'Doh Saw That Thi Bwe, argued that, "the Hatgyi hydropower project is located in our land. Our stand is not to allow such kind of big project until we have a guarantee for discussing politics."&lt;ref name="ethnic armed groups" /&gt;

=== Environmental impact ===
Environmental researcher Steve Thompson of the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network (KESAN) commented on the Hatgyi Dam by explaining that the dam could, "wipe out many or most riverine fish species, with serious socio-economic consequences for local villagers".&lt;ref name="above water" /&gt; An open letter by the Karen Rivers Watch in 2011 described the Hatgyi Dam site as being in an "ecologically sensitive area", close to an [[active fault]] line.&lt;ref name="open letter" /&gt; EJ Atlas listed environmental impacts as including flooding, biodiversity loss, soil, pollution, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="ej atlas" /&gt;

[[File:Paraffin-Young's-tombstone09b.jpg|thumb|Portrait bust of James Young, on his gravestone in [[Inverkip]] cemetery.]]

'''James Young''' (13 July 1811 – 13 May 1883) was a Scottish [[chemistry|chemist]] best known for his method of distilling [[kerosene|paraffin]] from coal and [[oil shale]]s. He is often referred to as '''Paraffin Young'''.

==Early life==
James Young was born in the Drygate area of [[Glasgow]], the son of John Young, a [[cabinetmaker]] and [[joiner]]. He became his father's apprentice at an early age and educated himself at [[wikt:night school|night school]], attending evening classes at the nearby Anderson's College (now [[Strathclyde University]]) from the age of 19.  At Anderson's College he met [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], who had just been appointed as a lecturer on chemistry. In 1831 Young was appointed as Graham's assistant and occasionally took some of his lectures. While at Anderson's College he also met and befriended the explorer [[David Livingstone]]; this friendship continued until Livingstone's death in Africa many years later. 

On 21 August 1838 he married Mary Young of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] middle parish; in 1839 they moved to [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="NRS"&gt;{{cite web | title=James Young (1811-1883) | website=National Records of Scotland | date=31 May 2013 | url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/learning/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-a-z/young-james | access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In Young's first scientific paper, dated 4 January 1837, he described a modification of a [[Galvanic cell|voltaic battery]] invented by [[Michael Faraday]]. Later that same year he moved with Graham to [[University College London|University College, London]] where he helped him with experimental work.

===Chemicals===
In 1839 Young was appointed manager at [[James Muspratt]]'s chemical works [[Newton-le-Willows]], near [[St Helens, Merseyside]], and in 1844 to Tennants, Clow &amp; Co. at [[Manchester]], for whom he devised a method of making [[Stannate|sodium stannate]] directly from [[cassiterite]].

===Potato blight===
In 1845 he served on a committee of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]] for the investigation of [[Phytophthora infestans|potato blight]], and suggested immersing the potatoes in dilute [[sulphuric acid]] as a means of combatting the disease; he was not elected a member of the Society until 19 October 1847. Finding the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' newspaper insufficiently liberal, he also began a movement for the establishment of the ''[[Manchester Examiner]]'' newspaper which was first published in 1846.

==Oils==

In 1847 Young had his attention called to a natural petroleum seepage in the [[Riddings]] [[colliery]] at [[Alfreton]], Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery.

In 1848 Young left Tennants', and in partnership with his friend and assistant Edward Meldrum, set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the [[sandstone]] roof of the coal mine, theorised that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.

Following up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded in producing, by distilling [[cannel coal]] at a low heat, a fluid resembling petroleum, which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | authorlink = | author2 = | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
The production of these oils and solid [[paraffin wax]] from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young &amp; Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney &amp; Co. at [[Bathgate]] in West Lothian and [[Edward Meldrum|E. Meldrum &amp; Co.]] at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], [[lamosite]], and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

In 1852 Young left Manchester to live in Scotland and that same year took out a US patent for the production of paraffin oil by distillation of coal. Both the US and UK patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

==Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company==
[[File:Addiewell Works West Lothian.jpg|thumb|[[Addiewell]] Works in  [[West Lothian]]|350px]]

In 1865 Young bought out his business partners and built second and larger works at [[Addiewell]], near [[West Calder]]. It was a substantial industrial complex, in its time one of the largest chemical works in Scotland. In 1866 Young sold the concern to Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Company. Although Young remained in the company, he took no active part in it, instead withdrawing from business to occupy himself with yachting, travelling, scientific pursuits, and looking after the estates which he had purchased.

The company continued to grow and expanded its operations, selling paraffin oil and [[paraffin lamp]]s all over the world and earning for its founder the nickname "[[Kerosene|Paraffin]]" Young. Addiewell remained the centre of operations for Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Co. Ltd., but as local supplies of shale became exhausted, activities were increasingly focussed on other shale-fields. The refinery closed around 1921. Other companies worked under license from Young's firm, and paraffin manufacture spread over the south of Scotland.

When the reserves of torbanite eventually gave out the company moved on to pioneer the exploitation of [[West Lothian]]'s oil shale (lamosite) deposits, not so rich in oil as cannel coal and torbanite.  By the 1900s nearly 2 million tons of shale were being extracted annually, employing 4,000 men.

==Other work==
*During the height of enthusiasm for the [[Volunteer movement]], Young formed the 4th Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Bathgate on 9 August 1862, mainly from employees of his chemical works, with Young himself as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in command until 1865. It later became D Company of the [[1st Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteers|8th Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian F.W.

*Young made significant discoveries in [[rustproofing]] ships in 1872, which were later adopted by the [[Royal Navy]]. Noticing that [[bilge]] water was acidic, he suggested that [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] could be used to prevent it corroding iron ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Young | first = James | authorlink = | author2 = | title = On the Preservation of Iron Ships | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 702 | publisher = [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] | location = | date =  November 1869 – January 1872 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
* In 1847 Young was elected to the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]].
* In 1861 he was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].
* From 1868–1877 he was President of Anderson's College and founded the Young Chair of Technical Chemistry at the College.
* In 1873 Young was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]
* In 1879 he was awarded an Honorary LI.D of [[St. Andrews University]].
* From 1879–1881 he was Vice-President of the [[Chemical Society]].

==Retirement and death==
[[File:Paraffin-Young's-tombstone09a.jpg|thumb|right|The memorial to James Young and his wife Mary is sited in the old [[Inverkip]] churchyard, at the north end of the mausoleum of the [[Shaw-Stewart Baronets]].]]

==Legacy==
*Statues of his old professor, [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], and of his fellow student and lifelong friend, [[David Livingstone]], which stand respectively in George Square, [[Glasgow]], and at [[Glasgow Cathedral]], were erected by him.
*From 1855 James 'Paraffin' Young lived at Limefield House, [[Polbeth]].  A [[sycamore maple|sycamore]] tree which Livingstone planted in 1864 is still flourishing in the grounds of Limefield House.  There too one can see a miniature version of the "Victoria Falls", which the missionary discovered in the mid-19th century.  It was built, as a tribute to Livingstone, by Young on the little stream which runs through the estate.
* Young had a lifelong friendship with David Livingstone, whom he had met at Anderson's College. He gave generously towards the expenses of Livingstone's African expeditions, and contributed to a search expedition, which proved too late to find Livingstone alive. He also had Livingstone's servants brought to England, and presented to Glasgow a statue to his memory, which was erected in [[George Square]], Glasgow.
*The James Young High School in Livingston, the street James Young Road in Bathgate and the James Young Halls at the [[University of Strathclyde]] are all named after him.
*In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the [[Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineeringhalloffame.org/index.html |title=Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame |work=engineeringhalloffame.org |year=2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Laleli Dam''' is an [[embankment dam]], currently under construction near the town of Laleli on the [[Çoruh River]] in [[Erzurum Province]], Turkey. The primary purpose of the dam is [[hydroelectric]] power production. After a prolonged legal battle, construction on the dam began in 2013 and it is expected to be complete in 2017. The dam, which will power a 99 MW power station, will also flood several villages to include Laleli. The dam's reservoir will stretch east into [[Bayburt Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BİZLERE SAHİP ÇIKILMAZ İSE BAYBURT KAYBEDER|url=http://www.bayburtmedya.com/index.php/bmgundem/item/1060-bizlere-sahip-%C3%A7ikilmaz-ise-bayburt-kaybeder|publisher=Bayburt Medya|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melex''' is an [[electric vehicle]] produced by a company of the same name in [[Mielec]], [[Poland]]. It has been in production since 1971.

[[Image:Melex.jpg|thumb|250px|Melex type 212]]

The car, having full necessary equipment such as [[headlamp]]s and [[seatbelt]]s, is very quiet and does not pollute the environment, so it is usually used in places where standard [[automobile|cars]] are not allowed. It is also smaller than them, but slower (the maximum speed is about 30&amp;nbsp;km/h, depending on the version). Some versions require having a [[driver's license]].

At first, the car was in use as a transport vehicle for [[golf]] players, but now it has many versions that include:
* passenger versions (max 8)
* truck versions (up to 1250&amp;nbsp;kg of cargo),
* special. (including ambulances and hearses)

Its typical use is to travel in quiet places, such as [[parks]], or [[cemetery|cemeteries]], or in [[factory|factories]] to transport people or things over short distances, where speed is not necessary

The standard Melex has no doors and can carry two people (a driver and a passenger). It can contain more seats for more passengers and/or baggage.

It is equipped with a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[rectifier]] which allow easy recharging.

'''Metallurgical failure analysis''' is the process by which a metallurgist determines the mechanism that has caused a metal component to fail. Typical failure modes involve various types of corrosion and mechanical damage. It has been estimated that the direct annual [cost of corrosion] alone in the United States was $276 billion, approximately 3.1% of GDP, in 1998. Corrosion costs have continued to skyrocket and total corrosion costs now are greater than $1 trillion annually in the United States as of 2012.

Metal components fail as a result of the environmental conditions to which they are exposed to as well as the mechanical stresses that they experience. Often a combination of both environmental conditions and stress will cause failure.

Metal components are designed to withstand the environment and stresses that they will be subjected to. The design of a metal component involves not only a specific elemental composition but also specific manufacturing process such as heat treatments, machining processes, etc.…  The huge arrays of different metals that result all have unique physical properties.
 Specific properties are designed into metal components to make them more robust to various environmental conditions. These differences in physical properties will exhibit unique failure modes.  A metallurgical failure analysistakes into account as much of this information as possible during analysis. The end goal of failure analysis is to provide a determination of the root cause and a solution to any underlying problems to prevent future failures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.g2mtlabs.com/failure-analysis/what-is-failure-analysis/   G2MT Labs - "What is Failure Analysis?"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Analysis of a failed part can be done using [[destructive testing]] or [[non-destructive testing]]. Destructive testing involves removing a metal component from service and sectioning the component for analysis. Destructive testing gives the failure analyst the ability to conduct the analysis in a [[laboratory]] setting and perform tests on the material that will ultimately destroy the component. Non destructive testing is a test method that allows certain physical properties of metal to be examined without taking the samples completely out of service. NDT is generally used to detect failures in components before the component fails catastrophically.

There is no standardized list of metallurgical [[failure mode]]s and different metallurgists might use a different name for the same failure mode. The Failure Mode Terms listed below are those accepted by [[ASTM]],&lt;ref&gt;“Standard Terms Relating to Corrosion and Corrosion Testing” (G 15), Annual Book of ASTM Standards, ASTM, Philadelphia, PA.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASM International (society)|ASM]],&lt;ref&gt;ASM-International Metals Handbook, Ninth Edition, Corrosion, ASM-International, Metals Park, OH
&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[National Association of Corrosion Engineers|NACE]]&lt;ref&gt;NACE-International NACE Basic Corrosion Course, NACE-International, Houston, TX&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct metallurgical failure mechanisms.

'''Multipurpose trees''' are trees that are deliberately grown and managed for more than one output. They may supply food in the form of [[fruit]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], or [[leaves]] that can be used as a [[vegetable]]; while at the same time supplying [[firewood]], add [[nitrogen]] to the [[soil]], or supply some other combination of multiple outputs. "Multipurpose tree" is a term common to [[agroforestry]], particularly when speaking of [[tropical]] agroforestry where the tree owner is a [[subsistence farmer]].

While all trees can be said to serve several purposes, such as providing habitat, shade, or soil improvement; multipurpose trees have a greater impact on a farmer’s well being because they fulfill more than one basic human need. In most cases multipurpose trees have a primary role; such as being part of a living fence, or a windbreak, or used in an ally cropping system. In addition to this they will have one or more secondary roles, most often supplying a family with food or firewood, or both.

When a multipurpose tree is planted, a number of needs and functions can be fulfilled at once. They may be used as a windbreak, while also supplying a staple food for the owner. They may be used as fencepost in a living fence, while also being the main source of firewood for the owner. They may be intercropped into existing fields, to supply nitrogen to the soil, and at the same time serve as a source of both food and firewood.

Common multipurpose trees of the tropics include:
* ''[[Gliricidia sepium]]'' – the most common tree used for living fences in Central America, firewood, fodder, fixing nitrogen into the soil.
* Moringa ''([[Moringa oleifera]])'' – edible leaves, pods and beans, commonly used for animal forage and shade (it does not fix nitrogen as is commonly believed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moringaceae.org/1/post/2014/02/does-moringa-fix-nitrogen.html|title=Does Moringa fix nitrogen?|website=The International Moringa Germplasm Collection|date=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Coconut palm]] – used for food, purified water (juice from inside the coconut), roof thatching, firewood, shade.
* [[Neem]] – limited use as insect repellent, antibiotic, adding nitrogen to the soil, windbreaks, biomass production for use as mulch, firewood.

Ideally most trees found on tropical [[farm]]s should be multipurpose, and provide more to the farmer than simply shade and firewood. In most cases they should be nitrogen fixing legumes, or trees that greatly increase the farmer's [[food security]].

'''National Grid plc''' is a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] electricity and gas utility company headquartered in Warwick, United Kingdom. Its principal activities are in the United Kingdom and Northeastern United States. It has a primary listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]], and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. It has a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].

==History==

===Background (CEGB before 1990)===
{{see also|Central Electricity Generating Board#Responsibilities}}

Before 1990, both the generation and transmission activities in [[England and Wales]] were under the responsibility of [[CEGB|Central Electricity Generating Board]] (CEGB). The present [[electricity market]] in the United Kingdom was built upon the breakup of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=68|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/LessonsNet.pdf |title=Lessons from Liberalised Electricity Markets|publisher=IEA / OECD |year=2005|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies—[[PowerGen]], [[National Power]], and [[Nuclear Electric]] (later [[British Energy]], eventually [[EDF Energy]])—and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the National Grid Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/nov/22/thatcher.politics1|title= A whole world sold on sell-offs|date=22 November 2000|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Grid and acquisitions (1990–1999)===
In 1990, the transmission activities of the CEGB were transferred to the National Grid Company plc, which was owned by the twelve [[regional electricity company|regional electricity companies]] (RECs) through a [[holding company]], National Grid Group plc. The company was first listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?d=&amp;s=ng&amp;m=L|title=NATIONAL GRID Share Price - NG.L- Yahoo! UK &amp; Ireland Finance|work=Yahoo! Finance|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion and consolidation (2000–present)===
With the beginning of the new millennium, National Grid pursued some major mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, National Grid Group acquired New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Notice: National Grid Group plc Acquisition of New England Electric System|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/35-27154.htm|website=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, National Grid Group acquired Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a New York State utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Grid acquires Niagara Mohawk|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2002/01/28/daily48.html|website=Albany Business Review|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, National Grid Group merged with Lattice Group plc, owner of Transco—the gas distribution business (Lattice demerged from BG Group in 2000). National Grid Group changed its name to National Grid Transco plc. In August 2004, National Grid Transco agreed to sell four of its regional gas distribution networks. The total cash consideration was £5.8&amp;nbsp;billion. NGT kept ownership of four other distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5875953/ns/business-world_business/t/national-grid-transco-sells-four-gas-piplines/#.VvXZXfmLQdU|title=National Grid Transco sells four gas pipelines|date=31 August 2004|publisher=CBS|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.&lt;ref name=nghistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.nationalgrid.com/about-us/our-history/|website=National Grid|title=History|accessdate=9 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312155733/http://www2.nationalgrid.com/about-us/our-history/|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy [[KeySpan]] Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgridus.com/aboutus/a3-1_news2.asp?document=1771 |title=National Grid – Keyspan Merger Provides New Savings And Expanded Resources To New Hampshire Customers |publisher=Nationalgridus.com |date=27 February 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the [[Southern Union Company]] subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/business/content/projo_20060217_grid17.1d64dbea.html |title=Electric Utility buying Rhode Island Gas Company |publisher=Projo.com |date=17 February 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8&amp;nbsp;million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4754350.stm |title=National Grid buy US gas company |publisher=BBC News |date=27 February 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, National Grid formed a [[joint venture]] with the Dutch transmission operator [[TenneT]] for a {{convert|260|km|adj=on}} 1,000&amp;nbsp;MW [[BritNed]] DC link between the [[Isle of Grain]] in [[Kent]] and [[Maasvlakte]], near [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name=natgrid&gt;

{{globalize/North America|date=December 2010}}
[[Natural gas]], like many other [[commodity|commodities]], can be stored for an indefinite period of time in '''natural gas storage''' facilities for later consumption.

== Usage ==
Gas storage is principally used to meet load variations. Gas is injected into storage during periods of low [[demand]] and withdrawn from storage during periods of peak demand. It is also used for a variety of secondary purposes, including:

*Balancing the flow in [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] systems. This is performed by mainline transmission pipeline companies to maintain operational integrity of the pipelines, by ensuring that the pipeline pressures are kept within design parameters.
*Maintaining contractual balance. Shippers use stored gas to maintain the volume they deliver to the pipeline system and the volume they withdraw. Without access to such storage facilities, any imbalance situation would result in a hefty penalty.
*Leveling production over periods of fluctuating demand. Producers use storage to store any gas that is not immediately marketable, typically over the summer when demand is low and deliver it in the winter months when the demand is high.
*Market [[speculation]]. Producers and marketers use gas storage as a speculative tool, storing gas when they believe that prices will increase in the future and then selling it when it does reach those levels.
*Insuring against any unforeseen accidents. Gas storage can be used as an insurance that may affect either production or delivery of natural gas. These may include natural factors such as [[hurricane]]s, or malfunction of production or distribution systems.
*Meeting regulatory obligations. Gas storage ensures to some extent the reliability of gas supply to the consumer at the lowest cost, as required by the regulatory body. This is why the regulatory body monitors storage inventory levels.
*Reducing price volatility. Gas storage ensures commodity liquidity at the market centers. This helps contain natural gas price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] and uncertainty.
*Offsetting changes in natural gas demands. Gas storage facilities are gaining more importance due to changes in natural gas demands. First, traditional supplies that once met the winter peak demand are now unable to keep pace. Second, there is a growing summer peak demand on natural gas, due to [[electricity|electric]] generation via gas fired [[Power station|power plants]].

[[Image:UndergroundGasStorage 10.JPG|thumb|500 px|center|Datasource.&lt;ref name="Source5"&gt;[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng stor top.asp ''EIA-Topics for Natural Gas Storage'']{{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Measures and definitions ==
Characteristics of underground storage facilities need to be defined and measured. A number of volumetric measures have been put in place for that purpose:

*Total gas storage capacity: It is the maximum [[volume]] of natural gas that can be stored at the storage facility. It is determined by several physical factors such as the reservoir volume, and also on the operating procedures and engineering methods used.
*Total gas in storage: It is the total volume of gas in storage at the facility at a particular time.
*Base gas (also referred to as cushion gas): It is the volume of gas that is intended as permanent inventory in a storage reservoir to maintain adequate pressure and deliverability rates throughout the withdrawal season.
*Working gas capacity: It is the total gas storage capacity minus the base gas.
*Working gas: It is the total gas in storage minus the base gas. Working gas is the volume of gas available to the market place at a particular time.
*Physically unrecoverable gas: The amount of gas that becomes permanently embedded in the formation of the storage facility and that can never be extracted.
*Cycling rate: It is the average number of times a reservoir’s working gas volume can be turned over during a specific period of time. Typically the period of time used is one year.
*Deliverability: It is a measure of the amount of gas that can be delivered (withdrawn) from a storage facility on a daily basis. It is also referred to as the deliverability rate, withdrawal rate, or withdrawal capacity and is usually expressed in terms of millions of cubic feet of gas per day (MMcf/day) that can be delivered.
*Injection capacity (or rate): It is the amount of gas that can be injected into a storage facility on a daily basis. It can be thought of as the complement of the deliverability. Injection rate is also typically measured in millions of cubic feet of gas that can be delivered per day (MMcf/day).
&lt;br /&gt;The measurements above are not fixed for a given storage facility. For example, deliverability depends on several factors including the amount of gas in the reservoir and the pressure etc. Generally, a storage facility’s deliverability rate varies directly with the total amount of gas in the reservoir. It is at its highest when the reservoir is full and declines as gas is withdrawn. The injection capacity of a storage facility is also variable and depends on factors similar to those that affect deliverability. The injection rate varies inversely with the total amount of gas in storage. It is at its highest when the reservoir is nearly empty and declines as more gas is injected. The storage facility operator may also change operational parameters.  This would allow, for example, the storage capacity maximum to be increased, the withdrawal of base gas during very high demand or reclassifying base gas to working gas if technological advances or engineering procedures allow.

== Types ==
[[File:Podzemni zasobnik plynu Haje (3).JPG|thumb|Equipment of an underground natural gas storage facility in the Czech Republic near the town of [[Milín]].]]
The most important type of gas storage is in underground reservoirs. There are three principal types&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; depleted gas reservoirs, [[aquifer]] reservoirs and salt cavern reservoirs. Each of these types has distinct physical and economic characteristics which govern the suitability of a particular type of storage type for a given application.

[[Image:UndergroundGasStorage 8.gif||frame|center|Natural gas is stored in underground (A) salt formations, (C) aquifer reservoirs and (D) depleted reservoirs.&lt;ref name="Source4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/oilgas/delivery/index.html |title='&amp;#39;U.S. Department of Energy-Transmission, Distribution &amp; Storage'&amp;#39; |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Depleted gas reservoir ===
These are the most prominent and common form of underground storage. They are the reservoir formations of natural gas fields that have produced all their economically recoverable gas. The depleted reservoir formation is readily capable of holding injected natural gas. Using such a facility is economically attractive because it allows the re-use, with suitable modification, of the extraction and distribution infrastructure remaining from the productive life of the [[gas field]] which reduces the start-up costs. Depleted reservoirs are also attractive because their geological and physical characteristics have already been studied by [[geologist]]s and [[petroleum engineering|petroleum engineers]] and are usually well known. Consequently, depleted reservoirs are generally the cheapest and easiest to develop, operate, and maintain of the three types of underground storage.

In order to maintain working pressures in depleted reservoirs, about 50 percent of the natural gas in the formation must be kept as cushion gas. However, since depleted reservoirs were previously filled with natural gas and [[hydrocarbon]]s, they do not require the injection of gas that will become physically unrecoverable as this is already present in the formation. This provides a further economic boost for this type of facility, particularly when the cost of gas is high.
Typically, these facilities are operated on a single annual cycle; gas is injected during the off-peak summer months and withdrawn during the winter months of peak demand.

A number of factors determine whether or not a depleted gas field will make an economically viable storage facility. Geographically, depleted reservoirs should be relatively close to gas markets and to transportation infrastructure (pipelines and distribution systems) which will connect them to that market. Since the fields were at one time productive and connected to infrastructure, distance from market is the dominant geographical factor. Geologically, it is preferred that depleted reservoir formations have high [[porosity]] and [[permeability (fluid)|permeability]]. The porosity of the formation is one of the factors that determines the amount of natural gas the reservoir is able to hold. Permeability is a measure of the rate at which natural gas flows through the formation and ultimately determines the rate of injection and withdrawal of gas from storage.

[[Image:NaturalGasStorage 3.JPG||frame|center|Datasource.&lt;ref name="Source1"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil gas/natural gas/feature articles/2006/ngstorage/ngstorage.pdf''U.S. Underground Natural Gas Storage Developments: 1998-2005'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Aquifer reservoir ===
[[Aquifer]]s are underground, porous and permeable rock formations that act as natural water reservoirs. In some cases they can be used for natural gas storage. Usually these facilities are operated on a single annual cycle as with depleted reservoirs.  The geological and physical characteristics of aquifer formation are not known ahead of time and a significant investment has to go into investigating these and evaluating the aquifer’s suitability for natural gas storage.

If the aquifer is suitable, all of the associated infrastructure must be developed from scratch, increasing the development costs compared to depleted reservoirs. This includes installation of wells, extraction equipment, pipelines, dehydration facilities, and possibly compression equipment. Since the aquifer initially contains water there is little or no naturally occurring gas in the formation and of the gas injected some will be physically unrecoverable. As a result, aquifer storage typically requires significantly more cushion gas than depleted reservoirs; up to 80% of the total gas volume. Most aquifer storage facilities were developed when the price of natural gas was low, meaning this cushion gas was inexpensive to sacrifice.  With rising gas prices aquifer storage becomes more expensive to develop.

A consequence of the above factors is that developing an aquifer storage facility is usually time consuming and expensive.  Aquifers are generally the least desirable and most expensive type of natural gas storage facility.

[[Image:NaturalGasStorage.JPG||frame|center|Total Deliverability from Natural Gas Storage by Type of Facility, 1998, 2005, 2008.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;]]

=== Salt formation ===
Underground [[salt dome|salt]] formations are well suited to natural gas storage.  Salt caverns allow very little of the injected natural gas to escape from storage unless specifically extracted. The walls of a [[salt cavern]] are strong and impervious to gas over the lifespan of the storage facility.

Once a salt feature is discovered and found to be suitable for the development of a gas storage facility a cavern is created within the salt feature. This is done by the process of [[solution mining]].  Fresh water is pumped down a [[borehole]] into the salt.  Some of the salt is [[solvation|dissolved]] leaving a void and the water, now [[saline water|saline]], is pumped back to the surface.  The process continues until the cavern is the desired size. Once created, a salt cavern offers an underground natural gas storage vessel with very high deliverability. Cushion gas requirements are low, typically about 33 percent of total gas capacity.

Salt caverns are usually much smaller than depleted gas reservoir and [[aquifer]] storage facilities.  A salt cavern facility may occupy only one one-hundredth of the area taken up by a depleted gas reservoir facility. Consequently, salt caverns cannot hold the large volumes of gas necessary to meet base load storage requirements.  Deliverability from salt caverns is, however, much higher than for either aquifers or depleted reservoirs. This allows the gas stored in a salt cavern to be withdrawn and replenished more readily and quickly. This quick cycle-time is useful in emergency situations or during short periods of unexpected demand surges.

Although construction is more costly than depleted field conversions when measured on the basis of dollars per thousand cubic feet of working gas, the ability to perform several withdrawal and injection cycles each year reduces the effective cost.

=== Other ===
There are also other types of storage such as:

==== LNG ====
[[File:National Grid LNG Tank.jpg|thumb|right|A liquefied natural gas storage tank in Massachusetts.]]
[[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] facilities provide delivery capacity during peak periods when market demand exceeds pipeline deliverability. [[LNG storage tank]]s possess a number of advantages over underground storage. As a liquid at approximately −163&amp;nbsp;°C (−260&amp;nbsp;°F), it occupies about 600 times less space than gas stored underground, and it provides high deliverability at very short notice because LNG storage facilities are generally located close to market and can be trucked to some customers avoiding [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] tolls. There is no requirement for cushion gas and it allows access to a global supply. LNG facilities are, however, more expensive to build and maintain than developing new underground storage facilities.

==== {{Visible anchor|Pipeline capacity}} ====
Gas can be temporarily stored in the pipeline system itself, through a process called '''line packing.''' This is done by packing more gas into the pipeline by an increase in the pressure. During periods of high demand, greater quantities of gas can be withdrawn from the pipeline in the market area, than is injected at the production area. The process of line packing is usually performed during off peak times to meet the next day’s peaking demands. This method, however, only provides a temporary short-term substitute for traditional underground storage.

==== Gasholders ====
{{Main|Gasholder}}
[[Image:Gasometer in East London.jpg|right|thumb|An older column-guided gasholder in [[West Ham]], [[London]]]]
[[File:Meadow Lane.jpg|thumb|right|1960s-built spiral-guided gasholders in [[Hunslet]], [[Leeds]]]]
Gas can be stored above ground in a [[gasholder]] (or gasometer), largely for balancing, not long-term storage, and this has been done since Victorian times.  These store gas at district pressure, meaning that they can provide extra gas very quickly at peak times.  Gasholders are perhaps most used in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]].  
There are two kinds of gasholder&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; column-guided, which are guided up by a large frame that is always visible, regardless of the position of the holder; and spiral-guided, which have no frame and are guided up by concentric runners in the previous lift.

Perhaps the most famous British gasholder is the large column-guided "[[Oval gasholders]]" that overlooks [[The Oval|The Oval cricket ground]] in [[London]].  Gasholders were built in the United Kingdom from early Victorian times; many, such as [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] in London and St. Marks Street in [[Kingston upon Hull]] are so old that they are entirely [[rivet]]ed, as their construction predates the use of welding in construction.  The last to be built in the UK was in 1983.

== Owners==

=== Interstate pipeline companies ===
Interstate pipeline companies rely heavily on underground storage to perform load balancing and system [[Supply management (procurement)|supply management]] on their long-haul transmission lines. FERC regulations though demand that these companies open up the remainder of their capacity not used for that purpose to third parties. Twenty-five interstate companies currently operate 172 underground natural gas storage facilities. In 2005, their facilities accounted for about 43 percent of overall storage deliverability and 55 percent of working gas capacity in the US.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt; These operators include the Columbia Gas Transmission Company, Dominion Gas Transmission Company, The National Fuel Gas Supply Company, Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Texas Gas Transmission Company, Southern Star Central Pipeline Company, [[TransCanada Corporation]].

=== Intrastate pipeline companies and local distribution companies ===
Intrastate pipeline companies use storage facilities for operational balancing and system supply as well as to meet the energy demand of end-use customers. LDCs generally use gas from storage to serve customers directly. This group operates 148 underground storage sites and account for 40 percent of overall storage deliverability and 32 percent of working gas capacity in the US.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt; These operators include Consumers Energy Company and the Northern Illinois Gas Company ([[Nicor]]), in the US and [[Enbridge]] and [[Union Gas]] in Canada.

=== Independent storage service providers ===
The [[deregulation]] activity in the underground gas storage arena has attracted independent storage service providers to develop storage facilities. The capacity made available would then be leased to third-party customers such as marketers and electricity generators. It is expected that in the future, this group would take more market share, as more deregulation takes place. Currently in the US, this group accounts for 18 percent of overall storage deliverability and 13 percent of working gas capacity in the US.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;

== Location and distribution ==

=== Europe ===
As of January 2011, there are 124 underground storage facilities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogas.org/uploaded/Statistical%20Report%202011_091211.pdf ''Eurogas 2011 Statistical Report'']{{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
The United States is typically broken out into three main regions when it comes to gas consumption and production. These are the consuming East, the consuming West and the producing South.
[[Image:NaturalGasStorage 5.gif|frame|center|Source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil gas/natural gas/analysis publications/storagebasics/storagebasics.html''EIA-The Basics of Underground Natural Gas Storage'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==== Consuming East ====
The consuming east region, particularly the states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, it is not surprising that this region has the highest level of working gas storage capacity of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis.{{cn|date = July 2014}} Although the total capacity for these LNG facilities does not match those of underground storage in scale, the short term high deliverability makes up for that.

==== Consuming West ====
The consuming west region has the smallest share of gas storage both in terms of the number of sites as well as gas capacity/deliverability. Storage in this area is mostly used to allow domestic and Albertan gas, coming from Canada, to flow at a rather constant rate.

==== Producing South ====
The producing south's storage facilities are linked to the market centers and play a crucial role in the efficient export, transmission and distribution of natural gas produced to the consuming regions. These storage facilities allow the storage of gas that is not immediately marketable to be stored for later use.

== Regulation and deregulation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

=== United States ===
Interstate pipeline companies in the US are subject to the jurisdiction of the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC). Prior to 1992, these companies owned all the gas that flowed through their systems. This also included gas in their storage facility, over which they had complete control. Then FERC Order 636 was implemented. This required the companies to operate their facilities, including gas storage on an open access basis. For gas storage, this meant that these companies could only reserve the capacity needed to maintain system integrity. The rest of the capacity would be available for leasing to third parties on a nondiscriminatory basis. Open access has opened a wide variety of application for gas storage, particularly for marketers which can now exploit price [[arbitrage]] opportunities. Any storage capacity would be priced at cost-based [[pricing]], unless the provider can demonstrate to FERC that it lacks market power, in which case it may be allowed to price at market-based rates to gain market share. FERC defines market power as "..the ability of a seller profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time.". The underlying pricing structure for storage has discouraged development in the gas storage sector, which has not seen many new storage facilities constructed, besides current ones being expanded. In 2005, FERC announced a new Order 678 targeted particularly to gas storage. This rule is intended to stimulate the development of new gas storage facility in the ultimate goal of reducing natural gas price [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]]. Commission Chairman [[Joseph T. Kelliher]] observed: "Since 1988, natural gas demand in the United States has risen 24 percent. Over the same period, gas storage capacity has increased only 1.4 percent. While construction of storage capacity has lagged behind the demand for natural gas, we have seen record levels of price volatility. This suggests that current storage capacity is inadequate. Further, this year, what storage capacity exists may be full far earlier than in any previous year. According to some analysts, that raises the prospect that some domestic gas production may be shut-in. Our final rule should help reduce price volatility and expand storage capacity."
This ruling aims at opening up two approaches for developers of natural gas storage, to be able to charge market-based rates. The first one is the redefinition of the relevant product market for storage that includes alternatives for storage such as available pipeline capacity, local gas production and LNG terminals. The second approach aims at implementing section 312 of the Energy Policy Act. It would allow an applicant to request authority to charge "market-based rates even if a lack of market power has not been demonstrated, in circumstances where market-based rates are in the public interest and necessary to encourage the construction of storage capacity in the area needing storage service and that customers are adequately protected," the
Commission said. It is expected that this new order will entice developers, especially independent storage operators, to develop new facilities in the near future.

=== Iran ===
The Underground Gas storage Company, as a subsidiary of the National Iranian Gas company, was established in 2007 with the following objectives:
# Organize, speed up and continue all the projects already in progress by the Natural Gas Storage Management
# Implementation of new projects and plans
# Execution of required studies with the purpose of locating new feasible gas storage potentials in different parts of the country which will turn into new plans and projects after approval. 6/30/2009

====Sarajeh reservoir====
Sarajeh reservoir is depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs storage capacity of 3/3 billion cubic meters of natural gas, the company said. Storage capacity of the project to remove gas stored in the reservoir during the third phase follows considering are.
- Phase 1: 10 million cubic meters of gas per day
- Phase 2: 20 million cubic meters of gas per day
- Phase 3: 30 million cubic meters of gas per day.
The project started at the end of 86 years from the date 10/17/85, 16% and 54% of the initial installation of the goods has grown. After 87 years at the end of the company's natural gas storage development project, the installation of any goods supplied to 84% is reached. Electric power supply operation by the end of the project has not improved in 86 years at the end of year 87 5/96% is reached. The gas injection project design, installation and commissioning of gas injection compressors 87 till about 3/9% has been developed.

====Shurijeh gas storage tank project====

- The first phase of 10 AD. CE. M.. The injection of 20 m. CE. CE.
- Phase II 20 m. M.. M.. R. injection and 40&amp;nbsp;mm

=== Canada ===
In [[Alberta]], gas storage rates are not regulated and providers negotiate rates with their customers on a contract-by-contract basis. However the Carbon facility which is owned by ATCO gas is regulated, since ATCO is a utility company. Therefore, ATCO Gas has to charge cost-based rates for its customers, and can market any additional capacities at market-based rates.
In [[Ontario]], gas storage is regulated by the Ontario Energy Board. Currently all the available storage is owned by vertically integrated utilities. The utility companies have to price their storage capacity sold to their customers at cost-based rates, but can market any remaining capacity at market-based rates. Storage developed by independent storage developers can charge market-based rates.
In [[British Columbia]], gas storage is not regulated. All available storage capacity is marketed at market-based rates.

=== United Kingdom ===
The regulation of gas storage, transportation and sale is overseen by [[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets|Ofgem]] (a government regulator). This has been the case since the gas industry was privatised in 1986. Most forms of gas storage were owned by Transco (now part of [[National Grid plc]]), however the national network has now largely been broken down into regional networks, owned by different companies, they are however all still answerable to Ofgem.

== Storage economics ==

=== Storage development cost ===
As with all infrastructural investments in the energy sector, developing storage facilities is capital intensive. Investors usually use the return on investment as a financial measure for the viability of such projects. It has been estimated that investors require a rate or return between 12 percent to 15 percent for regulated projects, and close to 20 percent for unregulated projects.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; The higher expected return from unregulated projects is due to the higher perceived market risk. In addition significant expenses are accumulated during the planning and location of potential storage sites to determine its suitability, which further increases the risk.

The capital expenditure to build the facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends on the type of the storage field. As a general [[rule of thumb]], salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one should keep in mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface and the quality of the geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas.  The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.

The expected cash flows from such projects depend on a number of factors. These include the services the facility provides as well as the regulatory [[regime]] under which it operates. Facilities that operate primarily to take advantage of [[commodity]] arbitrage opportunities are expected to have different cash flow benefits than ones primarily used to ensure seasonal supply reliability. Rules set by regulators can on one hand restrict the profit made by storage facility owners or on the other hand guarantee [[profit (economics)|profit]], depending on the market model.

===Storage valuation===
To understand the economics of gas storage, it is crucial to be able to value it. Several approaches have been proposed. They include:&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt;
*Cost-of-service valuation
*Least-cost planning
*Seasonal valuation
*Option-based valuation
The different valuation modes co-exist in the real world and are not mutually exclusive. Buyers and sellers typically use a combination of the different prices to come up with the true value of storage. An example of the different valuations and the price they generate can be found in the table below.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Cost of storage per valuation mode.&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt;
|-
! Type
! Dollars/mcf of working gas
|-
| Median cost-of-service
| $0.64
|-
| Intrinsic value for Winter 05/06 as of August 2004
| $0.47-$0.62

|-
| Hypothetical cost-of-service of salt cavern
| $2.93
|-
| Intrinsic and extrinsic value of salt cavern (depleted reservoir)
| $1.60-$1.90
|}

====Cost-of-service valuation====
This valuation mode is typically used to value regulated storage,&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; for instance storage operated by interstate pipeline companies. These companies are regulated by FERC. This pricing method allows the developers to recover their cost and an agreed upon return on investment. The regulatory body requires that the rates and tariffs are maintained and publicly published. The services provided by these companies include firm and interruptible storage as well as no-notice storage services. Usually, cost of service pricing is used for depleted reservoir facilities. If it is used to price, say salt cavern formations, the cost would be very high, due to the high cost of development of such facilities.

==== Least-cost planning ====
This valuation mode is typically used by local distribution companies (LDCs).&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; It is based on pricing storage, according to the savings resulting from not having to resort to other more expensive options. This pricing mode depends on the consumer and their respective load profile/shape.

==== Seasonal valuation ====
The seasonal valuation of storage is also referred to as the ''intrinsic value''. It is evaluated as the difference between the two prices in a pair of forward prices. The idea being that one can lock-in a forward spread, either physically or financially. For developers seeking to study the feasibility of building a storage facility, they would typically look at the long-term price spreads.

==== Option-based valuation ====
In addition to possessing an intrinsic value, storage may also have [[extrinsic value]]. Intrinsic valuation of storage does not take the cycling ability of high-deliverability storage. The extrinsic valuation reflects the fact that in such facilities, say salt cavern formations, a proportion of the space can be used more than once, thus increasing value. Such high-deliverability storage facility allows its user to respond to variations in demand/price within a season or during a given day rather than just seasonal variations as was the case with single cycle facilities.

=== Effects of natural gas prices on storage ===
In general as we see in the graph below, high [[natural gas prices|gas prices]] are typically associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.
== Future of storage technology ==
Research is being conducted on many fronts in the gas storage field to help identify new improved and more economical ways to store gas.
Research being conducted by the US Department of Energy is showing that salt formations can be chilled allowing for more gas to be stored.&lt;ref name="Source4"/&gt; This will reduce the size of the formation needed to be treated, and have salt extracted from it. This will lead to cheaper development costs for salt formation storage facility type.
Another aspect being looked at, are other formations that may hold gas. These include hard rock formations such as granite, in areas where such formations exists and other types currently used for gas storage do not.&lt;ref name="Source4"/&gt;
In Sweden a new type of storage facility has been built, called "lined rock cavern".&lt;ref name="Source4"/&gt; This storage facility consists of installing a steel tank in a cavern in the rock of a hill and surrounding it with concrete. Although the development cost of such facility is quite expensive, its ability to cycle gas multiple times compensates for it, similar to salt formation facilities.
Finally, another research project sponsored by the Department of Energy, is that of hydrates. Hydrates are compounds formed when natural gas is frozen in the presence of water. The advantage being that as much as 181 standard cubic feet of natural gas could be stored in a single cubic foot of hydrate.&lt;ref name="Source4"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1675">'''Non evaporable getters''' (NEG), based on the principle of metallic surface sorption of gas molecules, are mostly porous alloys or powder mixtures of  [[Aluminium|Al]], [[Zirconium|Zr]], [[Titanium|Ti]], [[Vanadium|V]] and [[Iron|Fe]]. They help to establish and maintain vacuums by soaking up or bonding to gas molecules that remain within a partial vacuum. This is done through the use of materials that readily form stable compounds with active gases. They are important tools for improving the performance of many vacuum systems.  [[Sintering|Sintered]] onto the inner surface of high vacuum vessels, the NEG coating can be applied even to spaces that are narrow and hard to pump out, which makes it very popular in particle accelerators where this is an issue. The main sorption parameters of the kind of NEGs, like pumping speed and sorption capacity, have low limits.
A different type of NEG, which is not coated, is the Tubegetter. The activation of these [[getter]]s is accomplished mechanically or at a temperature from 550 K.&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8064729/&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature range is from 0 to 800 K under HV/UHV conditions.

The NEG acts as a getter or getter pump that is able to reduce the pressure to less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]].

'''Northern coastal scrub''' is a [[scrubland]] plant community of [[California]] and [[Oregon]]. It occurs along the Pacific Coast from Point Sur on the Central California coast in [[Monterey County, California]], to southern Oregon. It frequently forms a landscape mosaic with [[California coastal prairie|coastal prairie]]. 

The Northern coastal scrub's predominant plants are low [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s. 

Characteristic shrubs include [[coyote brush]] ''(Baccharis pilularis)'', [[California yerba santa]] ''(Eriodictyon californicum)'', [[coast silk-tassel]] ''(Garrya elliptica)'', [[salal]] ''(Gaultheria shallon)'', and [[yellow bush lupine]] ''(Lupinus arboreus)''. 

Herbaceous Northern coastal scrub species include [[western blue-eyed grass]] ''(Sisyrinchium bellum)'', [[Douglas iris]] ''(Iris douglasiana)'', and [[:Category:Native grasses of California|native grasses]].

With all [[solar thermal collector]] systems there is a potential risk that the solar collector may reach an  equilibrium or [[stagnation temperature]] higher than the maximum [[safe operating temperature]]. Various measures are taken for '''optical overheating protection'''.

Stagnation temperatures are encountered under conditions of high radiation while no heat transfer fluid is flowing through the collector, for example during power failures, component failures, servicing, energy storage capacity limitations, or periods when little hot water is extracted from the system.&lt;ref name="Harrison2004" /&gt; More generally, stagnation conditions can be considered to be any situation under which the solar collector cannot adequately dispatch the absorbed solar heat to the heat transfer fluid.

Besides any damaging effects to the system, high stagnation temperatures also place constraints on collector materials. These materials must retain their important properties during and after exposure to the high stagnation temperatures. This implies that solar collectors are generally built from high temperature resistant materials. These materials are usually expensive, heavy, and have an overall high environmental impact.&lt;ref name="Köhl2005" /&gt;

[[Polymeric]] materials offer a significant cost-reduction and environmental improvement potential for solar thermal collectors and may thus benefit a broader utilization of solar energy for various heating purposes. However, the long-term service temperature of plastics is limited. Thus, for potential applications of plastics in solar absorbers an appropriate design including overheating protection is essential.&lt;ref name="Wallner2008" /&gt; Feasible ways would be a reduction in optical gain (for example, using [[thermotropic]] layers, or [[electrochromic]] devices) or an increase in system losses, by dumping of the hot water excess.

In this article an alternative method to decrease the optical gain is presented. The method is based on the geometry of prisms and the phenomenon of [[Total Internal Reflection]].

== Working principle ==

[[File:Prismatic Optical Switch.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Working Principle of the Prismatic Optical Switch. When liquid is present in the switch, the switch behaves as if transparent. When there is no liquid present, the switch becomes reflective]]

According to [[Snell's law]], light cannot escape from a medium when it strikes the medium boundary at an angle of incidence (θ) that is larger than the [[Critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] (θ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), an optical phenomenon called [[Total internal reflection|Total Internal Reflection]]. The critical angle can be calculated using;

&lt;math&gt;\theta _{c}=Sin^{-1}(\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}),\; \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;	

For a [[polycarbonate]] medium, with a [[refraction index]] of n=1.59, placed in an atmosphere of air with a refraction index close to 1, Total Internal Reflection occurs when θ &gt; θ&lt;sub&gt;(c,air)&lt;/sub&gt;=39°.

Consider a polycarbonate prismatic structure with an apex angle α&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;=45° placed in an atmosphere of air. A ray of light that strikes the medium boundary at normal incidence is total internal reflected, as θ&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;=45°&gt; θ&lt;sub&gt;(c,air)&lt;/sub&gt;=39°. In presence of water, θ&lt;sub&gt;(c,water)&lt;/sub&gt;=56.8° and θ&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;=45°&lt; θ&lt;sub&gt;(c,water)&lt;/sub&gt;, the incoming light is merely refracted and traverses the polycarbonate medium. As such, water acts as a switching fluid. In theory, water can be replaced by any other liquid, with an index of refraction close to that of the prismatic structure, to act as the switching fluid.

The optical switch consists of a self-regulating mechanism. In its ''passive'' state the switch is filled with liquid and light is allowed to pass through the switch and heat the system behind it. As the system heats up, the switching fluid evaporates out of the optical switch and the prismatic structure starts to behave as a reflective surface. No more light passes through the switch, limiting the maximum temperature of the system to the evaporation temperature of the liquid.&lt;ref name="Slaman2009" /&gt;

== Angular Dependence ==
[[File:Transmittance Prismatic Array.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Transmittance of a prismatic array against day rotation(δ) (δ=0 stands for 12.00h, 15° equals 1 hour). The prisms are aligned such that the angle of incidence (θ) in mid-summer at noon. (A); Vertical alignment of the prismatic array for a mid-summer day (a) for a mid-autumn &amp; mid-spring day (b), and for a mid-winter day (c). B; Horizontal alignment of the prismatic array for a mid-summer day (d), a mid-autumn &amp; mid-spring day (e), and for a mid-winter day (f).]]

Resulting from its geometry, the optical switch is sensitive to the angle of the incident beam. Depending on the shape of the prisms, the transmittance of the switch in its reflective state during a typical day shows characteristic angular dependence. This dependence can be used to find specific [[transmission curve]]s for different applications, where the geometry of the prisms serves as the input variable.

== Applications ==

The main application for which the optical switch was developed is overheating protection for solar thermal collectors.&lt;ref name="Slaman2009" /&gt; The prismatic geometry can be integrated within the cover plate of the collectors to prevent them from overheating, either by self-regulation through evaporation, or by draining the water out of the switch at a specified maximum temperature. Temperature limitation would allow for the use of polymeric materials within solar collectors, dramatically reducing cost-price and increasing market penetration.

Another application of the switch is in windows for both housing and office buildings. The amount of sunlight entering the building can be controlled by the switching liquid. Preventing the amount of sunlight entering a building will reduce the temperature inside the building on sunny days.

Finally, the switch can be used within roofs of [[greenhouse]]s. The plants in the greenhouse can be protected from damage on sunny days by putting the switch in the reflective state. Currently greenhouses are covered with a [[chalk]] layer to protect the plants during summer from excessive sunlight. Applying the chalk layer is time consuming and bad for the environment. Once the chalk is applied, it also blocks sunlight during less sunny days. The optical switch could potentially resolve this issue using the switching mechanism described above.

The temperature inside the greenhouse can be regulated by switching a certain amount of roof sections in the reflective state. Also the switching fluid inside the roof can be circulated to extract heat from the greenhouse. These cooling methods allow that the (roof) windows remain closed and that the climate ([[relative humidity]] and raised [[CO2]] levels) remain optimal and constant.

The Switching fluid in the greenhouse roof can be used as a filter for a certain part of the [[solar spectrum]]. Water allows so-called "PAR" light ([[Photosynthetically active radiation]], the light that plants use to grow) to pass, while "NIR" (Near [[Infra Red]]) light is absorbed. The amount of NIR light to absorb can be tuned by solving micro-particles of Copper Sulphate or clay in the switching fluid. In that way  optimum growth conditions can be selected.

Some greenhouse products, like flowers, are grown by using artificial light during the night. This artificial light causes so-called [[light pollution]] in the environment of the greenhouse. When a greenhouse roof consists of a well designed optical switch the greenhouse roof becomes reflective during the night, which keeps the artificial light inside the greenhouse. As a side effect there are less number of lights needed since the roof acts as an efficient mirror.

==History==

===Creation of Areva===
[[File:Siege Areva 33 rue Lafayette P1050953.JPG|upright|thumb|Former Areva headquarters, rue Lafayette in Paris]]
Areva was created on 3 April 2001, by the [[merger]] of [[Framatome]] (later Areva NP, now sold off and renamed back to Framatome&lt;ref name=reuters-20180123a/&gt;), [[Cogema]] (now [[Areva NC]]) and Technicatome (now Areva TA). 
It was based on the structure of its precursor, CEA-Industrie, and [[Anne Lauvergeon]] was named CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stock Ownership Profile |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/finance-402/shareholding-structure-of-the-world-leader-in-the-nuclear-industry-and-major-player-in-bioenergies.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009, Siemens sold its remaining shares of Areva NP.&lt;ref name=Parisien&gt;Marc Lomazzi, ''Le Parisien'', 13 August 2007 [http://www.leparisien.fr/economie/nucleaire-les-dessous-de-l-accord-entre-la-france-et-la-libye-13-08-2007-2008285886.php' "Nucléaire: les dessous de l'accord entre la France et la Libye"] {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], the former [[Prime Minister of France]], government announced the privatization of Areva in 2003, but it was postponed several times, the French government opting finally for the privatization of GDF and EDF. At the end of October 2005, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin announced that he had suspended the privatization process.

In 2006, Areva created its Renewable Energies Business Group.&lt;ref name=Renewables&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy, Expected Growth |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/group-689/renewable-energies-expected-growth.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Creusot Forge and Creusot Mécanique merged into the Areva group,&lt;ref name=nei-20170321/&gt;&lt;ref name=areva-creusot&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-2119/creusot-forge-and-creusot-mcanique-manufacturer-of-large-forged-parts-history.html |title=Creusot Forge and Creusot Mécanique: the production of large forged parts - History |publisher=Areva |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though there were quality concerns over Creusot Forge's work.&lt;ref name=nei-20170406&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsasn-warned-about-creusot-forge-over-10-years-ago-5781134 |title=ASN warned about Creusot Forge over 10 years ago |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=6 April 2017 |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Areva indicated work was being done on a new type of [[burner reactor]] type capable of breaking down [[actinides]] created as a product of [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pagnamenta, The Times, 22 March 2010, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/news/areva-develops-new-nuclear-reactors-that-destroy-atomic-waste/story-e6frg90o-1225843555348 Areva develops new nuclear reactors that 'destroy' atomic waste], The Australian&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to financial difficulties in 2016, in 2017 Areva NP merged with and as of January 04, 2018, Areva NP is now known as Framatome.

===Post-[[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] problems===

In December 2011, Areva suspended building work at several sites in France, Africa and the United States, one day after forecasting a €1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) loss. 
Areva halted "capacity extensions" at its [[COGEMA La Hague site|La Hague Reprocessing Plant]], in northern France, at its Melox factory in the southwest, and at two sites attached to its Tricastin power plant in the south. 
Work has also stopped on extensions to uranium mines in Bakouma in the Central African Republic, Trekkopje in Namibia, and Ryst Kuil in South Africa,&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hKI_2Q1_VI8EUXiKo-K7hlVuhFgg?docId=CNG.5611f082b5d1d0d543b2b015f4ad2b41.841 |title=French nuke giant Areva suspends investment in sites |date=14 December 2011 |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused a potential delay in construction until a capital solution is secured for the [[#Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility|Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="us.arevablog.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.arevablog.com/2011/12/13/areva-continues-eagle-rock-commitment/ |title=Areva Continues Eagle Rock Commitment |date=13 December 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areva wrote off most of the $2.5 billion purchase cost of Canadian uranium mining company Uramin, purchased in 2007, after concluding that its uranium ore deposits were of negligible value.&lt;ref name=bl-20150416/&gt;

In September 2014 [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] stated it might downgrade Areva’s debt following weak first-half results, leading to Areva indicating it would cut capital spending and dispose of some assets.&lt;ref name=ft-20141118&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/adc90b3e-6f67-11e4-8d86-00144feabdc0.html |title=EDF in fresh delay for flagship nuclear plant |author=Michael Stothard |newspaper=Financial Times |date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2014, CEO Luc Oursel took a leave of absence for health reasons.&lt;ref name=ft-20141118/&gt; 
He died in December of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landauro|first1=Inti|title=Areva CEO Luc Oursel Dies|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/areva-ceo-luc-oursel-dies-1417678416|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2014 Areva suspended its financial targets for 2015/2016 as a result of delays on its Finnish project ([[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]] Unit 3)  and "lacklustre" nuclear market.&lt;ref name=bbc-20141119&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30114326 |title=Areva shares plunge after it drops financial targets |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result, on 20 November 2014 Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded Areva long-term debt to BB+ and short-term-debt to A-3.&lt;ref name=reuters-20141120&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/markets-factors-europe-idUSL6N0TB0DO20141121 |title=European Factors to Watch-Indexes to edge higher, focus on ECB speeches |publisher=Reuters |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-20141120&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/fastft/239772/areva-cut-junk-sandp |title=Areva cut to junk by S&amp;P |publisher=fastFT |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This led to difficulties for Areva to raise money on the financial market, however according to S&amp;P Areva has a "high cash cushion". 
Some analysts speculate that Areva needs a 1.5-2 billion euro capital increase – at the moment the French government ([[Second Valls Government]]) is unwilling to increase capital for the state-owned company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/28/areva-debt-idUSL6N0TH31X20141128 Areva's options narrow in shadow of debt refinancing] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance sheet 2014 shows a sales revenue of 8.336 bn Euro and a [[consolidated net income]] of -4.834 bn Euro (0,58 Euro loss per 1 Euro sales revenue).&lt;ref&gt;areva.com [http://areva.com/scripts/news/publigen/content/templates/Show.asp?P=10470&amp;L=EN 2014 Annual Results (group)] (4 march 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] further downgraded Areva's [[credit rating]] to BB- after Areva posted a €4.8 billion loss for 2014. 
Areva intends to cut costs to save about €1 billion annually by 2017, and to sell €450 million of assets by 2017.&lt;ref name=reuters-20150306&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/03/06/areva-ratings-idUKL5N0W81MR20150306 |title=UPDATE 1-S&amp;P downgrades Areva debt further into junk status |author=Geert De Clercq |publisher=Reuters |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-20150304&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/business/international/areva-plans-to-cut-costs-while-mastering-difficult-projects.html |title=Areva Plans to Cut Costs While Mastering 'Difficult Projects' |author=David Jolly |newspaper=New York Times |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 EDF valued Areva NP at €2.7 billion ($2.9 billion) and agreed to take a majority stake in Areva NP, following a French government instruction they create a "global strategic partnership".&lt;ref name=nei-20150731&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsedf-to-buy-majority-of-areva-np-4635803 |title=EDF to buy majority of Areva NP |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=31 July 2015 |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Le Creusot Forge records falsification scandal===
In December 2015, operations at Le Creusot Forge were stopped following the discovery of quality assurance problems.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170418&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-ASN-sets-conditions-for-Creusot-Forge-restart-1804175.html |title=ASN sets conditions for Creusot Forge restart |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=18 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nei-20170420&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsfrench-regulator-lists-conditions-for-operation-of-le-creusot-forge-5791213 |title=French regulator lists conditions for operation of Le Creusot Forge |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=20 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a discovery at the [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant]], about 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 have been found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns, likely to continue over the winter high electricity demand period into 2017. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply.&lt;ref name=ft-20161028&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f86a3c6c-9c60-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a |title=French nuclear outages threaten higher UK power bills |author=Andrew Ward |newspaper=Financial Times |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=large-2016&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |title=Irregularities and Anomalies Relating to the Forged Components of Le Creusot Forge |author=John Large |work=Large Associates |publisher=Greenpeace France |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late October 2016, 20 of France's 58 reactors are offline.&lt;ref name=powermag-20161101&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.powermag.com/frances-nuclear-storm-many-power-plants-down-due-to-quality-concerns/?printmode=1 |title=France's Nuclear Storm: Many Power Plants Down Due to Quality Concerns |author=Lee Buchsbaum |newspaper=POWER |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-20161108&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-power-winteroutlook-idUKKBN1332C6 |title=France could face winter power cuts, hit by nuclear dependence |author=Bate Felix, Geert De Clercq |publisher=Reuters |date=8 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steel quality concerns may prevent the regulator giving the life extensions from 40 to 50 years, that had been assumed by energy planners, for many reactors.&lt;ref name=economist-20161203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21711087-electricit-de-france-has-had-shut-down-18-its-58-nuclear-reactors-frances-nuclear-energy |title=France's nuclear-energy champion is in turmoil |newspaper=The Economist |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' characterised the problem as a "decades long coverup of manufacturing problems", with Areva executives acknowledging that Le Creusot had been falsifying documents.&lt;ref name=wsj-20161213&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-at-nuclear-components-supplier-spark-global-reviews-1481625005 |title=Coverup at French Nuclear Supplier Sparks Global Review |author1=Matthew Dalton |author2=Inti Landauro |author3=Rebecca Smith |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 international inspectors at Le Creusot Forge found evidence of recent doctored paperwork, which had not been detected by Areva’s independent quality control checks. The team concluded that they "were not confident that the improvement programmes and associated remedial actions ... were sufficiently resourced, prioritised and integrated in order to bring about sustained improvements in manufacturing performance and nuclear safety culture".&lt;ref name=guardian-20170324&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/24/areva-creusot-nuclear-forge-france-hinkley-point |title=Inspectors find safety irregularities at Creusot nuclear forge in France |first=Adam |last=Vaughan |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire]] (ASN) determined that the safety culture in the plant was not sufficient to produce nuclear components and that the plant did not have sufficiently good equipment for some of its nuclear production, which led to the manufacture of substandard parts and document falsification.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170316&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-safety-creusot/areva-factory-ill-equipped-to-make-nuclear-parts-french-watchdog-idUSL5N1GM2XM |title=Areva factory ill-equipped to make nuclear parts - French watchdog |publisher=Reuters |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 ASN published the requirements for forging to resume at Le Creusot Forge.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170418/&gt;&lt;ref name=nei-20170420/&gt; In August 2017 ASN published a draft decision requiring the examination of Le Creusot Forge manufacturing records of all components during scheduled reactor refuelling outages.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170817&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-EDF-ordered-to-check-component-records-1708174.html |title=EDF ordered to check component records |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=17 August 2017 |accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2018 ASN gave approval for the resumption of the manufacture of forgings at Le Creusot. The 2016 improvement plan was 90% complete and will complete during the first half of 2018. The forge had been out of operation since December 2015. "Irregularities" in records of about 400 of 3854 nuclear components produced since 1965 had been found, and analysis of these deviations were expected to continue until the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180126&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Le-Creusot-to-resume-manufacture-of-forgings-26011801.html |title=Le Creusot to resume manufacture of forgings |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=26 January 2018 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In June 2016 Areva's restructuring plans were made public, including the sale of the majority of its reactor business to EDF in 2017, excluding the [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant|Olkiluoto 3 EPR]] under construction in Finland which will remain with Areva SA.&lt;ref name=wnn-20160615&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Areva-outlines-restructuring-plan-1506164.html |title=Areva outlines restructuring plan |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2017 Areva published figures for 2016 (loss 665 million Euro) and announced some information about the planned restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areva.com/FR/actualites-10923/resultats-annuels-2016.html www.areva.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2017 [[Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited]] (JNFL) and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (MHI) agreed to each take a 5% stake in the restructured Areva nuclear reactor business for €250 million each, dependent on the [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant|Flamanville 3]] [[reactor pressure vessel]] and other large steel forgings passing safety tests.&lt;ref name=nei-20170323&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsinvestment-agreements-on-areva-newco-take-effect-5770314 |title=Investment agreements on Areva NewCo take effect |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=23 March 2017 |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nei-20170321&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurenuclear-cracks-are-beginning-to-show-5768266/ |title=Nuclear cracks are beginning to show |author=Janet Wood, Caroline Peachey |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=21 March 2017 |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some days later, [[Toshiba]]'s nuclear branch ([[Westinghouse Electric Company]]) filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection.

In December 2017, Areva and EDF signed agreements on the transfer of Areva NP's nuclear reactor operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Binding-agreements-signed-for-sale-of-New-NP-2712175.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2018 Areva was renamed '''Orano'''. The name Areva shall continue to be used only relating to the holding company Areva SA, that is holding risks associated with Olkiluoto and the troubled Creusot foundry.

AREVA is developing AdCub, a modular concept for compact power plants targeting small-scale biomass resources that addresses relatively untapped growth opportunities in Europe. The objective is to combine innovative solutions which optimize customer costs for small-scale power plants (between 3 and 6 MW) and reduce construction time. This new biomass plant concept also aims to improve upstream technologies for multi-fuel acceptance and higher availability.&lt;ref name=bioinnovation/&gt;

====Energy storage====
AREVA designs, manufactures and industrializes turnkey energy storage solutions and products to generate electricity with fuel cells and produce hydrogen by electrolysis. AREVA supports ongoing research in the hydrogen field through partnerships with a number of industrial companies and national research organizations including: [[Agence Nationale de la Recherche]] (French National Research Agency), the Horizon Hydrogen Energy (H2E) program, PAN-H (''Plan d’Action National sur l’Hydrogène et les piles à combustible'') and Pôle Capenergies, an innovation cluster dedicated to the development of renewable forms of energy without greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-407/areva-energy-storage.html |title=AREVA Energy Storage |publisher=Areva |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Areva inaugurated a hydrogen storage system called the MYRTE platform near [[Ajaccio]], Corsica (MYRTE is the French acronym for ''Mission Hydrogène Renouvelable pour l’intégration au réseau électrique'').&lt;ref name=MYRTE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/hydrogen-storage-site-for-photovoltaic-power-2012-02-10 |title=Areva unveils hydrogen storage system |publisher=Engineering News |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system aims to establish the feasibility of a storage solution for [[solar energy]] using hydrogen technologies, which would serve as a back-up system to stabilize Corsica’s power grid.&lt;ref name=MYRTE/&gt; In 2014, AREVA’s energy storage and management system, the Greenergy Box, was added to the existing installation, in operation since early 2013. This management system increases grid output from the energy stored in hydrogen to 150&amp;nbsp;kW.

In May 2014, AREVA SMART ENERGIES, through its subsidiary CETH2, and the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), announced the creation of the AREVA H2-Gen joint venture.

==== Finland ====
In December 2003, [[Finland]] became the first country to order a new [[nuclear reactor]] in Western Europe in 15 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finland Rekindles Interest in Nuclear Power |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/12/international/europe/12finland.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – it will become [[Nuclear power in Finland|Finland]]'s fifth reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile Finland |url=http://www.oecd-nea.org/general/profiles/finland.html |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] [[Nuclear Energy Agency|NEA]] |accessdate=28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OLKILUOTO 3 - FINLAND |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-2389/finland--olkiluoto-3.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Areva started construction of the first [[European Pressurized Reactor]] (EPR) in [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant|Olkiluoto]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Finland, Nuclear Renaissance Runs Into Trouble |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/business/energy-environment/29nuke.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor, which is one of the first of the new [[Generation III reactor]]s, was initially expected to begin producing electricity in 2009, but the project has faced delays.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Finnish Nuclear Plant Won’t Open Until 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/business/global/finnish-nuclear-plant-wont-open-until-2016.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Finland’s [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant|Olkiluoto]] contract was issued on a [[turnkey]] basis and in 2004 a contracted fixed price was established as €3200M. Over the years delays have accumulated and costs started to overrun substantially.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

In its 2006 Annual Report, Areva recorded a write-down of €507M associated with the delay. {{As of|2014}} the project is at least seven years behind schedule with a total cost estimate of €8.5 billion ($11.4 billion).&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATE 1-Finnish nuclear plant delayed again as Areva, TVO bicker |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/tvo-olkiluoto-idUKL6N0LX3XQ20140228 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the customer's estimate, the Olkiluoto plant will be finished by 2016.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; Owner TVO had originally contracted to start selling nuclear power at the end of April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/pdf/WorldNuclearIndustryStatusReport2011_%20FINAL.pdf Nuclear Power in a Post-Fukushima World] The world nuclear industry status report 2010–2011 World Watch page 8, 28, 30, 60, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MineArlit1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Open-pit mining|open pit]] [[Uranium mining|uranium mine]] at Arlit, Niger.]]

Areva operates two mines through SOMAÏR and COMINAK situated in [[Arlit]], in northern [[Niger]], and is also developing the Imouraren project situated 80&amp;nbsp;km from Arlit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Report: Areva and Niger's uranium fight  |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/us-niger-areva-specialreport-idUSBREA140AA20140205 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=27 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mines and projects employ more than 7,000 people.

Up until 2007, Areva was the only industrial company able to extract uranium in the country, but under a policy shift by then President [[Mamadou Tandja]], the field was opened to competition and [[China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation|Sino-U]], a Chinese nuclear energy company, was granted uranium concessions.&lt;ref name=shift&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgis|first=Tom|title=Uranium: Coup alters the balance as nations jostle for position|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/93e487c6-74ed-11df-aed7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2c4QZdYNA|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2007, the CEO of Areva-Niger, Dominique Pin, was expelled from Niger (although he was in Paris at the time) on charges of supporting the [[Tuareg rebellion (2007–2009)|Tuareg Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=C2&gt;"Atomes pas très crochus au Niger" in ''Le Canard enchaîné'', 22 August 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;4 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Financial Times'' described the entry of Sino-U in 2007 as a "battle for resources" between China and France and illustrated a competition view held by some that saw "China’s pursuit of Africa’s resources as a direct – and potentially destabilizing – threat to western interests".&lt;ref name=shift /&gt; The country manager for AREVA disagreed with this view, stating in the same article that there were many uranium blocks, sufficient to keep both companies busy.&lt;ref name=shift /&gt;

The population of Niger was exposed to a serious [[famine]] in 2005.  AREVA donated €130,500 from January to June 2005 to the food crisis coordination group of Niger, and €120,000 in July in the form of two planes loaded with food and organized by [[Bernard Kouchner]]'s ''Réunir'' NGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fight Against Famine in 20015 |url= http://niger.areva.com/EN/niger-229/fight-against-famine-in-2005.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group's uranium mining project in Namibia at Trekkopje was put on hold in 2012 due to a decrease in uranium prices following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Areva delays $1 bln Namibia uranium mine |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/areva-namibia-trekkopje-idUSL6E8LBL4C20121011 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Areva delays $1 bln Namibia uranium mine |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/ozabs-areva-namibia-trekkopje-idAFJOE89A02120121011 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areva is currently running a care and maintenance program at the site so that it can be reopened in the future. The program is run at a cost of $10 million per year.&lt;ref name=Namibia&gt;{{cite web|title=Areva Resources Namibia: More than Just Mining |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-595/areva-resources-namibia-training-and-mining-projects.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2013, Areva directly employed about 50 people in Namibia, as well as about 50 suppliers and contractors in the country.&lt;ref name=Namibia/&gt;

Areva Resources Namibia finished a 20 million cubic meter desalination plant in the semi-arid Erongo region of the country in 2010.&lt;ref name=Namibia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Businessweek&gt;{{cite web |title=Areva Namibia-Unit Water Deal to Ensure Supply for Rio, Paladin |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/ozabs-areva-namibia-trekkopje-idAFJOE89A02120121011http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-06-05/areva-namibia-unit-water-deal-to-ensure-supply-for-rio-paladin |publisher=Business Week |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, AREVA announced plans to sign a 10-year deal with state-run utility Namibia Water Corp to maintain water supplies essential to uranium mines in the country.&lt;ref name=Businessweek/&gt;

====Gabon====

Areva has had a presence in Gabon since the 1950s, although there is currently no uranium mining in the country.&lt;ref name=Uranium&gt;{{cite web|title=Uranium Hot Spots: Mauritania, Gabon and Zambia |url=http://uraniuminvestingnews.com/17496/uranium-gabon-mauritania-zambia-africa.html |publisher=Uranium Investing News |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Areva operates in the country under the subsidiary Areva Gabon, established in 2008. Areva Gabon is focused on exploring new mining possibilities at sites around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Areva Gabon: Discovering New Deposits |url=http://www.areva.com/EN/operations-585/areva-gabon-discovering-new-deposits.html |publisher=Areva |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabon has received mineral exploration permits in four areas: Mopia, Andjogo, Lekabi, and N’Goutou.&lt;ref name=Uranium/&gt;

In 2010, Areva launched the Mounana Health Observatory to treat former workers who became ill after working in the COMUF mine, which was shut down in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

==== Libya ====
On 13 August 2007, the French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' alleged that the [[Libya and nuclear technology|Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement]] signed by President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Parisien /&gt;  ''Le Parisien'' cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to the deputy director of international affairs for the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA atomic agency]], which is the main share-holder in Areva.&lt;ref name=Parisien /&gt;  Following allegations that the deal had been related to the [[HIV trial in Libya|release of the Bulgarian nurses]], the [[French Socialist Party]], through the spokesperson [[Jean-Louis Bianco]], declared that this deal was "geopolitically irresponsible".&lt;ref name=Parisien /&gt;  The [[German government]] also denounced the agreement.&lt;ref name=Parisien /&gt;

===Bakouma assault===
On 24 June 2012, an armed group assaulted a uranium plant operated by Areva at [[Bakouma]] in the southeast of the [[Central African Republic]]. A statement by the military described that "a violent clash on Sunday afternoon pitted" Central African troops against "an unidentified group of armed men attempting to launch an assault on the site of mining company Areva".

According to the report the army successfully repelled the attack, but "the enemy did some material damage and pulled back while taking a sizeable quantity mainly of food with them." The Areva group issued no immediate statement regarding the attack. Central African military sources believe that the attack was organized by members of the [[Chad|Chadian]] rebel group [[Popular Front for Recovery]] (FPR) led by 'General' Baba Ladde, which has been active in the region since 2008. The army says it's conducting further operations to neutralize the remaining armed rebels in the region of Bakouma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2012/06/25/gunmen-attack-french-uranium-plant|title=Gunmen Attack French Uranium Plant|date=25 June 2012|work=timeslive.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News24 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=CAR gunmen attack French uranium plant | website=News24 | date=2012-06-25 | url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/CAR-gunmen-attack-French-uranium-plant-20120625 | access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuareg people===
In January 2014, [[Al Jazeera]] produced ''[[Orphans of the Sahara]]'', three-part series on the  [[Tuareg people]] of the Sahara desert, in which claims were brought to light that Areva mining and consequent radiations are causing diseases and deaths among their people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/Orphans-of-the-Sahara/|title=Orphans of the Sahara: Exile|date=23 January 2014|author=Orphans of the Sahara channel|work=aljazeera.com|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Technical|date=March 2015}}

In [[physics]], a '''plasmon''' is a [[quantum]] of [[plasma oscillation]]. Just as [[light]] (an optical oscillation) consists of [[photons]], the plasma oscillation consists of plasmons. The plasmon can be considered as a [[quasiparticle]] since it arises from the quantization of plasma oscillations, just like [[phonon]]s are quantizations of mechanical vibrations. Thus, plasmons are collective (a discrete number) oscillations of the [[Free electron model|free electron gas]] density. For example, at optical frequencies, plasmons can [[Coupling (physics)|couple]] with a [[photon]] to create another quasiparticle called a plasmon [[polariton]].

== Derivation ==
The plasmon was initially proposed in 1952 by [[David Pines]] and [[David Bohm]]&lt;ref&gt;David Pines, David Bohm: ''A Collective Description of Electron Interactions: II. Collective vs Individual Particle Aspects of the Interactions'', Phys. Rev. 85, 338, 15 January 1952.

Since plasmons are the quantization of classical plasma oscillations, most of their properties can be derived directly from [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref name="electro"&gt;

== Explanation ==

Plasmons can be described in the classical picture as an [[oscillation]] of electron density with respect to the fixed positive [[ion]]s in a [[metal]].  To visualize a plasma oscillation, imagine a cube of metal placed in an external [[electric field]] pointing to the right. [[Electron]]s will move to the left side (uncovering positive ions on the right side) until they cancel the field inside the metal. If the electric field is removed, the electrons move to the right, repelled by each other and attracted to the positive ions left bare on the right side.  They oscillate back and forth at the [[plasma frequency]] until the [[energy]] is lost in some kind of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[damping]]. Plasmons are a [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of this kind of oscillation.

===Role===
Plasmons play a large role in the [[optical]] properties of [[metal]]s and semiconductors. [[Light]] of frequencies below the [[plasma frequency]] is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] by a material because the electrons in the material [[Electric field screening|screen]] the [[electric field]] of the light. Light of frequencies above the plasma frequency is transmitted by a material because the electrons in the material cannot respond fast enough to screen it. In most metals, the plasma frequency is in the [[ultraviolet]], making them shiny (reflective) in the visible range. Some metals, such as [[copper]]&lt;ref&gt;

The plasmon energy can often be estimated in the [[free electron model]] as

:[[radiant energy|&lt;math&gt;E_{p} = &lt;/math&gt;]][[reduced Planck constant|&lt;math&gt; \hbar &lt;/math&gt;]][[Plasma frequency|&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n e^{2}}{m\epsilon_0}} = &lt;/math&gt;]][[reduced Planck constant|&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;]][[plasmon frequency|&lt;math&gt;\omega_{p},&lt;/math&gt;]]

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[conduction electron]] density, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron mass]], &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; the [[permittivity of free space]], &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; the [[reduced Planck constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\omega_{p}&lt;/math&gt; the [[plasmon frequency]].

== Surface plasmons ==
{{Main article|Surface plasmon}}
[[Surface plasmon]]s are those plasmons that are confined to surfaces and that interact strongly with light resulting in a [[polariton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |date=2013|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073|volume=176|pages=1128–1133|display-authors=4|last1=Zeng|first1=Shuwen|last2=Yu|first2=Xia|last3=Law|first3=Wing-Cheung|last4=Zhang|first4=Yating|last5=Hu|first5=Rui|last6=Dinh|first6=Xuan-Quyen|last7=Ho|first7=Ho-Pui|last8=Yong|first8=Ken-Tye |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur at the interface of a material exhibiting positive real part of their relative permittivity, i.e. [[dielectric constant]], (e.g. vacuum, air, glass and other dielectrics) and a material whose real part of permittivity is negative at the given frequency of light, typically a metal or heavily doped semiconductors. In addition to opposite sign of the real part of the permittivity, the magnitude of the real part of the permittivity in the negative permittivity region should typically be larger than the magnitude of the permittivity in the positive permittivity region, otherwise the light is not bound to the surface (i.e. the surface plasmons do not exist) as shown in the famous book by Raether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Surface Plasmons on Smooth and Rough Surfaces and on Gratings|last = Raether|first = Heinz|publisher = Springer|year = 1988|isbn = 978-3540173632|location = |pages = 119}}&lt;/ref&gt; At visible wavelengths of light, e.g. 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength provided by a He-Ne laser, interfaces supporting surface plasmons are often formed by metals like silver or gold (negative real part permittivity) in contact with dielectrics such as air or silicon dioxide. The particular choice of materials can have a drastic effect on the degree of light confinement and propagation distance due to losses. Surface plasmons can also exist on interfaces other than flat surfaces, such as particles, or rectangular strips, v-grooves, cylinders, and other structures. Many structures have been investigated due to the capability of surface plasmons to confine light below the diffraction limit of light.

Surface plasmons can play a role in [[surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]] and in explaining anomalies in diffraction from metal [[diffraction grating|gratings]] ([[Robert W. Wood|Wood's]] anomaly), among other things. [[Surface plasmon resonance]] is used by [[biochemist]]s to study the mechanisms and kinetics of ligands binding to receptors (i.e. a substrate binding to an [[enzyme]]). [[Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance]] can be used not only to measure molecular interactions, but also nanolayer properties or structural changes in the adsorbed molecules, polymer layers or graphene, for instance.

Surface plasmons may also be observed in the X-ray emission spectra of metals. A dispersion relation for surface plasmons in the X-ray emission spectra of metals has been derived (Harsh and Agarwal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0378-4363(88)90078-2 | volume=150 | issue=3 | title=Surface plasmon dispersion relation in the X-ray emission spectra of a semi-infinite rectangular metal bounded by a plane | journal=Physica B+C | pages=378–384|bibcode = 1988PhyBC.150..378H | last1=Harsh | first1=O.

[[File:GothicRayonnantRose003.jpg|thumb|[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[stained glass]] [[rose window]] of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. The colors were achieved by [[colloid]]s of gold nano-particles.]]
More recently surface plasmons have been used to control colors of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4443854.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=LEDs work like butterflies' wings | date=November 18, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible since controlling the particle's shape and size determines the types of surface plasmons that can couple to it and propagate across it. This in turn controls the interaction of light with the surface. These effects are illustrated by the historic [[stained glass]] which adorn medieval cathedrals. In this case, the color is given by metal nanoparticles of a fixed size which interact with the optical field to give the glass its vibrant color. In modern science, these effects have been engineered for both visible light and [[microwave radiation]]. Much research goes on first in the microwave range because at this wavelength material surfaces can be produced mechanically as the patterns tend to be of the order a few centimeters.  To produce optical range surface plasmon effects involves producing surfaces which have features &lt;400&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]]. This is much more difficult and has only recently become possible to do in any reliable or available way.

Recently, graphene has also been shown to accommodate surface plasmons, observed via near field infrared optical microscopy techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jianing Chen, Michela Badioli, Pablo Alonso-González, Sukosin Thongrattanasiri, Florian Huth, Johann Osmond, Marko Spasenović, Alba Centeno, Amaia Pesquera, Philippe Godignon, Amaia Zurutuza Elorza, Nicolas Camara, F.

== Possible applications ==
The position and intensity of plasmon absorption and emission peaks are affected by molecular [[adsorption]], which can be used in [[molecular sensor]]s. For example, a fully operational device detecting [[casein]] in milk has been prototyped, based on detecting a change in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of a gold layer.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localized surface plasmons of metal nanoparticles can be used for sensing different types of molecules, proteins, etc.

Plasmons are being considered as a means of transmitting information on [[Microprocessor|computer chips]], since plasmons can support much higher frequencies (into the 100&amp;nbsp;[[Terahertz (unit)|THz]] range, whereas conventional wires become very lossy in the tens of [[GHz]]). However, for plasmon-based electronics to be practical, a plasmon-based amplifier analogous to the [[transistor]], called a [[plasmonstor]], needs to be created.&lt;ref&gt;

Plasmons have also been [[Plasmonic nanolithography|proposed]] as a means of high-resolution [[lithography]] and microscopy due to their extremely small wavelengths; both of these applications have seen successful demonstrations in the lab environment.

Finally, surface plasmons have the unique capacity to confine light to very small dimensions, which could enable many new applications.

Surface plasmons are very sensitive to the properties of the materials on which they propagate. This has led to their use to measure the thickness of monolayers on [[colloid]] films, such as screening and quantifying [[protein]] binding events. Companies such as [[Biacore]] have commercialized instruments that operate on these principles.  Optical surface plasmons are being investigated with a view to improve makeup by [[L'Oréal]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2009, a Korean research team found a way to greatly improve [[organic light-emitting diode]] efficiency with the use of plasmons.&lt;ref&gt;

A group of European researchers led by [[IMEC]] has begun work to improve [[solar cell]] efficiencies and costs through incorporation of metallic nanostructures (using plasmonic effects) that can enhance absorption of light into different types of solar cells: crystalline silicon (c-Si), high-performance III-V, organic, and dye-sensitized.

These droplets are characterized internally by very high [[residual stress]]es, which give rise to counter-intuitive properties, such as the ability to withstand a blow from a hammer or a bullet on the bulbous end without breaking, while exhibiting explosive disintegration if the tail end is even slightly damaged. In nature, similar structures are produced under certain conditions in volcanic [[lava]] and are known as [[Pele's tears]].

The drops are named after [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], who brought them to England in 1660, although they were reportedly being produced in the Netherlands earlier in the 17th century and had probably been known to glassmakers for much longer. They were studied as scientific curiosities by the [[Royal Society]] and the unravelling of the principles of their unusual properties probably led to the development of the process for the production of toughened glass, patented in 1874. Research carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries shed further light on the reasons for the drops' contradictory properties.

== Description ==
[[File:Micrographia.gif|thumb|Robert Hooke's Micrographia]]
Prince Rupert's drops are produced by dropping molten glass drops into cold water. The water rapidly cools and solidifies the glass from the outside inward. This thermal [[quenching]] may be described using a simplified model of a rapidly cooled sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narayanaswamy|first=O. S.|last2=Gardon|first2=Robert|date=1998|title=Tempering glass spheres and related topics|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2265344|journal=Glass Science and Technology|volume=71|pages=120–128|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728082616/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2265344|archivedate=2017-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Rupert's drops have remained a scientific curiosity for nearly 400 years due to two unusual mechanical properties &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &amp;mdash; when the tail is snipped, the drop disintegrates explosively into powder, whereas the bulbous head can withstand compressive forces of up to {{convert|15000|N|lbf}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The explosive disintegration arises due to multiple crack bifurcation events when the tail is cut &amp;mdash; a single crack is accelerated in the tensile residual stress field in the center of the tail and bifurcates after it reaches a critical velocity of {{convert|1450-1900|m/s|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandrasekar|first=S|last2=Chaudhri|first2=M.

This is perhaps why this curious property of the drops remained unexplained for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science In The Making|last=Davis|first=E. A. Davis|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1999|isbn=0 7484 07677|location=Great Britain|pages=1994 B70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second unusual property of the drops, namely the strength of the heads, is a direct consequence of large compressive residual stresses—up to {{convert|700|MPa|psi}}—that exist in the vicinity of the head's outer surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This stress distribution is measured by using glass's natural property of [[Birefringence#Stress-induced birefringence|stress-induced birefringence]] and by employing techniques of 3D [[photoelasticity]]. The high fracture toughness due to residual compressive stresses makes Prince Rupert's drops one of the earliest examples of toughened glass.

==History==
A scholarly account of the early history of Prince Rupert’s drops is given in the ''Notes and Records'' of the [[Royal Society]] of London. Most of the early scientific study of the drops was performed at the Royal Society.&lt;ref name="Brodsley"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Frank|first2=Charles|last3=Steeds|first3=John W.|date=October 1986|title=Prince Rupert's Drops|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume=41|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1986.0001|jstor=531493|first1=Laurel|last1=Brodsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drops are reliably reported to have been made in [[Mecklenburg]] in North Germany,  as early as 1625.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EZ8EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=prince+rupert%27s+drops&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjymszlk6LRAhUqAsAKHXX7BdYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prince%20rupert%27s%20drops&amp;f=false |last=Beckmann |first=Johann |publication-date=1846 |pages=243–244 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102171941/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EZ8EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=prince+rupert%27s+drops&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjymszlk6LRAhUqAsAKHXX7BdYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prince%20rupert%27s%20drops&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been claimed that they were invented in the Netherlands (although it has been suggested that they had been known about by glassmakers since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]),&lt;ref name="Brodsley"/&gt; hence common names for them in the 17th century were ''lacrymae Borussicae'' (Prussian tears) or ''lacrymae Batavicae'' (Dutch tears).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S1lFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=lacrymae+Batavicae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY7P3qmqLRAhUsI8AKHa_dCj8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lacrymae%20Batavicae&amp;f=false |title=The Philosophical Transactions 1743-50 |page=560 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102171809/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S1lFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA560&amp;dq=lacrymae+Batavicae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY7P3qmqLRAhUsI8AKHa_dCj8Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lacrymae%20Batavicae&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secret of how to make them remained in the Mecklenburg area for some time, although the drops were disseminated across Europe from there, for sale as toys or curiosities.

The Dutch scientist [[Constantijn Huygens]] asked [[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle]] to investigate the properties of the drops; her opinion after carrying out experiments was that a small amount of volatile liquid was trapped inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064 | title=A Point of View: Whose science is it anyway? | publisher=BBC | date=11 October 2013 | accessdate=13 October 2013 | author=Jardine, Lisa | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011184310/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064 | archivedate=11 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] did not discover the drops, he played a role in their history by bringing them to Britain in 1660. He gave them to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], who in turn delivered them in 1661 to the Royal Society (which had been created the previous year) for scientific study. Several early publications from the Royal Society give accounts of the drops and describe experiments performed.&lt;ref&gt;See also:  Neri, Antonio with Christopher Merret, trans., ''The art of glass wherein are shown the wayes to make and colour glass, pastes, enamels, lakes, and other curiosities / written in Italian by Antonio Neri ; and translated into English, with some observations on the author ; whereunto is added an account of the glass drops made by the Royal Society, meeting at Gresham College'' (London, England:  Printed by A.W. for Octavian Pulleyn, 1662), An Account of the Glass Drops, [https://archive.org/stream/TheArtOfGlassWhereinAreShownTheWayesToMakeAndColourGlass/neri-a-art-1662-RTL014704-LowRes#page/n383/mode/2up pp. 353–362.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these publications was ''Micrographia'' of 1665 by [[Robert Hooke]], who later would discover [[Hooke’s Law]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Robert Hooke, ''Micrographia or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies made by Magnifying Glasses with Observation and Inquiries thereupon'' (London, 1665), [https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000817897#page/32/mode/2up "Observation vii. of some Phaenomena of Glass Drops,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107140342/https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000817897 |date=2016-11-07 }} pp. 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; His publication laid out correctly most of what can be said about Prince Rupert’s drops without a fuller understanding than existed at the time, of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] (to which Hooke himself later contributed) and of the failure of brittle materials from the propagation of cracks.  A fuller understanding of [[crack propagation]] had to wait until the work of [[Alan Arnold Griffith|A. A. Griffith]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

[[File:Prince Rupert's Drops- 400 Year Old Mystery Revealed.webm|thumb|left|Chandrasekar explaining the physics of Prince Rupert's drops]]
In 1994, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, an engineering professor at [[Purdue University]], and  Munawar Chaudhri, head of the materials group at the [[University of Cambridge]], used high-speed framing photography to observe the drop-shattering process and concluded that while the surface of the drops experiences highly compressive stresses, the inside experience high tension forces, creating a state of unequal equilibrium which can easily be disturbed by breaking the tail. However, this left the question of how the stresses are distributed throughout a Prince Rupert's drop.

In a further study published in 2017, the team collaborated with Hillar Aben, a professor at [[Tallinn University of Technology]] in Estonia using a [[Polariscope|transmission polariscope]] to measure the optical retardation of light from a red [[LED]] as it travelled through the glass drop, and used the data to construct the stress distribution throughout the drop. This showed that the heads of the drops have a much higher surface compressive stress than previously thought at up to {{convert|700|MPa|psi}}, but that this surface compressive layer is also thin, only about 10% of the diameter of the head of a drop. This gives the surface a high fracture strength which means that it is necessary to create a crack that enters the interior tension zone in order to break the droplet. As cracks on the surface tend to grow parallel to the surface, they cannot enter the tension zone but a disturbance in the tail allows cracks to enter the tension zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-05-scientists-year-old-mystery-prince-rupert.html|title=Scientists solve 400-year-old mystery of Prince Rupert's drops|last=Zyga|first=Lisa|date=9 May 2017|work=phys.org|publisher=Science X network|accessdate=16 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516222447/https://phys.org/news/2017-05-scientists-year-old-mystery-prince-rupert.html|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==

The process for the production of toughened glass by quenching was probably inspired by the study of the drops, as it was patented in England by Parisian Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie, in 1874, just one year after V. De Luynes had published accounts of his experiments with them.&lt;ref name="Brodsley"/&gt;
 
It has been known since at least the 19th century that formations similar to Prince Rupert's drops are produced under certain conditions in volcanic [[lava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodrich|first=Joseph|date=1829|title=Real and supposed effect of igneous action|journal=The American Journal of Science and Arts|volume=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA349|page=349|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103141011/https://books.google.com/books?id=IjwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA349|archivedate=3 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently researchers at the [[University of Bristol]] and the [[University of Iceland]] have studied the glass particles produced by explosive fragmentation of Prince Rupert's drops in the laboratory to better understand [[magma]] fragmentation and [[volcanic ash|ash]] formation driven by stored thermal stresses in active volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unige.ch/sciences/terre/mineral/CERG/Workshop2/Program/P-25_Cashman.pdf |title=Breaking magma: Controls on magma fragmentation and ash formation |author1=Cashman, Katharine |authorlink1=Katharine Cashman |author2=Nicholson, Emma |author3=Rust, Alison |author4=Gislason, Sigurdur |accessdate=27 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083529/http://www.unige.ch/sciences/terre/mineral/CERG/Workshop2/Program/P-25_Cashman.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
Because of their use as a party piece, Prince Rupert’s drops became widely known in the late 17th century—far more than today. It can be seen that educated people (or those in "society") were expected to be familiar with them, from their use in the literature of the day. [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]] used them as a [[metaphor]] in his poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' in 1663,&lt;ref&gt;Butler, S., ''Hudibras'' (Zachary Grey edition, London, 1799), vol. 1, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433074831607;view=1up;seq=478 p. 390, lines 385–389] ; and see footnote p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wilders edition (Oxford University Press, 1967){{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pepys]] refers to them in his diary.&lt;ref&gt;Pepys, S.: “The Diary” (ed. Robert Latham &amp; William Matthews), vol. III (Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1970-76), 13 January 1662, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drops were immortalized in a verse of the anonymous ''[[s:Ballad of Gresham College|Ballad of Gresham College]]'' (1663):
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And that which makes their Fame ring louder,
With much adoe they shew'd the King
To make glasse Buttons turn to powder,
If off the[m] their tayles you doe but wring.
How this was donne by soe small Force
Did cost the Colledg a Month's discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dorothy |last=Stimson |date=July 1932 |title='Ballad of Gresham Colledge' |journal=Isis |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=103–17 |jstor=224481 |doi=10.1086/346689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Diarist [[George Templeton Strong]] wrote (volume 4, p.122) of a hazardous sudden breaking up of pedestrian-bearing ice in New York City's East River during the winter of 1867 that "The ice flashed into fragments all at once like a Prince Rupert's drop."

[[Sigmund Freud]], discussing the dissolution of military groups in ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921), notes the panic that results from the loss of the leader: "The group vanishes in dust, like a Prince Rupert's drop when its tail is broken off."

In the 1940 detective novel ''There Came Both Mist and Snow'' by Michael Innes ([[J.I.M. Stewart]]), a character incorrectly refers to them as "Verona drops"; the error is corrected towards the end of the novel by the detective [[Sir John Appleby]].

In his 1943 novella ''[[Conjure Wife]]'', [[Fritz Leiber]] uses Prince Rupert drops as a metaphor for the volatility of several characters' personalities. These small-town college faculty people seem to be placid and impervious, but "explode" at a mere "flick of the filament".

[[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] devotes a chapter to the drops in his 1988 novel ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]''.

[[Alfred Jarry]]'s novel ''[[Supermale (novel)|Supermale]]'' makes reference to the drops in an analogy for the molten glass drops falling from a failed device meant to pass eleven thousand volts of electricity through the supermale's body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">A '''soft gamma repeater''' ('''SGR''') is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] object which emits large bursts of [[gamma-ray]]s and [[X-ray]]s at irregular intervals. It is conjectured that they are a type of [[magnetar]] or, alternatively, [[neutron star]]s with fossil disks around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Bing|last2=Xu|first2=R.X.|last3=Qiao|first3=G.J.|title=Nature and Nurture: a Model for Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2000|volume=545|issue=2|pages=127–129|bibcode=2000ApJ...545L.127Z|doi=10.1086/317889|arxiv = astro-ph/0010225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a number of receivers at different locations in the [[Solar System]]&lt;ref name=NASA1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast20may98_1.htm | title="Magnetar" discovery solves 19-year-old mystery | date=May 20, 1998 | publisher=[[NASA]] | last=Dooling | first=Dave | accessdate=March 2, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311072756/http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast20may98_1.htm | archivedate=March 11, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the burst at slightly different times, its direction could be determined, and it was shown to originate from near a [[supernova remnant]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref name=utex/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA1/&gt;

Over time it became clear that this was not a normal gamma-ray burst. The [[photon]]s were less energetic in the soft gamma-ray and hard X-ray range, and repeated bursts came from the same region.

Astronomer [[Chryssa Kouveliotou]] of the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center decided to test the theory that soft gamma repeaters were magnetars.&lt;ref name=utex/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA1/&gt; According to the theory, the bursts would cause the object to slow down its rotation. In 1998,&lt;ref name=utex/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA1/&gt; she made careful comparisons of the periodicity of soft gamma repeater [[SGR 1806-20]]. The period had increased by 0.008 seconds since 1993, and she calculated that this would be explained by a magnetar with a [[magnetic field|magnetic-field]] strength of 8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (8&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; [[gauss (unit)|gauss]]). This was enough to convince the international astronomical community that soft gamma repeaters are indeed magnetars.

An unusually spectacular soft gamma repeater burst was [[SGR 1900+14]] observed on August 27, 1998. Despite the large distance to this SGR, estimated at 20,000 light years, the burst had large effects on the Earth's atmosphere. The atoms in the [[ionosphere]], which are usually ionized by the Sun's radiation by day and recombine to neutral atoms by night, were ionized at nighttime at levels not much lower than the normal daytime level. The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer ([[RXTE]]), an [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] [[satellite]], received its strongest signal from this burst at this time, even though it was directed at a different part of the sky, and should normally have been shielded from the radiation.

{{See also|AC module}}
A '''solar micro-inverter''', or simply '''microinverter''', is a plug-and-play device used in [[photovoltaics]], that converts [[direct current]] (DC) generated by a single [[solar module]] to [[alternating current]] (AC). Microinverters contrast with conventional string and central [[solar inverter]]s, in which a single inverter is connected to multiple solar panels. The output from several microinverters can be combined and often fed to the [[electrical grid]].

Microinverters have several advantages over conventional inverters. The main advantage is that they electrically isolate the panels from each other, so small amounts of [[Photovoltaic system#Shading and dirt|shading, debris or snow lines]] on any one solar module, or even a complete module failure, does not disproportionately reduce the output of the entire array. Each microinverter harvests optimum power by performing [[maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) for its connected module.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2011/10/where-microinverter-and-panel-manufacturer-meet-up/: Where Microinverter and Panel Manufacturer Meet Up] Zipp, Kathleen “Solar Power World”, US, 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Simplicity in system design, lower amperage wires, simplified stock management, and added safety are other factors introduced with the microinverter solution.

The primary disadvantages of a microinverter include a higher initial equipment [[cost per watt|cost per peak watt]] than the equivalent power of a central inverter since each inverter needs to be installed adjacent to a panel (usually on a roof). This also makes them harder to maintain and more costly to remove and replace. Some manufacturers have addressed these issues with panels with built-in microinverters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/market-and-technology-competition-increases-as-solar-inverter-demand-peaks Market and Technology Competition Increases as Solar Inverter Demand Peaks] Greentech Media Staff from GTM Research. ''[[Greentech Media]]'', USrs, 26 May 2009. Retrieved on 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A microinverter has often a longer lifespan than a central inverter, which will need replacement during the lifespan of the solar panels. Therefore the financial disadvantage at first may become an advantage on the long term.

A type of technology similar to a microinverter is a [[power optimizer]] which also does panel-level maximum power point tracking, but does not convert to AC per module.

== Description ==

=== String inverter ===

{{main|Solar inverter}}

Solar panels produce [[direct current]] at a voltage that depends on module design and lighting conditions. Modern modules using 6-inch cells typically contain 60 cells and produce a nominal 24-30 V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backwoodssolar.com/catalog/Spec_Sheets/SolarWorld_245_Spec.pdf SolarWorld's SW 245] is a typical modern module, using 6" cells in a 6 by 10 arrangement and a &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt; of 30.8&amp;nbsp;V&lt;/ref&gt; (so inverters are ready for 24-50 V).

For conversion into AC, panels may be connected in series to produce an array that is effectively a single large panel with a nominal rating of 300 to 600 VDC.{{efn|Since 2011 an increasing number of panels and string inverters are rated to 1000 V instead of the older 600 V standard. This allows longer strings to be created, lowering system cost by avoiding the need for additional "combiners". This standard is not universal, but is being rapidly adopted {{asof|2014}}}} The power then runs to an inverter, which converts it into standard AC voltage, typically 230 VAC / 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 240 VAC / 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sma-america.com/en_US/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-boy/sunny-boy-3000-us-3800-us-4000-us.html SMA's SunnyBoy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408045414/http://www.sma-america.com/en_US/products/grid-tied-inverters/sunny-boy/sunny-boy-3000-us-3800-us-4000-us.html |date=8 April 2011 }} series is available in US and European versions, and the recommended input range is 500 to 600&amp;nbsp;VDC.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main problem with the "string inverter" approach is the string of panels acts as if it were a single larger panel with a max current rating equivalent to the poorest performer in the string. For example, if one panel in a string has 5% higher resistance due to a minor manufacturing defect, the entire string suffers a 5% performance loss. This situation is dynamic. If a panel is shaded its output drops dramatically, affecting the output of the string, even if the other panels are not shaded. Even slight changes in orientation can cause output loss in this fashion. In the industry, this is known as the "Christmas-lights effect", referring to the way an entire string of series-strung Christmas tree lights will fail if a single bulb fails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enphase.com/explore/enphase-technology/productive/ "Productive"], Enphase&lt;/ref&gt; However, this effect is not entirely accurate and ignores the complex interaction between modern string inverter maximum power point tracking and even module bypass [[diode]]s. Shade studies by major microinverter and DC optimizer companies show small yearly gains in light, medium and heavy shaded conditions- 2%, 5% and 8% respectively- over an older string inverter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solaredge.com/files/pdfs/performance_of_pv_topologies_under_shaded_conditions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the efficiency of a panel's output is strongly affected by the load the inverter places on it. To maximize production, inverters use a technique called [[maximum power point tracking]] to ensure optimal energy harvest by adjusting the applied load. However, the same issues that cause output to vary from panel to panel, affect the proper load that the MPPT system should apply. If a single panel operates at a different point, a string inverter can only see the overall change, and moves the MPPT point to match. This results in not just losses from the shadowed panel, but the other panels too. Shading of as little as 9% of the surface of an array can, in some circumstances, reduce system-wide power as much as 54%.&lt;ref&gt;Muenster, R. [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/02/shade-happens-54551  2009-02-02 “Shade Happens”] Renewable Energy World.com. Retrieved on 2009-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eiqenergy.com/parallel_solar/increase_power.php "Increase Power Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516132706/http://eiqenergy.com/parallel_solar/increase_power.php |date=16 May 2011 }}, eIQ Energy&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated above, these yearly yield losses are relatively small and newer technologies allow some string inverters to significantly reduce the effects of partial shading.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sma.de/en/partners/knowledgebase/optitrac-global-peak.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue, though minor, is that string inverters are available in a limited selection of power ratings. This means that a given array normally up-sizes the inverter to the next-largest model over the rating of the panel array. For instance, a 10-panel array of 2300&amp;nbsp;W might have to use a 2500 or even 3000&amp;nbsp;W inverter, paying for conversion capability it cannot use. This same issue makes it difficult to change array size over time, adding power when funds are available (modularity). If the customer originally purchased a 2500&amp;nbsp;W inverter for their 2300&amp;nbsp;W of panels, they cannot add even a single panel without over-driving the inverter. However, this over sizing is considered common practice in today's industry (sometimes as high as 20% over inverter nameplate rating) to account for module degradation, higher performance during winter months or to achieve higher sell back to the utility.

Other challenges associated with centralized inverters include the space required to locate the device, as well as heat dissipation requirements. Large central inverters are typically actively cooled. Cooling fans  make noise, so location of the inverter relative to offices and occupied areas must be considered. And because cooling fans have moving parts, dirt, dust, and moisture can negatively affect their performance over time. String inverters are quieter but might produce a humming noise in late afternoon when inverter power is low.

=== Microinverter ===
Microinverters are small inverters rated to handle the output of a single panel. Modern grid-tie panels are normally rated between 225 and 275W, but rarely produce this in practice, so microinverters are typically rated between 190 and 220&amp;nbsp;W (someones, 100W). Because it is operated at this lower power point, many design issues inherent to larger designs simply go away; the need for a large [[transformer]] is generally eliminated, large [[electrolytic capacitor]]s can be replaced by more reliable thin-film capacitors, and cooling loads are reduced so no fans are needed. Mean time between failures (MTBF) are quoted in hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=M190&gt;[http://www.enphaseenergy.com/downloads/Enphase_M190_Datasheet.pdf "Enphase Microinverter M190"], Enphase Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

More importantly, a microinverter attached to a single panel allows it to isolate and tune the output of that panel. For example, in the same 10-panel array used as an example above, with microinverters any panel that is under-performing has no effect on panels around it. In that case, the array as a whole produces as much as 5% more power than it would with a string inverter. When shadowing is factored in, if present, these gains can become considerable, with manufacturers generally claiming 5% better output at a minimum, and up to 25% better in some cases.&lt;ref name=M190/&gt; Furthermore, a single model can be used with a wide variety of panels, new panels can be added to an array at any time, and do not have to have the same rating as existing panels.

Sometimes, as much as two solar panels are attached to the same microinverters (duo microinverter). The power that inputs  the microinverter is then  ≥600W and 24 V (i.e. as said, two 12 V solar panel can be tied together). Microinverter then converts power provided by solar panel(s) into standard AC voltage, typically 230 VAC / 50 Hz or 240 VAC / 60 Hz. The typical size of this microinverter is: 22x16.4x5.2cm / 8.66x6.46x2.05".

As said, microinverters produce grid-matching power directly at the back of the panel (i.e. 220V). Arrays of panels are connected in parallel to each other, and then to the grid. This has the major advantage that a single failing panel or inverter cannot take the entire string offline. Combined with the lower power and heat loads, and improved MTBF, some suggest that overall array reliability of a microinverter-based system is significantly greater than a string inverter-based one. This assertion is supported by longer warranties, typically 15 to 25 years, compared with 5 or 10 year warranties that are more typical for string inverters. Additionally, when faults occur, they are identifiable to a single point, as opposed to an entire string. This not only makes fault isolation easier, but unmasks minor problems that might not otherwise become visible – a single under-performing panel may not affect a long string's output enough to be noticed.

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantage of the microinverter concept has, until recently, been cost. Because each microinverter has to duplicate much of the complexity of a string inverter but spread that out over a smaller power rating, costs on a per-watt basis are greater. This offsets any advantage in terms of simplification of individual components. As of October 2010, a central inverter costs approximately $0.40 per watt, whereas a microinverter costs approximately $0.52 per watt.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Kerry Dolan, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/1108/technology-enphase-energy-solar-power-rooftop-revolution.html "Enphase's Rooftop Solar Revolution"], ''Forbes'', 8 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Like string inverters, economic considerations force manufacturers to limit the number of models they produce. Most produce a single model that may be over or undersize when matched with a specific panel.

In many cases the packaging can have a significant effect on price. With a central inverter you may have only one set of panel connections for dozens of panels, a single AC output, and one box. With microinverters, each one has to have its own set of inputs and outputs, in its own box. Because that box is on the roof, it has to be sealed and weatherproofed. This can represent a significant portion of the overall price-per-watt.

To further reduce costs, some models control two or three panels from a single box, reducing the packaging and associated costs. Some systems simply place two entire micros in a single box, while others duplicate only the MPPT section of the system and use a single DC-to-AC stage for further cost reductions. Some have suggested that this approach will make microinverters comparable in cost with those using string inverters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/green-light/post/solarbridge-and-pv-microinverter-reliability SolarBridge and PV Microinverter Reliability]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Wesoff, Eric.''[[Greentech Media]]'', US, 2 June 2011.

Ekoleden. Retrieved on 2012-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; model selections to match PV module output more closely, cost is less of an obstacle so microinverters may now spread more widely.

Microinverters have become common where array sizes are small and maximizing performance from every panel is a concern. In these cases, differential in price-per-watt is minimized due to the small number of panels, and has little effect on overall system cost. The improvement in energy harvest given a fixed size array can offset this difference in cost. For this reason, microinverters have been most successful in the residential market, where limited space for panels constrains array size, and shading from nearby trees or other objects is often an issue. Microinverter manufacturers list many installations, some as small as a single panel and the majority under 50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/all_public_systems "All systems"], the very first entry on 25-March-2011 was a single-panel system&lt;/ref&gt;

An often overlooked disadvantage of micro inverters is the future operation and maintenance costs associated with them. While the technology has improved over the years the fact remains that the devices will eventually either fail or wear out. The installer must balance these replacement costs (around $400 per truck roll), increased safety risks to personnel, equipment and module racking against the profit margins for the installation. For homeowners, the eventual wear out or premature device failures will introduce potential damage to the roof tiles or shingles, property damage and other nuisances.

=== Advantages ===
While microinverters generally have a lower efficiency than string inverters, the overall efficiency is increased due to the fact that every inverter / panel unit acts independently. In a string configuration, when a panel on a string is shaded, the output of the entire string of panels is reduced to the output of the lowest producing panel. This is not the case with micro inverters.

A further advantage is found in the panel output quality. The rated output of any two panels in the same production run can vary by as much as 10% or more. This is mitigated with a string configuration but not so in a microinverter configuration. The result is maximum power harvesting from a microinverter array.

Monitoring and maintenance is also easier as many microinverter producers provide apps or websites to monitor the power output of their units. In many cases, these are proprietary; however this is not always the case. Following the demise of Enecsys, and the subsequent closure of their site; a number of private sites such as Enecsys-Monitoring &lt;ref&gt;[http://enecsys-monitoring.com "Enecsys-Monitoring"]&lt;/ref&gt; sprung up to enable owners to continue to monitor their systems.

===Three-phase microinverters===
Efficient conversion of DC power to AC requires the inverter to store energy from the panel while the grid's AC voltage is near zero, and then release it again when it rises. This requires considerable amounts of energy storage in a small package. The lowest-cost option for the required amount of storage is the electrolytic capacitor, but these have relatively short lifetimes normally measured in years, and those lifetimes are shorter when operated hot, like on a rooftop solar panel. This has led to considerable development effort on the part of microinverter developers, who have introduced a variety of conversion topologies with lowered storage requirements, some using the much less capable but far longer lived [[thin film]] [[capacitor]]s where possible.

[[Three-phase electric power]] represents another solution to the problem. In a three-phase circuit, the power does not vary between (say) +120 to -120&amp;nbsp;Volts between two lines, but instead varies between 60 and +120 or -60 and -120V, and the periods of variation are much shorter. Inverters designed to operate on three phase systems require much less storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Quan|author2=P.

Three-phase systems, however, are generally only seen in industrial and commercial settings. These markets normally install larger arrays, where price sensitivity is the highest. Uptake of three-phase micros, in spite of any theoretical advantages, appears to be very low.

== Protection==
Microinverters protection usually include: anti-[[islanding]]; [[short circuit]]; 
[[reverse polarity]]; [[low voltage]]; [[over voltage]] and over temperature.

==Portable uses==
Foldable solar panel with AC microinverters can be used to recharge [[laptop]]s and some [[electric vehicle]]s.
== History ==

The microinverter concept has been in the solar industry since its inception. However, flat costs in manufacturing, like the cost of the transformer or enclosure, scaled favorably with size, and meant that larger devices were inherently less expensive in terms of [[price per watt]]. Small inverters were available from companies like ExelTech and others, but these were simply small versions of larger designs with poor price performance, and were aimed at niche markets.

=== Early examples ===
[[File:Sunmaster 130.jpg|thumb|right|Released in 1993, Mastervolt's Sunmaster 130S was the first true microinverter.]]
[[File:OK4E-100.jpg|thumb|right|Another early microinverter, 1995's OK4E-100 – E for European, 100 for 100 watts.]]

In 1991 the US company Ascension Technology started work on what was essentially a shrunken version of a traditional inverter, intended to be mounted on a panel to form an ''AC panel''. This design was based on the conventional linear regulator, which is not particularly efficient and dissipates considerable heat. In 1994 they sent an example to [[Sandia Labs]]  for testing.&lt;ref name=k3&gt;Katz, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Ascension partnered with US panel company ASE Americas to introduce the 300&amp;nbsp;W SunSine panel.&lt;ref name=k4&gt;Katz, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Design of, what would today be recognized as a "true" microinverter, traces its history to late 1980s work by Werner Kleinkauf at the ISET (''Institut für Solare Energieversorgungstechnik''), now [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology. These designs were based on modern high-frequency switching power supply technology, which is much more efficient. His work on "module integrated converters" was highly influential, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurosolar.de/en/index.php?Itemid=25&amp;id=196&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view "Appreciation Prof. Dr. Werner Kleinkauf"], EUROSOLAR&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Mastervolt introduced their first [[grid-tie inverter]], the Sunmaster 130S, based on a collaborative effort between Shell Solar, Ecofys and ECN. The 130 was designed to mount directly to the back of the panel, connecting both AC and DC lines with [[compression fitting]]s. In 2000, the 130 was replaced by the Soladin 120, a microinverter in the form of an [[AC adapter]] that allows panels to be connected simply by plugging them into any [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall socket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.mastervolt.nl/files/SOLAR_brochure_EN.pdf "Connect to the Sun"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mastervolt, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, OKE-Services designed a new high-frequency version with improved efficiency, which was introduced commercially as the OK4-100 in 1995 by NKF Kabel, and re-branded for US sales as the Trace Microsine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyocerasolar.com/pdf/specsheets/linetie.pdf "Utility Line Tie Power"], Trace Engineering, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; A new version, the OK4All, improved efficiency and had wider operating ranges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oke-services.nl/ok4all/ok4all.htm "OK4All"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628030028/http://www.oke-services.nl/ok4all/ok4all.htm |date=28 June 2010 }}, OK-Services&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this promising start, by 2003 most of these projects had ended. Ascension Technology was purchased by Applied Power Corporation, a large integrator. APC was in turn purchased by [[Schott AG|Schott]] in 2002, and SunSine production was canceled in favor of Schott's existing designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenraysolar.com/technology/tech-history "GreenRay Solar, History of the Technology"]. Greenraysolar.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt; NKF ended production of the OK4 series in 2003 when a subsidy program ended.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Katz, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mastervolt has moved on to a line of "mini-inverters" combining the ease-of-use of the 120 in a system designed to support up to 600 W of panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.mastervolt.nl/files/SOLAR_brochure_EN.pdf "Connect to the Sun"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Mastervolt, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enphase ===

In the aftermath of the 2001 [[Telecoms crash]], Martin Fornage of [[Cerent Corporation]] was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he found the project he was looking for. In 2006 he formed [[Enphase Energy]] (now integrated in [[Siemens]]) with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, and they spent the next year applying their telecommunications design expertise to the inverter problem.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

Released in 2008, the Enphase M175 model was the first commercially successful microinverter. A successor, the M190, was introduced in 2009, and the latest model, the M215, in 2011. Backed by $100 million in private equity, Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2011/kw03/enphase-energy-surpasses-500000-solar-pv-inverter-units-shipped-microinverter-leader-tripling-capacity-in-2011.html "Enphase Energy surpasses 500,000 solar PV inverter units shipped"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022941/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2011/kw03/enphase-energy-surpasses-500000-solar-pv-inverter-units-shipped-microinverter-leader-tripling-capacity-in-2011.html |date=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enphase.com/eblog/2011/journey-to-the-1000000th-microinverter/ "Journey to the 1,000,000th Microinverter"]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, they announced that re-branded versions of the new design will be sold by [[Siemens]] directly to electrical contractors for widespread distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Yuliya Chernova, [https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/02/02/will-solar-become-a-standard-offering-in-construction/ "Will Solar Become A Standard Offering In Construction?"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Enphase has subscribed an agreement with [[EnergyAustralia]], to market its micro-inverter technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/enphase-says-storage-already-at-parity-in-some-australian-markets-90233 2 Enphase says storage already at parity.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major players ==

Enphase's success did not go unnoticed, and since 2010 a host of competitors have appeared. Many of these are identical to the M190 in specs, and even in the casing and mounting details.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.involar.com/our-products.php this product] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903141327/http://www.involar.com/our-products.php |date=3 September 2010 }} for instance, or [http://www.energyharvestingjournal.com/articles/enecsys-solar-pv-micro-inverter-gains-ul-certification-00003057.asp?sessionid=1 this one], and compare to photos of the M190&lt;/ref&gt; Some differentiate by competing head-to-head with Enphase in terms of price or performance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparqsys.com/PDF/SPARQ%20Microinverter/SPARQ-Data-Sheet-Innovative-Microinverter-Technology.pdf SPARQ's design]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} uses a single high-power digital signal controller with few supporting components&lt;/ref&gt; while others are attacking niche markets.&lt;ref&gt;Like [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/09/new-solar-micro-inverter-company-launched Island Technology's] system aimed at thin-film modules which have different voltage ranges than conventional cells&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger firms have also stepped into the field: [[SMA Solar Technology|SMA]], [[Enecsys]] and [[iEnergy]].

The only USA made microinverter in production is from Chilicon Power. Since 2009, several companies from Europe to China, including major central inverter manufacturers, have launched microinverters—validating the microinverter as an established technology and one of the biggest technology shifts in the PV industry in recent years.&lt;ref name=green&gt;[http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Microinverter-Panel-Optimizer-and-Inverter-Startup-News/ "A roundup of new players"], Greentechmedia&lt;/ref&gt;

APsystems is marketing inverters for up to four solar modules a microinverters, including the three-phase YP1000 with an AC output of up to 900 Watt.

In 2018, there are 20 microinverter manufacturers around the world including: [[Apparent Corporation|Apparent]], [[Delta Electricity|Delta]], [[Sparq Systems|Sparq]], [[Kaco]], [[ABB]], Array Converter, Chilicon Power, GreenRay Solar, Azuray Technologies, Petra Solar, Direct Grid, Accurate Solar, [[SMA Solar Technology|OKE/SMA]], Exeltech, [[National Semiconductor]], Larankelo, [[Enphase]], [[APsystems]], Northern Electric &amp; Power (Northernep / NEP), [[ReneSola]] (Micro Replus), SolarEpic, SWEA and Plug &amp; Power. 

There is a growing list of big name PV companies around the world who have partnered with microinverter companies to produce and sell AC solar panels, including [[Trina Solar]], [[BenQ]], [[LG]], [[Canadian Solar]], [[Suntech]], [[SunPower]], [[NESL]], [[Hanwha SolarOne]], [[Sharp Solar|Sharp]] and other ones that are just joining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.solarquotes.com.au/inverters/micro/ Micro Inverters and AC Solar Panels: The Future of Solar Power?]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Price declines ===

The period between 2009 and 2012 included unprecedented downward price movement in the PV market. At the beginning of this period, wholesale pricing for panels was generally around $2.00 to $2.50/W, and inverters around 50 to 65 cents/W. By the end of 2012, panels were widely available in wholesale at 65 to 70 cents, and [[Grid-tie inverter|string inverter]]s around 30 to 35 cents/W.&lt;ref&gt;Galen Barbose, Naïm Darghouth, Ryan Wiser, [http://emp.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/LBNL-5919e-REPORT.pdf "Tracking the Sun V"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202022339/http://emp.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/LBNL-5919e-REPORT.pdf |date=2 December 2012 }}, Lawrence Berkeley Lab, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, microinverters have proven relatively immune to these same sorts of price declines, moving from about 65 cents/W to 50 to 55 once cabling is factored in. This could lead to widening losses as the suppliers attempt to remain competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wesoff, [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Enphase-Q2-Public-PV-Microinverter-Firm-Loses-CFO-Announces-Results "Enphase Update: Stock Price Slammed After PV Microinverter Firm Loses CFO, Losses Widen"], Greentech Media, 8 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in 2018 some DC 12 / 24 V to AC 110 / 220V inverters are sold by $0.06/W (ie 100W microinverter by $6.81).

A steam [[whistle]] is a device used to produce [[sound]] with the aid of [[live steam]], which acts as a vibrating system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=Chanaud  |first=Robert

  |journal=[[Scientific American]]
  |year=1970
  |issue=223
  |pages=40–46
  |ref=Chanaud, Sci Am, Aerodynamic whistles
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare to [[train horn]]).

== Operation ==
The whistle consists of the following main parts, as seen on the drawing: the whistle bell (1), the steam orifice or aperture (2), and the valve (9).

When the [[lever]] (10) is pulled (usually via a [[pull cord]]), the valve opens and lets the steam escape through the orifice. The steam will alternately compress and rarefy in the bell, creating the sound. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]], or tone, is dependent on the length of the bell; and also how far the operator has opened the valve. Some locomotive engineers invented their own style of whistling.

Steam whistles were often used in factories, and similar places to signal the start or end of a shift, etc.  [[Steam locomotive|Railway locomotive]]s, [[traction engine]]s, and [[steam ship]]s have traditionally been fitted with a whistle for warning and communication purposes. Large diameter steam whistles were used on light houses, likely beginning in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A copy of the trumpet drawing signed May 1833 shows a device about eighteen inches high with an ever-widening trumpet shape with a six-inch diameter at its top or mouth.&lt;ref name="Stretton, Clement Edwin 1903" /&gt; It is said that George Stephenson invented his trumpet after an accident on the Leicester and Swannington Railway where a train hit either a cart, or a herd of cows, on a [[level crossing]] and there were calls for a better way of giving a warning. Although no-one was injured, the accident was deemed serious enough to warrant Stephenson’s personal intervention. One account states that [driver] Weatherburn had `mouthblown his horn' at the crossing in an attempt to prevent the accident, but that no attention had been paid to this audible warning, perhaps because it had not been heard.

Stephenson subsequently called a meeting of directors and accepted the suggestion of the company manager, Ashlin Bagster, that a horn or whistle which could be activated by steam should be constructed and fixed to the locomotives. Stephenson later visited a musical instrument maker on Duke Street in [[Leicester]], who on Stephenson's instructions constructed a ‘Steam Trumpet’ which was tried out in the presence of the board of Directors ten days later.

Stephenson mounted the trumpet on the top of the boiler's [[steam dome]], which delivers [[dry steam]] to the cylinders.  The company went on to mount the device on its other locomotives

Locomotive steam trumpets were soon replaced by steam whistles. Air whistles were used on some Diesel and electric locomotives, but these mostly employ  [[train horn|air horns]].

=== Music ===
An array of steam whistles arranged to play music is referred to as a [[calliope (music)|calliope]].

In [[York, Pennsylvania]], a variable pitch steam whistle at the New York Wire Company has been played annually on Christmas Eve since 1925 (except in 1986 and 2005) in what has come to be known as "York's Annual Steam Whistle Christmas Concert".  On windy nights, area residents report hearing the concert as far as 12 to 15 miles away.  The whistle, which is in the Guinness Book of World Records, was powered by an air compressor during the 2010 concert due to the costs of maintaining and running the boiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inyork.com/local/ci_16923843?source=most_viewed|title=York steam whistle ready to play -- without the steam|work=www.inyork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="York Town Square"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2008/12/new-york-wire-cloth.html|title=York Town Square|work=York Town Square|access-date=2010-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227095721/http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2008/12/new-york-wire-cloth.html|archive-date=2010-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ydr.com/local/ci_16886613|title=Steam whistle player's hospitalization won't stop concert|work=ydr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2007/12/new-york-wires-musical-factory.html|title=York Town Square|work=York Town Square|access-date=2010-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228192536/http://www.yorkblog.com/yorktownsquare/2007/12/new-york-wires-musical-factory.html|archive-date=2010-12-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwGLjW435XU|title=York Pa wire company|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.witf.org/news/regional-and-state/2686-yorks-annual-christmas-steam-whistle-concert-endangered{{deadlink|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of whistles ==
*'''Plain whistle''' – an inverted cup mounted on a stem, as in the illustration above. In Europe, railway steam whistles were typically loud, shrill, single-note plain whistles. In the UK, locomotives were usually fitted with only one or two of these whistles, the latter having different tones and being controlled individually to allow more complex signalling. On railroads in Finland, two single-note whistles were used on every engine; one shrill, one of a lower tone. They were used for different signaling purposes. The [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] of [[Germany]] introduced another whistle design in the 1920s called "Einheitspfeife", conceived as a single-note plain whistle which already had a very deep-pitched and loud sound, but if the whistle trigger is just pulled down half of its way an even lower tone like from a chime-whistle could also be caused. This whistle is the reason for the typical "long high - short low - short high" signal sound of steam locomotives in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoR1vsnr8SE|title=Dampflokpfeifen / The Whistles of Steamtrains|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chime whistle''' – two or more resonant bells or chambers that sound simultaneously. In America, railway steam whistles were typically compact chime whistles with more than one whistle contained within, creating a chord. In Australia the New South Wales Government Railways after the 1924 re-classification many steam locomotives either had 5 chimes whistles fitted (this include many locomotives from the pre 1924 re-classification, or were built new with 5 chime whistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=ZzljAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=186718|title=Patent US186718 - Improvement in steam-whistles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3-chimes (3 compact whistles within one) were very popular, as well as 5-chimes, and 6-chimes. In some cases chime whistles were used in Europe. Ships such as the ''Titanic'' were equipped with chimes consisting of three separate whistles (in the case of the Titanic the whistles measured 9, 12, and 15&amp;nbsp;inches diameter). The [[Japanese National Railways]] used a chime whistle that sounds like a very deep single-note plain whistle, because the chords where just accessed in a simple parallel circuit if the whistle trigger is pulled down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTuX3qExokE|title=SL津和野稲荷号　走行シーン　SL "Tsuwano-inari " Running scene|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Organ whistle''' – a whistle with mouths cut in the side, usually a long whistle in relation to diameter, hence the name. These whistle were very common on steamships, especially those manufactured in the UK.
*'''Gong''' – two whistles facing in opposite directions on a common axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=7TUAAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=48921|title=Patent US48921 - Improvement in steam-whistles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were popular as factory whistles. Some were composed of three whistle chimes.
*'''Variable pitch whistle''' – a whistle containing an internal piston available for changing pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=tFVDAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=131176+whistle|title=Patent US131176 - Improvement in steam-whistles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This whistle type could be made to sound like a siren or to play a melody. Often called a fire alarm whistle, wildcat whistle, or mocking bird whistle.
*'''Toroidal or Levavasseur whistle''' – a whistle with a torus-shaped (doughnut-shaped) resonant cavity paralleling the annular gas orifice, named after Robert Levavasseur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=_QFiAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=toroidal+whistle#PPA1950,M1|title=Patent US2755767 - High power generators of sounds and ultra-sounds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its inventor. Unlike a conventional whistle, the diameter (and sound level) of a ring-shaped whistle can be increased without altering resonance chamber cross-sectional area (preserving frequency), allowing construction of a very large diameter high frequency whistle. The frequency of a conventional whistle declines as diameter is increased. Other ring-shaped whistles include the Hall-Teichmann whistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=HXNfAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2678625|title=Patent US2678625 - Resonant sound signal device|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graber whistle,&lt;ref&gt;"Directional Isophasic Toroidal Whistle" Patent No. US 20130291784 A1

*'''Helmholtz whistle''' – a whistle with a cross-sectional area exceeding that of the whistle bell opening, often shaped like a bottle or incandescent light bulb. The frequency of this whistle relative to its size is lower than that of a conventional whistle and therefore these whistles have found application in small gauge steam locomotives. Also termed a Bangham whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagen, Ed. (1996). Technical talk about flue pipes, cavities, and Helmholtz resonators. Horn and Whistle 71:8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangham, Larry (2002). The Resonator Whistle. Steam in the Garden 66 and 67, reprinted in Horn and Whistle 101:12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hooter whistle''' - a whistle that was mainly used by the Norfolk and Western railroad that was featured on their S1 switchers, Class A, Class K1, Class Z, and Class Y6b locomotives.

== Whistle acoustics ==

=== Resonant frequency ===
A whistle has a characteristic natural resonant frequency&lt;ref name="Liljencrants, 2006, End correction" &gt;{{cite web
  |last=Liljencrants  |first=Johan
  |year=2006
  |url=http://www.fonema.se/mouthcorr/mouthcorr.htm
  |title=End correction at a flue pipe mouth
  |ref=Liljencrants, 2006, End correction
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be detected by gently blowing human breath across the whistle rim, much as one might blow over the mouth of a bottle. The active sounding frequency (when the whistle is blown on steam) may differ from the natural frequency as discussed below. These comments apply to whistles with a mouth area at least equal to the cross-sectional area of the whistle.

* '''Whistle length''' – The natural resonant frequency decreases as the length of the whistle is increased. Doubling the effective length of a whistle reduces the frequency by one half, assuming that the whistle cross-sectional area is uniform. A whistle is a quarter-wave generator, which means that a sound wave generated by a whistle is about four times the whistle length. If the [[speed of sound]] in the steam supplied to a whistle were 15936&amp;nbsp;inches per second, a pipe with a 15-inch effective length  blowing its natural frequency would sound near [[middle C]]: 15936/(4 x 15) = 266&amp;nbsp;Hz. When a whistle is sounding its natural frequency, the ''effective'' length referred to here is somewhat longer than the physical length above the mouth if the whistle is of uniform cross-sectional area. That is, the vibrating length of the whistle includes some portion of the mouth. This effect (the “end correction”) is caused by the vibrating steam inside the whistle engaging vibration of some steam outside the enclosed pipe, where  there is a transition from plane waves to spherical waves.&lt;ref&gt;Tohyama, M. (2011) Sound and Signals. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 389 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Formulas are available to estimate the effective length of a whistle,&lt;ref name="Liljencrants, 2006, End correction" /&gt; but an  accurate formula to predict sounding frequency would have to incorporate whistle length, scale, gas flow rate, mouth height, and mouth wall area (see below).
*'''Blowing pressure''' – Frequency increases with blowing pressure,&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2003, Pressure &amp; frequency" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which determines gas volume flow through the whistle, allowing a locomotive engineer to play a whistle like a musical instrument, using the valve to vary the flow of steam. The term for this was “quilling.” An experiment with a short plain whistle reported in 1883 showed that incrementally increasing steam pressure drove the whistle from E to D-flat, a 68 percent increase in frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Science Magazine, Volume 2, No. 46 December 21, 1883 page 799.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch deviations from the whistle natural frequency likely follow velocity differences in the steam jet downstream from the aperture, creating phase differences between driving frequency and natural frequency of the whistle. Although at normal blowing pressures the aperture constrains the jet to the speed of sound, once it exits the aperture and expands, velocity decay is a function of absolute pressure.&lt;ref name="Birch"&gt;Birch, A.D., D.J. Hughes, and F. Swaffield. (1987). Velocity decay of high pressure jets. Combustion Science and Technology. 52:161-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, frequency may vary at a fixed blowing pressure with differences in temperature of steam or compressed air.&lt;ref name="Elliott, 2006, Compressed Air" &gt;{{cite book

Boston : Jones and Bartlett.&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial steam whistles typically were operated in the range of 100 to 300 [[pounds per square inch]] gauge pressure (psig) (0.7 - 2.1 megapascals, MPa), although some were constructed for use on pressures as high as 600 psig (4.1 MPa). All of these pressures are within the [[choked flow]] regime,&lt;ref&gt;Heisler, S.I. (1998). Wiley Engineer's Desk Reference.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive pressure for a given whistle design will drive the whistle into an '''overblown mode''', where the fundamental frequency will be replaced by an odd [[harmonic]], that is a frequency that is an odd number multiple of the fundamental. Usually this is the third harmonic (second [[overtone]] frequency), but an example has been noted where a large whistle jumped to the fifteenth harmonic.&lt;ref name=Ommundsen2013&gt;Ommundsen, Peter (2013). "Steam whistle harmonics and whistle length." Horn and Whistle 129:31-33&lt;/ref&gt; A long narrow whistle such as that of the [[Liberty ship]] [[SS John W. Brown|John W. Brown]] sounds a rich spectrum of [[overtones]], but is not overblown. (In overblowing the "amplitude of the pipe fundamental frequency falls to zero.")&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, N.H. (1974). Non-linear interactions in organ flue pipes. J. Acoustical Society of America, 56:645-652.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing whistle length increases the number and amplitude of harmonics, as has been demonstrated in experiments with a variable-pitch whistle. Whistles tested on steam  produce both even-numbered and odd-numbered harmonics.&lt;ref name=Ommundsen2013/&gt; The harmonic profile of a whistle might also be influenced by aperture width, mouth cut-up, and lip-aperture offset, as is the case for organ pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, N.H. and Lorna M. Douglas. (1980). "Harmonic generation in organ pipes, recorders, and flutes." Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 68:767-771.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Steam quality]]''' – The quality of steam (steam dryness) on which whistles are blown is variable and will affect whistle frequency. Steam quality determines the [[velocity of sound]], which declines with decreasing dryness due to the [[inertia]] of the liquid phase. The speed of sound in steam is predictable if steam dryness is known. &lt;ref&gt;Šafarík, P., Nový, A., Jícha, D. and Hajšman, M., 2015. On the speed of sound in steam.

*'''Aspect ratio''' – The more squat the whistle, the greater is the change in pitch with blowing pressure.&lt;ref name="Organ pipe sensitivity to pressure"&gt;Liljencrants, Johan.

  |ref=Ommundsen, 2004, Whistle mouth and pressure
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whistle frequency prediction thus requires establishment of a set of frequency/pressure curves unique to whistle scale, and a set of whistles may fail to track a musical chord as blowing pressure changes if each whistle is of a different scale. This is true of many antique whistles divided into a series of compartments of the same diameter but of different lengths. Some whistle designers minimized this problem by building resonant chambers of a similar scale.&lt;ref&gt;Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway 1925 engineering drawing, published 1984, Horn and Whistle 13:12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mouth vertical length (“cut-up”)''' – Frequency of a plain whistle declines as the whistle bell is raised away from the steam source. If the cut-up of an organ whistle or single bell chime is raised (without raising the whistle ceiling), the effective chamber length is shortened. Shortening the chamber drives frequency up, but raising the cut-up drives frequency down. The resulting frequency (higher, lower, or unchanged) will be determined by whistle scale and by competition between the two drivers.&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2005, Mouth size and frequency" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cut-up prescribed by whistle-maker Robert Swanson for 150 psig steam pressure was 0.35 x bell diameter for a plain whistle, which is about 1.45 x net bell cross-sectional area (subtracting stud area).&lt;ref&gt;Airchime Manufacturing Company, May 15, 1960, Steam Whistle Installation: Adjustments. Horn and Whistle Magazine No. 25, page 37, July – August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nathan Manufacturing Company used a cut-up of 1.56 x chamber cross-sectional area for their 6-note railway chime whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Manufacturing Company 1910, December 3, General Information, Pattern 30146.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Cut-up in relation to mouth arc ''' – A large change in cut-up (e.g., 4x difference) may have little impact on whistle natural frequency if mouth area and total resonator length are held constant.&lt;ref name="Liljencrants, 2006, End correction" /&gt; For example, a plain whistle, which has a 360-degree mouth (that extends completely around the whistle circumference), can emit a similar frequency to a partial mouth organ whistle of the same mouth area and same overall resonator length (aperture to ceiling), despite an immensely different cut-up.  (Cut-up is the distance between the steam aperture and the upper lip of the mouth.) This suggests that ''effective'' cut-up is determined by proximity of the oscillating gas column to the steam jet rather than by the distance between the upper mouth lip and the steam aperture.&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2007, slot width" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Gas composition''' – The frequency of a whistle driven by steam is typically higher than that of a whistle driven by [[compressed air]] at the same pressure. This frequency difference is caused by the greater [[speed of sound]] in steam, which is less dense than air. The magnitude of the frequency difference can vary because the speed of sound is influenced by air temperature and by steam quality. Also, the more squat the whistle, the more sensitive it is to the difference in gas flow rate between steam and air that occurs at a fixed blowing pressure. Data from 14 whistles (34 resonant chambers) sounded under a variety of field conditions showed a wide range of frequency differences between steam and air (5 - 43 percent higher frequency on steam). Very elongate whistles, which are fairly resistant to gas flow differences, sounded a frequency 18 - 22 percent higher on steam (about three semitones).&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Harry, and Peter Ommundsen. (2012). "Whistle frequency differences on steam vs. compressed air." ''Horn and Whistle'' 126:5 - 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, depressing the piston of a variable-pitch steam whistle changed the frequency from 333&amp;nbsp;Hz to 753&amp;nbsp;Hz and raised the sound pressure level from 116 dBC to 123 dBC. That five-fold difference in the square of the frequency resulted in a five-fold difference in sound intensity.&lt;ref name=Barry2015&gt;Barry, Harry and Peter Ommundsen (2015). "Whistle sound levels revisited." ''Horn and Whistle'' (133):4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sound level also increases as whistle cross-sectional area is increased.&lt;ref name="Burrows, 1957, US2784693, 2" &gt;[[#Burrows, 1957, US2784693|Burrows, 1957, US2784693]], column 5, lines 30-34&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of 12 single-note whistles ranging in size from one-inch diameter to 12-inches diameter showed a relationship between sound intensity and the square of the cross-sectional area (when differences in frequency were taken into account). In other words, relative whistle sound intensity can be estimated using the square of the cross-sectional area divided by the square of the wavelength.&lt;ref name=Barry2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry, 2002, Sound levels" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sound intensity from a whistle bell of 6-inch diameter x 7.5-inch length (113 dBC) was 10x that of a 2 x 4-inch whistle (103 dBC) and twice that of a (lower frequency) 10 x 40-inch whistle (110 dBC). These whistles were sounded on compressed air at 125 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (862 Kilopascals) and sound levels were recorded at 100 feet distance. Elongate organ whistles may exhibit disproportionately high sound levels due to their strong higher frequency overtones.  At a separate venue a 20-inch  diameter Ultrawhistle (ring-shaped whistle) operating at 15 pounds per square inch gauge pressure (103.4 kilopascals) produced 124 dBC at 100 feet.&lt;ref name="Weisenberger, 1983, Loudest whistle" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound level of a Levavasseur toroidal whistle is enhanced by about 10 decibels by a secondary cavity parallel to the [[resonant cavity]], the former creating a [[vortex]] that augments the [[oscillation]]s of the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] driving the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Isador (1962). Evaluation and application of the Levavasseur whistle. 1962 IRE National Convention Record. 36-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Steam aperture width''' – If gas flow is restricted by the area of the steam aperture, widening the aperture will increase the sound level for a fixed blowing pressure.&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2005, Slot width" /&gt; Enlarging the steam aperture can compensate for the loss of sound output if pressure is reduced. It has been known since at least the 1830s that whistles can be modified for low pressure operation and still achieve a high sound level.&lt;ref name="Pringle, R.E 1839"/&gt; Data on the compensatory relationship between pressure and aperture size are scant, but tests on compressed air indicate that a halving of absolute pressure requires that the aperture size be at least doubled in width to maintain the original sound level, and aperture width in some antique whistle arrays increases with diameter (aperture area thus increasing with whistle cross-sectional area) for whistles of the same scale.&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2007, slot width"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2005, Slot width" /&gt; Applying the physics of high pressure jets exiting circular apertures, a doubling of velocity and gas concentration at a fixed point in the whistle mouth would require a quadrupling of either aperture area or absolute pressure. (A quartering of absolute pressure would be compensated by a quadrupling of aperture area—the velocity decay constant increases approximately with the square root of absolute pressure in the normal whistle-blowing pressure range.) In reality, trading pressure loss for greater aperture area may be less efficient as pressure-dependent adjustments occur to virtual origin displacement.&lt;ref name="Birch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birch, A.D., D.R. Brown, M.G. Dobson and F. Swaffield. (1984) The structure and concentration decay of high pressure jets of natural gas. Combustion Science and Technology, 36:249-261.&lt;/ref&gt; Quadrupling the width of an organ pipe aperture at a fixed blowing pressure resulted in somewhat less than a doubling of velocity at the flue exit.&lt;ref&gt;Auberlencher, H.J. and T. trommer (2009). Experimental jet velocity and edge tone investigations on a foot model of an organ pipe. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 126:878-886.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Steam aperture profile''' – Gas flow rate (and thus sound level) is set not only by aperture area and blowing pressure, but also by aperture geometry. [[Friction]] and [[turbulence]] influence the flow rate, and are accounted for by a [[discharge coefficient]]. A mean estimate of the discharge coefficient from whistle field tests is 0.72 (range 0.69 - 0.74).&lt;ref name="Gilbert, 1897" /&gt;
*'''Mouth vertical length (“cut-up”)''' – The mouth length (cut-up) that provides the highest sound level at a fixed blowing pressure varies with whistle scale, and some makers of multi-tone whistles therefore cut a mouth height unique to the scale of each resonant chamber, maximizing sound output of the whistle.&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, Lewis M. (1957). [http://www.google.com/patents?id=tC5hAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=2784693 “Whistle Patent Number 2784693"] United States Patent Office, column 5, lines 20-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideal cut-up for whistles of a fixed diameter and aperture width (including single-bell chime compartments) at a fixed blowing pressure appears to vary approximately with the square root of effective length.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Tom (1984). Building a steamboat whistle. Live Steam, November:42-44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antique]] whistle makers commonly used a compromise mouth area of about 1.4x whistle cross-sectional area. If a whistle is driven to its maximum sound level with the mouth area set equal to the whistle cross-sectional area, it may be possible to increase the sound level by further increasing the mouth area. .&lt;ref name="Ommundsen, 2008, Levavasseur" &gt;{{cite journal

*'''Frequency and distance ''' – [[Sound pressure]] level decreases by half (six decibels) with each doubling of distance due to divergence from the source. This relationship is termed [[inverse proportional]], often incorrectly described as the [[inverse square law]]; the latter applies to sound intensity, not sound pressure. Sound pressure level also decreases due to atmospheric absorption, which is strongly dependent upon frequency, lower frequencies traveling farthest. For example, a 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz whistle has an atmospheric attenuation coefficient one half that of a 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz whistle (calculated for 50 percent [[relative humidity]] at 20 degrees Celsius). This means that in addition to divergent [[sound dampening]], there would be a loss of 0.5 decibel per 100 meters from the 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz whistle and 1.0 decibel per 100 meters for the 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz whistle. Additional factors affecting [[sound propagation]] include barriers, atmospheric temperature gradients, and "ground effects.”&lt;ref name="Fagen, 2005, Whistles as sound sources, 1" &gt;{{cite journal

So far four editions have been published; the first three of which are in the form of a ring-bound manual with a plastic cover, and the latest, Edition 4, is a paperback booklet.  Edition I covers the use of the [[S6 NBC Respirator|S6 Respirator]] and Mk.III NBC suit and overboots, Edition II featuring the [[S10 NBC Respirator|S10 Respirator]] and Mk.IV suit and overboots which were introduced since, and Edition III (1995) is a revised version of II, and features the addition of the Mk.V overboots. A concise aide-memoire, containing much of the same information as in the manuals is also issued, in the form of a tall card which is stored in the [[respirator]] [[haversack]], with different versions being issued to the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Navy|Navy]] in accordance with differing requirements for each service.

The '''Upper Kaleköy Dam''', also known as the '''Yukarı Kaleköy Dam''', is a [[gravity dam]] currently under construction on the [[Murat River]] near the town of Kale in [[Solhan]] district of [[Bingöl Province]], eastern Turkey. Construction on the dam began in 2012 and it is expected to be completed in 2018. It is one of six major dams planned for the river. Its primary purpose is [[hydroelectric]] power generation and it will support a 636.6 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station. The {{Convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall dam will withhold a reservoir of {{Convert|783800000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}.

A '''vaneless ion wind generator''' or '''power fence''' is a proposed [[wind power]] device that produces [[electrical energy]] directly by using the [[wind]] to pump [[electric charge]] from one [[electrode]] to another, with no [[moving parts]].

Wind energy is usually extracted to make [[electricity]] by means of a [[wind turbine]].  The bird deaths, vibrational noise, and moving shadows associated with wind turbines would not occur with ion based power generation.

One design uses [[water]] sprayed from a nozzle facing a toroidal charged electrode. This induces an opposite charge in the water, and when the water flows out of the nozzle, each drop carries a small amount of charge. These water droplets are then blown by the wind, going through the center of the charged toroid without touching it. The droplets then hit a fine mesh, adding to its charge. 

The other alternative is to use the [[Ground (electricity)|Earth]] as the second electrode.  The main advantage of this system is that it has no moving parts except the water droplets. The disadvantages are that it needs a constant supply of water, its wind profile can't be reduced, it requires many small parts, and it has to be well-crafted to reduce [[corona discharge]] losses.  The device would produce [[direct current]], which would need to be [[Inverter (electrical)|inverted]] to apply to a standard AC power grid.

[[Lord Kelvin]] created a similar device that used the energy of ''falling'' water droplets to generate [[high voltage]], sometimes called "[[Kelvin water dropper|Kelvin's Thunderstorm]]".

The history of '''wooden toymaking in the Ore Mountains''' is closely bound to regional circumstances. The [[Ore Mountains]] are located in Central Europe on the border between [[Germany]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. For many centuries it was a countryside in which the local population eked out a hard existence from the land. Long and harsh winters restricted agriculture; in addition the region had very poor communications. With the onset of ore [[mining]] a new line of commerce developed, but the hard labour and high risks involved meant that it was only work for young and strong men. Many were injured or died as a result of accidents. The miners rose early in the morning whilst it was still dark in order to go to work and did not return home again until late in the evening after dark. From those times comes a custom that has survived to the present day, the practice of placing lights in the window. These lights were intended to show the miners the safe way back to the homes of their families.

It was not long before the winnings of silver ore fell in many parts of the mountains and numerous pits had to close. This hardship forced its inhabitants to look for other work and, thanks to abundance of timber in the region, the manufacture of wooden toys became an important secondary source of income. Entire families were engaged in wooden toymaking, especially in the harsh winters. [[Child labour]] in conditions of poor lighting and equipment was the rule rather than the exception. The children often had to work more than 12 hours a day. Families developed a high degree of specialisation. For example, an experienced turner would be working on turning animal shapes (''[[Reifendrehen]]''), another man carved the animal figures out of it and another family took over the painting and the manufacture of small boxes. Earnings from the individual steps in the process were very low. Production was usually bought by travelling merchants who used their position without mercy, to force down the prices. The majority of these products was taken to the toy markets of [[Nuremberg]] and redistributed from there. The formation of associations and cooperatives (such as [[Dregeno]]) was in order to ensure a minimum level of income.

Production is concentrated today in the toymaking village of [[Seiffen/Erzgeb.|Seiffen]] and its surrounding area in the middle of the so-called "German Christmas Land" as the Ore Mountains are called. A great variety of products has developed, but they are clearly associated with the Ore Mountains and go by the concept of [[Ore Mountain folk art]]. They include many typical wooden Ore Mountain products such as [[Christmas pyramid]]s, wooden ''[[Räuchermann]]'' incense smokers, [[nutcracker]]s, wooden figures ([[Christmas Angels]], [[miners]], [[Reifendrehen|turned animals]], etc.), Christmas mountain scenes (''[[Weihnachtsberg]]''e) and [[Ore Mountain Schwibbogen|Ore Mountain candle arches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nutcrackerplus.qcommerce.com/ ''Treasures from the German Erzgebirge''] at nutcrackerplus.qcommerce.com.
