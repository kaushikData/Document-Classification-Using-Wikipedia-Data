The '''aerodynamic force''' is the force exerted on a body by the air (or some other gas) in which the body is immersed, and is due to the [[relative motion]] between the body and the gas. The [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] force arises from two causes:
&lt;ref&gt;Hurt, H.H.Jr. ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators''.  p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LJC&gt;[[L. J. Clancy]] (1975).  ''Aerodynamics''.  Pitman Publishing Limited, London.  {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§4.10}}&lt;ref&gt;Massey, B.S. ''Mechanics of Fluids'', section 10.8.2&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[normal force]] due to the [[pressure]] on the surface of the body 
*the [[shear force]] due to the [[viscosity]] of the gas, also known as [[skin friction]].

Pressure acts locally, normal to the surface, and shear force acts locally, parallel to the surface. The net aerodynamic force over the body is due to the pressure and shear forces integrated over the total exposed area of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson,J.D.Jr  ''Aircraft performance and design''.  Section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;

When an [[airfoil]] (or a [[wing]]) is moving relative to the air it generates an aerodynamic force, in a rearward direction at an angle with the direction of relative motion. This aerodynamic force is commonly resolved into two [[Euclidean_vector#Representations|components]]:&lt;ref&gt;Hurt, H.H.Jr. ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators''.  p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LJC/&gt;{{rp|§ 5.3}}

*''[[Drag (force)|drag]]'' is the force component parallel to the direction of relative motion,
*''[[Lift (force)|lift]]'' is the force component perpendicular to the direction of relative motion.

In addition to these two forces, the body may experience an aerodynamic [[Principle of moments|moment]] also, the value of which depends on the point chosen for calculation.

The force created by a [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] or a [[jet engine]] is called ''[[thrust]]'' and it is also an aerodynamic force (since it also acts on the surrounding air).  The aerodynamic force on a powered airplane is commonly represented by three [[Euclidean_vector|vectors]]: thrust, lift and drag.&lt;ref&gt;Hurt, H.H.Jr. ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators''.  Fig 2.20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LJC/&gt;{{rp|§ 14.2}}

The other force acting on an aircraft during flight is its [[weight]].  Weight is a [[body force]] and is not an aerodynamic force.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52854">'''Attachment and Health''' is psychological model which considers how [[attachment theory]] pertains to people’s preferences and expectations for the proximity of others when faced with stress, threat, danger or pain.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Maunder|first2=RG|date=2001|title=Using attachment theory to understand illness behavior|journal=General Hospital Psychiatry|volume=23|issue=4|pages=177–82|pmid=11543843|last1=Hunter|first1=JJ|doi=10.1016/s0163-8343(01)00141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the American Psychiatrist, [[Lawrence Kolb]], noticed that patients with chronic pain displayed behaviours with their healthcare providers akin to what children might display with an attachment figure, thus marking one of the first applications of attachment theory to physical health.&lt;ref name="kolb1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolb|first1=LC|title=Attachment behavior and pain complaints.|journal=Psychosomatics|date=April 1982|volume=23|issue=4|pages=413–25|pmid=7079441|doi=10.1016/s0033-3182(82)73404-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of adult attachment theory and adult [[attachment measures]] in the 1990s provided researchers with the means to apply attachment theory to health in a more systematic way.&lt;ref name="ravitz2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravitz|first1=P|last2=Maunder|first2=R|last3=Hunter|first3=J|last4=Sthankiya|first4=B|last5=Lancee|first5=W|title=Adult attachment measures: a 25-year review|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=October 2010|volume=69|issue=4|pages=419–32|pmid=20846544|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time it has been used to understand variation in stress response, health outcomes and health behaviour. Ultimately, the application of attachment theory to health care may enable health care practitioners to provide more personalized medicine by creating a deeper understanding of patient distress and allowing clinicians to better meet their needs and expectations.

==History of Attachment Theory==
{{main|History of attachment theory}} {{see also|Attachment Theory}}

===Infant attachment===
[[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed attachment theory in the 1960s while investigating the effects of [[Maternal deprivation|maternal separation]] on infant development.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bretherton|first1=Inge|title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1992|volume=28|issue=5|pages=759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the [[Strange Situation]] task in 1965 by Ainsworth and Wittig allowed researchers to systematically investigate the attachment system operating between children and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mary|first1=Ainsworth|title=Patterns of attachment : a psychological study of the strange situation|date=1978|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89859-461-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation involves separating infant-parent dyads and observing infant behaviours upon reunion. Infant behaviour tended to follow patterns, leading to the development of three attachment categories: Secure, Anxious-Avoidant, and Anxious-Resistant. In 1990, Ainsworth added a new category, championed by [[Mary Main]], called Disorganized/Disoriented attachment, characterized by its less reliable pattern of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of a new, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern. In M. Yogman &amp; T. B. Brazelton (Eds.), Affective development in infancy (pp. 95–124). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby believed attachment to be a primary biological drive to achieve proximity with a caregiver that transforms across child development to also encompass a psychological drive to find security by achieving a preferred interpersonal distance with an important caregiver he called an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992" /&gt; Insecure attachment patterns develop when caregivers are experienced as inconsistent or unpredictable, which necessitates the development of different strategies to achieve a sense of comfort and safety within an interpersonal setting. Furthermore, he posited that attachment figures function as a ''secure base'' that facilitate environmental eexploration and that ''attachment behaviours'' are triggered by perceived stress, danger or pain, and are thus ''state dependent''.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis|date=2001|publisher=Other Press|last1=Fonagy|first1=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult attachment===
{{main|Attachment in adults}}

In the late 1980s Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult romantic relationships based on observations of the interactions between adult romantic partners.☃☃ They noticed that romantic partners often prefer to be physically close, become anxious when they are separated and that stressful situations can be buffered by the presence of a romantic partner. Three main methods of measuring adult attachment have been developed (see [[attachment measures]]), with slightly different purposes and variable amounts of concordance between them.&lt;ref name= eagle2013 /&gt; Some aim to categorize attachment style while others rate degrees of attachment anxiety and avoidance.

==Attachment Styles==
Attachment styles refer to characteristic patterns of thought concerning the ability of self and others to help an individual achieve security. Longitudinal studies have suggested attachment is fairly stable from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Weinfield2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sroufe|first2=LA|last3=Egeland|first3=B|date=2000|title=Attachment from infancy to early adulthood in a high-risk sample: continuity, discontinuity, and their correlates.|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=695–702|pmid=10953936|last1=Weinfield|first1=NS|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waters2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Merrick|first2=S|last3=Treboux|first3=D|last4=Crowell|first4=J|last5=Albersheim|first5=L|date=2000|title=Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: a twenty-year longitudinal study|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=684–9|pmid=10953934|last1=Waters|first1=E|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When shifts do occur it is usually with good reason, with shifts away from secure attachment due to increased hardship and shifts towards secure related to finding partners in adulthood or finding symbolic attachments (God, places, pets) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=DL|last2=Needham|first2=TN|last3=Coolidge|first3=FL|title=Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment|journal=International Journal of Aging &amp; Human Development|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=119–32|pmid=19960862|doi=10.2190/ag.69.2.c|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people generally have positive views about themselves and about others. They tend to agree with statements "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Horowitz|first2=LM|date=August 1991|title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–44|pmid=1920064|last1=Bartholomew|first1=K|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===
'''Anxious-preoccupied''' people tend to view themselves less positively than okthey view others. They are more likely to become highly anxious when they are away from their attachment partners and are at risk of becoming, or seeming, dependent. They tend to agree with statements such as “I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." &lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Avoidant-dismissive''' people tend to have a positive view of themselves and a less positive view of others. They often highly value independence and become uncomfortable in, or resist, situations where they become dependent on others. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is very important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." This is considered to be roughly equivalent to the anxious-avoidant style in children.&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Fearful-avoidant''' people tend to have conflicted, and often negative, views of themselves and of others. They often desire to have emotional relationships but feel uncomfortable when others get too close. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt; People with loss or trauma in childhood are at greater risk of developing this style of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byun|first1=S|last2=Brumariu|first2=LE|last3=Lyons-Ruth|first3=K|title=Disorganized Attachment in Young Adulthood as Partial Mediator of Relations Between Severity of Childhood Abuse and Dissociation |journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26836233|pmc=5004628|doi=10.1080/15299732.2016.1141149|volume=17|issue=4|pages=460–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure Attachment Styles in Healthcare Settings===

'''Anxious-Preoccupied'''
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment tend to be hypervigilant to signs of danger and to worry or catastrophize about symptoms. In health care appointments, their narrative is full of intense negative emotion but relatively sparse in the specific detail desired by health care providers. This presentation can readily be perceived as “needy” or “dramatic”. If the healthcare provider pulls away in response it may reinforce the patient’s need to articulate their distress, creating a cycle of distress-withdrawal-distress.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maunder|first1=R|last2=Hunter|first2=J|title=Love, Fear and Health: How our attachments to others shape health and health care|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=J|last2=Maunder|first2=R|title=Improving Patient Treatment with Attachment Theory: a guide for primary care providers and specialists|date=2015|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidant-Dismissive'''
People with avoidant dismissive attachment emphasizetheir independence and minimizing expressing distress. They may delay seeking healthcare (see healthcare utilization), minimize reporting symptoms and disclose limited personal information.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

'''Fearful-Disorganized'''
People with fearful attachment often avoid routine healthcare, but present in a crisis with volatile, intense, negative emotions. Due to their degree of distress, they can present a disorganized narrative that is difficult for providers to follow and interpret diagnostically.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

==Working Model== 
Working models are representatives of the cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], or psychological structure (often unconscious), which underlie the different attachment classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=P|title=Structure and functions of internal working models of attachment and their role for emotion regulation|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=December 1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=291–306|pmid=11708228|doi=10.1080/14616739900134161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working models develop in children over time based on their experiences with their attachment figures. The cognitive schema for attachment consists of views of the efficacy of self and other to create security in times of distress.

===Bartholomew and Horowitz Model===
Bartholomew and Horowitz proposed and verified a working model based on two dimensions; the view of the self (self-esteem) and the view of others (sociability)&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;
*Secure- Positive view of self, Positive view of other 
*Dismissive- Positive view of self, Negative view of other
*Preoccupied- Negative view of self, Positive view of other
*Fearful- Negative view of self, Negative view of other

===Prototype-Insecurity Classification Model===
In 2012 Maunder and Hunter&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=RG|last2=Hunter|first2=JJ|title=A prototype-based model of adult attachment for clinicians|journal=Psychodynamic Psychiatry|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=4|pages=549–73|pmid=23216396|doi=10.1521/pdps.2012.40.4.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined the internal working model with the attitudes, behaviours and emotional expression of the different styles to create a prototype based classification that included severity of insecurity. This model was designed to be clinically useful, allowing healthcare providers to identify and predict the behaviours of patients whose attachment systems were activated by pain and illness.

They distinguish the different attachment styles by; 1) attachment anxiety, the discomfort someone feels when separated, 2) attachment avoidance, which is discomfort associated with closeness and 3) severity of insecurity 
*Secure- Low anxiety, low avoidance, low severity of insecurity 
*Dismissive- Low anxiety, high avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Preoccupied- High anxiety, low avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Fearful- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity 
*Disorganized- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity. The difference between disorganized and fearful is that people with disorganized attachment do not use a consistent strategy to find security.

==Attachment and health outcomes==
Attachment and health interact on multiple levels. Attachment is a biologically based system tied to our response to distress and attachment styles appear to confer differences in stress physiology. Illness and pain themselves act as an “activating signal” for attachment systems, and health care providers act as attachment figures in their role addressing illness and pain. Accordingly, attachment styles influence patient perception of illness, health care utilization, medication compliance and treatment response.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feeney2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feeney|first1=J A|title=Implications of attachment style for patterns of health and illness|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|date=July 2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=277–288|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2214.2000.00146.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
While strong social support has been linked to greater resilience to stress and lower medical morbidity and mortality, the mechanism behind this association is poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozbay|first1=F|last2=Fitterling|first2=H|last3=Charney|first3=D|last4=Southwick|first4=S|title=Social support and resilience to stress across the life span: a neurobiologic framework|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=August 2008|volume=10|issue=4|pages=304–10|pmid=18627668|doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Paul Ciechanowski investigated the role of attachment styles in patients managing diabetes, finding that individuals with an avoidant-dismissive style were less likely to be compliant with treatment recommendations and had less well-controlled disease as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin.&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Russo|first2=J|last3=Katon|first3=W|last4=Von Korff|first4=M|last5=Ludman|first5=E|last6=Lin|first6=E|last7=Simon|first7=G|last8=Bush|first8=T|date=2004|title=Influence of patient attachment style on self-care and outcomes in diabetes|journal=Psychosomatic Medicinevolume=66|issue=5|pages=720–8|pmid=15385697|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=P|doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000138125.59122.23|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger scale evidence comes from a large American survey of self-reported attachment styles and physical illness conducted by McWilliams and Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McWilliams|first=Lachlan A.|last2=Bailey|first2=S.

Specifically, they found preoccupied individuals reported more heart disease, and dismissive individuals more pain conditions. A prospective study followed children until the age of 32 and found a similar pattern of results. They found that people with anxious-resistant (dismissive) styles of attachment reported vague, non-specific symptoms more often, and those with anxious-preoccupied classification had a higher rate of inflammation-based illnesses. This prospective study was particularly important because of the difficulty assigning causation in the often observed relationship between chronic pain and insecure attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=K.

Causal relationships between insecure attachment and mental illness may be complex.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eagle2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Some risk factors for insecure attachment such as loss of parental figure, and sexual or physical abuse, are also risk factors for mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="eagle2013" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=M.|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis: Theory, research and clinical|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-report measures of attachment may be biased by mental health conditions. For example, clinical depression is often associated with negative thoughts about the self, and this cognitive bias may influence the self-report in attachment questionnaires. There may be interpersonal consequences from untreated mental health conditions. Pre-existing psychological problems can increase the likelihood of secure attachment changing to insecure attachment over time.&lt;ref name="mikulincer&amp;shaver2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaver|first2=PR|date=February 2012|title=An attachment perspective on psychopathology|journal=World Psychiatry : Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)|volume=11|issue=1|pages=11–5|pmid=22294997|last1=Mikulincer|first1=M|doi=10.1016/j.wpsyc.2012.01.003|pmc=3266769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms by which Attachment Influences Health==
Maunder and Hunter outline 3 ways in which insecure attachment can serve as a risk factor for health problems: 1) it may increase one’s susceptibility to stress by changing stress physiology, 2) it may be related to potentially harmful behaviours undertaken to regulate affect, and 3) it may change the way people interact with the healthcare system.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;

===Attachment and Stress===
See also: [[stress (biology)]], [[stress (psychological)]]
The stress response in humans is largely governed by the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) and [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The HPA axis has garnered particular attention from attachment researchers because it is known to be activated by social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa M.|title=Contributions of Psychophysiology to Research on Adult Attachment: Review and Recommendations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=November 2001|volume=5|issue=4|pages=276–295|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_1|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.2676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal response for this system is to release stress hormones, particularly cortisol, for a brief duration and then shut itself off due to negative feedback, resulting in a short, strong release of cortisol. The HPA axis also follows a [[circadian rhythm]], with highest release within about 30 minutes to 1 hour upon awakening, called the cortisol response to awakening (CRA), and a slow taper throughout the day. Researchers have looked at both cortisol response to stress (CRS) and CRA to determine if attachment anxiety and avoidance underlie individual differences in HPA activity.

Findings in the field have inconsistent. The evidence suggests that (a) individuals with high attachment anxiety perceive a higher degree of distress when faced with a stressor and have higher baseline anxiety compared to those low in attachment anxiety,&lt;ref name="ditzen2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditzen|first1=B|last2=Schmidt|first2=S|last3=Strauss|first3=B|last4=Nater|first4=UM|last5=Ehlert|first5=U|last6=Heinrichs|first6=M|title=Adult attachment and social support interact to reduce psychological but not cortisol responses to stress|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=May 2008|volume=64|issue=5|pages=479–86|pmid=18440400|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maunder2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Robert G.|last2=Lancee|first2=William J.|last3=Nolan|first3=Robert P.|last4=Hunter|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Tannenbaum|first5=David W.|title=The relationship of attachment insecurity to subjective stress and autonomic function during standardized acute stress in healthy adults|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=March 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=283–290|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.08.013|pmid=16516661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidd2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Tara|last2=Hamer|first2=Mark|last3=Steptoe|first3=Andrew|title=Adult attachment style and cortisol responses across the day in older adults|journal=Psychophysiology|date=September 2013|volume=50|issue=9|pages=841–847|doi=10.1111/psyp.12075|pmid=23808770|pmc=4298031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitte2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewitte|first1=Marieke|last2=De Houwer|first2=Jan|last3=Goubert|first3=Liesbet|last4=Buysse|first4=Ann|title=A multi-modal approach to the study of attachment-related distress|journal=Biological Psychology|date=September 2010|volume=85|issue=1|pages=149–162|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.06.006|pmid=20600574|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1091912|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finding that those with fearful attachment would show small cortisol reactivity in response to a stressor may seem counterintuitive but is in line with the predictions of stress researcher [[Bruce McEwen]], who hypothesized that frequent early stressors in life would cause an initial hyper-reactivity in the HPA axis that would over time become pathologically sluggish as the individual ages, leading to greater overall cortisol release and less adaptive responsivity.&lt;ref name="mcewen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McEwen|first1=BS|title=Allostasis and allostatic load: implications for neuropsychopharmacology.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=February 2000|volume=22|issue=2|pages=108–24|pmid=10649824|doi=10.1016/s0893-133x(99)00129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related biological system that regulates stress response is the [[autonomic nervous system]]. In general, the sympathetic system is activated during times of stress and the parasympathetic system acts to decrease physical readiness for stress. These systems are sometimes called the “fight-or-flight” and “rest-or-digest” systems, respectively, and operate in a balance, as opposed to being totally on or off. Researchers can approximate the relative balance by looking at skin conductance, blood pressure and heart rate. Studies of this kind provided hard evidence that avoidant infants were truly distressed during the strange situation task&lt;ref name="gander2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gander|first1=Manuela|last2=Buchheim|first2=Anna|title=Attachment classification, psychophysiology and frontal EEG asymmetry across the lifespan: a review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=19 February 2015|volume=9|pages=79|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00079|pmid=25745393|pmc=4333768}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their minimally distressed appearance as they showed elevations in heart rate when caregivers were away and took longer to return to baseline when the caregiver returned in comparison to securely attached infants. Studies of skin conductance and heart rate in adults have shown that those with avoidant attachment and anxious attachment will show markers of increased distress during attachment and non-attachment stressors compared to those securely attached.&lt;ref name="maunder2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gander2015" /&gt;

===Health behaviours===
According to attachment theory people with insecure attachment have less effective strategies for dealing with negative emotions compared to people with secure attachment. One way in which insecurely individuals may try to regulate their distress is by using strategies or behaviours that are attractive for their short term relief but may have deleterious risks over years like eating, drug use or risky sex. 
In a survey of 356 primary care patients in Toronto, rates of smoking, harmful drinking and obesity, were all found to be highest in those with the most severe anxious and avoidant attachment.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have been linked in separate studies to increasing the risk of eating disorders and substance use in adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Kearney|first1=R|title=Attachment disruption in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: a review of theory and empirical research.|journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=September 1996|volume=20|issue=2|pages=115–27|pmid=8863063|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199609)20:2&lt;115::aid-eat1&gt;3.0.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Andreas|last2=Bröning|first2=Sonja|title=A Review on Attachment and Adolescent Substance Abuse: Empirical Evidence and Implications for Prevention and Treatment|journal=Substance Abuse|date=25 November 2014|volume=36|issue=3|pages=304–313|doi=10.1080/08897077.2014.983586|pmid=25424652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex'''
Risky sexual behaviour is defined as sexual contact with an increased risk of either unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. In a study aimed at evaluating the evidence supporting six major risky sex theories, Leslie Simons and her colleagues found that only the social support and attachment theory had strong empirical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=Leslie Gordon|last2=Sutton|first2=Tara E.|last3=Simons|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Gibbons|first4=Frederick X.|last5=Murry|first5=Velma McBride|title=Mechanisms That Link Parenting Practices to Adolescents’ Risky Sexual Behavior: A Test of Six Competing Theories|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2015|volume=45|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0409-7|pmid=26718543}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the attachment theory model, risk is enhanced in insecurely attached individuals due to negative working models of relationships, reduced closeness in intimate relationships and through decreased self-control. In terms of conscious motivations for sex, attachment anxiety is related to many attachment-related motivations including using sex for desire for emotional closeness, reassurance, self-esteem enhancement, stress reduction, the experience and exertion of power, elicitation of caregiving from a partner, protection from a partner’s anger or bad moods.&lt;ref name="davis2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Deborah|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip R.|last3=Vernon|first3=Michael L.|title=Attachment Style and Subjective Motivations for Sex|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 August 2004|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1076–1090|doi=10.1177/0146167204264794|pmid=15257790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those high in attachment avoidance report using sex for power or partner manipulation and endorse a desire to use sex as a way of avoiding emotional closeness.&lt;ref name="davis2004" /&gt; Accordingly, there is evidence that attachment avoidance is associated with positive attitudes towards casual sex, a higher number of casual sex partners, and an interest in emotionless sex and one-night stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beaulieu-Pelletier|first1=Genevieve|last2=Philippe|first2=Frederick L.|last3=Lecours|first3=Serge|last4=Couture|first4=Stéphanie|title=The role of attachment avoidance in extradyadic sex|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=2011|volume=13|issue=3|pages=293–313|doi=10.1080/14616734.2011.562419|pmid=21506032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Treatment adherence'''
Attachment insecurity also plays an important role in how people follow the advice of the healthcare community. Attachment avoidance has consistently been linked to poorer treatment adherence&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calia|first1=Rosaria|last2=Lai|first2=Carlo|last3=Aceto|first3=Paola|last4=Luciani|first4=Massimiliano|last5=Camardese|first5=Giovanni|last6=Lai|first6=Silvia|last7=Amato|first7=Giara|last8=Pietroni|first8=Valentina|last9=Salerno|first9=Maria Paola|last10=Pedroso|first10=Jose Alberto|last11=Romagnoli|first11=Jacopo|last12=Citterio|first12=Franco|title=Attachment style predict compliance, quality of life and renal function in adult patients after kidney transplant: preliminary results|journal=Renal Failure|date=2015|volume=37|issue=4|pages=678–680|doi=10.3109/0886022X.2015.1010989|pmid=25687387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=JK|last2=Fuertes|first2=JN|last3=Keitel|first3=M|last4=Phillips|first4=R|title=The role of patient attachment and working alliance on patient adherence, satisfaction, and health-related quality of life in lupus treatment|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=2011|volume=85|issue=1|pages=53–9|pmid=20869188|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently to no shows in scheduled follow up appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sockalingam|first1=Sanjeev|last2=Cassin|first2=Stephanie|last3=Hawa|first3=Raed|last4=Khan|first4=Attia|last5=Wnuk|first5=Susan|last6=Jackson|first6=Timothy|last7=Okrainec|first7=Allan|title=Predictors of Post-bariatric Surgery Appointment Attendance: the Role of Relationship Style|journal=Obesity Surgery|date=2013|volume=23|issue=12|pages=2026–2032|doi=10.1007/s11695-013-1009-9|pmid=23757051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment avoidance has also been linked to lower rates of cervical cancer screening in both American and Iranian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=EM|last2=Gick|first2=ML|title=Attachment and barriers to cervical screening|journal=Journal of Health Psychology|date=2013|volume=18|issue=5|pages=648–57|pmid=22933580|doi=10.1177/1359105312454910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hajializadeh|first1=K|last2=Ahadi|first2=H|last3=Jomehri|first3=F|last4=Rahgozar|first4=M|title=Psychosocial predictors of barriers to cervical cancer screening among Iranian women: the role of attachment style and social demographic factors|journal=Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene|date=2013|volume=54|issue=4|pages=218–22|pmid=24779284|pmc=4718322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare utilization===
Attachment theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance and people high in attachment anxiety would display different utilization of health care resources based on their prototypical behavioural responses when stressed.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt; The theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance, when faced with an illness, are likely to minimize their symptoms, and wait longer to see a health care provider, since they view their own distress as a sign of unacceptable vulnerability and also because their internal working model dictates that other people are not useful in helping them manage distress. For those high in attachment anxiety, they would have higher distress when faced with an illness, less perceived ability to manage it on their own, and thus visit health care services more frequently to try to attain security. For those with high anxiety and high avoidance, or fearful attachment, they would be predicted to present less frequently than those with secure attachment, but show up in a crisis when they do, which may interfere with optimal care. Research findings have generally been supportive of these predictions. One of the earliest studies in the field found correlations between preoccupied attachment and increased symptom reporting and an inverse relationship between avoidant attachment and visits to health professionals.&lt;ref name="feeney&amp;ryan1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ryan|first2=SM|date=July 1994|title=Attachment style and affect regulation: relationships with health behavior and family experiences of illness in a student sample|journal=Health Psychology : Official Journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association|volume=13|issue=4|pages=334–45|pmid=7957012|last1=Feeney|first1=JA|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.13.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt; High attachment anxiety has been associated with increased symptom reporting and visits to healthcare providers,&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Katon|first2=WJ|last3=Russo|first3=JE|last4=Walker|first4=EA|date=January 2001|title=The patient-provider relationship: attachment theory and adherence to treatment in diabetes.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=1|pages=29–35|pmid=11136630|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=PS|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high attachment avoidance associated with less visits and decreased treatment compliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=RE|last2=Marshall|first2=T|last3=Mann|first3=A|last4=Goldberg|first4=DP|title=Insecure attachment and frequent attendance in primary care: a longitudinal cohort study of medically unexplained symptom presentations in ten UK general practices.|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=2012|volume=42|issue=4|pages=855–64|pmid=21880165|doi=10.1017/s0033291711001589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=M.

'''Barkov Glacier''' ({{Coord|71|46|S|10|27|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] draining northeast between [[Mount Dallmann]] and the central part of the [[Shcherbakov Range]], in the [[Orvin Mountains]], [[Queen Maud Land]]. First photographed and roughly plotted by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]], 1938–39, it was mapped from air photos and surveys by the [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]], 1956–60, remapped by the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]], 1960–61, and named after Soviet geographer [[A.S. Barkov]].

'''Bio-1''' is a consortium of partners founded in 2007 designed to identify and promote bioscience in the [[Central New Jersey]] area. It is the result of a $5 million grant made available by the [[Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development]] (WIRED) program.

==Mission statement==

Bio-1’s goal is to make Central New Jersey (CNJ) the next “hot spot” for the global bioscience industry, by creating high-quality, high-paying jobs and a skilled workforce. The five-county BIO-1 partnership is named for the Route 1 corridor from Rutgers to Princeton, around which most of CNJ’s biotech firms are clustered. The CNJ region, comprising [[Hunterdon]], [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer]], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]], and [[Somerset County, NJ|Somerset]] counties, has received $5 million, available under the Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) program from the [[United States Department of Labor]] (USDOL). The WIRED grant will be used to transform the rich array of existing bioscience education and training and economic development initiatives into an into a world class bioscience talent development system.

The partnership has its roots in an initiative created by Governor [[Jon Corzine]] as part of his statewide economic strategy. This is the third WIRED investment in New Jersey, making it “the most WIRED state” in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio-one.org/about.html Growing and Developing Central New Jersey's Bioscience Workforce] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724101527/http://bio-one.org/about.html |date=July 24, 2008 }} 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

In collaboration with representatives of all key players in the biosciences in CNJ, the Bio-1 initiative will focus on six key strategies:

* Excite young people about the bio-sciences, especially focusing on underrepresented groups.
* Create a consortium of biotechnology educators from the high school through university levels that will facilitate smooth career pathways through articulation agreements, mentoring and professional development.
* Transform graduate education with the development of professional science master's degrees that integrate business and science, and interdisciplinary Ph.D. programs in biotech areas.
* Increase bioscience workforce development with education and training opportunities. A “flak jackets to lab coats” initiative, for example, will focus on training and job placement in the bioscience industry for returning veterans.
* Enhance linkages between education and industry through internships, cooperative education and mentoring.
* Facilitate globally competitive “biobusinesses” by encouraging collaboration between business and education, supporting bioscience start-ups and leveraging existing global networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio-one.org/about.html How will Bio-1 achieve its goal?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724101527/http://bio-one.org/about.html |date=July 24, 2008 }} 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bioindustry Park Silvano Fumero''' (BiPCa) is a [[Science park|Science and Technology Park]] located in [[Canavese]] near [[Turin]] in the north-west of [[Italy]].
The park was founded to promote and develop [[biotechnological]] research, to host companies operating [[research and development]], and pilot production in the [[life science]] sector. Companies such as [[Serono|Merck Serono]] and Bracco chose the Park as the location for their research and development activities.

==Services==
The Park offers a complete set of support services to R&amp;D activities, not only offering research facilities and scientific services, but also flexible and attractive financing solutions, sound project management and results evaluation. 

The park is the owner of the '''Laboratory for Advanced Methodologies''' (LIMA) which performs exploitation of scientific results in the fields of [[Chemistry]], [[Molecular Biology]], [[Proteomics]] and [[Bioinformatics]]. LIMA, thanks to its solid co-operation with the [[University of Turin]] and CNR ISPA ([[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]]), is also a permanent training site for graduates and researchers. 

A University Center in Imaging Technologies ('''CEIP''') managed by University of Torino is also active and is focused on the use of different technologies ([[MRI]], [[Ultrasound]], [[X-ray]], etc.) in order to evaluate new solutions in the diagnosis and assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of [[drug]]s.

==Start-ups==
In 2005 BiPCa has launched, with the support of [[Regions of Italy|Regione]] [[Piemonte]], the '''Discovery''' initiative to identify and select innovative entrepreneurial ideas in the Biotech field. Eight start-ups have already been created from the beginning of the project in partnership with Eporgen venture, a [[Seed capital]] company focused on investment in new innovative entrepreneurial projects in the biotech field.

==Local cluster==
Bioindustry Park is also acting as system integrator for the development of a [[Business cluster|local cluster]], bioPmed (http://www.biopmed.eu).
Since 2009 Bioindustry Park acts as cluster management company for the development of the regional cluster bioPmed (www.biopmed.eu) on biotech and medtech. Created thanks to Regione Piemonte, it gathers more than 60 companies, research centres and three academic institutions (University of Turin, Università del Piemonte Orientale and  [[Turin Polythecnic]]), who signed an agreement to create, build, support and animate the local cluster. 

All the activities are carried out in cooperation with strong local actors, such as Turin Province and Turin Chamber of Commerce, CEIPiemonte, ALPS EEN and Patlib network and synergies with other local R&amp;D initiatives are in place. The cluster is also founding member of the AlpsBioCluster (www.alpsbiocluster.eu) together with [[ Rhône-Alpes]] Region (France), Lombardy, South Tirol, Bavaria  and Western Switzerland that intends to promote and foster transalpine competitiveness in the biotech and [[medical science]]s sectors.

'''Bisalog''', also ''Tagbis'', is a [[portmanteau]] of the words 'Bisaya' and 'Tagalog' which refers to either a [[Visayan languages|Visayan language]] or [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] being infused with words or expressions from the other.

Speakers of Bisalog may often [[Code-switching|code-switch]] with [[Philippine English|English]], as well, resulting in what is sometimes called ''Bistaglish'' or ''Tagbislish''.

The word also used by radio station [[DZRH]] as a news/talk show where it brings the latest news from around the provinces (via [[Aksyon Radyo]]) every Sunday at 7am.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3265">The '''Chanchlani Global Health Research Award''' is a Canadian health sciences award that recognizes a world leading scholar in the area of Global Health. Each year a discipline within Global Health (i.e. Determinants of Health, Policy Development, and Innovative Solutions) is chosen by the internal review committee at [[McMaster University]]. The review committee then selects the leading researcher based on interview and impact in the field. The award recipient receives a monetary prize of $25,000 and opportunity to present their research findings to researchers and students.

The award provides opportunities for informal scientific exchanges between the scientist/scholar and faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate medical students. The award was created by the [[Vasu Chanchlani|Chanchlani Family]] through $1 Million endowment along with a $250,000 donation at the [[McMaster University]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHANCHLANI GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AWARD|url=http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/pgp/chanchlani_global_health_research_award.html|publisher=McMaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15611">'''DNA teleportation''' (also called '''DNA transduction''') is a pseudoscientific claim that [[DNA]] produces [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic signals]] (EMS), measurable when highly diluted in water.

Here they claim that the electromagnetic waves could be explained in terms of quantum effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montagnier|first1=Luc|last2=Del Giudice|first2=Emilio|last3=Aïssa|first3=Jamal|last4=Lavallee|first4=Claude|last5=Motschwiller|first5=Steven|last6=Capolupo|first6=Antonio|last7=Polcari|first7=Albino|last8=Romano|first8=Paola|last9=Tedeschi|first9=Alberto|last10=Vitiello|first10=Giuseppe|title=Transduction of DNA information through water and electromagnetic waves|journal=Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine|date=2015|volume=34|issue=2|pages=106–112|doi=10.3109/15368378.2015.1036072|pmid=26098521|arxiv=1501.01620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetic signals of DNA==

===Bacterial DNA===
In 2009, Montagnier and his collaborators published a paper titled "Electromagnetic signals are produced by aqueous nanostructures derived from bacterial DNA sequences" in which they showed that bacterial DNA can produce electromagnetic signal (EMS) that is transferred through the cell culture medium.&lt;ref name=mont09/&gt; They used the DNA of bacteria ''Micoplasma pirum'' and ''Escherichia coli'' cultured in a [[T cell|T lymphocyte]] (a type of white blood cell) culture medium. They took the solution of the culture medium with all the bacteria filtered off. Absence of bacterial DNA was ascertained by [[polymerase chain reaction]]. When the solution was simply incubated for two or three weeks, the bacterial DNA was detected. They diluted the solution several times and tested for electromagnetic radiation using Fourier analysis by a method developed by Jacques Benveniste and his team in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benveniste|first1=J|last2= Jurgens|first2=P|last3=Assa|first3=J|year=1996|title=Digital recording/transmission of the cholinergic signal|journal= FASEB Journal|volume=10|issue=6|pages=2761–2761}}&lt;/ref&gt; They detected electromagnetic frequencies only at high dilutions, such as ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=mont09/&gt;

===Viral DNA===
In a subsequent paper published in the same year, they reported similar EMS from the DNA of HIV under high dilution of the culture medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montagnier|first1=Luc|last2=Aïssa|first2=Jamal|last3=Lavallée|first3=Claude|last4=Mbamy|first4=Mireille|last5=Varon|first5=Joseph|last6=Chenal|first6=Henri|title=Electromagnetic detection of HIV DNA in the blood of AIDS patients treated by antiretroviral therapy|journal=Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences|date=2009|volume=1|issue=4|pages=245–253|doi=10.1007/s12539-009-0059-0|pmid=20640802}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the prototype virus, HIV1 strain (the discovery for which Montangier shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The experiment is more sophisticated. They used CEM cells (T cell leukemia cells) to culture the virus (HIV infected the cells). No EMS was detected an any concentration. They tested blood samples of different HIV-infected patients, such as those showing symptoms of AIDS, treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), and untreated individuals. They found that EMS were detectable in plasma dilutions between 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. The blood samples were only from patients previously treated with ART and having no detectable viral DNA copies in their blood.

The experiment was first made in July 2005, and was repeated and filmed for a TV documentary in 2013, released on the French channel France 5 on 5 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MANIL|first1=Christian|title=On a retrouvé la mémoire de l'eau|agency=France Télévisions|url=http://www.france5.fr/et-vous/France-5-et-vous/Les-programmes/LE-MAG-N-28-2014/articles/p-20549-On-a-retrouve-la-memoire-de-l-eau.htm|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=France 5|publisher=Doc en Stock, and France Télévisions|date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal ''Ouvertures'' detailed the test protocol through interviews with Montagnier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LOMBARD|first1=Eric|title=Le Pr. Luc Montagnier a-t-il retrouvé la mémoire de l’eau ?|url=http://www.ouvertures.net/luc-montagnier-retrouve-memoire-eau/|website=Ouvertures|publisher=Ouvertures|accessdate=8 November 2014|ref=http://www.ouvertures.net/luc-montagnier-retrouve-memoire-eau/|language=fr-FR|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montagnier's experiment can be summarised as follows:

#A known water sample with 2&amp;nbsp;ng/ml of 104 bases DNA from an HIV infected patient is diluted by 10 into water and agitated for 15 seconds. After filtration to remove the DNA, the dilution and agitation steps are repeated 10 times, reaching high dilution levels of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.
#The highly diluted sample emits [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic signals]] (EMS) of low frequencies.
#This EMS is recorded by a microphone coil and saved as a 6-second WAV file at the lab in Paris.
#The WAV file is emailed to a partner team at the university of Benevento in Italy.
#The Italian team emits with a coil for 1 hour the EMS of the WAV file on a sample of distilled water in a sealed metal tube.
#The water sample is then placed in a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) machine.
#The PCR machine in Italy produces DNA, 98% identical to the initial DNA in Paris.

==Interpretation==
{{Incomprehensible|date=September 2017}}
It is proposed by Montagnier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montagnier|first1=L|last2=Aissa|first2=J|last3=Giudice|first3=E Del|last4=Lavallee|first4=C|last5=Tedeschi|first5=A|last6=Vitiello|first6=G|title=DNA waves and water|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=8 July 2011|volume=306|pages=012007|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/306/1/012007|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/306/1/012007/meta;jsessionid=CD2C5517F67A4A8300B83F8B0700B486.c1.iopscience.cld.iop.org|arxiv=1012.5166}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some molecules interact through electromagnetic waves instead of direct contact.{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}} These waves could be trapped into coherence domains formed by water molecules vacuum spheres at quantum scales. These structures would keep the signal in the absence of the original molecule. During the PRC step of the experiment, this remaining signal could have contained the necessary information for the initial DNA to be reconstructed.{{Failed verification|date=September 2017}}

The principle is similar to Benveniste's experiment from 1997&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benveniste|first1=J|last2=Jurgens|first2=P|last3=Hsueh|first3=W|last4=Aïssa|first4=J|title=Transatlantic Transfer of Digitized Antigen Signal by Telephone Link|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1997|volume=99|issue=1|pages=S101–S200|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(97)81064-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where EMS was recorded from [[ovalbumine]] at the [[Northwestern University]] Medical School of Chicago, and transmitted through email to Benvenist's [[Digital Biology]] Laboratory in Clamart, France. After emitting the signal on pure water for 20 minutes, the water could cause an allergic shock on an isolated Guinea-pig heart allergic to ovalbumine. In both experiments the EMS reproduces the properties of the original molecules in their absence.

==Responses and criticisms==

The 2009 publications immediately followed scientific comments and criticisms on the credibility of the purported phenomenon, as well as the authenticity of the research. According to Jeff Reimers of the University of Sydney, Australia, "If the results are correct, these would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry." [[Gary Schuster]], at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, compared it to [[pathological science]].&lt;ref name=coghlan11/&gt;

The credibility of the peer-review system of the journal ''Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences'', in which the 2009 papers were published, was questioned. It was a new journal of which Montagnier is chairman of the editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences'' The Editorial Board|url=https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/systems+biology+and+bioinformatics/journal/12539?detailsPage=editorialBoard|publisher=Springer|accessdate=4 June 2016|issn=1867-1462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PZ Myers]] at the University of Minnesota Morris also described it as "pathological science." He described the paper as "one of the more unprofessional write-ups I've ever run across" and criticized the publication process as having an "unbelievable" turnaround time: "another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 03 January 2009, revised on 05 January 2009, and accepted on 06 January 2009", leading him to ask: "Who reviewed this, the author's mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the chairman of the editorial board is: Luc Montagnier... This is the same nonsense and the same apparatus that Benveniste was peddling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myers|first1=PZ|title=It almost makes me disbelieve that HIV causes AIDS!|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/24/it-almost-makes-me-disbelieve/|website=Pharyngula|publisher=ScienceBlogs LLC.|accessdate=4 June 2016|ref=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Benveniste can also be inferred from one of the co-authors, Jamal Aïssa, who was Benveniste's collaborator in the research in which they claim that water memory can be transported through the internet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; (It was for this research that Benveniste received his second [[IgNobel Prize]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadis|first1=Steve|title=French scientist shrugs off winning his second Ig Nobel prize|journal=Nature|date=1998|volume=395|issue=6702|pages=535–535|doi=10.1038/26831|bibcode=1998Natur.395..535N}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Philip Ball]] wrote an analysis about Montagnier's work in ''[[Chemistry World]]'', stating "It looks like one of the most astonishing discoveries in a century, yet it was almost entirely ignored." He claims this experiment was never replicated and that the work was "ignored for good reason, namely that it’s utterly implausible".&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/dna-waves-dont-wash/6373.article |title= DNA waves don't wash |work=Chemistry World |last=Ball |first=Philip |date=10 July 2013|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2010, Montagnier spoke at the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]] in Germany,&lt;ref name=Lindau&gt;[http://www.lindau-nobel.org/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=278 Program (2010 – 60th Meeting of Nobel Laureates (3rd interdisciplinary))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217005305/http://lindau-nobel.org/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=278 |date=2010-12-17 }}, Meeting on 28 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "where 60 Nobel prize winners had gathered, along with 700 other scientists, to discuss the latest breakthroughs in medicine, chemistry and physics."&lt;ref name=Australian/&gt; He "stunned his colleagues ... when he presented a new method for detecting viral infections that bore close parallels to the basic tenets of homeopathy. Although fellow Nobel prize winners – who view [[homeopathy]] as [[quackery]] – were left openly shaking their heads, Montagnier's comments were rapidly embraced by homeopaths eager for greater credibility. Cristal Sumner, of the [[British Homeopathic Association]], said Montagnier's work gave homeopathy 'a true scientific ethos'."&lt;ref name=Australian&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/nobel-laureate-gives-homeopathy-a-boost/story-e6frg8y6-1225887772305 Nobel laureate gives homeopathy a boost.] ''[[The Australian]]'' 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Montagnier was also questioned about his beliefs on homeopathy, to which he replied: "I can’t say that homeopathy is right in everything. What I can say now is that the high dilutions are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules. We find that with DNA, we cannot work at the extremely high dilutions used in homeopathy; we cannot go further than a 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; dilution, or we lose the signal. But even at 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;, you can calculate that there is not a single molecule of DNA left. And yet we detect a signal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enserink|first1=M.|title=French Nobelist Escapes 'Intellectual Terror' to Pursue Radical Ideas in China|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47426344/Luc-Montagnier-French-Nobelist-on-homeopathy |journal=Science|date=2010|volume=330|issue=6012|pages=1732–1732|doi=10.1126/science.330.6012.1732|pmid=21205644|bibcode=2010Sci...330.1732E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|directly landing on the Moon or other body|direct injection|Parking orbit}}
'''Direct ascent''' is a method of landing a spacecraft on the Moon or another planet directly, without first assembling the vehicle in Earth orbit, or carrying a separate landing vehicle into orbit around the target body. It was proposed as the first method to achieve a manned lunar landing in the United States [[Apollo program]], but was rejected because it would have required developing a prohibitively large [[launch vehicle]]. It was used to launch uncrewed lunar landers in the United States [[Surveyor program]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna programme|Luna program]].

==Apollo program==
[[Image:Apollo Direct Ascent.png|thumb|right|190px|Artist's conception of an early Apollo spacecraft that would have used direct ascent]]
The [[Apollo program]] was initially planned based on the assumption that direct ascent would be used.&lt;ref name=apollo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=NASA - Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program|publisher=NASA|date=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have required developing an enormous [[launch vehicle]], either the [[Saturn C-8]] or [[Nova rocket]], to launch the three-man [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo spacecraft]], with an attached landing module, directly to the Moon, where it would land tail-first and then launch off the Moon for the return to Earth.  The other two options that [[NASA]] considered required a somewhat smaller launch vehicle, either the [[Saturn C-4]] or [[Saturn V|C-5]]. These were [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous#Apollo|Earth Orbit Rendezvous]], which would have involved at least two launches to assemble the direct-landing and return vehicle in orbit; and [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] (LOR), which carried a smaller two-man [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]] spacecraft for flight between lunar orbit and the surface. LOR was the strategy used successfully in Apollo.&lt;ref name=apollo/&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] also considered several direct ascent strategies, though in the end they settled on an approach similar to NASA's: two men in a [[Soyuz spacecraft]] with a one-man [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]] lander.  The failure of the Soviets' [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] delayed their lunar program substantially, however, and they were nowhere close to a successful N1 launch when [[Apollo 11]] lifted off and made the first manned [[lunar landing]]. The Soviets had planned to use an [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]], which looked much like a smaller version of the spider-like [[Lunar Module]], although [[OKB-52]] continued to develop the [[UR-700]] modular booster for the direct ascent [[LK-700]] ship.

[[Science fiction]] movies such as ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' had frequently depicted direct ascent missions.

[[File:Economic Recovery sign Clean.png|thumb|A "Project funded by [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]]" project sign]]
An '''economic recovery''' is the phase of the [[business cycle]] following a [[recession]], during which an economy regains and exceeds peak employment and output levels achieved prior to downturn. A recovery period is typically characterized by abnormally high levels of growth in real [[gross domestic product]], employment, corporate profits, and other indicators.

This is a turning point from Contraction to Expansion. This often results in increase in consumer confidence.

The United States of America experienced an economic recovery following the 'Great Recession' of 2008. The United States AMI (Average Median Income) has not statically changed in a dramatic since the end of the Johnson  Administration (inflation adjusted).  This is due to a lack of [[industrial policy]] in the United States over the last 50 years, and an over-reliance on [[Classical liberalism|laissez faire]] economics in this era.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Russian electric bath.jpg|thumb|High voltage electric bath c. 1890s–1900s]]

An '''electric bath''' is a 19th-century medical treatment in which high-voltage electrical apparatus was used for electrifying patients by causing an [[electric charge]] to build up on their bodies.  In the US this process was known as '''Franklinization''' after [[Benjamin Franklin]].  The process became widely known after Franklin described it in the mid-18th century, but after that it was mostly practiced by [[quackery|quacks]].  [[Golding Bird]] brought it into the mainstream at [[Guy's Hospital]] in the mid-19th century and it fell into disuse in the early 20th century.

== Description ==
[[File:Reeve 41435 electrotherapy.jpg|thumb|Assorted electrotherapy electrodes c. 1918–1920s]]
The source of electricity for an electric bath was usually a [[frictional electrical machine]].  The patient was seated on a wooden stool, and both the patient and the stool insulated from ground by a platform on glass legs or some other insulator.  In some arrangements, the patient was lying down rather than seated.  The patient was then charged with [[static electricity]] either by direct connection to one electrode of the generator (usually the positive), or else through [[electrostatic induction]] by holding a large electrode close to the patient's body.  The [[electric tension]] applied was around {{nowrap|30–50 [[kilovolt|kV]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Chalovich, 20' 30"&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment could take several hours.  Following charging the patient was "bathed" in electricity, hence the name of the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Morus, pp. 235–236|Coley, p. 368|Bird, p. 85|Schiffer (2006), pp. 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be observed in a darkened room as a luminous discharge around the patient, especially at the hair and extremeties.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric bath treatment was painless, but it caused the patient to warm and sweat, and the heart rate to increase.  It also caused the hair to stand on end.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Schiffer (2006), p. 137|Bird, p. 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electric bath could form a treatment in itself.  It could also be the first stage in further treatment.  A common procedure was to draw sparks from the patient after charging, especially from the spine.&lt;ref&gt;Morus, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Electricity had been in use for medical treatment since the mid-18th century.  However, this was mainly at the hands of [[quackery|quacks]] and [[charlatan]]s, often promoting the treatment as a [[universal panacea]].  One notorious fringe practitioner using the electric bath was [[James Graham (sexologist)|James Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer (2006), pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;  It was brought into the mainstream by [[Golding Bird]] at [[Guy's Hospital]] who ran the "electrifying room" there from 1836.  This was not the first time electricity had been used as a treatment in a hospital, but Bird was the first to study its efficacy with scientific rigour.  According to [[Thomas Addison]], past hospital use had been "vague and indiscriminate".  Bird was well aware of the need to overcome this bad reputation and convince his colleagues.  In a series of ''Guy's Hospital Reports'', Bird identified specific treatments for specific conditions based on case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Morus, pp. 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;  He was quick to highlight conditions that could not be treated so that his work was distinguished from the charlatans.  Nevertheless, [[electrotherapy]] was usually considered a treatment of last resort when all else had failed.&lt;ref&gt;Morus, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird's most common use of the electric bath was to use the electric charge on the patient to draw off sparks by placing another electrode near the point of treatment.  He used this method on the spine of [[chorea]] sufferers with some success.&lt;ref&gt;Morus, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  Another condition for which Bird used this treatment was [[wrist drop]] caused by [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, pp. 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Bird found that there were some conditions for which this treatment did not work, mostly conditions where the brain or nervous system had been damaged such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;Coley, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of charging up a patient with static electricity was called ''Franklinization'' after [[Benjamin Franklin]] briefly experimented in this field.  He attempted to treat a number of [[paralytic]]s, first with [[electric shock treatment|electric shock]]s, and then with static charging, but without much success.  He described these procedures in a letter of 1757.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer (2006), pp. 136–137, 301&lt;/ref&gt;  Franklinization could also be applied locally to a wound or specific patch of skin with a hand-held array of needle electrodes.  The intention was often to generate a "static breeze", a wind of ionized air over the skin.  Alternatively, the intention could be to breathe in the ionized air as a form of [[ozone therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Chalovich, 40' 40"|Pinchuk ''et al.'', p. 277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric bath apparatus for medical use were still for sale as late as 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer (2001), p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, prior to forming E4D, Katie Gibbs was one of the organizers for the Death of Evidence protest in Ottawa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/business/Scientists+stage+mock+funeral+protest+cuts+research/6913396/story.html|title=Scientists stage mock funeral to protest cuts to research|last=Smith|first=Teresa|date=2012-07-09|work=Canada.com|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/scientists-rally-on-parliament-hill-to-mourn-death-of-evidence-1.1237215|title=Scientists rally on Parliament Hill to mourn 'death of evidence' {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2,000 scientists and supporters attended the protest, which was in the form of a mock funeral, to protest then Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s government funding cuts to basic science research and in response to Bill C-38.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-rough-guide-to-bill-c-38/|title=A rough guide to Bill C-38 - Macleans.ca|date=2012-06-06|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/264793/scientists-march-to-parliament-hill-to-protest-death-of-evidence-3/|title=Scientists march to Parliament Hill to protest ‘death of evidence’|work=Global News|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest's success prompted Gibbs to co-found E4D.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/01/canada-war-on-science/514322/|title=Looking Back at Canada's Political Fight Over Science|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|date=2017-01-26|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
E4D advocates for evidence-based policy-making and to build a national culture where science and evidence are valued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://in-sightjournal.com/2016/04/01/an-interview-with-dr-katie-gibbs-2/#_ftn9|title=An Interview with Dr. Katie Gibbs|date=2016-04-01|work=In-Sight Publishing|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; E4D primarily launches issue-based campaigns to address current issues which affect science, alongside panels, lectures, workshops and documentary screenings, to provide knowledge and skill-based training to the scientific community, as well as the broader public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Notable campaigns ==
On 16 September 2013, E4D collaborated with local organizers to hold Stand Up for Science protests in 17 cities (including [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]]), to voice concerns for the state of science in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/when-scientists-become-activists/|title=When scientists become activists {{!}} University Affairs|work=University Affairs|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/scientists-aim-to-put-state-of-canadian-research-in-the-public-spotlight-with-demonstrations/article14332546/|title=Scientists push campaign for evidence-based decision making from government|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idees-ideas.ca/blog/scientists-stand-across-canada|title=Scientists stand up across Canada {{!}} Fédération des sciences humaines|website=www.idees-ideas.ca|language=fr|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stand-up-for-science-rallies-target-federal-government-1.1855977|title=Stop stifling science, protesters tell Ottawa {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/en/content/stand-science|title=Stand Up for Science!|date=2013-08-28|work=Evidence For Democracy|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous science advocacy, coupled with the Stand Up for Science protests across Canada, helped place science as a key campaign issue in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 Canadian federal elections]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/3397989/canada-history-march-for-science/|title=Canada’s complicated history with scientific freedom|work=Global News|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the [[Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada]] and E4D submitted an open letter with over 5,000 Canadians signatures, to the Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], Minister [[Navdeep Bains]], and Minister [[Kirsty Duncan]], to safeguard government scientists' right to speak through collective agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/sites/default/files/letter-pipsc-e4d-e.pdf|title=Science integrity enshrined in collective agreements|last=|first=|date=|website=Evidence For Democracry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/en/success-science-integrity|title=Success!

'''''Feynman's Lost Lecture: The  Motion of Planets Around the Sun''''' is a book based on a lecture by [[Richard Feynman]].  Restoration of the lecture notes and conversion into book form was undertaken by [[Caltech]] physicist [[David L. Goodstein]] and archivist [[Judith R. Goodstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Reviews of ''Feynman's Lost Lecture'':

&lt;/ref&gt; Feynman had given the lecture on the motion of bodies at Caltech on March 13, 1964, but the notes and pictures were lost for a number of years and consequently not included in ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' series.  The lecture notes were later found, but unfortunately without the photographs of his illustrative [[chalkboard]] drawings.  One of the editors, David L. Goodstein, stated that at first without the photographs, it was very hard to figure out what diagrams he was referring to in the audiotapes, but a later finding of his own private lecture notes made it possible to understand completely the logical framework with which Feynman delivered the lecture.

==Overview==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''You can explain to people who don't know much of the physics, the early history... how Newton discovered... Kepler's Laws, and equal areas, and that means it's toward the sun, and all this stuff.  And then the key - they always ask then, "Well, how do you see that it's an ellipse if it's the inverse square?"  Well, it's God damned hard, there's no question of that.  But I tried to find the simplest one I could.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bruno Bitencourt Luiz|title=Richard Feynman's Lost Lecture - Complete|date=2016-03-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcD-5UfY1g0&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a non-course lecture delivered to a freshman physics audience, Feynman undertakes to present an elementary, geometric demonstration of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s discovery of the fact that [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s first observation, that the planets travel in elliptical orbits, is a necessary consequence of Kepler's other two observations.

The structure of Feynman's lecture:
* A historical introduction to the material
* An overview of some geometric properties of an ellipse
* Newton's demonstration that equal areas in equal times is equivalent to forces toward the sun
* Feynman's demonstration that equal changes in velocity occur in equal angles in the orbit
* Feynman's demonstration, using techniques of [[Ugo Fano]], that these velocity changes imply that the orbit is elliptical
* Discussion of [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|Rutherford's experiments]] with scattering of [[alpha particle]]s, and the discovery of the [[atomic nucleus]]

The audio recording of the lectures also includes twenty minutes of informal Q&amp;A at the blackboard with students who had attended the lecture.

{{crystallization}}
In chemistry, '''fractional crystallization''' is a method of [[refining]] substances based on differences in [[soluble|solubility]]. It [[fractionation|fractionates]] via differences in [[crystallization]] (forming of [[crystal]]s). If a mixture of two or more substances in solution are allowed to crystallize, for example by allowing the temperature of the solution to decrease or increase, the [[precipitate]] will contain more of the least soluble substance. The proportion of components in the precipitate will depend on their [[solubility product]]s. If the solubility products are very similar, a [[Cascade (chemical engineering)|cascade process]] will be needed to effectuate a complete separation.    
This technique is often used in [[chemical engineering]] to obtain very pure substances, or to recover saleable products from waste solutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13149">{{for|the 1976 book|The Hunting Hypothesis}}
In [[paleoanthropology]], the '''hunting hypothesis''' is the hypothesis that [[human evolution]] was primarily influenced by the activity of [[hunting]] for relatively large and fast animals, and that the activity of  hunting  distinguished human ancestors from other [[hominins]].

While it is undisputed that early humans were hunters, the importance of this fact for the final steps in the emergence of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' out of earlier [[australopithecines]], with its [[bipedalism]] and production of [[stone tool]]s (from about 2.5 million years ago), and eventually also [[control of fire]] (from about 1.5 million years ago), are emphasized in the "hunting hypothesis", and de-emphasized in scenarios that stress the [[omnivore]] status of humans as their recipe for success, and [[social interaction]], including [[mating|mating behaviour]] as essential in the emergence of language and culture.

Advocates of the hunting hypothesis tend to believe that [[tool]] use and toolmaking essential to effective hunting were an extremely important part of human evolution, and trace the  [[origin of language]] and [[prehistoric religion|religion]] to a hunting context.

As societal evidence Buss cites that modern tribal population deploy hunting as their primary way of acquiring food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buss|first1=David|title=Evolutionary Psychology: The new Science of the Mind.|date=1999|publisher=Needham Heights: Allyn &amp; Bacon.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aka people|Aka pygmies]] in the [[Central African Republic]] spend 56% of their quest for nourishment hunting, 27% gathering, and 17% processing food. Additionally, the [[!Kung]] in Botswana retain 40% of their calories from hunting and this percentage varies from 20% to 90% depending on the season.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;Buss, David M. Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  For physical evidence Buss first looks to the guts of humans and apes.  The human gut consists mainly of the small [[intestines]], which are responsible for the rapid breakdown of proteins and absorption of nutrients. The ape’s gut is primarily [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], which indicates a vegetarian diet. This structural difference supports the hunting hypothesis in being an evolutionary branching point between modern humans and modern primates. Buss also cites human teeth in that fossilized human teeth have a thin enamel coating with very little heavy wear and tear that would result from a plant diet. The absence of thick enamel also indicates that historically humans have maintained a meat-heavy diet.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  Buss notes that the bones of animals human ancestors killed found at Olduvai Gorge have cut marks at strategic points on the bones that indicate tool usage and provide evidence for ancestral butchers.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

==Applications ==
===[[Sexual division of labor (evolutionary perspective)]]===
According to the hunting hypothesis, women are preoccupied with pregnancy and dependent children and so do not hunt because it is dangerous and less profitable. Gijsbert Stoet highlights the fact that men are more competent in throwing skills, focused attention, and spatial abilities. (Experiments 1 and 2).&lt;ref name = "Stoet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gisbert | year = 2011 | title = Sex Differences in Search and Gathering Skills | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 416–22 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting.&lt;ref name="Stoet"/&gt;

==Provisioning hypothesis==
===Parental investment===
Buss purports that the hunting hypothesis explains the high level of human male parental investment in offspring as compared to primates. Meat is an economical and condensed food resource in that it can be brought home to feed the young, however it is not efficient to carry low-calorie food across great distances. Thus, the act of hunting and the required transportation of the kill in order to feed offspring is a reasonable explanation for human male provisioning.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

===Male coalitions===
Buss suggests that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, they tend to be temporary and opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for community consumption increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; 
Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He suggests that male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;

Hawkes proposes that hunters pursue large game and divide the kill across the group. Hunters compete to divvy up the kill to signal courage, power, generosity, prosocial intent, and dedication. By engaging in these activities, hunters receive reproductive benefits and respect.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolin | first1 = David A | year = 2010 | title = Food-Sharing Networks in Lamalera, Indonesia | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513811001188 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 243–68 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.11.003| pmc = 3398706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reproductive benefits lead to greater reproductive success in more skilled hunters.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt; Evidence of these hunting goals that do not only benefit the families of the hunters are in the [[Aché people|Ache]] and [[Hadza people|Hadza]] men. Hawkes notes that their hunting techniques are less efficient than alternative methods and are energetically costly, but the men place more importance on displaying their bravery, power, and prosocial intent than on hunting efficiency. This method is different as compared to other societies where hunters retain the control of their kills and signal their intent of sharing. This alternate method aligns with the coalition support hypothesis, in efforts to create and preserve political associations.&lt;ref name = "Nolin"/&gt;

===Reciprocal altruism===
The meat from successful large game hunts are more than what a single hunter can consume. Further, hunting success varies by week. One week a hunter may succeed in hunting large game and the next may return with no meat. In this situation Buss suggests that there are low costs to giving away meat that cannot be eaten by the individual hunter on his own and large benefits from the expectation of the returned favor in a week where his hunting is not successful.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes calls this sharing “tolerated theft” and purports that the benefits of reciprocal altruism stem from the result that families will experience “lower daily variation and higher daily average” in their resources.&lt;ref name = "Hawkes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkes | first1 = Kristen | year = 1991 | title = Showing Off Tests of an Hypothesis About Men's Foraging Goals | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016230959190011E | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 29–54 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(91)90011-E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisioning may actually be a form of sexual competition between males for females.&lt;ref name = "Norton"&gt;Larsen, Clark S. "Early Hominid Origins and Evolution: The Roots of Humanity." Chapter 10:. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, n.d. Web. 15 Nov. 2012. &lt;http://www.wwnorton.com/college/anthro/our-origins2/ch/10/outline.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkes suggests that male provisioning is a particularly human behavior, which forges the nuclear family.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The structure of familial provisioning determines a form of resource distribution. However, Hawkes does acknowledge inconsistencies across societies and contexts such as the fluctuating time courses dedicated to hunting and gathering, which are not directly correlated with return rates, the fact that nutrition value is often chosen over caloric count, and the fact that meat is a more widely spread resource than other resources.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

===The show-off hypothesis===
The show-off hypothesis is the concept that more successful men have better mate options. The idea relates back to the fact that meat, the result of hunting expeditions, is a distinct resource in that it comes in large quantities that more often than not the hunter’s own family is not able to consume in a timely manner so that the meat doesn’t go sour.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Also the success of hunting is unpredictable whereas berries and fruits, unless there is a drought or a bad bush, are fairly consistent in seasonality. Kristen Hawkes argues that women favor neighbors opting for men who provide the advantageous, yet infrequent meat feasts.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; These women may profit from alliance and the resulting feasts, especially in times of shortage. Hawkes suggests that it would be beneficial for women to reward men who employ the “show-off strategy” by supporting them in a dispute, caring for their offspring, or providing sexual favors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; The benefits women may gain from their alignment lie in favored treatment of the offspring spawned by the show-off from neighbors.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Buss echoes and cites Hawke’s thoughts on the show-off’s benefits in sexual access, increased likelihood of having children, and the favorable treatment his children would receive from the other members of the society.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt; Hawkes also suggests that show-offs are more likely to live in large groups and thus be less susceptible to predators.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt; Show-offs gain more benefits from just sharing with their family (classical fitness) in the potential favorable treatment from the community and reciprocal altruism from other members of the community.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

Hawkes uses the Ache people of Paraguay as evidence for the Show-off hypothesis. Food acquired by men was more widely distributed across the community and inconsistent resources that came in large quantities when acquired were also more widely shared.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;

While this is represented in the Ache according to Hawkes, Buss notes that this trend is contradicted in the Hadza who evenly distribute the meat across all members of their population and whose hunters have very little control over the distribution. In the Hadza the show-off hypothesis does not have to do with the resources that result from hunting, but from the prestige and risk that is involved in big game hunting. There are possible circuitous benefits such as protection and defense.&lt;ref name="Buss"/&gt;  
&lt;!-- The following is not a sentence and does not carry a message - please complete if possible.
Why hunters forge male coalitions, even though the hunter’s personal return rate is lower and hunters eat less of their own kill than other family and community members.&lt;ref name="Hawkes"/&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Hyland’s Teething Tablets (DSC 1575).jpg|thumb|right|Hyland's Teething Tablets]]
'''Hyland's''' is a brand of [[Homeopathy|homeopathic products]] sold in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Hyland's operates in the United States as Hyland's Inc and in Canada as Hyland’s Homeopathic Canada Inc and is a division of Standard Homeopathic Co..

== History ==
The company was founded in 1903 in Los Angeles as Standard Homeopathic Pharmacy.  It was purchased by George H. Hyland in 1910 and the name was changed to Standard Homeopathic Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.hylands.com/history|website=Hyland's Inc|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyland's began selling products in Canada in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.hylands.ca/history|website=Hyland's Homeopathic Canada Inc|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] conducted a review of Hyland's labeling and marketing information which revealed numerous products misbranded in violation of sections 503 and 301 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)]] [21 U.S.C. §§ 353 and 331]. This review included the products for "Infant Earache Drops," "Restful Legs," "Teething Tablets," and other products. The products are marketed as [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] for diagnoses and treatments that require a physician's consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2013/ucm370015.htm|title=2013 - Standard Homeopathic Company, Inc. 9/25/13|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety concerns==
In 2004, Hyland's Teething Tablets were the second most popular [[teething]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathic Remedies Thrive in Mainstream|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/20/business/fi-hyland20|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDA warned consumers about Hyland's teething products in 2010, citing concern over the toxicity of its [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] ingredient and lack of child proof caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyland’s Teething Tablets may pose a risk to children|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm230761.htm|website=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyland's voluntarily recalled its Hyland's Teething Tablets product after the 2010 warning in both the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working with FDA, Standard Homeopathic Company Voluntarily Recalls Hyland’s Teething Tablets to Address Manufacturing Process|url=https://www.hylands.com/media/press-release/working-fda-standard-homeopathic-company-voluntarily-recalls-hyland’s-teething|website=Hyland's Inc|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Information Regarding the Voluntary Recall of the Children's Product Hyland's Teething Tablets|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2010/13446a-eng.php|website=Healthy Canadians|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyland's began selling a reformulated version of the product with a child proof cap in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good news, moms: Hyland's Teething Tablets will be back... but not until 2011|url=http://www.newhope.com/health/good-news-moms-hylands-teething-tablets-will-be-back-not-until-2011|website=New Hope|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isentropic expansion''' waves are created when a [[supersonic flow]] is redirected along a curved surface. These waves are studied to obtain a relation between deflection angle and [[Mach number]]. Each wave in this case is a [[Mach wave]], so it is at an angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha = sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{M})&lt;/math&gt; , where M is the Mach number immediately before the wave. Expansion waves are divergent because as the flow expands the value of Mach number increases, thereby decreasing the [[Mach angle]].

In an isentropic wave, the speed changes from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(v + dv)&lt;/math&gt;, with deflection &lt;math&gt;d \theta&lt;/math&gt;. We have oriented the coordinate system orthogonal to the wave. We write the basic (continuity, momentum and 1st, 2nd law of thermodynamics) equations for this infinitesimal control volume.
[[File:Expansion waves over curved surface.png|thumb|Expansion waves over curved surface]]

[[File:Isentropic Control Volume.png|thumb|Control Volume Analysis]]

Assumptions''''':'''''
# Steady flow.
# Negligible body forces.
# Adiabatic flow.
# No work terms.
# Negligible gravitational effect.

==Relation between θ,M and v==
The '''continuity equation''' is,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\limits_{CV}\rho dV +\int\limits_{CS}\rho \bar v.d\bar A=0&lt;/math&gt;  .......(1.1)

First term is zero by '''''assumption(1)'''''.

 Now,   &lt;math&gt;{-\rho v\sin \alpha A}+ { (\rho +d \rho)(v+dv)\sin (a-d\theta)A}=0&lt;/math&gt;

 or    &lt;math&gt;\rho v \sin\alpha =(\rho+ d\rho)(v+dv)\sin(\alpha-d\theta)&lt;/math&gt;......  (1.2)

Now we consider the momentum equation for normal and tangential to shock.

For &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;- component, 
 &lt;math&gt;F_{S_y}+F_{B_y}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\limits_{CV}v_y\rho dV +\int\limits_{CS}v_y\rho \bar v.d\bar A&lt;/math&gt;......(1.3)

Second term of L.H.S and first term of R.H.S are zero due to '''''assumption (2) and (1) respectively'''''.

Then,
 &lt;math&gt;0=v\cos\alpha(-\rho v \sin\alpha A) + (v+dv)\cos(\alpha - d\theta){(\rho+d\rho)(v+dv)\sin(\alpha-d\theta)A}&lt;/math&gt;

Or '''using continuity''',

 &lt;math&gt;v\cos\alpha=(v+dv)\cos(\alpha-d\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding and simplifying [Using the facts that, to the first order, in the limit as  &lt;math&gt;d\theta\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos{d\theta}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin {d\theta}\rightarrow d\theta&lt;/math&gt;], we obtain

 &lt;math&gt;d\theta=\frac{-dv}{v\tan\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

 But,  &lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha=\frac{1}{M}&lt;/math&gt;,

 so, &lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(M^2-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;,
 and

 &lt;math&gt;d\theta=-\frac{\sqrt{(M^2-1)}dv}{v}&lt;/math&gt;  ......(1.4)

==Derivation of Prandtl-Meyer supersonic expansion function==

We skip the analysis of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-component of the momentum and move on to the first law of thermodynamics, which is

 &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}-\dot{W}_s-\dot{W}_{shear}-\dot{W}_{other}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int\limits_{CV}e\rho dV +\int\limits_{CS}h\rho \bar v.d\bar A&lt;/math&gt; .........(1.5)

First term of L.H.S,next three terms of L.H.S and first term of R.H.S are zero due to '''''assumption (3),(4) and (1)''''' respectively.

where,
 &lt;math&gt;e=u+\frac{v^2}{2}+gz&lt;/math&gt;

For our control volume we obtain

 &lt;math&gt;0=[{h+\frac{v^2}{2}}](-\rho v \sin \alpha A)+[(h+dh)+\frac{(v+dv)^2}{2}][(\rho+d\rho)(v+dv)\sin(\alpha-d\theta)A]&lt;/math&gt;

This may be simplified as

 &lt;math&gt;{h+\frac{v^2}{2}}=(h+dh)+\frac{(v+dv)^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding and simplifying in the limit to first order, we get

 &lt;math&gt;dh=-vdv&lt;/math&gt;

If we confine to ideal gases, &lt;math&gt;dh=c_p dT&lt;/math&gt; , so

 &lt;math&gt;c_pdT=-vdv&lt;/math&gt; ......(1.6)

Above equation relates the differential changes in velocity and temperature. We can derive a relation between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; using  &lt;math&gt;v=Mc=M\sqrt{kRT}&lt;/Math&gt;. Differentiating (and dividing the left hand side by &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the right by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{kRT}&lt;/math&gt; ),

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v}=\frac{dM}{M}+\frac{dT}{2T}&lt;/math&gt;

Using equation 1.6

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v}=\frac{dM}{M}-\frac{vdv}{2c_pT}=\frac{dM}{M}-\frac{dv\frac{v^2}{c_pT}}{2v}=\frac{dM}{M}-\frac{dv\frac{M^2c^2}{c_pT}}{2v}&lt;/math&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{M}-\frac{dv\frac{M^2kRT}{c_pT}}{2v}=\frac{dM}{M}-\frac{dv[M^2(k-1)]}{2v}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v}=\frac{2}{2+M^2(k-1)}\frac{dM}{M}&lt;/math&gt; .....(1.7)

Combining (1.4) and (1.7)

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{2\sqrt{(M^2-1)}}=-\frac{1}{2+M^2(k-1)}\frac{dM}{M}&lt;/math&gt; .....(1.8)

We generally apply the above equation to negative &lt;math&gt;d\theta&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;d\omega= d\theta&lt;/math&gt;. We can integrate this between the initial and final Mach numbers of given flow, but it will be more convenient to integrate from a reference state, the critical speed (&lt;math&gt;M=1&lt;/math&gt;) to Mach number &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily set to zero at &lt;math&gt;M=1&lt;/math&gt;,

 &lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{0}^{\omega} d\omega=\int\limits_{1}^{M}\frac{2\sqrt{(M^2-1)}}{2+M^2(k-1)}\frac{dM}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Leading to '''Prandtl-Meyer supersonic expansion function''',

 &lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{(\frac{k+1}{k-1})}\ tan^{-1}[\frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{\sqrt{k+1}}(M^2-1)]-\ tan^{-1}(M^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Wallis's research centers on understanding how the [[frontal cortex]] of the brain is functionally organized to help people set and attain goals at the level of single [[neuron]]s. Decision making requires weighing the costs and benefits of different courses of action. Wallis's group has investigated how cost-benefit analysis is undertaken in the brain to make effective decisions by monitoring single neuronal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hosokawa|first=Takayuki|last2=Kennerley|first2=Steven W.|last3=Sloan|first3=Jennifer|last4=Wallis|first4=Jonathan D.|date=2013|title=Single-Neuron Mechanisms Underlying Cost-Benefit Analysis in Frontal Cortex|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=33|issue=44|pages=17385–17397|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2221-13.2013|issn=0270-6474|pmid=24174671|pmc=3812506}}&lt;/ref&gt; They trained monkeys to make decisions that required integrating reward that required a certain amount of effort cost or a certain amount of delay cost. They found that single [[prefrontal cortex]] neurons played a role in encoding the type of cost decision the monkeys faced. The finding built on Wallis's previous work that found individual neurons in this region encoded several decision attributes, such as the probability of reward, the magnitude of the reward, and how much effort that reward would require.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennerley|first=Steven W.|last2=Dahmubed|first2=Aspandiar F.|last3=Lara|first3=Antonio H.|last4=Wallis|first4=Jonathan D.|date=2009|title=Neurons in the frontal lobe encode the value of multiple decision variables|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1162–1178|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21100|issn=0898-929X|pmc=2715848|pmid=18752411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Jonathan D.|last2=Kennerley|first2=Steven W.|date=April 2010|title=Heterogeneous reward signals in prefrontal cortex|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862852/|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=191–198|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2010.02.009|issn=0959-4388|pmc=2862852|pmid=20303739|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research group also found that neurons involved in associating [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] with certain rewarding outcomes are found in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], while neurons involved in associating actions with certain rewarding outcomes are found in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luk|first=Chung-Hay|last2=Wallis|first2=Jonathan D.|date=2013-01-30|title=Choice Coding in Frontal Cortex during Stimulus-Guided or Action-Guided Decision-Making|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/5/1864|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=1864–1871|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4920-12.2013|issn=0270-6474|pmid=23365226|pmc=3711610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis's group has also studied the dynamics of decision making in both humans and monkeys over the period of time over which they are making a particular decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Laurence T|last2=Behrens|first2=Timothy EJ|last3=Hosokawa|first3=Takayuki|last4=Wallis|first4=Jonathan D|last5=Kennerley|first5=Steven W|date=2015|title=Capturing the temporal evolution of choice across prefrontal cortex|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=4|doi=10.7554/eLife.11945|pmid=26653139|pmc=4718814|issn=2050-084X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using primate [[neurophysiology]] and human [[magnetoencephalography]], they measured how brain activity changed as primates and humans were making different decisions. Their findings were consistent with a mathematical model of decision making, drawing connections between economic models of choice and the underlying neuroscience. In a different study, Wallis's group was able to deduce neuronal signatures as the brains of monkeys evaluate different choices, tracking the dynamics of neurons firing over time and space in the orbitofrontal cortex of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rich|first=Erin L.|last2=Wallis|first2=Jonathan D.|date=2016|title=Decoding subjective decisions from orbitofrontal cortex|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=19|issue=7|pages=973–980|doi=10.1038/nn.4320|issn=1546-1726|pmc=4925198|pmid=27273768}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering two options, the group of neurons associated with each of the two options would alternate firing, flipping back and forth between the two options before finally deciding.

'''Kleinite''' is a rare [[mineral]] that has only been found in the United States and Germany that occurs in [[Hydrothermal circulation#Hydrothermal ore deposits|hydrothermal]] [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] deposits.&lt;ref name="=Handbook of Mineralogy 2005"/&gt; It occurs associated with [[calcite]], [[gypsum]] and (rarely) [[barite]] or [[calomel]].&lt;ref name="USGS 1909"/&gt; Its color can range from pale yellow/canary yellow to orange, and it is [[Transparency and translucency|transparent to translucent]].&lt;ref name="=Handbook of Mineralogy 2005"/&gt; As a [[photosensitive]] mineral, its coloration darkens when exposed to light.&lt;ref name="Castor Ferdock 2004 p. 304"/&gt;

It has been hypothesized that kleinite formed through a "reaction of [[cinnabar]] with oxidized [[meteoric water]]", with this reaction being the source of kleinite's [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name="Castor Ferdock 2004 p. 304"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Kleinite is named after Carl Klein (1842–1907), who was a professor of [[mineralogy]] at the [[University of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="=Handbook of Mineralogy 2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31855">[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has produced several lines of [[computer printer|printers]] in its history, but no longer produces or supports these devices today. Though some early products use [[thermal printer|thermal]] technology, Apple's products can be broadly divided into three lines: [[ImageWriter]] ([[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]]), [[LaserWriter]] ([[PostScript]] [[laser printer|laser]]), and [[StyleWriter]] ([[inkjet printer#Thermal (thermal DOD inkjet)|thermal inkjet]]).

==Early products==
Apple's first printer release was the [[Apple Silentype]], released in June 1979, shortly after the [[Apple II|Apple II Plus]]. The Silentype was a [[thermal printer]], which used a special paper and provided [[Apple 80 column card|80 column]] output. Also compatible with the [[Apple III]], the Silentype was a rebranded [[Trendcom 200]].&lt;ref name="Weyhrich13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah13.html|title=Chapter 13: Peripherals, cont.|last=Weyhrich|first=Steven|date=December 31, 1991|work=Apple II History|publisher=Creative Commons license|accessdate=August 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207203249/http://apple2history.org/history/ah13.html|archivedate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silentype12102009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/144738/2009/12/apple_silentype.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129114355/http://www.macworld.com/article/144738/2009/12/apple_silentype.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title=Apple Silentype (1980)|last=Edwards|first=Benj|date=December 10, 2009|work=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apple Dot Matrix Printer]] (often shortened to Apple DMP) is a printer manufactured by [[C. Itoh]] and sold under [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] label in 1982 for the [[Apple II family|Apple II series]], [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], and the [[Apple III]].&lt;ref name="Weyhrich13"/&gt; Apple followed this release with a [[Qume]] [[Daisy wheel printer|daisy wheel]] engine, the [[Apple Daisy Wheel Printer|Apple Letter Quality]] Printer (also known as the Apple Daisy Wheel Printer), in January 1983.  This printer could print at forty characters per second.&lt;ref name="Weyhrich13"/&gt; Also in 1983, Apple released its only [[plotter]], the Apple Color Plotter. This printer moved and rotated four color pens along the horizontal axis, the device moving the paper into order to allow its pens to render along the vertical axis.&lt;ref name="Weyhrich13"/&gt; The [[Apple Scribe Printer]] was a [[thermal transfer printer]], first introduced in 1984 alongside the [[Apple IIc]] for a relatively low retail price, and compatible with the [[Apple IIe]] computer.&lt;ref name="Weyhrich13"/&gt;

== Laser printer series ==
{{main|LaserWriter}}
The [[LaserWriter]] was a [[laser printer]] with built-in [[PostScript]] interpreter introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1985. It was one of the first laser printers available to the mass market. In combination with [[WYSIWYG]] publishing software like [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]], that operated on top of the [[graphical user interface]] of [[Macintosh]] computers, the LaserWriter was a key component at the beginning of the [[desktop publishing]] revolution.&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;H.

== Inkjet series ==
{{main|StyleWriter}}

The [[StyleWriter]] was the first of Apple's line of [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] serial printers, targeted mainly towards consumers. They produced print quality that was better than the [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]] [[ImageWriter]]s, and were cheaper than the [[LaserWriter]]s. All but a few models contained [[Canon (company)|Canon]] print engines, a few were rebadged Canon printers, while the last few were rebadged [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[DeskJet]] printers.

The [[Apple Color Printer]] was the first color [[inkjet printer]] sold by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. Introduced in 1993 alongside the StyleWriter II, it was a rebadged Canon BJC-820 printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tidbits.com/article/2728|title=Why  The Lame Apple Color Printer?|date=February 1, 1993|work=Adam Engst|publisher=TidBITS|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maximum resolution was 360 DPI and connected to the computer via [[SCSI]]. Unlike many inkjet printers of the time, the Apple Color Printer did not suffer from print slowdowns caused by slow communication from the computer performing [[rasterization]], since the SCSI bus is relatively fast. The model was discontinued in 1994 when Apple introduced the [[Color StyleWriter]] series of printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/SP448|title=Apple Color Printer |date=October 13, 2008|work=Apple.com|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nicknames ==

=== The First State ===
This nickname was officially adopted on May 23, 2002, to commemorate the fact that on December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first of the 13 original states to ratify the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c003/index.shtml#P187_5917 Delaware Code Title 29 § 318]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Diamond State ===
This nickname comes from the legend that Thomas Jefferson described Delaware as a jewel among states due to its strategic location on the Eastern Seaboard.

=== Blue Hen State ===

This nickname comes from the fighting [[Delaware Blue Hen|Blue Hen]] cocks that were carried with soldiers for entertainment during the Revolutionary War.

=== Small Wonder ===
This nickname comes from substantial contributions Delaware has made as compared to its relatively small size.

==== The Last State ====
Some residents of states that were also formerly part of the 13 original colonies have given this name to Delaware as a parody or insult to its classic nickname "The First State."

== Bird ==
The [[Delaware Blue Hen]] was officially adopted on April 14, 1939, having been used as many political campaigns and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title29/c003/index.shtml#P46_2288 Delaware Code Title 29 § 304]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8766">An '''ECMAScript engine''' is a program that executes source code written in a version of the [[ECMAScript]] language standard, for example, [[JavaScript]].

These are new generation ECMAScript engines for web browsers, all implementing [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) or variations of that idea. The performance benefits for just-in-time compilation make it much more suitable for web applications written in [[JavaScript]].

'''{{lang|fr|Manufacture d'horlogerie}}''' (meaning "watchmaking manufacturer") is a [[French language]] term of [[horology]] that has also been adopted in [[English language]] as a [[loanword]]. In horology, the term is usually encountered in its abbreviated form ''manufacture''. This term is used when describing a wrist watch [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] or watchworks fabricator which makes all or most of the parts required for its products in its own production facilities, as opposed to simply assembling watches using parts purchased from other firms.

==Definition==
The ''Dictionnaire professionnel illustree de l'horlogerie'' (The Illustrated Professional Dictionary of the Watchmaking Industry) defines ''manufacture'' as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Swiss watch industry the term ''manufacture'' is used of a factory in which watches are manufactured almost completely, as distinct from an ''atelier de terminage'', which is concerned only with assembling, timing, fitting the hands and casing.&lt;ref&gt;Berner, Dictionnaire professionnel illustree de l'horlogerie&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of ''[[List of watch manufactures|manufacture]]'' in the [[Swiss watch]] making industry refers to any firm that at least designs [[Caliber (horology)|calibre]]s, produces the movements parts thereof called [[ébauche#Horology|ébauches]], and assembles them into watches. For example, a company that does not manufacture crystals (the watch glass) or [[hairspring]]s may still be regarded as a ''manufacture''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montresuisses.blogspot.com/2005/08/terms-of-art_25.html Terms of art - manufacture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following companies produce whole watches, including cases and movements:
* [[A. Lange &amp; Söhne]]
* [[Audemars Piguet]]
* [[Blancpain]]
* [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]]
* [[Breitling SA]]
* [[Chopard]]
* [[Citizen Holdings]]
* [[Frédérique Constant ]] (some models)
* [[F. P. Journe]]
* [[Girard-Perregaux]]
* [[Moritz Grossman]]
* [[Hublot]]
* [[International Watch Company|IWC]]
* [[Jaeger-LeCoultre]]
* [[Lang &amp; Heyne]]
* [[Maurice Lacroix]]
* [[Moser &amp; Cie]]
* [[Nomos Glashütte]]
* [[Omega SA]]
* [[Panerai]]
* [[Parmigiani Fleurier]]
* [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]]
* [[Piaget SA]]
* [[Roger Dubuis]]
* [[Rolex]]
* [[Seiko]]

'''''Mysterium Magnum''''' is Latin for "great mystery" and has several different associations and usages.  

==Paracelsus==

[[Paracelsus]] and other [[alchemy|alchemist]]s employed the term "Mysterium Magnum" to denote primordial undifferentiated matter, from which all the [[Classical Element]]s sprang, sometimes compared with [[Brahman]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]] and [[akasha]].

==Jakob Böhme==

[[Jakob Böhme]] (1575&amp;ndash;November 17, 1624) a German [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] wrote a treatise entitled ''The Mysterium Magnum'' (1623). 

==Sacrament==

"Mysterium Magnum" is often employed in [[Christian theology]] as a euphemism for "[[sacrament]]".

{{About|philosophical anthropology|other uses|Anthropology (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' or the perfect man by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
'''Philosophical anthropology''', sometimes called '''anthropological philosophy''',&lt;ref&gt;Fikentscher (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h8PxF5BvtIAC&amp;pg=PA74 pp.74, 89]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; is a discipline dealing with questions of [[metaphysics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the human person, and interpersonal relationships.

==History==

===Ancient Christian writers: Augustine of Hippo===
{{Main|Christian anthropology}}
[[Augustine of Hippo]] was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear anthropological vision,{{Request quotation |date= February 2012}} although it is not clear if he had any influence on [[Max Scheler]], the founder of philosophical anthropology as an independent discipline, nor on any of the major philosophers that followed him. Augustine has been cited by [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]] as one of the early writers to inquire on time-consciousness and the role of ''seeing'' in the feeling of "Being-in-the-world".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1964, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, ''Being and Time'' Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964. 171. Articulating on how "Being-in-the-world" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': "The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''." Heidegger, quoting the ''Confessions'': "Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing...  We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'".&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni (1965), pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; He was much closer in this anthropological view to [[Aristotle]] than to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrics (1954), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAS&gt;Massuti, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; In his late treatise [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead]] sec. 5 (420 CE) he insisted that the body is essential part of the human person:
{{quotation |In no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned. (...) For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature of man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627 [13–22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...) Haec enim non-ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''; ''Contra Faustum'', 22.27; PL 44,418.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is marriage: ''caro tua, coniux tua – your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6; [[Corpus Christianorum |CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]); ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4, 4–5; CCL 46, 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another.

They are two categorically different things: the body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into detail in his efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they were metaphysically distinct. To be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and that the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On the free will]]'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7–6.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, p. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

According to N.

Philosophical anthropology as a kind of thought, before it was founded as a distinct philosophical discipline in the 1920s, emerged as post-[[medieval]] thought striving for emancipation from [[Christian religion]] and Aristotelic tradition.&lt;ref name="Apostolopoulou1992p49"&gt;Apostolopoulou, ''Georgia The Problem of Religion in Helmuth Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology'', in Reimer, A. James and Siebert, Rudolf J. (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8RAQAAIAAJ ''The Influence of the Frankfurt school on contemporary theology: critical theory and the future of religion''], pp.42–66. Quotation from p.49: {{quotation|Philosophical anthropology is a kind of thought arising in times of crisis. The main anthropologists, Max Scheler and Helmuth Plessner, share the same opinion [that it] has appeared as a consequence of the shaking of the Middle Age's order, the roots of which were Greek tradition and Christian religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this liberation, characteristic of [[modernity]], has been the [[Cartesian skepticism]] formulated by [[Descartes]] in the first two of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641).

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) taught the first lectures on anthropology in the European academic world. He specifically developed a conception of ''pragmatic anthropology'', according to which the human being is studied as a free agent. At the same time, he conceived of his anthropology as an empirical, not a strictly philosophical discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Both his philosophical and his anthropological work has been one of the influences in the field during the 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref name="Grolier 1981p768"&gt;Grolier (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SesZAAAAMAAJ ''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 21''] p. 768&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buber1943PM"/&gt; After Kant, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] is sometimes considered the next most important influence and founder of anthropological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Poolla Tirupati Raju (1966) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3cYtAAAAYAAJ ''The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy''] p. 490 {{quotation|Feuerbach interpreted philosophical anthropologism as the summary of the entire previous development of philosophical thought. Feuerbach was thus the father of the comprehensive system of anthropological philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Deutsch Kornblatt, Richard F. Gustafson (1996) ''Russian religious thought'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=AqwGUM4tFoEC&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140] quotation: {{quotation|In modern thought, according to Buber, Feuerbach was the most important contributor to philosophical anthropology, next to Kant, because he posited Man as the exclusive object of philosophy...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, an important contribution came from [[post-kantian]] [[German idealist]]s like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]],&lt;ref name="Grolier 1981p768"/&gt; as well from [[Søren Kierkegaard]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Philosophical anthropology as independent discipline ===
Since its development in the 1920s, in the milieu of Germany [[Weimar culture]], philosophical anthropology has been turned into a philosophical discipline, competing with the other traditional sub-disciplines of [[epistemology]], ethics, [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NfTwdJYsx-AC&amp;pg=PA64 p.64], quotation: {{quotation|Ende der 1920er Jahre prominent geworden, weil damals aus verschiedenen Denkrich- tungen und Motiven die Frage nach dem Menschen in die Mitte der philosophischen Problematik rückte. Die philosophische Anthropologie wurde so zu einer neuen Disziplin in der Philosophie neben den eingeführten Subdisziplinen der Erkenntnistheorie, der Ethik, der Metaphysik, der Ästhetik}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding behaviour of humans as both creatures of their [[social environment]]s and creators of their own [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Although the majority of philosophers throughout the [[history of philosophy]] can be said to have a distinctive "[[anthropology]]" that undergirds their thought, philosophical anthropology itself, as a ''specific discipline'' in philosophy, arose within the later modern period as an outgrowth from developing methods in philosophy, such as phenomenology and [[existentialism]]. The former, which draws its energy from methodical reflection on human experience (first person perspective) as from the philosopher's own personal experience, naturally aided the emergence of philosophical explorations of human nature and the [[human condition]].

===1920s Germany===
[[Max Scheler]], from 1900 till 1920 had been a follower of [[Husserl]]'s phenomenology, the hegemonic form of philosophy in Germany at the time. Scheler sought to apply Husserl's phenomenological approach to different topics. From 1920 Scheler laid the foundation for philosophical anthropology as a philosophical discipline, competing with phenomenology and other philosophic disciplines. Husserl and [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), were the two most authoritative philosophers in Germany at the time, and their criticism to philosophical anthropology and Scheler have had a major impact on the discipline.

Scheler defined the human being not so much as a "[[Rationality|rational]] animal" (as has traditionally been the case since [[Aristotle]]) but essentially as a [[love|loving]] [[being]]. He breaks down the traditional [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of the human person, and describes the personal being with a [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] structure of [[lived body]], [[soul]], and [[spirit]]. Love and [[hatred]] are not [[psychological]] [[emotions]], but [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[intention]]al acts of the person, which he [[Categorization|categorises]] as "intentional feelings."{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Scheler based his philosophical anthropology in a Christian metaphysics of the spirit.&lt;ref name= "Wilkoszewska2004p129"&gt;Wilkoszewska, Krystyna (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHY5Q4lgY4sC&amp;pg=PA129 ''Deconstruction and reconstruction: the Central European Pragmatist Forum''], Volume 2, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmuth Plessner]] would later emancipate philosophical anthropology from Christianity.&lt;ref name="Wilkoszewska2004p129" /&gt;

[[Helmuth Plessner]] and [[Arnold Gehlen]] have been influenced by Scheler, and they are the three major representatives of philosophical anthropology as a movement.

===From the 1940s===
[[Ernst Cassirer]], a neo-Kantian philosopher, has been the most influential source for the definition and development of the field from the 1940s till the 1960s.&lt;ref name= "Schilpp67p73"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Schilpp | year = 1967 | title = The philosophy of Martin Buber | page = 73 |quote=It was a neo-Kantian philosopher, Ernst Cassirer, who perhaps more than anyone else contributed to the definition and development of philosophical anthropology in recent decades. Particularly relevant here is Cassirer's conception of man as a symbolizing and mythologizing animal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly influential has been Cassirer's description of man as a ''[[symbolic animal]]'',&lt;ref name= "Schilpp67p73" /&gt; which has been reprised in the 1960s by [[Gilbert Durand]], scholar of [[symbolic anthropology]] and the [[Imaginary (sociology) |imaginary]].

In 1953, future pope [[Karol Wojtyla]] based his dissertation thesis on Max Scheler, limiting himself to the works Scheler wrote before rejecting Catholicism and the Judeo-Christian tradition in 1920. Wojtyla used Scheler as an example that phenomenology could be reconciled with Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Anna-Teresa | last = Tymieniecka | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iGONF4dUwOwC | title = Phenomenology world-wide | page = 487| isbn = 9781402000669 | year = 2002 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that Wojtyla influenced philosophical anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Hans | last = Köchler | author-link = Hans Köchler | title = The Phenomenology of Karol Wojtyla.  On the Problem of the Phenomenological Foundation of Anthropology | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 42 | year = 1982 | pages = 326–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | K.

In the 20th century, other important contributors and influences to philosophical anthropology have been [[Paul Häberlin]] (1878–1960), [[Martin Buber]] (1878–1965),&lt;ref name="Buber1943PM"&gt;{{Citation | last = Buber | first = Martin | author-link = Martin Buber | year = 1943 | title = Das Problem des Menschen |trans-title=The Problem of Man | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.R. Dodds]] (1893–1979), [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (1900–2002), [[Eric Voegelin]] (1901–85), [[Hans Jonas]] (1903–93), [[Josef Pieper]] (1904–97), [[Hans-Eduard Hengstenberg]] (1904–98),{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–80), [[Joseph Maréchal]] (1878–1944), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1908–61), [[Paul Ricoeur]] (1913–2005), [[René Girard]] (1923–2015), [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (1929–), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002), [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004), [[Emerich Coreth]] (1919–2006), [[Leonardo Polo]] (1926–2013).

==Anthropology of interpersonal relationships==
A large focus of philosophical anthropology is also interpersonal relationships, as an attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding the behaviour of humans as both creatures of their [[social environment]]s and creators of their own values. It analyses also the [[ontology]] that is in play in human relationships – of which [[intersubjectivity]] is a major theme. Intersubjectivity is the study of how two individuals, subjects, whose experiences and interpretations of the world are radically different understand and relate to each other.

Recently anthropology has begun to shift towards studies of intersubjectivity and other existential/phenomenological themes. Studies of language have also gained new prominence in philosophy and sociology due to language's close ties with the question of intersubjectivity.

===Michael D. Jackson's study of intersubjectivity===
The academic [[Michael Jackson (anthropology)|Michael D. Jackson]] is another important philosophical anthropologist. His research and fieldwork concentrate on existential themes of "being in the world" (''[[Dasein]]'') as well as interpersonal relationships. His methodology challenges traditional anthropology due to its focus on first-person experience. In his most well known book, ''Minima Ethnographica'' which focuses on intersubjectivity and interpersonal relationships, he draws upon his ethnographic fieldwork in order to explore existential theory.

In his latest book, ''Existential Anthropology'', he explores the notion of control, stating that humans anthropomorphize inanimate objects around them in order to enter into an interpersonal relationship with them. In this way humans are able to feel as if they have control over situations that they cannot control because rather than treating the object as an object, they treat it as if it is a rational being capable of understanding their feelings and language. Good examples are prayer to gods to alleviate drought or to help a sick person or cursing at a computer that has ceased to function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''PlanetQuest''' is [[NASA]]'s education and public outreach program centered on the science and technology of NASA’s long-term search for habitable planets beyond our solar system.

Major components of the PlanetQuest outreach program include:
* PlanetQuest: the Search for Another Earth, a continuously updated public news and multimedia Internet site;
* The Night Sky Network, a national coalition of amateur astronomy clubs who do astronomy education and public outreach on behalf of NASA;
* The Center for Astronomy Education, which provides professional development resources for instructors who teach introductory astronomy course, including a series of national “Teaching Excellence” workshops; 
* Informal education initiatives, including “PlanetQuest Updates” provided to more than 60 museums nationwide, and interactive multimedia kiosks. 

Begun in January 2002 and based at NASA’s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], PlanetQuest is funded by the Exoplanet Exploration Program, a long-term suite of NASA missions designed to detect and characterize of Earth-like planets. The main components of Navigator include two ground-based and two space based missions:

On Earth:
* The [[Keck Interferometer]]. Initial interferometeric work began in 2005.
* The [[Large Binocular Telescope]] Interferometer.  Instrument that is part of the Large Binocular Telescope, which has been operational since 2005.
In space:
* [[SIM PlanetQuest]]. SIM Lite cancelled in 2010.
* The [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] observatories. ''De facto'' cancelled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4231">[[Image:Abbot Richard Wallingford.jpg|thumb|right|Richard of Wallingdorf, inventor of the rectangulus]]

The '''rectangulus''' was an [[astronomical instrument]] made by [[Richard of Wallingford]] around 1326. Dissatisfied with the limitations of existing [[astrolabe]]s, Richard developed the rectangulus as an instrument for [[spherical trigonometry]] and to measure the angles between planets and other astronomical bodies.&lt;ref name="Gimpel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St Albans" /&gt; This was one of a number of instruments he created, including the ''Albion'', a form of [[equatorium]], and a famously complicated and expensive horologium ([[astronomical clock]]).

His ''Tractus Rectanguli'', describing the rectangulus, was an influential text in medieval astronomy and at least thirty copies were known to survive.&lt;ref name="Gimpel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St Albans" /&gt; His ''Quadripartitum'' was the first text on spherical trigonometry to be published in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="North, Cosmos" /&gt;

The rectangulus was a form of skeleton [[torquetum]].&lt;ref name="Michel" /&gt; This was a series of nested angular scales, so that measurements in azimuth and elevation could be made directly in polar coordinates, relative to the [[ecliptic]]. Conversion from these coordinates though was difficult, involving what was the leading mathematics of the day. The rectangulus was an analogue computing device to simplify this: instead of measuring in angular measurements it could resolve the angles to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian components]] directly. This then simplified the further calculations.

The rectangulus was constructed as a brass pillar with a number of linear scales hinged above it. Pinhole sights on the upper arm allowed it to be pointed accurately at the astronomical target. [[Plumb bob]] lines descended from the scales above and intersected with linear scales marked on the horizontal scales below.&lt;ref name="North, Rectangulus" /&gt; These allowed measures to be read, not as angles, but as trigonometric ratios.

To celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Rectangulus in 1926 a replica was constructed.&lt;ref name="St Albans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature, 1926" /&gt; This is now in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="MHS" /&gt;

'''Johannes Müller von Königsberg''' (6 June 1436 – 6 July 1476), better known as '''Regiomontanus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|iː|dʒ|i|oʊ|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|n|ə|s}}), was a  [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]] of the [[German Renaissance]], active in [[Vienna]], [[Buda]] and [[Nuremberg]]. His contributions were instrumental in the development of [[Copernican heliocentrism]] in the decades following his death.

Regiomontanus wrote under the Latinized name of ''Ioannes de Monteregio'' (or ''Monte Regio'';  ''Regio Monte''); the adjectival ''Regiomontanus'' was first used by [[Philipp Melanchthon]] in 1534. He is named after [[Königsberg, Bavaria|Königsberg]] in [[Lower Franconia]], not the larger  [[Königsberg]] (modern [[Kaliningrad]]) in Prussia.

At eleven years of age, Regiomontanus became a student at the [[University of Leipzig]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]. In 1451 he continued his studies at [[University of Vienna|Alma Mater Rudolfina]], the university in [[Vienna]], [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]]. There he became a pupil and friend of [[Georg von Peuerbach]]. In 1452 he was awarded the bachelor degree ([[Bachelor's degree|''baccalaureus'']]), and he was awarded his ''magister artium'' ([[Master of Arts]]) at the age of 21 in 1457. It is known that he held lectures in [[optics]] and ancient literature.

Regiomontanus continued to work with Peuerbach learning and extending the then known areas of astronomy, mathematics and instrument making until Peuerbach's death in 1461.

In 1460 the papal legate [[Basilios Bessarion]] came to Vienna on a diplomatic mission. Being a humanist scholar and great fan of the mathematical sciences, Bessarion sought out Peuerbach's company. [[George of Trebizond]] who was Bessarion's philosophical rival had recently produced a new Latin translation of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' from the Greek, which Bessarion, correctly, regarded as inaccurate and badly translated, so he asked Peuerbach to produce a new one. Peuerbach's Greek was not good enough to do a translation but he knew the ''Almagest'' intimately so instead he started work on a modernised, improved abridgement of the work. Bessarion also invited Peuerbach to become part of his household and to accompany him back to Italy when his work in Vienna was finished. Peuerbach accepted the invitation on the condition that Regiomontanus could also accompany them. However Peuerbach fell ill in 1461 and died only having completed the first six books of his abridgement of the ''Almagest''. On his death bed Peuerbach made Regiomontanus promise to finish the book and publish it.

In 1461 Regiomontanus left Vienna with Bessarion and spent the next four years travelling around Northern Italy as a member of Bessarion's household, looking for and copying mathematical and astronomical manuscripts for Bessarion, who possessed the largest private library in Europe at the time. Regiomontanus also made the acquaintance of the leading Italian mathematicians of the age such as [[Giovanni Bianchini]] and [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]] who had also been friends of Peuerbach during his prolonged stay in Italy more than twenty years earlier.

He went to work for [[János Vitéz (bishop)|János Vitéz]], archbishop of [[Esztergom]].{{year needed|date=March 2017}} There he calculated extensive astronomical tables and built astronomical instruments. 
In 1467 he went to [[Buda]], and the court of [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary, for whom he built an astrolabe, and where he collated Greek manuscripts for a handsome salary.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |last=Clerke |first=Agnes Mary |author-link=Agnes Mary Clerke |wstitle=Regiomontanus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The tables that he created while living in Hungary, his ''Tabulae directionum'', were designed for astrology, including finding astrological houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mosley |first=Adam | url=http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/regioastrol.html | title=Regiomontanus and Astrology | publisher=Cambridge University: History and Philosophy of Science Department | date=1999 | accessdate=2013-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1471 Regiomontanus moved to the Free City of [[Nuremberg]], in [[Franconia]], then one of the Empire's important seats of learning, publication, commerce and art, where he worked with the humanist and merchant [[Bernhard Walther]].  Here he founded the world's first scientific printing press, and in 1472 he published the first printed astronomical textbook, the ''Theoricae novae Planetarum'' of his teacher Georg von Peurbach.

Regiomontanus and Bernhard Walther observed the [[comet of 1472]]. Regiomontanus tried to estimate its distance from Earth, using the angle of parallax.{{efn|See [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/teachers/attachments/parallax.html NASA: parallax].}} According to David A. Seargeant:&lt;ref&gt;David A. Seargeant. ''The Greatest Comets in History'', 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In agreement with the prevailing Aristotelian theory on comets as atmospheric phenomena, he estimated its distance to be at least 8,200 miles (13,120 km) and, from this, estimated the central condensation as 26, and the entire coma as 81 miles (41.6 and 129.6 km respectively) in diameter. These values, of course, fail by orders of magnitude, but he is to be commended for this attempt at determining the physical dimensions of the comet.}}
The 1472 comet was visible from Christmas Day 1471 to 1 March 1472 (Julian Calendar), a total of 59 days.&lt;ref&gt;Donald K. Yeomans, ''[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?great_comets Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Great Comets in History]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1475, Regiomontanus was called to Rome by [[Pope Sixtus IV]] on to work on the planned [[Gregorian calendar#Background|calendar reform]]. Sixtus promised substantial rewards, including the title of [[bishop of Regensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Regiomontanus was named bishop of Regensburg (or at least promised the title) shortly before his death on 6 July 1476 as part of the rewards promised to him by [[Sixtus IV]].

Rudolf Schmidt,  [http://www.zeno.org/Schmidt-1902/A/Regiomontanus,+Johann Regiomontanus, Johann] in: ''Deutsche Buchhändler. Deutsche Buchdrucker'' vol. 5 (1908), 797f.
Reported by Paul Jovius (Giovio; 1483-1552), ''Ab hac commendatione eruditi nominis creatus est a Xysto Quarto Ratisponensis Episcopus'' (cited by [[Pierre Gassendi]]).
Hagen, J. (1911) in ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (s.v. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10628a.htm  Johann Müller]) opines that the report by Jovius "is not improbable, since by this dignitary title the pope could give more force to his invitation. Yet it seems certain that Müller never occupied the episcopal chair."&lt;/ref&gt;
On his way to Rome, stopping in Venice, he commissioned the publication of his ''Calendarium'' with [[Erhard Ratdolt]] (printed in 1476). 
Regiomontanus reached Rome, but he died there after only a few months, in his 41st year,  on 6 July 1476.  
According to a rumor repeated by [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] in his Regiomontanus biography, he was poisoned by relatives of [[George of Trebizond]] whom he had criticized in his writing; it is however considered more likely that he died from the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Schmidt,  [http://www.zeno.org/Schmidt-1902/A/Regiomontanus,+Johann Regiomontanus, Johann] in: ''Deutsche Buchhändler. Deutsche Buchdrucker'' vol. 5 (1908), 797f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Houghton Typ Inc 4366 - Regiomontanus 1.jpg|thumb|Title page for ''Qvesta opra da ogni parte e un libro doro'', 1476]]
During his time in Italy he completed Peuerbach's ''Almagest'' abridgement, ''Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei''. In 1464, he completed ''De Triangulis omnimodis''. ''De Triangulis'' (On Triangles) was one of the first textbooks presenting the current state of [[trigonometry]] and included lists of questions for review of individual chapters. In it he wrote:

{{quote|You who wish to study great and wonderful things, who wonder about the movement of the stars, must read these theorems about triangles. Knowing these ideas will open the door to all of astronomy and to certain geometric problems.}}

His work on [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]], ''Algorithmus Demonstratus'', was among the first containing [[symbolic algebra]].&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Regiomontanus|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1465, he built a portable [[sundial]] for [[Pope Paul II]].

In ''Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei'', he critiqued the translation of ''Almagest'' by [[George of Trebizond]], pointing out inaccuracies. Later [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] would refer to this book as an influence on his own work.

A prolific author, Regiomontanus was internationally famous in his lifetime. Despite having completed only a quarter of what he had intended to write, he left a substantial body of work. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' teacher, [[Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara]], referred to Regiomontanus as having been his own teacher. There is speculation that Regiomontanus had arrived at a theory of heliocentrism before he died; a manuscript shows particular attention to the [[heliocentric]] theory of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]], mention was also given to the motion of the earth in a letter to a friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler]], ''The Sleepwalkers'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the material on [[spherical trigonometry]] in Regiomontanus' ''On Triangles'' was taken directly{{dubious|date=March 2017}} from the twelfth-century work of [[Jabir ibn Aflah]] otherwise known as Geber, as noted in the sixteenth century by [[Gerolamo Cardano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Legacy==

Regiomontanus designed his own [[Astrological houses#Regiomontanus|astrological house system]], which became one of the most popular systems in Europe.&lt;ref name="Lewis2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James R. |title=The Astrology Book: The Encyclopedia of Heavenly Influences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmv4930JbY0C&amp;pg=PA574|accessdate=4 August 2012|date=1 March 2003|publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]]|isbn=978-1-57859-144-2|pages=574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1561, [[Daniel Santbech]] compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus, ''De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque'' (first published in 1533) and ''Compositio tabularum sinum recto'', as well as Santbech's own ''Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem''. It was published in [[Basel]] by [[Henrich Petri]] and [[Petrus Perna]].

There is an image of him in Hartmann Schedel's 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''. He is holding an astrolabe.{{efn|See [http://www.swaen.com/os/mapimg/33115B.jpg image].}} Yet, although there are thirteen illustrations of comets in the '''Chronicle'' (from 471 to 1472), they are stylized, rather than representing the actual objects. {{efn|See [http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/DanComet2.gif]}}

The crater [[Regiomontanus (crater)|Regiomontanus]] on the Moon is named after him.

The '''Faculty of Chemistry (since 2014 The Institute of Chemistry)  ''' at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] is one of the leading chemistry faculties in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Donetskaya|first1= S.S.|year= 2007|title= The scientific capabilities of chemistry faculty members in Russian universities.|journal= Eko (Russian: Эко)|issue= 4|pages= 131–143|url= http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|accessdate= 2010-01-18|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120302160600/http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|archivedate= 2012-03-02|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Formally, the Department of Chemistry has been created as a separate entity of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg State University (then Leningrad State University)]] in 1929. However, the history of chemistry at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] began much earlier. First chemistry laboratory and lectures in chemistry were introduced at the University in 1833. One of the first professors of chemistry was Alexander Voskresensky, a doctoral student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. Voskresensky largely contributed to the growth of chemistry classes at the University. He initiated lectures in organic chemistry (1843) and promoted first scientific projects. Later, in 1868, the chemistry division hosted then by the Department of Physics and Mathematics was split into three to form the division of organic chemistry led by [[Aleksandr Butlerov]], the division of inorganic chemistry led by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and the division of analytical chemistry led by [[Nikolai Menshutkin]]. Since then, [[Saint Petersburg State University|the University of Saint-Petersburg]] became home to one of the most elite chemistry schools in the country. Many prominent Russian chemists began their career and/or worked there. Among them are [[Nikolay Zinin]], [[Alexey Favorsky]], [[Lev Aleksandrovich Chugaev]], Dmitry Konovalov, [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev]], [[Tishchenko reaction|Vyacheslav Tishchenko]], [[Vladimir Ipatieff]], [[Nikolay Semyonov]], [[Boris Nikolsky]], [[Mikhail Shultz]].

In the Soviet era, the Department of Chemistry continued to grow with new divisions: colloid chemistry (1939), electrochemistry (1940), chemistry of macromolecular compounds (1944), radiochemistry (1945), physical organic chemistry (1946), theory of solutions (1950), chemistry of natural compounds (1963), quantum chemistry (1967), solid state chemistry (1978).

==Campuses==
Historically, some of the first chemistry offices were located in the main building of [[Saint Petersburg State University]] called [[Twelve Collegia]]. The remainder of these is the [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] museum located on the first floor of the central part of this enormous building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Trimble|first1= R.F.|year= 1981|title= Mendeleev's Discovery of the Periodic Law|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 58|issue= 1|pages= 28|doi= 10.1021/ed058p28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Krotikov|first1= V.A.|year= 1960|title= The Mendeleev Archives and Museum of the Leningrad University|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 37|issue= 12|pages= 625–628|doi= 10.1021/ed037p625}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the Department of Chemistry was headquartered at 41/43 Sredniy prospekt on [[Vasilievsky Island]], about one mile west of [[Twelve Collegia]]. In the 1980s, most of the laboratories were relocated to a more spacious building in the newly constructed campus in the suburb of [[petergof|Peterhof]].

In [[scientific visualization]], '''texture advection''' is a family of methods to densely visualize [[vector field]]s or flows (like the wind movement of a tornado). Scientists can use the created images and animations to better understand these flows and reason about them. 
In comparison to techniques that visualise [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], [[streakline]]s, or [[timeline]]s, methods of this family don't need any seed points and can produce a whole image at every step.

The methods have in common that they bend a whole image (or texture) according to the flow to create a new image that is warped by the flow. If that is done in small enough time steps and often enough, the images can be combined to create an animation visualising the flow.

== Methods ==
* [[Line integral convolution]]
* [[Lagrangian–Eulerian advection]]
* [[Image-based flow visualization]]

'''ULAS&amp;nbsp;J133553.45+113005.2''' (also called '''ULAS1335''') is a [[T-type star|T-type]] [[brown dwarf]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]].&lt;ref name=sb0 /&gt;  It was discovered in data from the UK Infrared Telescope ([[UKIRT]]) Infrared Deep Sky Survey ([[UKIDSS]]) Large Area Survey (LAS).  Its discovery was reported June 2008.&lt;ref name=exploring&gt;Exploring the substellar temperature regime down to ~550K, Ben Burningham et al., ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' '''391''', #1 (November 2008), pp. 320–333, {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13885.x}}, {{bibcode|2008MNRAS.391..320B}}.  The arXiv e-print of this paper, {{arxiv|0806.0067}}, was first submitted June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After identification, ULAS1335 was imaged using the UFTI camera on the UKIRT, on [[Mauna Kea]], [[Hawaii]], to confirm its [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] properties and location. It was [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] confirmed as a T9 dwarf using the [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini North telescope]], also at Mauna Kea, and was imaged using IRAC on the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The IRAC imaging confirmed it as the reddest (in near-to-mid infrared colors) T dwarf yet discovered, and by inference the coolest.&lt;ref name=exploring /&gt;

ULAS1334 was initially estimated to have a temperature around 550–600 [[Kelvin|K]], a distance of 8&amp;ndash;12 [[parsecs]] (26–40 [[light years]]), and a mass of 15–31 [[Jupiter mass]]es.&lt;ref name=exploring /&gt;   More recent [[spectroscopic]] observations, using IRS on the Spitzer Space Telescope, give an effective temperature of 500&amp;ndash;550 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=four600k /&gt;  Since these temperature estimates are based on model comparisons, they should be treated with caution until the [[parallax]] of this object has been measured.&lt;ref name=exploring /&gt;

'''''Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood''''' is a [[memoir]] by [[Oliver Sacks]] about his childhood published in [[2001 in literature|2001]]. The book is named after Sacks's Uncle Dave, secretary of a business named Tungstalite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/1951_Directory_for_the_British_Glass_Industry:_Users_T|title=1951 Directory for the British Glass Industry: Users T - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which made [[incandescent lightbulb]]s with a [[tungsten]] [[Electrical filament|filament]], whom Oliver nicknamed Uncle Tungsten. According to family members, Oliver used the single nickname, Uncle Tungsten, to refer to a combination of Dave with several other individuals in the same family. Uncle Tungsten was fascinated with tungsten and believed it was the metal of the future.

The book combines autobiographical elements with a primer in the history and science of [[chemistry]]. However, it is not all about his youthful passion for chemistry, but also is eclectic, relating his memories of the catastrophic fire at [[the Crystal Palace]], his terrible experiences of sadism at school, his interest in [[amateur chemistry]], and a passing obsession with coloring his own black-and-white photographs in his home laboratory.

[[DARPA]]'s '''VLSI ([[very-large-scale integration]]) Project''' provided research funding to a wide variety of [[university]]-based teams in an effort to improve the [[state of the art]] in [[microprocessor]] design, then known as [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]]. Although little known in comparison to their work on what became the [[internet]], the VLSI Project is likely one of the most influential research projects in modern computer history. Its offspring include [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD Unix]], the [[RISC]] processor concept, many [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] tools still in use today, [[32-bit]] graphics [[workstations]], [[Fabless semiconductor company|fabless design houses]] and its own [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]], [[MOSIS]]. A similar DARPA project partnering with industry, [[VHSIC]], is generally considered to have had little or no impact.

==Project==
The Project was the brainchild of [[Caltech]] professor [[Carver Mead]] and [[Xerox PARC]] programmer [[Lynn Conway]] in the late 1970s. At the time microprocessor design was plateauing at the 100,000 [[transistor]] level because the tools available to the designers were simply unable to deal with more complex designs. [[16-bit]] and 16/32-bit designs were coming to market, but beyond that seemed too difficult and expensive to contemplate. Mead and Conway felt that there was no theoretical problem impeding progress, simply a number of practical ones, and set about solving these in order to make much more complex designs possible.

One of the primary efforts under VLSI was the creation of the hardware and software needed to automate the design process, which at that point was still largely manual. For a design containing hundreds of thousands of transistors, there was simply no machine short of a [[supercomputer]] that had the memory and performance needed to work on the design as a whole.

To address this problem and allow "average" companies to use automated tools, VLSI funded the '''Geometry Engine''' and '''Pixel-Planes''' projects at [[Stanford University]] and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (respectively) to create suitable graphics hardware at the desktop level. The former evolved into an effort to design a networked CAD workstation, known as the '''Stanford University Network'''. This is better known today under its [[acronym]], "SUN", as in [[Sun Microsystems]], which commercialized the design.

To provide a common ''software'' platform to run these new tools, VLSI also funded a Berkeley project to provide a standardized [[Unix]] implementation, known today as the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD). Almost all early workstations used BSD, including designs that evolved into Sun, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Apollo Computer]], and others. 
BSD later spawned  several descendants, [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[DragonFlyBSD]].

CAD software was an important part of the VLSI effort. This led to major improvements in CAD technology for layout, design rule checking, and simulation. The tools developed in this program were used extensively in both academic research programs and in industry. The ideas were developed in commercial implementations by companies such as [[VLSI Technology]], [[Cadnetix]], and Synopsis.

With these tools in hand, other VLSI funded projects were able to make huge strides in design complexity, sparking off the RISC revolution. The two major VLSI-related projects were [[Berkeley RISC]] and [[Stanford MIPS]], both of which relied heavily on the tools developed in previous VLSI projects. To allow design teams to produce test examples, the project also funded the building of their own fabrication facility, '''MOSIS''' (''Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service''), which received plans electronically. [[MOSIS]] remains in operation today.

Another important part of their fabrication process was the development of the '''multichip wafer''', which allowed a single wafer of silicon to be used to produce several chip designs at the same time. Previously a wafer would normally be used to produce a single design, which meant that there was a definite minimum production run one could consider starting up. In contrast the multichip wafer a small batch of a chip could be produced in the middle of a larger run, dramatically lowering the startup cost and prototyping stage.

==Direct outcomes of the VLSI Project==
*[[Sun-1]] was an offshoot of the Stanford [[SUN workstation|SUN workstation project]]
*[[Silicon Graphics]]'s workstation design was based on the [[Geometry pipelines|Geometry Engine concept]]
*UNC's [[Pixel-Planes]], [[PixelFlow]] and [[WarpEngine]] series of [[parallel processor]] graphics [[workstation]]s
*[[Berkeley RISC]] turned into [[SPARC]] at [[Sun Microsystems]]
*[[Stanford MIPS]] are used in many embedded applications such as [[set-top box]]es
*[[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD Unix]] and its derivatives remain a popular system

'''WISE J073444.02−715744.0''' (designation abbreviated to '''WISE 0734−7157''') is a [[brown dwarf]] of [[spectral class]] Y0,{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} located in constellation [[Volans]] at approximately 35 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}} It is one of the furthest Y0 brown dwarfs known.

==Discovery==
'''WISE 0734−7157''' was discovered in 2012 by [[J. Davy Kirkpatrick]] et al. from data, collected by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)]] [[Earth-orbit]]ing [[satellite]] — [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[infrared|infrared-wavelength]] 40 [[centimeter|cm]] (16 [[inch|in]]) [[space observatory|space telescope]], which mission lasted from December 2009 to February 2011. In 2012 Kirkpatrick et al. published a paper in [[The Astrophysical Journal]], where they presented discovery of seven new found by WISE [[brown dwarf]]s of [[spectral type]] Y, among which also was WISE 0734−7157.{{r|Kirkpatrick2012}}

==Distance==
[[Trigonometric parallax]] of WISE 0734−7157 is not yet measured. Therefore, there are only distance estimates of this object, obtained by indirect — spectrofotometric — means (see table).

'''Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis''' ('''Weka''') is a suite of [[machine learning]] software written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], developed at the [[University of Waikato]], [[New Zealand]]. It is [[free software]] licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].

==Description==
Weka contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for [[data analysis]] and [[predictive modeling]], together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/book.html |title=Data Mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques, 3rd Edition |accessdate=2011-01-19 |author=Ian H. Witten |author2=Eibe Frank |author3=Mark A. Hall  |year=2011 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original non-Java version of Weka was a [[Tcl]]/Tk front-end to (mostly third-party) modeling algorithms implemented in other programming languages, plus [[data preprocessing]] utilities in [[C (programming language)|C]], and a [[Makefile]]-based system for running machine learning experiments. This original version was primarily designed as a tool for analyzing data from agricultural domains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/publications/1994/Holmes-ANZIIS-WEKA.pdf |title=Weka: A machine learning workbench |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=G. Holmes |author2=A. Donkin |author3=I.H. Witten |year=1994 |work=Proc Second Australia and New Zealand Conference on Intelligent Information Systems, Brisbane, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/publications/1995/Garner95-imlc95.pdf |title=Applying a machine learning workbench: Experience with agricultural databases |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=S.R. Garner |author2=S.J. Cunningham |author3=G. Holmes |author4=C.G. Nevill-Manning |author5=I.H. Witten |year=1995 |work=Proc Machine Learning in Practice Workshop, Machine Learning Conference, Tahoe City, CA, USA |pages=14–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the more recent fully [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research. Advantages of Weka include:

* Free availability under the [[GNU General Public License]].
* Portability, since it is fully implemented in the [[Java programming language]] and thus runs on almost any modern computing platform.
* A comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques.
* Ease of use due to its graphical user interfaces.

Weka supports several standard [[data mining]] tasks, more specifically, data preprocessing, [[data clustering|clustering]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], visualization, and [[feature selection]]. All of Weka's techniques are predicated on the assumption that the data is available as one flat file or relation, where each data point is described by a fixed number of attributes (normally, numeric or nominal attributes, but some other attribute types are also supported). Weka provides access to [[SQL]] [[database]]s using [[Java Database Connectivity]] and can process the result returned by a database query. Weka provides access to [[deep learning]] with [[Deeplearning4j]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weka.sourceforge.net/packageMetaData/ |title=Weka Package Metadata |accessdate=2017-11-11 |year=2017 |work=SourceForge }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not capable of multi-relational data mining, but there is separate software for converting a collection of linked database tables into a single table that is suitable for processing using Weka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/pubs/reutemann_et_al.ps.gz |title=Proper: A Toolbox for Learning from Relational Data with Propositional and Multi-Instance Learners |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=P. Reutemann |author2=B. Pfahringer |author3=E. Frank |year=2004 |work=17th Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI2004) |publisher=Springer-Verlag }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important area that is currently not covered by the algorithms included in the Weka distribution is sequence modeling.

== User interfaces ==

Weka's main user interface is the ''Explorer'', but essentially the same functionality can be accessed through the component-based ''Knowledge Flow'' interface and from the [[command line]]. There is also the ''Experimenter'', which allows the systematic comparison of the predictive performance of Weka's machine learning algorithms on a collection of datasets.

The ''Explorer'' interface features several panels providing access to the main components of the workbench:

* The ''Preprocess'' panel has facilities for importing data from a [[database]], a [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) file, etc., and for preprocessing this data using a so-called ''filtering'' algorithm. These filters can be used to transform the data (e.g., turning numeric attributes into discrete ones) and make it possible to delete instances and attributes according to specific criteria.
* The ''Classify'' panel enables applying [[Statistical classification|classification]] and [[Regression analysis|regression]] algorithms (indiscriminately called ''classifiers'' in Weka) to the resulting dataset, to estimate the [[accuracy]] of the resulting [[Predictive modeling|predictive model]], and to visualize erroneous predictions, [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC) curves, etc., or the model itself (if the model is amenable to visualization like, e.g., a [[decision tree]]). 
* The ''Associate'' panel provides access to [[Association rule learning|association rule learners]] that attempt to identify all important interrelationships between attributes in the data. 
* The ''Cluster'' panel gives access to the [[cluster analysis|clustering]] techniques in Weka, e.g., the simple [[k-means]] algorithm. There is also an implementation of the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|expectation maximization algorithm]] for learning a mixture of [[normal distribution]]s. 
* The ''Select attributes'' panel provides algorithms for identifying the most predictive attributes in a dataset. 
* The ''Visualize'' panel shows a [[scatter plot]] matrix, where individual scatter plots can be selected and enlarged, and analyzed further using various selection operators.

== Native regression tools ==
Weka has a large number of regression and classification tools. Native packages are the ones included in the executible Weka software, while other non-native ones can be downloaded and used within R.Weka environment. Among the native packages, the most famous tool is the M5p model tree package. The full list of tools is available [https://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Classifiers here]. Some of the regression tools are:

* M5Rules (M5' algorithm presented in terms of mathematical function without a tree)
* DecisionStump (same as M5' but with a single number output in each node)
* M5P (splitting domain into successive binary regions and then fit linear models to each tree node)
* RandomForest (several model trees combined)
* RepTree (several model trees combined)
* ZeroR (the average value of outputs)
* DecisionRules (splits data into several regions based on a single independent variable and provides a single output value for each range)
* LinearRegression
* SMOreg (support vector regression)
* SimpleLinearRegression (uses an intercept and only 1 input variable for multivariate data)
* MultiLayerPerceptron (neural network)
* GaussianProcesses

== Extension packages ==
In version 3.7.2, a package manager was added to allow the easier installation of extension packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weka.wikispaces.com/How+do+I+use+the+package+manager%3F|title=weka - How do I use the package manager?|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some functionality that used to be included with Weka prior to this version has since been moved into such extension packages, but this change also makes it easier for others to contribute extensions to Weka and to maintain the software, as this modular architecture allows independent updates of the Weka core and individual extensions.

==History==

* In 1993, the [[University of Waikato]] in [[New Zealand]] began development of the original version of Weka, which became a mix of Tcl/Tk, C, and Makefiles.
* In 1997, the decision was made to redevelop Weka from scratch in Java, including implementations of modeling algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/publications/1999/99IHW-EF-LT-MH-GH-SJC-Tools-Java.pdf |title=Weka: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations |accessdate=2007-06-26 |author=Ian H.

* In 2005, Weka received the [[SIGKDD]] Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Service Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2005/n13/2i.html |title=KDnuggets news on SIGKDD Service Award 2005 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |author=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |date=2005-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigkdd/awards_service.php |title=Overview of SIGKDD Service Award winners |accessdate=2007-06-25 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, [[Pentaho]] Corporation acquired an exclusive licence to use Weka for [[business intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pentaho.com/pentaho-acquires-weka-project|title=Pentaho Acquires Weka Project|work=Pentaho|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the data mining and predictive analytics component of the Pentaho business intelligence suite.

'''Windage''' is a [[force]] created on an object by [[friction]] when there is relative movement between [[air]] and the object. '''Windage loss''' is the reduction in efficiency due to windage forces.

There are two causes of windage:
# The object is moving and being slowed by [[Air resistance|resistance]] from the air.
# A [[wind]] is blowing producing a [[force]] on the object.

The term can refer to:
* The effect of the force, for example the deflection of a missile or an aircraft by a cross wind.
* The area and shape of the object that make it susceptible to friction, for example those parts of a [[boat]] that are exposed to the wind.
* The difference between the bore and the diameter of the cannonball in a [[muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] [[cannon]] or [[Muzzleloader|firearm]].

[[Aerodynamic]] [[streamliner|streamlining]] can be used to reduce windage.

There is a [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] effect similar to windage.

== Ballistics ==
In [[firearms]] parlance, the word ''windage'' refers to the sight adjustment used to compensate for the horizontal deviation of the [[projectile]] [[trajectory]] from the intended point of impact due to [[external ballistics#Wind|wind drift]] or [[Coriolis effect]].  By contrast, the adjustment for the vertical deviation is the ''[[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]]''.  ''Kentucky windage'' refers to the practice of aiming to one side of the target to adjust for wind, without changing the existing settings on the [[gunsight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXY0yQnvmmUC&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Kentucky+windage)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q-5PVMPTIMGOiwL1mYGICQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Kentucky%20windage)&amp;f=false | title=The Facts on File Dictionary of American Regionalisms | publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | author=Hendrickson, Robert | year=2000 | isbn=9781438129921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Windage'' can also refer to the difference in diameter between the bore and the shot, especially in muskets and cannons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An elementary treatise on artillery and infantry|last=Kingsbury|first=Charles P.|authorlink=|last2=|first2=|editorn-last=|editorn-first=|edition=|volume=|year=1849|origyear=|page=59|pages=|publisher=GP Putnam|place=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22cannon%22%20bronze%20iron&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q=windage&amp;f=false|accessdate=|isbn=|oclc=761213440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automobiles ==
In automotive parlance, windage refers to parasitic drag on the [[crankshaft]] due to sump oil splashing on the cranktrain during rough driving, and/or dissipating energy in turbulence from the cranktrain moving the crankcase gas and oil mist at high RPM. Windage may also inhibit the migration of oil into the sump and back to the oil pump, creating lubrication problems. Some manufacturers and aftermarket vendors have developed special scrapers to remove excess oil from the counterweights and windage screens to create a barrier between the crankshaft and oil sump.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crank-scrapers.com/What%20is%20a%20crank-scraper.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.circletrack.com/techarticles/ctrp_0603_oil_pan_design_windage_tech/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1161">The '''World Livestock Auctioneer Championship''' is an annual competition of livestock [[auctioneer]]s who practice the [[auction chant]] typical of rural areas in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The competition is sponsored by the [[Livestock Marketing Association]], and was first held in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmaweb.com/livestock-marketing-association/WLAC/history.html WLAC history] at official site&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Curing won the competition in 2017. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lmaweb.com/brian-curless-wins-2017-world-livestock-auctioneer-championship/|title=Livestock Marketing Association    Brian Curless wins 2017 World Livestock Auctioneer Championship|last=quannt|website=lmaweb.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yevgeny Ivanovich Tolstikov''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Иванович Толстиков}}) (February 9, 1913 – December 3, 1987) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[polar explorer]], awarded by the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] title. He led the [[Third Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] and one of the first [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|manned drifting ice stations]] in the [[Arctic]].

In 1979, he was made deputy chairman of the [[State Committee for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control]].

A [[minor planet]] [[3357 Tolstikov]] discovered by Czech astronomer [[Antonín Mrkos]] in 1984 is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&amp;q=3357+Tolstikov+1984+FT Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;
