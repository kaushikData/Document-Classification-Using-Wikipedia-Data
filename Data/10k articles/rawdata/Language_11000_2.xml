'''Arakanese''' (also known as '''Rakhine''' {{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|aɪ|n}}; {{lang-my|ရခိုင်ဘာသာ}}, [[MLC Transcription System|MLCTS]]: ''ra.hkuing bhasa'' {{IPA-my|ɹəkʰàɪɴ bàθà|}}) is a language closely related to [[Burmese language|Burmese]], of which it is often considered a dialect. "Arakan" is the former name for the [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] region. Arakanese can be divided into three dialects: [[Sittwe]]–[[Marma people|Marma]] (about two thirds of speakers), [[Ramree dialect|Ramree]], and [[Thandwe]].{{sfn|Okell|1995|p=3}}

==Vocabulary==
There are significant vocabulary differences from Standard Burmese. Some are native words with no cognates in Standard Burmese, like "sarong" ({{my|လုံခြည်}} in Standard Burmese, {{my|ဒယော}} in Arakanese). Others are loan words from [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[English language|English]], and [[Hindi]], not found in Standard Burmese. An example is "hospital," which is called {{my|ဆေးရုံ}} in Standard Burmese, but is called {{my|သေပ်လှိုင်}} (pronounced {{IPA|[θeɪʔ l̥àɪɴ]/[ʃeɪʔ l̥àɪɴ]}}) in Arakanese, from English "sick lines." Other words simply have different meanings (e.g., "afternoon", {{my|ညစ}} in Arakanese and {{my|ညနေ}} in Standard Burmese). Moreover, some archaic words in Standard Burmese are preferred in Arakanese. An example is the first person pronoun, which is {{my|အကျွန်}} in Arakanese (not {{my|ကျွန်တော်}}, as in Standard Burmese).

===Comparison===
A gloss of vocabulary differences between Standard Burmese and Arakanese is below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/programmes/2011/04/110401_alinkar_paleban_18.shtml?bw=nb&amp;mp=wm&amp;bbcws=1&amp;news=1|title=ရခိုင်စကားနဲ့ ဗမာစကား|date=1 April 2011|work=BBC Burmese|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Arakanese prominently uses the {{IPA|/r/}} sound, which has merged to the {{IPA|/j/}} sound in standard Burmese. This is particularly interesting because the use of the ‘r’ sound is something that is avoided with Burmese speakers. For example, Burmese pronounce the words, “tiger” or  “to hear” (both words have similar pronunciation) as “kya,” where in Arakanese, it would be pronounced as, “kra.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://viss.wordpress.com/2007/07/02/the-arakanese-dialect/|title=The Arakanese dialect|date=2007-07-02|website=Fifty Viss|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Arakanese has merged various vowel sounds like  {{my|ဧ}} ({{IPA|[e]}}) vowel to ဣ ({{IPA|[i]}}). Hence, a word like "blood" is {{my|သွေး}} ({{IPA|[θwé]}}) in standard Burmese while it pronounced {{IPA|[θwí]}} in Arakanese. According to speakers of standard Burmese, Arakanese only has an intelligibility of seventy-five percent with Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viss.wordpress.com/2007/07/02/the-arakanese-dialect/ Information on Arakanese]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is less voicing in Arakanese than in Standard Burmese, occurring only when the consonant is unaspirated.{{sfn|Okell|1995|p=4, 14}} Unlike in Burmese, voicing never shifts from {{IPA|[θ]}} to {{IPA|[ð]}}.{{sfn|Okell|1995|p=14}}

Because Arakanese has preserved the {{IPA|/r/}} sound, the {{IPA|/-r-/}} medial (preserved only in writing in Standard Burmese with the diacritic {{my|ြ}}) is still distinguished in the following consonant clusters: {{IPA|/ɡr- kr- kʰr- ŋr- pr- pʰr- br- mr- m̥r- hr-/}}.

The Arakanese dialect has a higher frequency of open vowels weakening to {{IPA|/ə/}}. An example is the word for "salary," ({{my|လခ}}) which is {{IPA|[la̰ɡa̰]}} in standard Burmese, but {{IPA|[ləkha̰]}} in Arakanese.

The following are [[consonant]]al, [[vowel]] and [[rhyme]] changes found in the Arakanese [[dialect]]:{{sfn|Okell|1995}}{{sfn|Houghton|1897|pp=453–61}}

In 2014, he won the [[Padmaprabha Literary Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/novelist-cv-balakrishnan-chosen-for-padmaprabha-award/861213|title=Novelist C.V. Balakrishnan Chosen for Padmaprabha Award|date=24 September 2014|publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Balakrishnan was born in [[Payyannur]], [[Kannur district]], Kerala. After completing his school education, he took training in teaching and worked in various schools before shifting to [[Calcutta]] in 1979 where he worked as a freelance journalist. It was in Calcutta he began writing ''[[Ayussinte Pusthakam]]''.

Balakrishnan is married to Pathmavathi and has two children: Nandan and Nayana. He resides in Kalikkadavu, [[Kasaragod district]], Kerala.

==''Ayussinte Pusthakam''==
{{Main|Ayussinte Pusthakam}}
''Ayussinte Pusthakam'' is considered one of the major works in the post-modernist Malayalam literature. Balakrishnan began writing this novel when he moved to [[Calcutta]] in late-1970s. An old edition of [[the Bible]] at St. Paul's Cathedral in Calcutta triggered the book in him. It took him three years to complete the novel. Says the author: "All the characters and villages of Christian settlers were in my mind long before I began thinking about writing ''Ayussinte Pusthakam''. The characters are based on people I met during my course as a school teacher in a village in Kasaragod. I wrote ''Ayussinte Pusthakam'' at a time when I was going through an emotionally difficult period; my relation with my father was strained and I was feeling very lonely. ''Ayussinte Pusthakam'' is about loneliness.” The book is also about sin and sadness, written in a style and language that have been judiciously borrowed from The Bible."&lt;ref name="Book of life"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/05/16/stories/2008051650140300.htm "Book of life"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The novel was successfully adapted for the stage by [[suveeran]] in 2008. It won many [[Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi]] Awards including one for the best play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7476">A '''catalogue aria''' is a genre of [[opera]] [[aria]] in which the singer recounts a list of information (people, places, food, dance steps, etc.) that was popular in Italian [[comic opera]] in the latter half of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. "[[Madamina, il catalogo è questo]]" from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' is the most famous example, and is often referred to as "'''the''' catalogue aria". Leporello notes how many lovers the title character has had in each country he has visited. Pasquale sings two such arias in [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''[[Orlando paladino]]'', "Ho viaggiato in Francia, in Spagna" in act one, which lists the countries to which he has traveled, and "Ecco spiano" in act 2, which rattles off all of his varied musical talents.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. C. Robbins Landon]] and [[David Wyn Jones]]. ''Haydn: His Life and Music''. Bloomington and Indianapolis: [[Indiana University Press]], 1988, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional devices of the catalogue aria include a solidly neutral opening, a section of rising comic excitement full of rapid [[patter]] and an emphatic final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]], normally closing with an [[epigram]].&lt;ref name="Platoff"&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
The clearest antecedent of the catalogue aria of Mozart and librettist [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]] can be found in the 1787 opera, ''[[Don Giovanni Tenorio]]'', with which they were both familiar, composed by [[Giuseppe Gazzaniga]] on a libretto by [[Giovanni Bertati]]. Da Ponte based much of his libretto on Bertati's, heavily revised for content and language but significantly retaining much of the narrative structure.&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|297}} In this opera, one finds a similar catalogue aria for the equivalent character of Leporello, Pasquariello. [[John Platoff]] sees superiority in Da Ponte's text as well as Mozart's music. The Bertati aria, "Dell' Italia ed Alemagna" uses punch lines such as "ve ne sono non se quante (there I know not how many)" while Da Ponte uses specific numerical figures to add to the humor (e.g. "ma in Espagna, son già mille e tre, mille e tre, mille e tre (But in Spain he had one thousand and three, one thousand and three, one thousand and three)".&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|304}} Bertati also structures the aria differently, beginning immediately with the list and not including an introduction, which is in the preceding [[recitative]]. Da Ponte removed ugly words and references to women of lower social station ("cuoche," "guattere"),&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|305}} and took a reference that being female is enough to be of interest to Giovanni (although Bertati's Giovanni, unlike Da Ponte's, is not interested in old ladies), to a more subtle conclusion shifted to the closing that it Giovanni wants anyone who wears a skirt.&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|306}} Platoff considers Mozart's approach to the music "genius" in that Mozart finishes the patter in the first part of the aria before going on to the second. His unconventional approach divides the aria "based on content rather than metre."&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|310}} By dividing the aria at line 14, Mozart separates the numbers of women from the kinds of women, "contrary to the natural tendency to put the energetic high point at the end of the comic aria,"&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|310}} although Platoff also notes that [[Giovanni Paisiello]] does this in "Scorsi già molti paesi," a buffa aria from ''[[The Barber of Seville (Paisiello)|Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' (libretto by [[Giuseppe Petrosellini]]) to which Platoff compares catalogue arias in general. The minuet for of the andante section allows Leporello to imitate his master. This, Platoff argues, "draws comedy from human foible rather than mechanized display of patter declamation", suggesting that Leporello is telling us as much about himself as he is about Giovanni.&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|311}} Leporello's aria contains no epigram—the Andante section takes its place.

C. Headington, R. Westbroook, and T. Barfoot in ''Opera: A History'' (1987) say that "Ho viaggiato in Francia, in Spagna" "must surely be ranked as the forerunner of Leporello's... aria",&lt;ref name="Platoff" /&gt;{{rp|296}} but they seem to have gone to the next most familiar piece of music rather than digging into research. Platoff notes that catalogue arias were a particular specialty of Bertati.&lt;ref&gt;(Platoff citing Daniela Goldin. "Aspetti dela librettistica italiana fra 1770 e 1830" ''AnMc'' no 21. (1982), 128–91.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Applied Linguistics''' ('''CAL''') is a private, nonprofit organization founded in 1959 and  headquartered in Washington, DC. CAL’s mission is to promote language learning and cultural understanding by serving as a trusted source for research, resources, and policy analysis. Through its work, CAL seeks solutions to issues involving language and culture as they relate to access and equity in education and society around the world. CAL’s President and Chief Executive Officer is Joel Gómez.

The organization carries out its mission by working in the fields of bilingual and dual language education, English as a second language, world languages education, language policy, assessment, immigrant and refugee integration, literacy dialect studies; and the education of linguistically and culturally diverse adults and children (Peterson, 2004). Staff members conduct research, design and develop language assessments and instructional materials, provide technical assistance and professional development, and disseminate information and resources related to language and culture.

==History==
At the close of the 1950s, issues of language diversity, interest in language policy, and the emergence of English as a world language created a demand for information about world languages and for expertise in linguistics and language training. In the United States, reactions to the launch of Sputnik and the continuation of the Cold War led to concern about the ability of U.S. schools to train students in mathematics, the sciences, and foreign languages. CAL was created in this environment of increased interest in language issues by [[Charles A. Ferguson|Dr. Charles A. Ferguson]], a pioneer in the field of applied linguistics. Through a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] to the [[Modern Language Association]], CAL was established in 1959  to serve as a liaison between the academic world of linguistics, and the practical world of language education and language-related concerns (Spolsky, 1999; Troike, 2008). CAL's original mandate was to improve the teaching of English around the world; encourage the teaching and learning of less commonly taught languages; contribute new knowledge to the field by conducting language research to resolve social and educational problems; and serve as a clearinghouse for information collection, analysis, and dissemination and as a coordinating agency to bring together scholars and practitioners involved in language-related issues.

==Current activities==
Since its inception, CAL has played a leading role in conducting research on language use, language learning, and effective teaching methods, and translating research into practical applications to help language learners succeed (Christian, 2008; Berns, 2010). Among the populations that CAL serves are language educators of children and adults who are learning foreign languages and English as a second language; immigrants and refugees in the United States and the agencies that provide services for them; schools, school districts, and other educational institutions in need of curriculum development, professional development, and assessments; and policy makers who need information about language and culture to address the important issues of the day.

CAL's [http://www.cal.org/ website] provides detailed information about the organization and access to resources on a wide range of topics including

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/english-learners English Learners]: CAL works with educators and practitioners to help the growing number of students who speak English as a second language in the United States succeed in the classroom and the workplace.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/world-languages World Languages Education]: Proficiency in languages other than English is critical in the global society. CAL provides resources to inform language education at all levels of instruction, from early language programs in elementary schools through graduate level programs for individuals seeking high levels of proficiency in a range of languages.

[http://www.cal.org/siop Sheltered Instruction]: CAL supports educators who are implementing sheltered instruction, an approach to teaching that promotes language development and content-area learning for students who are not yet proficient in the language of instruction.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/english-learners/bilingual-and-dual-language-education Bilingual and Dual Language Education]: Proficiency in more than one language is a valuable skill to be cultivated and nurtured in schools and communities. CAL provides information and resources to support the development of bilingualism and the academic success of English language learners through programs that utilize their native language in instruction.
 
[http://www.cal.org/heritage/ Heritage and Community Languages]: The United States has a rich diversity of languages other than English that are spoken in communities around the country. CAL offers a rich set of resources about heritage and community languages.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/immigrant-refugee-integration Immigrant and Refugee Integration]: Since the major influx of refugees from Southeast Asia in the 1970s, CAL has conducted programs in refugee integration and orientation, helping newcomers understand fundamental aspects of life in the United States while helping service providers and interested parties understand the rich cultures and likely resettlement needs of the new members of their communities.

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/testing-assessment Testing and Assessment]: CAL researches and develops assessments of language proficiency in English as a second language and foreign languages at all educational and proficiency levels. Specialists also examine the language and culture issues related to assessment of subject matter knowledge through a second language for English learners and design innovative approaches to addressing these concerns. CAL has been involved in the development of many tests, including the TOEFL. The TOEFL was originally developed at the Center for Applied Linguistics under the direction of Stanford University applied linguistics professor and CAL's first president Dr. Charles A. Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.cal.org/areas-of-impact/language-planning-policy Language Planning and Policy]: CAL facilitates collaboration nationally and internationally among scholars and other stakeholders and is committed to making significant contributions to the dialogue and debate about language planning and policy with the goal of expanding language choices and widening the context within which language policy decisions are made. In particular, CAL is focusing on language in education planning as a means of promoting language acquisition and achieving greater equity of access to resources.

[http://www.cal.org/what-we-do/research Research]: CAL is involved in a variety of research projects that inform its mission, such as math, science, and language education for English learners, biliteracy development for Spanish-speaking students, effective approaches for developing high levels of language proficiency in English and other languages, and innovative methods for assessing math and science knowledge in English learners. Much of CAL’s grant and project work includes a substantial research component.

[http://www.cal.org/what-we-do/services Services]: CAL offers solutions to the challenges faced by practitioners working with language learners at all levels of instruction through professional development, technical assistance, program evaluation, and other services.

[http://www.cal.org/resource-center Resources]: CAL provides research-based language and cultural education resources and testing tools, including publications, teacher tools, free downloadable digests, and databases and directories of information about language programs.

On its [http://www.cal.org/ website], CAL provides information about current [http://www.cal.org/what-we-do/projects projects]. The organization also distributes a monthly email newsletter, ''[http://www.cal.org/news-and-events/cal-news CALNews]'', and an [http://www.cal.org/who-we-are/annual-reports annual report].

{{lowercase|title=eXtended WordNet}}

The '''eXtended WordNet''' is a project at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] (and funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]) that aims to improve [[WordNet]] by semantically parsing the [[Lexical definition|gloss]]es, thus making the information contained in these definitions available for automatic knowledge processing systems. It is freely available under  a [[BSD License|BSD style license]]. Although it has not been updated since November 2004 (the most recent version is based on WordNet 2.0), it still remains a useful resource.

==Database format==

The database is available as a set of four [[XML]] files - one each for [[verb]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s. The following information is extracted from the glosses:
* [[Word sense disambiguation]]
* [[Parse tree]]
* [[Logic form]]

As an example, the following information is available for the [[synset]] ''excellent, first-class, fantabulous'':

Gloss:
  of the highest quality

Word sense disambiguation:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
  &lt;wf pos="IN" &gt;of&lt;/wf&gt;
  &lt;wf pos="DT" &gt;the&lt;/wf&gt;
  &lt;wf pos="JJS" lemma="highest" quality="normal" wnsn="1" &gt;highest&lt;/wf&gt;
  &lt;wf pos="NN" lemma="quality" quality="normal" wnsn="2" &gt;quality&lt;/wf&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Parse tree:
  (TOP (S (NP (JJ excellent) )
          (VP (VBZ is)
              (NP (NP (NN something) )
                  (PP (IN of)
                      (NP (DT the) (JJS highest) (NN quality) ) ) ) )
          (. .) ) )

Logic form:
  excellent:JJ(x1) -&gt; of:IN (x1, x2) highest:JJ(x2) quality:NN(x2)

==Data quality==

Each gloss is first [[Part-of-speech tagging|tagged]] using [[Brill's tagger]]. The glosses are then parsed using both [[Charniak's parser]] and an in-house [[Collins' parser|Collins']] style parser. Each parsed gloss is then assigned a level of quality:
* Gold: those that have been manually checked
* Silver: those where both parsers have produced the same output
* Normal: those where different outputs have been produced&amp;mdash;in these situations the output of the in-house parser is used

An '''ecosystem model''' is an [[abstract model|abstract]], usually [[mathematical model|mathematical]], representation of an [[ecological system]] (ranging in scale from an individual [[population]], to an [[ecological community]], or even an entire [[biome]]), which is studied to better understand the real system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hall, Charles A.S.|author2=Day, John W.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecosystem Modeling in Theory and Practice: An Introduction with Case Histories|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87081-216-3|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using data gathered from the field, ecological relationships—such as the relation of sunlight and water availability to [[photosynthetic]] rate, or that between [[predator and prey]] populations—are derived, and these are combined to form [[ecosystem]] models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of models==
There are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) ''analytic'' models and (2) ''simulation'' / ''computational'' models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|title=Handbook of environmental and ecological modeling|publisher=CRC Press|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56670-202-7|pages=403–404|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGJ1Jm6txQEC&amp;pg=PA403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant, William Edward|author2=Swannack, Todd M.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Ecological modeling: a common-sense approach to theory and practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-6168-8|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3qUumawqEoC&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecopath]] is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model [[marine ecosystems]].

==Model design==
[[File:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the Silver Springs model (Odum, 1971). Note the aggregation into functional groups such as "herbivores" or "decomposers".&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). Environment, Power, and Society. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Soetaert, Karline|author2=Herman, Peter M.J.|last-author-amp=yes|title=A practical guide to ecological modelling: using R as a simulation platform|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4020-8623-6|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVjDtSmJqhAC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this [[complexity]], [[ecosystem]] models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillman, Michael|author2=Hails, Rosemary|last-author-amp=yes|title=An introduction to ecological modelling: putting practice into theory|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|isbn=978-0-632-03634-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7U8Uf10TpyIC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Felix|chapter=What are the General Conditions Under Which Ecological Models Can Be Applied|editor=Jopp, Fred|display-editors=etal|title=Modeling Complex Ecological Dynamics|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-3-642-05028-2|pages=13–14|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEgIo-BOzF0C&amp;pg=PA13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of [[state variable]]s and [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical functions]] that describe the nature of the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Day, 1990: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5733/afin.052.0112 |title=Functional Feeding Groups as a Taxonomic Surrogate for a Grassland Arthropod Assemblage |journal=African Invertebrates |volume=52 |pages=217–228 |year=2011 |last1=Buschke |first1=Falko T. |last2=Seaman |first2=Maitland T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of [[space]] used.  Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. ''Spatially explicit models'' (also called "spatially distributed" or "landscape" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCallum, Hamish|chapter=Spatial Parameters|title=Population parameters: estimation for ecological models|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-86542-740-2|page=184|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFKIbI4cLUEC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tenhunen, John D.|display-editors=etal|title=Ecosystem approaches to landscape management in Central Europe|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-3-540-67267-8|pages=586–587|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSanEfM25uAC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ball, George L.|chapter=Ecological modeling|title=Encyclopedia of environmental science|publisher=Springer|year=1999|isbn=978-0-412-74050-3|pages=154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0iX2z48qkUC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sklar, Fred H.|author2=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|last-author-amp=yes|chapter=The Use and Uncertainties of Spatial Data for Landscape Models: An Overview with Examples from the Florida Everglades|editor=Hunsaker, Carolyn T.|title=Spatial uncertainty in ecology: implications for remote sensing and GIS applications|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-387-95129-4|page=15|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbczI9mw2v8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validation==
After construction, models are ''validated'' to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model's output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jørgensen, Sven Erik|author2=Bendoricchio, G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Fundamentals of ecological modelling|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|isbn=978-0-08-044028-6|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geNPWdVBbDYC&amp;pg=PA79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pastorok, Robert A.|chapter=Introduction|title=Ecological modeling in risk assessment: chemical effects on populations, ecosystems, and landscapes|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-56670-574-5|page=22|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNdRGbpDWgUC&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shifley, S.R.|editor=Millspaugh, Joshua J.|editor2=Thompson, Frank Richard|chapter=Validation of Landscape-Scale Decision Support Models That Predict Vegetation and Wildlife Dynamics|title=Models for planning wildlife conservation in large landscapes|publisher=Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-12-373631-4|page=419|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GLtcJs2f810C&amp;pg=PA419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voinov, Alexey|title=Systems Science and Modeling for Ecological Economics|year=2008|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-372583-7|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nol8DOt-qe8C&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reuter, Hauke|chapter=How Valid Are Model Results?

==Examples==
===The Lotka–Volterra equations===
[[File:Lotka Volterra dynamics.svg|thumb|300px|right|A sample [[Time series|time-series]] of the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka-Volterra model]].  Note that the two populations exhibit [[Limit cycle|cyclic behaviour]], and that the predator cycle lags behind that of the prey.]]
One of the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Earlier work on [[smallpox]] by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[human overpopulation]] by [[Thomas Malthus]] predates that of Lotka and Volterra, but is not strictly ecological in nature&lt;/ref&gt; and most well-known, ecological models is the [[predation|predator-prey]] model of [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1925)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lotka | first=A. J. | year=1925 | title=The Elements of Physical Biology | publisher=Williams &amp; Williams Co., Baltimore, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vito Volterra]] (1926).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/118558a0 |title=Fluctuations in the Abundance of a Species considered Mathematically |journal=Nature |volume=118 |issue=2972 |pages=558–560 |year=1926 |last1=Volterra |first1=Vito }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model takes the form of a pair of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, one representing a prey [[species]], the other its predator.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt} = \alpha . X - \beta . X . Y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dY}{dt} = \gamma . \beta . X . Y - \delta . Y&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| style="background-color: transparent; width: 90%"
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" |
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the number/concentration of the prey species;

* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the prey species' growth rate;
| width="50%" align="left" valign="top" |
* &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the predation rate of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; upon &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] efficiency of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the mortality rate of the predator species
|} &lt;/center&gt;

Volterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in [[fish]] and [[shark]] populations observed in the [[Adriatic Sea]] after the [[First World War]] (when [[fishery|fishing]] was curtailed).  However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Begon | first=M. | last2=Harper | first2=J. L. | last3=Townsend | first3=C. R. | year=1988 | title=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities | publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications Inc., Oxford, UK | title-link=Ecology: Individuals, Populations and Communities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models:  modelled biological [[population]]s experience [[Malthusian growth model|growth]], interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or [[Competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|competitors]]) and suffer [[mortality rate|mortality]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi-Ginzburg equations|Arditi-Ginzburg]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80211-5 |title=Coupling in predator-prey dynamics: Ratio-Dependence |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=139 |issue=3 |pages=311–326 |year=1989 |last1=Arditi |first1=Roger |last2=Ginzburg |first2=Lev R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models.  According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong.  They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R.

The [[Theoretical ecology|theoretical ecologist]] [[Robert Ulanowicz]] has used [[information theory]] tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing [[mutual information]] (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulanowicz|first=Robert E.|title=Ecology, the Ascendent Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSKDw_zAMJUC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1997|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10829-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Farrukh Ahmad''' (10 June 1918 – 19 October 1974) was a poet and writer of [[Bangladesh]]. He is commonly known as the 'Poet of the Muslim renaissance', as many of his poems embody the spirit of resurrection, particularly in the hearts of the down-trodden Muslims of the then Bengal.&lt;ref name="farrukhahmadhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abdussamad.co.uk/clients/londoni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=13|title=Poet of Islamic Renaissance|website=abdussamad.co.uk|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Farrukh Ahmad was born in the village of Majhail of [[Sreepur Upazila, Magura|Sreepur Upazila]] of [[Magura District]]. He was the second son of Syed Hatem Ali and Begum Rawshan. He graduated from Khulna Zila School in 1937 and did his IA from [[Surendranath College|Ripon College]], Kolkata in 1939. He then enrolled at the prestigious [[Scottish Church College]] to pursue a BA (Hons) in Philosophy and English Literature, but was unable to his complete studies there.&lt;ref&gt;''Some Alumni of Scottish Church College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he studied at the [[City College, Kolkata|City College]]. He married his cousin Saieda Taieba Khatun in 1942.&lt;ref name="farrukhahmadhistory"/&gt; He started his professional life in Inspector General (IG) Prison Office in 1943. He worked for Civil Supply for a short time in 1944.&lt;ref name="farrukhfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farrukhfoundation.org/bio.php|title=Farrukh Foundation|website=farrukhfoundation.org|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a student, Farrukh Ahmad had been attracted to the radical [[humanism]] of [[Manabendra Nath Roy]] and had participated in leftist politics. From the forties, however, he supported the [[Pakistan movement]] to have an independent Muslim state created within the region of South Asia from the British Indian empire. Despite his Pakistani and Islamic ideals, he supported the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] in 1952 and, later, the [[liberation war]] of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ahmad,_Farrukh|title=Ahmad, Farrukh - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
His poems reflect the [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] legacy in Bengal and are replete with Arabic and Persian words. He also wrote satirical poems and sonnets.

'''Focus''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|foc}}''') is a grammatical category that determines which part of the sentence contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information.&lt;ref name=Halliday&gt;{{Citation

==Functional approaches==
Information structure has been described at length by a number of linguists as a grammatical phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Prince|first=E|title=Towards a taxonomy of given-new information|year=1981|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chafe|first=W.L.|title=Givenness, Contrastiveness, Definiteness, Subjects, Topics and Points of View|year=1976|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Halliday|first=M.A.K.|title=Notes on Transitivity and Theme in English|year=1967|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lexicogrammatical structures that code prominence, or focus, of some information over other information has a particularly significant history dating back to the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weil|first=H.|title=The order of words in ancient languages compared with that of modern languages|year=1887|publisher=Ginn|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent attempts to explain focus phenomena in terms of discourse function, including those by [[Knud Lambrecht]] and [[Talmy Givón]], often connect focus with the packaging of new, old, and contrasting information. Lambrecht in particular distinguishes three main types of focus constructions: predicate-focus structure, argument-focus structure, and sentence-focus structure. Focus has also been linked to other more general cognitive processes, including [[attention]] orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Levelt|first=W J. M.|title=Speaking|year=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tomlin|first=R. S.|title=attention, voice, and word-order: an experimental, cross-linguistic study|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generative approaches==
Standard generative approaches to grammar argue that [[phonology]] and [[semantics]] cannot exchange information directly (''See Fig. 1'').  Therefore, syntactic mechanisms including features and [[transformational grammar|transformations]] include prosodic information regarding focus that is passed to the semantics and phonology.  [[File:SyntaxSplit.jpg|thumb|right|frame|Fig. 1 The Y-Model of Syntax, Semantics and Phonology]] 
Focus may be highlighted either prosodically or syntactically or both, depending on the language. In syntax this can be done assigning focus markers, as shown in (1), or by preposing as shown in (2):

(1) I saw [JOHN] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

(2) [JOHN] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, I saw.

In (1), focus is marked syntactically with the subscripted ‘f’  which is realized phonologically by a nuclear [[pitch accent]].  [[cleft sentence|Clefting]] induces an obligatory intonation break.  Therefore, in (2), focus is marked via word order and a nuclear pitch accent.

Focus also relates to phonology and has ramifications for how and where [[prosody (linguistics)|suprasegmental]] information such as [[rhythm]], [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] is encoded in the grammar, and in particular intonational tunes that mark focus.&lt;ref name=Beaver&gt;{{Citation

Specifically, the question/answer paradigm has been used as a diagnostic for what counts as new information.  For example, the focus pattern in (3) would be infelicitous if the question was ‘Did you see a grey dog or a black dog?’.

In (3) and (4), the pitch accent is marked in bold.  In (3), the pitch accent is placed on ''dog'' but the entire noun phrase ''a grey dog'' is under focus. In (4), the pitch accent is also placed on ''dog'' but only the noun ''dog'' is under focus.  In (5), pitch accent is placed on ''grey'' and only the adjective ''grey'' is under focus.

Historically, generative proposals made focus a feature bound to a single word within a sentence.  [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Morris Halle|Halle]]&lt;ref name=Chomsky&gt;{{Citation

Since this constituent is prominent sententially in a way that can contrast with lexical stress, this was originally referred to as "nuclear" stress.  The purpose of this rule was to capture the intuition that within each sentence, there is one word in particular that is accented more prominently due to its importance - this is said to form the [[sentence nucleus|nucleus]] of that sentence.

[[File:LeftPeriphery Rizzi 1997 eng.png|thumb|right|Left periphery structure, according to Rizzi (1997)]]
Focus was later suggested to be a structural position at the beginning of the sentence (or on the left periphery) in [[Romance languages]] such as Italian, as the lexical head of a Focus Phrase (or FP, following the [[X-bar theory]] of [[phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]).

Sound structure ([[phonology|phonological]] and [[phonetics|phonetic]]) studies of focus are not as numerous, as relational language phenomena tend to be of greater interest to syntacticians and semanticists. But this may be changing: a recent study found that not only do focused words and phrases have a higher range of pitch compared to words in the same sentence but that words following the focus in both [[American English]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]] were lower than normal in pitch and words before a focus are unaffected. The precise usages of focus in natural language are still uncertain. A continuum of possibilities could possibly be defined between precisely [[enunciation|enunciated]] and [[staccato]] styles of speech based on variations in [[pragmatics]] or [[timing (linguistics)|timing]].

Currently, there are two central themes in research on focus in generative linguistics.  First, given what words or expressions are prominent, what is the meaning of some sentence?  Rooth,&lt;ref name=Rooth1/&gt; Jacobs,&lt;ref name=Jacobs&gt;{{Citation

===Prominence and meaning===

Focus directly affects the semantics, or meaning, of a sentence.  Different ways of pronouncing the sentence affects the meaning, or, what the speaker intends to convey.  Focus distinguishes one interpretation of a sentence from other interpretations of the same sentence that do not differ in word order, but may differ in the way in which the words are taken to relate to each other.  To see the effects of focus on meaning, consider the following examples:

(6) John only introduced Bill to SUE.

In (6), accent is placed on Sue.  There are two readings of (6) - broad focus shown in (7) and narrow focus shown in (8):

(7) John only [introduced Bill to SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

(8) John only introduced Bill to [SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

The meaning of (7) can be summarized as ''the only thing John did was introduce Bill to Sue''.  The meaning of (8) can be summarized as ''the only person to whom John introduced Bill is Sue''.

In both (7) and (8), focus is associated with the focus sensitive expression ''only''.  This is known as association with focus.  The class of focus sensitive expressions in which focus can be associated with includes exclusives (''only'', ''just'') non-scalar additives (''merely'', ''too'') scalar additives (''also'', ''even''), particularlizers (''in particular'', ''for example''), intensifiers, quantificational adverbs, quantificational determiners, sentential connectives, emotives, counterfactuals, superlatives, negation and generics.&lt;ref name=Beaver/&gt;  It is claimed that focus operators must [[c-command]] their focus.

====Alternative semantics====

Beginning with Rooth,&lt;ref name=Rooth1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rooth2/&gt; the effects of focus on semantics can be said to be the introduction of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of alternatives that contrasts with the ordinary semantic meaning of a sentence.  Consider the following example:

(9) Mary only likes [SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:RoothOrdinary.jpg|thumb|right|frame|The syntactic/semantic tree of the ordinary meaning of the sentence ''Mary likes Sue.''&lt;ref name=Rooth2/&gt;]] The ordinary semantic meaning of (9) is the [[binary relation]]:

::&lt;math&gt;like\langle Mary, Sue\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

(9) is true if and only if ''Mary'' stands in the ''like'' relation to ''Sue''.  The set of alternatives that is a resultant of ''Sue'' being focused is the set:

::&lt;math&gt;\{like\langle Mary, y\rangle |y  \in E\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''E'' is the domain of [[type theory|entities]] or individuals.

The relevant alternatives for example (9) might be the set:

::&lt;math&gt;\{like\langle Mary, Sue\rangle, like\langle Mary, Bill\rangle, like\langle Mary, Lisa\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;.

In (9), the set of alternatives is said to contrast with the ordinary semantic meaning of because the speaker indicates that the ordinary semantic meaning is true while every alternative is false.  For example, in (9), ''Mary likes Sue'' is true while ''Mary likes Bill'' and ''Mary likes Lisa'' are both false.  Generally, the meaning of (9) can be summarized as ''Mary likes Sue and no one else''.

====Structured meanings====

Following Jacobs&lt;ref name=Jacobs/&gt; and Williams,&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; Krifka&lt;ref name=Krifka1/&gt; argues differently. Krifka claims focus partitions the semantics into a background part and focus part, represented by the pair:

[[File:KrifkaFocus.jpg|frame|right|200px|The syntactic/semantic tree of the sentence ''John only introduced [BILL] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to [SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name=Krifka1/&gt;]]

::&lt;math&gt;\langle B,F\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

The [[logical form]] of which represented in [[lambda calculus]] is:

::&lt;math&gt;\langle \lambda x.x, A\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

This pair is referred to as a ''structured meaning''. Structured meanings allow for a compositional semantic approach to sentences that involve single or multiple foci. This approach follows [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] (1897) Principle of Compositionality:  the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its parts, and the way in which those parts are combined into structured meanings. Krifka’s structured meaning theory represents focus in a transparent and compositional fashion it encompasses sentences with more than one focus as well as sentences with a single focus.  Krifka claims the advantages of structured meanings are twofold: 1) We can access the meaning of an item in focus directly, and 2) Rooth's&lt;ref name=Rooth1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rooth2/&gt; alternative semantics can be derived from a structured meaning approach but not vice versa.   To see Krifka’s approach illustrated, consider the following examples of single focus shown in (10) and multiple foci shown in (11):

(10) John introduced Bill to [SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

(11) John only introduced [BILL] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to [SUE] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.

Generally, the meaning of (10) can be summarized as ''John introduced Bill to Sue and no one else'', and the meaning of (11) can be summarized as ''the only pair of persons such that John introduced the first to the second is Bill and Sue''.

Specifically, the structured meaning of (10) is:

::&lt;math&gt;\langle introd(j, b, x), s\rangle&lt;/math&gt; where ''introd'' is the denotation of ''introduce'', '''j''' ''John'', '''b''' ''Bill'' and '''s''' ''Sue''.

The background part of the structured meaning is; ''introd (j, b, x)''; and the focus part is ''s''.

Through a (modified) form of functional application (or [[lambda calculus|beta reduction]]), the focus part of (10) and (11) is projected up through the syntax to the sentential level.  Importantly, each intermediate level has distinct meaning.

===Focus marking===

It has been claimed that ''new'' information in the discourse is accented while ''given'' information is not.  Generally, the properties of ''new'' and ''given'' are referred to as a word's discourse status.  Definitions of ''new'' and ''given'' vary.  Halliday&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt; defines ''given'' as “[[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphorically]]” recoverable, while ''new'' is defined to be “textually and situationally non-derivable information”.  To illustrate this point, consider the following discourse in (12) and (13):

(12) Why don’t you have some French TOAST?

(13) I’ve forgotten how to MAKE French toast.&lt;ref name=Ladd&gt;{{Citation

In (13) we note that the verb ''make'' is not given by the sentence in (12).  It is discourse new.  Therefore, it is available for accentuation.  However, ''toast'' in (13) is given in (12).  Therefore, it is not available for accentuation.  As previously mentioned, pitch accenting can relate to focus.  Accented words are often said to be in focus or F-marked often represented by F-markers. The relationship between accent placement is mediated through the discourse status of particular syntactic nodes.&lt;ref name=German&gt;{{Citation

====Selkirk and accent placement====

Selkirk&lt;ref name=Selkirk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkirk2/&gt; develops an explicit account of how F-marking propagates up [[parse tree|syntactic trees]].  Accenting indicates F-marking.  F-marking projects up a given syntactic tree such that both lexical items, i.e. [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminal nodes]] and phrasal levels, i.e. [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|nonterminal nodes]], can be F-marked.  Specifically, a set of rules determines how and where F-marking occurs in the syntax.  These rules are shown in (1) and (2):

(14) '''Basic Rule''':  An accented word is f-marked.

(15) '''Focus Projection''':

::a. F-marking the head of a phrase licenses F-marking of the phrase.

::b. F-marking of the internal argument of a head licenses the F-marking of the head.

::c. F-marking of the antecedent of a trace left by NP or wh-movement licenses F-marking of the trace.

To see how (14) and (15) apply, consider the following example:

::'''[[Judy (personal name)|Judy]]''' &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; [adopted &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; a '''parrot''' &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sub&gt;foc&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

Because there is no rule in (14) or (15) that licenses F-marking to the direct object from any other node, the direct object ''parrot'' must be accented as indicated in bold.  Rule (15b) allows F-marking to project from the direct object to the head verb ''adopted''.  Rule (15a) allows F-marking to project from the head verb to the VP ''adopted a parrot''. Selkirk&lt;ref name=Selkirk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkirk2/&gt; assumes the subject ''Judy'' is accented if F-marked as indicated in bold.&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

====Schwarzschild and accent placement====

Schwarzschild&lt;ref name=Schwarzschild1/&gt; points out weaknesses in Selkirk’s&lt;ref name=Selkirk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkirk2/&gt; ability to predict accent placement based on facts about the discourse.  Selkirk’s theory says nothing about how accentuation arises in sentences with entirely old information.  She does not fully articulate the notion of discourse status and its relation to accent marking.  Schwarzschild differs from Selkirk in that he develops a more robust model of discourse status.  Discourse status is determined via the entailments of the context.  This is achieved through the definition in (16):

(16) '''Definition of given''':  An utterance of U counts as given if it has a salient antecedent A and

::a. if U is type [[type theory|e]], then A and U corefer;

::b. otherwise:  modulo &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-type-shifting, A entails the existential F-closure of U.

The operation in (16b) can apply to any constituent. &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-type-shifting “is a way of transforming syntactic constituents into full [[proposition]]s so that it is possible to check whether they are [[entailment|entailed]] by the context”.&lt;ref name=German /&gt;  For example, the result of &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-type-shifting the VP in (17) is (18):

(17) [hums a happy tune]

(18) &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x''[''x'' hums a happy tune]&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

Note that (18) is a full proposition.  The existential F-closure in (16b) refers to the operation of replacing the highest F-marked node with an existentially closed variable. The operation is shown in (19) and (20):

(19) &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x''[''x'' hums [a happy &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; tune &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;]

(20) &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''Y''&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x''[''x'' hums ''Y'']&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

Given the discourse context in (21a) it is possible to determine the discourse status of any syntactic node in (21b):

(21)

::a.  Sean [hummed a happy tune] &lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;

::b. Angie [hummed [Chopin’s Funeral March] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

If the VP in (21a) is the salient antecedent for the VP in (21b), then the VP in (21b) counts as given. &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;-type-shifed VP in (21a) is shown in (22).  The existential F-closure of the VP in (21b) is shown in (23):

(22)  &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x''[''x'' hums a happy tune]

(23)  &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''Y''&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x''[''x'' hums ''Y'']&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

(22) entails (23).  Therefore, the VP of (21b) counts as given.  Schwarzschild&lt;ref name=Schwarzschild1/&gt; assumes an [[optimality theory|optimality theoretic]] grammar.&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;{{Citation

  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accent placement is determined by a set of violable, hierarchically ranked constraints as shown in (24):

(24)

::a. '''GIVENness''':  A constituent that is not F-marked is given.

::b. '''Foc''':  A Foc-marked phrase contains an accent

::c. '''AvoidF''': Do not F-mark

::d. '''HeadArg''':  A head is less prominent than its internal argument.

The ranking Schwarzschild&lt;ref name=Schwarzschild1/&gt;  proposes is seen in (25):

(25)   GIVENness, Foc &gt;&gt; AvoidF &gt;&gt; HeadArg

As seen, GIVENness relates F-marking to discourse status.  Foc relates F-marking to accent placement.  Foc simply requires that a constituent(s) of an F-marked phrase contain an accent.  AvoidF states that less F-marking is preferable to more F-marking.  HeadArg encodes the head-argument asymmetry into the grammar directly.&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

=====Responses=====

Recent empirical work by German ''et al.''&lt;ref name=German/&gt; suggests that both Selkirk’s&lt;ref name=Selkirk1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Selkirk2/&gt; and Schwarzschild’s&lt;ref name=Schwarzschild1/&gt; theory of accentuation and F-marking makes incorrect predictions.  Consider the following context:

(26)  Are the children playing their game?

(27)  Paul took down their tent that they play their game in.&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

It has been noted that prepositions are intrinsically weak and do not readily take accent.&lt;ref name=Ladd/&gt;&lt;ref name=German/&gt;  However, both Selkirk and Schwarzschild predict that in the narrow focus context, an accent will occur at most on the preposition in (27) as shown in (28):

(28) Paul took down their tent that they [play their game [in &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; [[trace (linguistics)|t]] &lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sub&gt;foc&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;ref name=German/&gt;

However, the production experiment reported in German ''et al.''&lt;ref name=German/&gt;  showed that subjects are more likely to accent verbs or nouns as opposed to prepositions in the narrow focused context, thus ruling out accent patterns shown in (28).  German ''et al.'' argue for a stochastic constraint-based grammar similar to Anttila&lt;ref name=Antilla&gt;{{Citation

'''Futurists''' or '''futurologists''' are scientists and [[social science|social scientists]] whose specialty is [[Futures studies|futurology]] or the attempt to systematically explore predictions and possibilities about the future and how they can emerge from the present, whether that of human society in particular or of life on Earth in general.

== Definition ==

=== Past futurists and the emergence of the term ===

The term "futurist" most commonly refers to people who attempt to predict the future (sometimes called trend analysis) such as authors, consultants, thinkers, organizational leaders and others who engage in [[interdisciplinary]] and [[systems thinking]] to advise private and public organizations on such matters as diverse global [[Fads and trends|trend]]s, possible [[scenarios]], [[emerging market]] opportunities and [[risk management]]. Futurist is not in the sense of the art movement [[futurism]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] identifies the earliest use of the term ''futurism'' in English as 1842, to refer, in a [[Theology|theological]] context, to the [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Christian eschatological]] tendency of that time. The next recorded use is the label adopted by the [[Futurism (art)|Italian and Russian Futurists]], the artistic, literary and political movements of the 1920s and 1930s which sought to reject the past and fervently embrace speed, technology, and often violent change.

There are a number of organizations that specialize in this field including the World Future Society.

Visionary writers such as [[Jules Verne]], [[Edward Bellamy]], and [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] were not in their day characterized as futurists. The term [[futurology]] in its contemporary sense was first coined in the mid‑1940s by the German Professor [[Ossip K. Flechtheim]], who proposed a new science of probability. Flechtheim argued that even if systematic forecasting did no more than unveil the subset of statistically highly probable processes of change and charted their advance, it would still be of crucial social value.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Ossip K. Flechtheim|Flechtheim, O]] (1972). [http://www.ghandchi.com/iranscope/Anthology/Flechtheim.htm Futurology-The New Science of Probability?] in Toffler, A (1972). ''The Futurists'' p. 264-276&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid‑1940s the first professional "futurist" consulting institutions like [[RAND]] and [[SRI International|SRI]] began to engage in long-range planning, systematic trend watching, scenario development, and visioning, at first under [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] military and government contract and, beginning in the 1950s, for private institutions and corporations. The period from the late 1940s to the mid‑1960s laid the conceptual and methodological foundations of the modern [[futures studies]] field. [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]'s ''The Art of Conjecture'' in 1963 and [[Dennis Gabor]]'s ''Inventing the Future'' in 1964 are considered key early works, and the first U.S.&amp;nbsp;university course devoted entirely to the future was taught by the late [[Alvin Toffler]] at the [[New School]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, W. (1997). ''Foundations of Futures Studies: Volume 1'' New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers., p. 60. {{ISBN|1-56000-271-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern futurists ===

More generally, the label includes such disparate lay, professional, and academic groups as visionaries, foresight consultants, corporate strategists, policy analysts, cultural critics, planners, marketers, forecasters, prediction market developers, roadmappers, operations researchers, investment managers, [[actuaries]], and other risk analyzers, and future-oriented individuals educated in every academic discipline, including anthropology, [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity studies]], [[computer science]], economics, engineering, [[urban design]], [[evolutionary biology]], history, management, mathematics, philosophy, physical sciences, political science, psychology, sociology, [[systems theory]], technology studies, trend analysis, and other disciplines.

== Futures studies ==
{{Main article|Futures studies}}

"Futures studies"—sometimes referred to as futurology, futures research, and foresight—can be summarized as being concerned with "three P's and a W", i.e. "possible, probable, and preferable" futures, plus "wildcards", which are low-probability, high-impact events, should they occur. Even with high-profile, probable events, such as the fall of telecommunications costs, the growth of the internet, or the aging demographics of particular countries, there is often significant uncertainty in the rate or continuation of a trend. Thus, a key part of futures analysis is the managing of uncertainty and risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfs.org/ownermanual.htm ''The Future: An Owner's Manual'', World Future Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019004708/http://www.wfs.org/ownermanual.htm |date=2006-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Futurists and futurology ==

Not all futurists engage in the practice of [[futurology]] as generally defined. Pre-conventional futurists (see below) would generally not. And while religious futurists, astrologers, occultists, New Age diviners, etc. use methodologies that include study, none of their personal revelation or belief-based work would fall within a consensus definition of futurology as used in academics or by futures studies professionals.

Several authors have become recognized as futurists. They research trends, particularly in technology, and write their observations, conclusions, and predictions. In earlier eras, many futurists were at academic institutions. [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], author of ''The Future of the Future'', published a "Futures Directory", and directed a [[think tank]] called The Centre For Integrative Studies at a university. Futurists have started [[consultant|consulting]] groups or earn money as speakers, with examples including [[Alvin Toffler]], [[John Naisbitt]] and [[Patrick Dixon]]. [[Frank Feather]] is a business speaker that presents himself as a pragmatic futurist. Some futurists have commonalities with [[science fiction]], and some science-fiction writers, such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?scifi=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326081204/http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?scifi=2 |archivedate=2016-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are known as futurists.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the introduction to ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] distinguished futurists from novelists, writing of the study as the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurists. In her words, "a novelist's business is lying".

A survey of 108 futurists&lt;ref&gt;Sohail Inayatullah, ed., The Views of Futurists. Vol 4, The Knowledge Base of Futures Studies. Brisbane, Foresight International, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; found the following shared assumptions:

# We are in the midst of a historical transformation. Current times are not just part of normal history.
# Multiple perspectives are at heart of futures studies, including unconventional thinking, internal critique, and cross-cultural comparison.
# Consideration of alternatives. Futurists do not see themselves as value-free forecasters, but instead aware of multiple possibilities.
# Participatory futures. Futurists generally see their role as liberating the future in each person, and creating enhanced public ownership of the future. This is true worldwide.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}
# Long-term policy transformation. While some are more policy-oriented than others, almost all believe that the work of futures studies is to shape public policy, so it consciously and explicitly takes into account the long term.
# Part of the process of creating alternative futures and of influencing public (corporate, or international) policy is internal transformation. At international meetings, structural and individual factors are considered equally important.
# Complexity. Futurists believe that a simple one-dimensional or single-discipline orientation is not satisfactory. Trans-disciplinary approaches that take complexity seriously are necessary. Systems thinking, particularly in its evolutionary dimension, is also crucial.
# Futurists are motivated by change. They are not content merely to describe or forecast. They desire an active role in world transformation.
# They are hopeful for a better future as a "[[strange attractor]]".
# Most believe they are pragmatists in this world, even as they imagine and work for another. Futurists have a long term perspective.
#  Sustainable futures, understood as making decisions that do not reduce future options, that include policies on nature, gender, and other accepted paradigms. This applies to corporate futurists and other non-governmental organizations. [[Environmentalism|Environmental]] sustainability is reconciled with the technological, spiritual, and post-structural ideals. Sustainability is not a "back to nature" ideal, but rather inclusive of technology and culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34751">'''German Luftwaffe and Navy Kriegsmarine Radar Equipment''' during World War II, relied on an increasingly diverse array of communications, IFF and RDF equipment for its function.  Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG ({{lang-de|Funkgerät}}), meaning "radio equipment". During the war,  Germany renumbered their radars. From using the year of introduction as their number they moved to a different numbering scheme.

==Search Light and Fighter Control==

No German ground radar was accurate enough for Flak fire direction. The operation method for Flak during the day was to use the radar to be used to set the optical fire control for the flak onto the target. Once acquired the flak was controlled by the optical equipment to complete the engagement. During the night the Radar would be used to indicate the target to the search light crews. The rest of the engagement would be carried out optically. During the day fighters would be directed with sufficient precision that they would be able to see their targets and during The night they would use their onboard AI radar to find the target after initial direction from the ground-based radars.

[[File: Würzburg-Riese at Gatow.JPG|thumb|''Würzburg-Riese'' radar]]
The Würzburg was first operational in the summer of 1940, had a parabolic shaped antenna with a diameter of about 3metres and in some models could be folded in half for transport. The Würzburg was produced in the thousands with various estimated figures being between 3000 and 4000 with up to 1500 sets of Würzburg Riese. The antenna of the Würzburg weighed over 9.5 tons and its parabolic surface had a diameter equal to 7.5 metres and a focal length of one metres and 70&amp;nbsp;cm. Only one German company had the technical skill to build these radars, and that was

In response to jamming various models of Würzburg radar were developed to operate on various frequencies called "Islands".&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg A'''  First production version introduced in 1940. 50&amp;nbsp;cm operating wavelength. Operation range was approximately 30&amp;nbsp;km. Included an IFF system that worked with the FuG 25z airborne unit.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg B''' Integrated IR telescope to increase accuracy. Proved unsatisfactory and not placed into production.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg C''' Replaced the model A in production in 1941. Had lobe switching to improve accuracy. On this unit the integral IFF system was replaced by a system based on the FuG 25a airborne. To support this system which worked at approx 125-160&amp;nbsp;MHz two antenna were placed inside the main dish. A separate interrogation and receiving units were attached to show the IFF responses.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''Würzburg D''' Replaced the model C in production in 1942. It now had a usable range of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km. Conical scan was used for fine accuracy. The IFF antenna was now fitted in the center of the dish rather than on the sides. Better instruments were fitted and generally it was the best of the small Würzburg.&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

'''FuMG 65 Würzburg Riese(Giant)''': The electronics of the D model Würzburg combined with a 7-meter dish to improve resolution and range. Range approx 70&amp;nbsp;km. Version E was a modified unit to fit on railroad [[flatcar]]s to produce a mobile Flak radar system. Version G had the 2.4-meter antenna and electronics from a Freya installed. The antenna dipoles were inside the reflector. The reason for this was that the allies were flying very high recon flights which were above the maximum height of the Freya. The standard Würzburg Riese's 50&amp;nbsp;cm beam was too narrow to find them directly. By combining the two systems the Freya could set the Würzburg Riese onto the target.&lt;ref&gt;The Radar War: Germany's Pioneering Achievement 1904-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galati2015"/&gt;

=== Mannheim  ===
[[File:FuMG 64 Mannheim 41 T radars at Grove DK 1945.jpg|thumb|FuMG 64 captured by the British forces in 1945.]]
'''FuMG 63 Mainz''' The Mainz, introduced in 1941, was a development from the Wurzburg with its 3-meter solid metal reflector mounted on top of the same type of control car as used by the ‘Kurmark’. Its range was 25–35&amp;nbsp;km with an accuracy of ±10–20 meters, azimuth 0.1 degrees, and elevation ±0.3-0.5 degrees.  Only 51 units were produced before being superseded by the ‘Mannheim’.

'''FuMG 64 Mannheim''' The Mannheim was an advanced development from the ‘Mainz’. It also had a 3-meter reflector, which was now made from a lattice framework covered in a fine mesh. This was fixed to the front of a control cabin and the whole apparatus was rotated electrically. Its range was 25–35&amp;nbsp;km, with an accuracy of ±10–15 meters; azimuth and elevation accuracy of ±0.15 degrees. Though accurate enough to control Flak guns it was not deployed in large numbers. This was due to its cost (time and materials to manufacture was about 3 time that of a Würzburg D.

'''FuMG 75 Mannheim Riese''' Just as the Wurzburg’s performance was greatly improved when fitted with a 7-meter reflector, so was the Mannheim’s, and the result called a Mannheim Riese (Giant Mannheim).  There was an optical device for the initial visual acquisition of the target. With its narrow beam it was relatively immune from ‘Window’. Its accuracy and automatic tracking enabled it to be used in anti-aircraft missile research to track and control the missiles in flight. Only a handful were manufactured.

'''FuMG 68 Ansbach''' There was a need for a mobile radar with the range and accuracy of the ‘Mannheim’. The result, in 1944, was the Ansbach. It had a collapsible reflector of diameter 4.5&amp;nbsp;meters, operating on a wavelength of 53.6&amp;nbsp;cm, and peak power of 8&amp;nbsp;kW, giving it a normal range 25–35&amp;nbsp;km (70&amp;nbsp;km in search mode) with an accuracy of 30–40 meters. Azimuth and elevation accuracy was around ±0.2°. The antenna and reflector were remote controlled from a Bayern control van up to 30 meters away. The control system was based on the remote control system of the Michael microwave communication system, this was based on the Ward-Leonard AC/DC control system. The Ansbach was to be installed in large Flak batteries with six or more guns, but only a few were produced by the end of the war, and these didn’t see operational service

==Medium Range Search ==

=== Freya &amp; similar units ===
[[File:freya-radar.jpg|thumb|FuMG 401 "''Freya-Fahrstuhl''"]]
'''FuMG 450 [[Freya radar|Freya]] / FuMG 41G''': This was a 2D Early warning radar. (2D means unable to indicate height). It was used for fighter direction and target indication for the Würzburg. Operating wavelength of approx 2.4&amp;nbsp;meters (125&amp;nbsp;MHz). In response to jamming various models were developed to operate on various frequencies called "Islands". Over 1000 units delivered in various models

'''FuMG 401 / FMG 42''' FREYA - LZ (Models A - D). An Air portable version, the model differences were due to an operating frequency range being in 4 descrete bands between 91 and 200&amp;nbsp;MHz.

'''Freya-Rotschwarz and Freya-Grünschwarz''': These two systems were Freya modified to operate on the same frequency as the British radio navigation system GEE to avoid jamming. However, as by the time they were ready the Germans were jamming GEE it is not clear whether any were ever deployed.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuMG 451 A Freya Flamme''': Freya which had been built to use the "Island D" band were modified to be able to trigger the British IFF equipment. Ranges of up to 450&amp;nbsp;km were obtained. Fell from use as British IFF procedures improved.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuMG 401 Freya Fahrstuhl''': A 3D version of the Fraya. (3D means could measure height). Measurements made by moving the antenna up and down on a rack. Only a very rough estimation of height available. originally intended for early warning most of the systems produced went to help "jammed" Würzburg

'''Freya EGON''': EGON stood for Erstling Gemse Offensive Navigation system. Where Erstling was the codename of the '''Fug25a''' transceiver in the aircraft and Gemse was the codename for the receiver. The system operated on a principle similar to the British OBOE navigation system. An IFF signal was sent from a Freya, that had had its receiver antenna removed, to the aircraft. The '''Fug25a''' in the aircraft responded and the received signal was displayed as a range offset on the Freya display. Using a second transmitter and triangulation the position of the aircraft was resolved. Though the system was tested to guide night fighters it was found to be to limited by the number of aircraft that it could control at one time (the same limitation was found with Oboe). The "Y system" was used instead for night fighter control. The EGON system was used to control pathfinders for bombing raids over both England and Russia, however by now the Luftwaffe bomber force was running out of planes, pilots and fuel so the results were minimal. Work was done  using a third transmitter to improve system performance. Range with a normal Freya was up to 250&amp;nbsp;km, work was underway to use a Wasserman system instead of a Freya to increase range too 350&amp;nbsp;km. (the Freya signal was to weak to trigger the '''Fug25a''' at ranges beyond 250&amp;nbsp;km), but this was not completed.

== Long Range Search ==
[[File:Mammut-radar.JPG|thumb|FuMG 41/42 Mammut.]]
For area air defense (vs point defense) Freya's range was found to be insufficient. This led to attempts to use Freya technology to achieve greater range. This resulted in the Wassermann and Mammut. All though the Mammut units achieved their aims they were large installations, with large arrays built on bunkers. This resulted in long building times and vulnerability to air attacks. The Wassermann was a better solution in that being smaller they were harder to locate and quicker to build, 3–4 weeks. However sources indicate that they never achieved the desired range of 400&amp;nbsp;km, the best was approx 300&amp;nbsp;km. This may be why there were so many variants deployed.

'''FuMG 401 Mammut''': First deployed in 1942 this was a long range 2 D search radar. It consisted of 8 Freya class antenna arranged in a 4 x 2 configuration. It measured 25 meters wide and ten meters high and was mounted on four pylons fixed in concrete. Some installations had a second array mounted back-to-back. Each array could be electronically swung through about 100 degrees, so the dual sided array could look behind itself to continue to track bombers as they flew into Germany. Frequency was the same as Freya (125&amp;nbsp;MHz). Range was up to 300&amp;nbsp;km with a transmit power of 200 KW. Installations being very large took up to 4 months to build.

'''FuMG 402 Wassermann''': This system was deployed in 1942. It was basically 6 Freya antenna mounted on a rotation cylinder. Frequencies were similar to Freya (125&amp;nbsp;MHz) transmit power was 100 KW resulting in a usable range of approx 200&amp;nbsp;km. Three main versions were produced with sub variants in each class.

'''Wassermann L''': The original light version. Some sources indicate that it had structural problems.

'''Wassermann S''': The heavy version. first deployed late 1942 Some sources indicate it had more than 6 arrays.

'''Wassermann M''': The last family were the medium class units. Again it is not clear exactly how many Freya arrays were attached to the mast. In 1944 this version received a modification that allowed it to electronically tilt its beams by 16 degrees which allowed it to perform height determination turning its into a 3 D search radar.

'''Elefant &amp; See Elefant''': These bi-static radars were an attempt to combine jamming resistance with long range. They operated in two bands 23–28&amp;nbsp;MHz or 32–38&amp;nbsp;MHz. Range was approximately 400&amp;nbsp;km but under [[Skywave|certain RF conditions]] much greater ranges were obtained. Antenna were usually mounted on Wassermann towers (all units differed in detail from each other). 3 Elefants were in operation at the end of the war with one See Elefant. Sources are unclear what the difference between the two types were.

==Panoramic Search ==
[[File:Jagdschloß FuMG404.jpg|thumb|''FuMG 404'' captured in 1945 still in construction.]]
The first type of early-warning radar set giving panoramic display which come into operation in usually referred to as the Jagdschloss, although it’s official designation is Jagdschloss F, to distinguish it from later types, such as the Michael B and Z.

'''Jagdschloss F''': The antenna was 24 m wide and 3 m high, consisting of sixteen pairs of double horizontal transmit and receive dipoles. Above this, an 8.5 metre wide antenna array of eight vertical dipoles was mounted for the IFF.The first 62 Jagdschloss were of the Voll Wismar type using wide band antenna covering the band 1.90-2.20 metres. Another 18, used the band 1.20–1.90 meters. Range was 100&amp;nbsp;km. An optional feature known as Landbriefträger (Postman) was a remote PPI display for use with Jagdschloss. This allowed the PPI display from the radar station to be sent simultaneously to command HQ by HF cable, or by a UHF radio link.

'''Jagdschloss Michael B''': A ponderous aerial array of two rows of eighteen Würzburg mirrors measuring 56 metres long x 7 metres high was used in the Würzmann experimental early-warning radar, and formed the serial array for Jagdschloss Michael B with the array in a horizontal position. The wavelength employed, was
that of a Voll Wismar 53.0-63.8&amp;nbsp;cm. Range approx 250&amp;nbsp;km. None may have entered service, though one source mentions one entering service.

'''Forsthaus F''': This system was a development of the Jagdschloss Michael B using the so-called Euklid 25–29&amp;nbsp;cm. waveband employed by the Navy. Once more a
very long aerial array 48 metres long and about 8 metres high was used, employing a cylindrical paraboloid. A wave guide antenna (Hohlraumstrahler) was placed along the focal line with a second and a third wave guide parallel to it above and below respectively.Range was expected to be over 200&amp;nbsp;km. Probably none completed.

'''Forsthaus KF''': Development of the Forsthaus F. Reduced in size so that the system would fit in a railway carriage. Antenna 24 meters long. Range 120&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Dreh Freya''': This set, which was also known as '''Freya Panorama''', was first introduced in June 1944. It consisted of a Freya aerial of the Breitband type working in Bereich I (1.90-2.50), the frequency of which could be adjusted at will. The aerial was so built that it rotated through 360° and gave a remote
panoramic presentation. About 20 equipments were in use in January 1945. The range claimed for it was only about 100&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Jagdhütte''':This apparatus, which was produced by Siemens, gave a panoramic P.P.I. display of the German I.F.F. responses, using 24 metre or 36 metre rotating aerials. The wavelength employed was 2.40 metres and it was planned, with its aid, to trigger off the FuGe 25A. In this way friendly fighters were to be controlled from the ground at ranges up to about 300&amp;nbsp;km. It was fully realised that if the FuGe 25A frequency was ever jammed the Jagdhütte would be useless, but it was not considered likely that the Allies would attempt to jam it. Small numbers may have been completed at the wend of the war.

'''Jagdwagen''': Jagdwagen was designed as a mobile Panoramic radar to control fighters at close ranges immediately behind the front. It was a project of the firm of Lorenz. The aerials were considerably smaller than the Jagdhütte, the array being only 8 metres long. The aerial array was to be mounted on the Kumbach stand as used in the Egerland Flak set. The frequency bend used was that of the A.S.V. set Hohentwiel namely 53–59&amp;nbsp;cm. Range 40–60&amp;nbsp;km. Prototypes only.

'''Jagdhaus (FuMG 404)''': Jagdhaus was designed and built by Lorenz in 1944 as an early warning radar. It was the most powerful radar built by the Germans, with a peak pulse power of 300&amp;nbsp;kW, which Lorenz planned to increase to 750&amp;nbsp;kW. The whole assembly was the size of a house, which is possibly how it got its name; ‘haus’ being the German for ‘house’. The rotating upper part of the construction housed the separate parabolic transmit and receive antennae and reflectors, with the IFF above them as usual. It weighed 48 tons and rotated at 10 rpm. It operated on wavelengths of 1.4 to 1.8 metres, and had a range of about 300&amp;nbsp;km. It could measure altitude, azimuth and range. The control room was located below the antennae, from which its PPI image was also transmitted to command HQ at Charlottenberg by Landbrieftrager, similar to the Jagdschloss system. It is believed that only one Jagdhaus was constructed, which fell into Soviet hands when it was captured by their troops in 1945, during which time it was damaged. The Soviets compelled the Germans to repair it and instruct them in its operation.

== Airborne Intercept ==
[[File:Lichtenstein-radar.jpg|thumb|''Lichtenstein B/C FuG 202'' with 32-dipole "mattress" aerials]]
'''[[Lichtenstein radar|Lichtenstein]] B/C - FuG 202''': Low-UHF band frequency range, introduced in 1941 it was the initial AI radar. Deployed in large numbers with 32-dipole element ''Matratze'' (mattress) antenna arrays, it operated on the 61&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength. Its range was (in theory) 2–3&amp;nbsp;km but in practise was found to be dependent on factors such as height. Compromised to the Allies [[Junkers Ju 88#Ju 88R|on May 9, 1943]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galati|first=Gaspare |title=100 Years of Radar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LoeQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=24 December 2017 |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-00584-3|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lichtenstein C-1 - FuG 212''': Introduced in 1943, this was an improved version of the FuG 202.

'''Lichtenstein SN2 - FuG 220''': Low-mid VHF band frequency range, introduced in 1943 in response to Allied jamming, and used an eight-dipole ''Hirschgeweih'' (atag's antlers) antenna array. Transmitter power of 2Kw on 3.3 meters. Range was increased to 6&amp;nbsp;km. Minimum range was 400 m which was found to be a problem, hence aircraft carried it and FuG202. Later versions did away for the need for the Fug 202. Compromised to the Allies [[Lichtenstein radar#FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2|in July 1944]].

'''Lichtenstein SN3 - FuG 228''': A higher powered version of the SN2. Range increased to 8&amp;nbsp;km. Only a small number accepted into service, perhaps only prototypes.

''' FuG 214 ''': This was an "add-on" unit to the SN2 which gave it an additional, ''rear''-facing antenna installation. This was in response to Allied night fighters accompanying the bomber steams to hunt the German Night fighters while the hunted the bombers. The idea was to prevent allied fighters attacking the German fighters from behind.

''' Neptun 1 - FuG 216''': A small number of experimental sets fitted to FW190 and BF109. 1.3 to 1.8 meters wavelength.

''' Neptun 2 - FuG 217''': A small number of sets fitted to FW190 and BF109. 1.6 to 1.8 meters wavelength. Some has a rear warning component.

'''Neptun 3 - Fug 218''': A replacement for SN2, deployed late 1944 after SN2 was jammed. Wavelength 1.6 to 1.9 meters, most often using same, eight-dipole "stag's antlers" antenna array with shorter dipole elements. Range up to 5&amp;nbsp;km.  Some were fitted to me 262 to create night fighters that could catch Mosquito intruders.

''' Neptun 4 - FuG 219''': Increased power version of the  FuG218, experimental sets only.

''' Berlin A - FuG 224''': The first centimetric (3 GHz) band radar. Based on a captured H2S radar unit, codenamed "Rotterdams". Unknown number built but under 100. Range 5K under ideal conditions, 10&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength.

''' Berlin N1 - FuG 240 N''': Combination of the Berlin A and the SN2. Only small numbers delivered.

''' Berlin N2''': Increased power Berlin  N, Range reported to be 9K.

'''Berlin N3/N4''': Experimental units.

'''Bremen - FuG 244''': (also known as Berlin D) Berlin A with the frequency changed to 3&amp;nbsp;cm (10 GHz) rather than 9&amp;nbsp;cm. Experimental.

'''Bremen O - FuG 245''': Another experiments 3&amp;nbsp;cm unit.

==Air to Surface Search ==

'''Neptun''': Early system - It failed its acceptance tests - the system was later reworked into an Airborne intercept set.

[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|'''Hohentwiel (FuG 200)''']]; UHF-band radar, operated at wavelength between 52 and 57&amp;nbsp;cm. Range was between 10&amp;nbsp;km for a small vessel like a surfaced submarine to 70&amp;nbsp;km for a large ship. Under the best circumstances it could see the coast at approx 150&amp;nbsp;km. It had separate antennae for transmit and receive. The transmit antenna was centrally mounted, pointing forward, while the two receive antennae were mounted either side, pointing outwards by 30 degrees, giving it a search beam width of about 120 degrees. Each antenna array consisted of sixteen horizontally polarised dipoles, mounted in four groups of four in a vertical stack.

A variant of the '''Hohentwiel''' the '''Tiefentwiel (FuMG407)'''; was tried as an Air Surveillance radar on the coast to try and detect low flying aircraft.

==Naval Surface Search - Land Based - ''Seetakt''==

'''FuMO 1 - Calis A''': Its 6.2 x 2.5m antenna consisted of 2 rows of eight full wave vertical dipoles. Its wavelength was 82&amp;nbsp;cm and its range depended on the height it was installed above sea level, but typically was about 15–20&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="KaufmannKaufmann2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kaufmann|first1=J.E|last2=Kaufmann|first2=H.W.  |last3= Jankovie-Potoenik |first3=A.|title=The Atlantic Wall: History and Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nHuSIG45WsC&amp;pg=RA1-PT289|accessdate=24 December 2017|date=19 September 2012|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78337-838-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the frequency low angle reflections from the surface, also known a clutter would have been an issue.

'''FuMO 2 - Calis B''': Improved version of the FuMO 1  - similar clutter problems but improved transmitter and accuracy.

'''FuMO 3 - Zerstorersaule''': A version of the destroyer radar modified for land use.

'''FuMO 4 - Dunkirchen ''': Improved version of the FuMo 2 - similar otherwise

'''FuMO 5 - Boulogne''': Yet another improved version of the FuMO 2 - increased transmitter power again with an improved aerial - usable range now 40 – 50&amp;nbsp;km.

'''FuMO 11 - Renner''': 3M antenna from a Wurzburg combined with a 9&amp;nbsp;cm "Berlin" unit and mounted on a Seetakt base optimized for sea search rather than air search. Sources differ on usable range.

'''FuMO 12 &amp; 13''': Improved Renner units to attempt to compensate for poor reliability with the original unit.

'''FuMO 15 - Sheer''': Combination of a Berlin 9&amp;nbsp;cm and an Antenna from a Giant Wurzburg - seems to have been optimized for surface search in the same was as the Renner series was.

'''FuMO 51 - Mammut G''': Version of the Luftwaffe FuMO401 but with Seetakt antenna and waveforms to optimise it for surface search rather than air search.

'''FuMO 215''': Improved range version of the FuMO214.

==Centimeter Radars  ==
All though the Germans were carrying out research at centimeter wavelengths at the start of the war the work was abandoned as it was decided that the war would be over before the research &amp; development could be completed. In February 1943 a RAF Stirling bomber was shot down over Rotterdam and a damaged H2S system was recovered. The Germans started a crash development program to use the information deduced from the captured system. All though a range of prototypes were produced, very few reached front line troops. Due to the device being recovered near Rotterdam the Germans used that name in several code names for the Centimeter (9&amp;nbsp;cm) systems, such as "Rotterdam Device".

'''Rotterdam''': To get the quickest start with development, German industry copied, as far as possible, the H2S system. Approximately 20 systems were manufactured for R&amp;D work. They led to the '''Roderich''' jammer and the '''Berlin''' &amp; '''Korfu''' receivers.

'''Jagdschloss Z''': The 9&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Jagdschloss F panoramic radar system. Prototypes only.

'''Forsthaus Z''': The 9&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Forsthaus panoramic search radar. Prototypes only.

'''FuMG 77''': Rotterheim. A combination of the 9&amp;nbsp;cm receiver/transmitter of the Berlin system with the Antenna and other systems from a Mannheim. Its range was about 30&amp;nbsp;km and it was found to be unaffected by allied jamming. Its name changed to Marbach V later in the war.

'''FuMG 76''': Marbach. A combination of the Berlin transmitter/receiver with the Ansback 4.5 meter reflector and systems. Controlled by the "Michael" remote control system. Sources suggest that 3 systems were completed.

'''FuMG 74''': Kulmbach. A 9&amp;nbsp;cm panoramic search radar. 6 meter antenna and remote controlled like the FuMG76. When combined with that radar it was known as the '''Egerland''' system. Only 2 completed. range of approx 50&amp;nbsp;km.

==Passive Search==
'''FuG 221 Freya-Halbe ''': This was a Freya modified to locate British airborne jammers. Development completed but due to lack of parts never deployed.&lt;ref name="ADIK390"/&gt;

'''FuG 221 Rosendahl'''; This was a Freya modified to locate British bombers by tracking their Monica warning radar emissions. By the time development was completed the British had ceased using Monica, so never deployed&lt;ref name = ADIK390 &gt;http://www.cdvandt.org/ADIK390all.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuG 223''': A family of passive airborne receivers tuned to various radar bands such as Freya and Würzburg. Designed to allow night fighters to home onto bombers fitted with jammers against those radars. The '''Fug223''' was a version build from surplus '''FuG 227''' components that detected reflected energy from an aircraft being illuminated by a ground radar. In this way it was an example of an early semi-active radar homing system. In order to work it seems that the radar beam had to illuminate the target and the night fighter so that the two receivers could be synchronized. Used by one test and development squadron at the end of the war.

'''FuG 227''': Built using some components from the '''FuG 220''' range of AI equipment. This was a passive device which allowed night fighters to home onto bombers which had their rear warning 'Monica' active. Monica was a short range VHF radar (200&amp;nbsp;MHz band) which was fitted to the tail of British heavy bombers facing down and back to give the rear turret gunner a warning display. Using this equipment the night fighters could achieve intercept with apparent ease. Extremely effective until the British captured a Me 110 with '''FuG227''' installed and realised its mode of operation. there after Monica was removed from bombers and '''FuG227''' ceased to have any value.

'''Klein Heidelberg''' was the code-name give to a passive radar system devised in 1941. The system was a bi-static radar system. What was unusual was that the transmitters were British rather than German! The system worked by using the reflections from the Chain Home (British coastal radar system) rather than transmitters associated with the receivers. Klein Heidelberg worked by sensing Chain Home (CH) transmission pulses directly with a small auxiliary antenna, close to the main antenna, whose receiver was tuned to a particular CH station whose exact location, bearing and range was known. The CH signal was then used to synchronise the KH with the CH transmission pulses. The CH pulse started a circular trace on a cathode ray tube (CRT) divided into forty sections. The main antenna received the reflection of these pulses from the target and displayed them on the CRT. Range was between 300–600&amp;nbsp;km. The display was 2D. Resolution was not very good but it allowed the Germans to see bomber formations forming up over England and the general path of the bomber streams. Its big advantage was it was not possible for the British to jam without jamming their own radars. The system entered service in late 1943 and by late 1944 six system were commissioned on the Dutch coast.

[[Naxos radar detector|'''FuG 350 Naxos''']] &amp; '''FuG 351 Korfu''': This was a family or radar detectors that operated in the 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;cm band. They were primarily designed to locate Allied H2S radar transmissions. A range of antenna were used some stationary and some rotating. There were intended to be air, land and maritime versions. However Naxos had a resolution problem that limited its ability to distinguish individual aircraft. This allowed the night fighter to locate the bomber stream but not usually individual bombers. This was not usually an issue with the maritime based system (primarily U boats) as there was usually only one aircraft detected at a time. To reduce this issue an improved version the '''Korfu''' was developed. It was intended to field '''Korfu''' as a replacement for Naxos in all three versions but due to a shortage of components only the land based version was fielded where is resolution could be used to the best effect.&lt;ref name = ADIK369&gt;http://www.cdvandt.org/ADIK369all.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FuG 350 Naxos Z''': The original system, detected H2S radar system on bombers. Unable to distinguish individual bombers nor the 10 GHz [[H2X]] Allied bombing radar, but could reliably guide the fighter into the bomber stream.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZR''': Additional aerials added a tail warning system which allowed British night-fighters to be detected.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZX''': 3&amp;nbsp;cm version for detecting allied H2X radars. Not known to have ever been fielded.

'''FuG 350 Naxos RX''': 3&amp;nbsp;cm version of the Naxos ZR. Not known to have ever been fielded.

'''FuG 350 Naxos ZD''': Combined Z and ZX, allowing 9&amp;nbsp;cm and 3&amp;nbsp;cm detection in the same system.

'''FuG 351 Korfu Z''': Entered production late 1944, due to shortage of components only ground-based versions deployed though an airborne version completed development. better range and discrimination than Naxos.

'''FuG 280 Kiel Z''': IR based passive receiver. 10 degree field of view - display via CRT. problems with discrimination between fires aircraft and other IR sources.&lt;ref name = ADIK369 /&gt;

''' Falter''': Based on the Fug 280 K but detected British IR recognition systems. Development not completed.&lt;ref name = ADIK369 /&gt;

A '''hand mould''' is a simple [[mold (manufacturing)|mould]] used for low quantity work. It is used in the [[injection moulding]] and the [[printing industry]].
It is made by a hand injection molding machine. It is a simple machine which contains a barrel, handle, nozzle, mold and heaters. 

==Printing==
In the printing industry, a hand mould specifically refers to a two-part mould used for [[casting]] hand-made [[Sort (typesetting)|type]]. Inside the mould is a [[matrix (printing)|matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Knight | first = Edward Henry | title = Knight's American mechanical dictionary | page = 1057 | publisher = Houghton, Mifflin | year = 1876 | volume = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7jZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1057 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, it refers to a system for casting [[movable type]], pioneered by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], which was widely used in the early era of printing in Europe (15th-16th century).&lt;!-- I am not sure how long it continued to be used, can someone fill in please? --&gt;

In this method, the type was made by punching a letter-shaped cavity in a matrix made of some soft metal (typically copper).  Then this matrix would be held in the lower part of the mould, the upper part would close on it, and molten [[type metal]] would be poured into the cavity.  Using the hand mould, the printer could quickly make any additional type he might need.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. ''A History of Graphic Design.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58–69) {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injection moulding==
In injection moulding, hand moulds refer to simple moulds that have no provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand mould is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the moulds and the moulds must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the mould. They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of the simplicity of the parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from [[aluminum]] or [[brass]], but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional [[steel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harper | first = Charles A. | title = Modern plastics handbook | page = 6.34 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ee4Qf0HaBwC&amp;pg=PT460 | isbn = 978-0-07-026714-5 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullet casting==
Hand [[cast bullet]]s remain popular with the [[handloading]], [[Muzzleloader|muzzleloading]] and small custom ammunition loading communities. In a tradition dating back to the beginning of firearms, molds matched to the [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] (and the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] for breech loading weapons) are custom made for each weapon. Anywhere from one to six cavities are carved into the molding block, along with appropriate gates and [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprues]]. As the blocks are now usually made out of aluminum, which does not allow lead alloys to stick, only a small amount of parting compound is needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neihandtools.com/mold_info.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.midwayusa.com/pdf/instructions/Bullet_Mold.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harari''' is the language of the [[Harari people]] of [[Ethiopia]]. It is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch and is a member of the [[Ethiopian Semitic|Ethiosemitic]] group. According to the 2007 Ethiopian census, it is spoken by 25,810 people. Most of its speakers are multilingual in [[Amharic]] and/or [[Eastern Oromo language|Eastern Oromo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Harari is closely related to the [[Gurage languages#Eastern|Eastern Gurage languages]], [[Zay language|Zay]], and [[Silt'e language|Silt'e]], all of whom are linked to the now extinct Semitic [[Harla]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gebissa|first1=Eziekel|title=Leaf of Allah|publisher=Ohio State University|page=36|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ga91oPVFb5MC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=semitic-speaking+harla+an+autochthonous&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DbgoD7pHIv&amp;sig=omaLW-PnCBfpqwC33gZ1C_1TCiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPsPDP9cbNAhUE6IMKHXJVDvYQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=semitic-speaking%20harla%20an%20autochthonous&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braukhamper|first1=Ulrich|title=Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia|publisher=LITverlag|page=18|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HGnyk8Pg9NgC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=harala+semitic+harar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAn-iD9cbNAhVK7IMKHdvUC5AQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=harala%20semitic%20harar&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locals or natives of Harar refer to it as ''Gēy Ritma'' or ''Gēy Sinan'' "language of the City" (''Gēy'' is the word for how Harari speakers refer to [[Harar]], whose name is an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]).{{sfn|Leslau|1959|p=276}}

Harari was originally written with a version of the Arabic script, then the Ethiopic script was adopted to write the language. Some Harari speakers in diaspora write their language with the Latin alphabet.

==Vowels==
/æ, a, e, ai, ɪ, i/

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

====Number====

The noun has two numbers, Singular and Plural. The affix -ách changes singulars into plurals:

: aboch, a man;  abochách, men.
: wandaq, a servant;  wandaqách, servants.
: gár, a house;  gárách, houses.

Nouns ending in the long á or í become plural without reduplicating this letter:
: gáfá, a slave;  gáfách (for gáfáách), slaves.
: gubná, a harlot;  gubnách, harlots.
: lijji, a son;   lijjách (for lijjiách), sons.
: Maqbarti, a grave;  Maqbartách (for Maqbartách), graves.

/s/ alternates with /z/:
: faraz, a horse;  farazách, horses.
: iráz, a cloth;  irázách, cloths.

====Gender====
Masculine nouns may be converted into feminines by three processes. The first changes the terminal vowel into -it, or adds -it to the terminal consonant:

: rágá, an old man;   rágít, an old woman.
: buchí, male dog;  buchít, female dog
: wasíf, a slave boy;  wasífít, a slave girl.

Animals of different sexes have different names. and this forms the second process:

: bárá, an ox; lám, a cow.

The third and the most common way of expressing sex is by means of aboch, "male or man," and inistí: woman, " female, corresponding to English " he-" and " she-":

: aboch faraz, a stallion; inistí faraz, a mare.
: aboch č̣abar a he mule; inistí č̣abar, a she mule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">'''Heinrich von Louffenburg''' (1391&amp;ndash;1460) was a [[Swabia]]n priest born at [[Laufenburg, Germany|Louffenburg]] on the Rhein, Germany.

He is best known for his treatise, ''Versehung des Leibs'',(Care of the Body), written in 1429. It was published in 1491 as one of four great medical treatises in ''[[Pediatric Incunabula]]'', the first known text to be devoted to the normal physiology and common illnesses of children.&lt;ref&gt;Colon, A.R.: Colon, P.A.. Nurturing Children: a history of Pediatrics. Greenwood Press. January 1999. {{ISBN|9780313310805}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louffenburg wrote his treatise in Swabian, his native tongue, instead of the traditional Latin.  Swabians are ethnic Germans closely related to people from Baden Germany, Alsace-Lorraine, France, and Switzerland.  They speak [[Swabian German]], which is difficult for speakers of standard German to understand.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan. One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, Ltd., 2000. P. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Versehung des Leibs'' is actually a poem meant to be chanted, as that is how works were often written to aid memorization and the spread of information among those who were not able to read and write.&lt;ref name="Ruhrah"&gt;Ruhrah, John.

History of Medicine: A scandalously short introduction. University of Toronto Press. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Later in life, Louffenburg was a dean of St. Mauritius in Zofingen. In 1445, he entered the [[Benedictine]] monastery [[Saint John Abbey, Müstair|Saint John Abbey]] in Müstair, Switzerland. He spent his later years translating church poems from Latin into Swabian. He died on 31 March 1460 at the Abbey.&lt;ref name="Ruhrah" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13200">In the 9th century, [[Old Norse]] began to diverge into Old West Norse (Norway and Iceland) and Old East Norse (Sweden and Denmark). In the 12th century, the dialects of Denmark and Sweden began to diverge, becoming Old Danish and Old Swedish in the 13th century. All were heavily influenced by [[Middle Low German]] during the medieval period. Though stages of language development are never as sharply delimited as implied here, and should not be taken too literally, the system of subdivisions used in this article is the most commonly used by Swedish linguists and is used for the sake of practicality.

==Old Norse==
{{main|Old Norse}}
{{Old Norse language map}}
In the 8th century, the common [[Germanic language]] of [[Scandinavia]], [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], had undergone some changes and evolved into Old Norse. This language began to undergo new changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted the appearance of two similar dialects, ''Old West Norse'' ([[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]) and ''Old East Norse'' ([[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]).

Old East Norse is in Sweden called ''[[Runic Swedish]]'' and in Denmark ''Runic Danish'', but until the 12th century, the dialect was the same in the two countries. The dialects are called ''runic'' because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which only had 16 letters. Due to the limited number of runes, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the [[vowel]] ''u'' which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''ø'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'' which was also used for ''e''.

A change that separated Old East Norse (Runic Swedish/Danish) from Old West Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''æi'' (Old West Norse ''ei'') to the [[monophthong]] ''e'', as in ''stæin'' to ''sten''. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dauðr'' into ''ø'' as in ''døðr''. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tauþr'' into ''tuþr''. Moreover, the ''øy'' (Old West Norse ''ey'') diphthong changed into ''ø'' as well, as in the Old Norse word for "island".

From 1100 onwards, the dialect of Denmark began to diverge from that of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] to [[Svealand]].

==Old Swedish==
{{main|Old Swedish}}
[[Image:Västgötalagen blad 21.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of ''[[Västgötalagen|Äldre Västgötalagen]]'' – a [[code of law|law code]] of [[Västergötland]] from the 1280s, one of the earliest texts in Swedish written in the [[Latin alphabet]].]]
Old Swedish is the term used for the medieval Swedish language, starting in 1225. Among the most important documents of the period written in [[Latin script]] is the oldest of the provincial [[code of law|law codes]], ''[[Västgötalagen]]'', of which fragments dated to 1250 have been found. The main influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Catholic Church and various [[monastery|monastic]] orders, introducing many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] loanwords. With the rise of [[Hanseatic league|Hanseatic]] power in the late 13th and early 14th century, the influence of [[Middle Low German]] became ever more present. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of German speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their mother tongue into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loan words for areas like warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions where imported. Almost all of the naval terms were also borrowed from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Early medieval Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex [[case (linguistics)|case]] structure and had not yet experienced a reduction of the [[gender (grammar)|gender]] system. [[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[pronoun]]s and certain [[Grammatical number|numerals]] were inflected in four cases; besides the modern [[Nominative case|nominative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]] there were also [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Accusative case|accusative]]. The gender system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], having the genders masculine, feminine and neuter. Most of the masculine and feminine nouns were later grouped together into a common gender. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish. The old inflections remained common in high prose style until the 18th century, and in some dialects into the early 20th century.

A transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination "ae" as æ{{spaced ndash}}and sometimes as a'{{spaced ndash}}though it varied between individuals and regions. The combination "aa" similarly became a&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;, and "oe" became o&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters ä, å and ö.

==Modern Swedish==
{{main|Modern Swedish}}
[[Image:Gustav Vasa Bible 1541.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Front page of the Gustav Vasa Bible of  1541. The title translated to English reads: "The Bible / That is / The Holy Scripture / in Swedish. Printed in [[Uppsala]]. 1541".]]
Modern Swedish begins with the advent of the [[printing press]] and the European [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. After assuming power, the new monarch [[Gustav Vasa]] ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The [[New Testament]] came out in 1526, followed by a full [[Bible translation#Swedish Translations|Bible translation]] in 1541, usually referred to as the ''[[Gustav Vasa Bible]]'', a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were [[Laurentius Andreæ]] and the brothers [[Laurentius Petri|Laurentius]] and [[Olaus Petri]].

The Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (1996), pg. 151&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish [[orthography]]. It established the use of the vowels "å", "ä", and "ö", and the spelling "ck" in place of "kk", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally due to the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.

Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.

[[Capitalization]] was during this time not standardized. It depended on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized, due to the Gothic or [[black letter]] font which was used to print the Bible. This font was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin font (often [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]).

Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into {{IPA|/ɧ/}} and the softening of /g/ and /k/ into /ʝ/ and {{IPA|/ɕ/}} before [[front vowel]]s. The [[voiced dental fricative|dental]] and [[voiced velar fricative|velar fricatives]] {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} were transformed to the corresponding plosives /d/ and /g/.

==Contemporary Swedish==
[[Image:August Strindberg.jpg|thumb|left|[[August Strindberg]], often considered to be the founder of modern Swedish literature.]]
The period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed ''nusvenska'' ("Contemporary Swedish", lit. "Now-Swedish") in linguistic terminology. With the [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on [[Swedish literature]]. Many authors, scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the new national language that was emerging, the most influential of these being [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912).

It was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, with the exception of some minor deviations, by the time of the spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish spoken today. The plural verb forms remained, in ever decreasing use, in formal (and particularly written) language until the 1950s, when they were finally officially abolished even from all official recommendations.

A very significant change in Swedish occurred in the 1960s, with the so-called ''[[du-reformen]]'', "the you-reform". Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher [[social status]] had been by [[title]] and [[surname]]. The use of ''herr'' ("mr"), ''fru'' ("mrs") or ''fröken'' ("miss") was only considered acceptable in initial conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ''Ni'' (the standard [[Grammatical person|second person plural]] [[pronoun]]){{spaced ndash}}corresponding to ''vous'' in [[French language|French]] and "Sie" in [[German language|German]]. ''Ni'' wound up being used as a slightly less arrogant form of ''du'' used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 60s, these previously significant distinctions of [[social class|class]] became less important and ''du'' became the standard, even in formal and official contexts.

==Former language minorities==
[[Image:Estonian archipelago (Saaremaa and Hiiumaa).jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Estonian islands which formerly housed "''Coastal Swede''" populations]]
Formerly, there were Swedish-speaking communities in [[Estonia]], particularly on the islands ([[Hiiumaa]], [[Saaremaa]] and [[Vormsi]]) along the coast of the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of the Baltic territories to [[Russia]] in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Swedish speakers were forced to march to [[Ukraine]], where they founded a village, ''[[Gammalsvenskby]]'' ("Old Swedish Village"), north of the [[Crimea]]. A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.&lt;ref&gt;The number of registered Swedes in Zmeyovka (the modern Russian name of ''Gammalsvenskby'') as of 1994 was 116 according to [[Nationalencyklopedin]], article ''svenskbyborna'' , but the number of native speakers is closer to 20 according to the association [http://www.svenskbyborna.com/foreningen.htm ''Svenskbyborna''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Estonia, the small remaining Swedish community was very well treated between the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, had Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden at the end of World War II when Estonia was incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. Only a handful of older speakers remain today.

'''Inge Krokann''' (19 August 1893   &amp;ndash; 27 September 1962) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer. His most famous work is '' I Dovre Sno '' (1929), an epic story of the Loe family during the [[Middle Ages]]. Because his writing was full of local expressions and is so strongly tied to the use of the Oppdal dialect and idiosyncratic [[Nynorsk]],   his works are largely inaccessible and difficult to translate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.allkunne.no/framside/biografiar/k/inge-krokann/94/706/|title=Inge Krokann|publisher = allkunne|accessdate= April  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ingebrikt Krokann was born at [[Oppdal]]  in [[Trøndelag]], Norway. He was the son of Trond Jonsson Krokann (1858-1936) and Dørdi Olsdatter Lo (1859-1933). In 1915 he took his final  exam at Volda lærarskule.  He worked as a [[teacher]]  first at the children's school in [[Rennebu]]. During the winter of 1917-18,  he got a leave to go to [[Askov]] Folk High School in [[Denmark]], and then he took a college course in [[Volda]]. From 1920 to 1923 he taught at Skogn Folkhøgskule. He developed [[tuberculosis]] and never fully recovered. He taught at the Nordic folk college in [[Fredriksberg]] in Denmark during 1937-1938. Krokann received several travel grants and traveled to many countries in Europe and Africa.

|accessdate= April  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married in 1921 with Gunvor Widebæk Lund (1899-1991). He died at [[Gausdal]] in [[Oppland]], Norway.

|accessdate= April  1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work was characterized by:
* Vivid descriptions of the relationships between man and nature in the harsh environment around his birthplace of [[Oppdal]];
* Effective and innovative use of the  Oppdal dialect  and [[nynorsk]] in his writing;
* A strong sense of history in his writing, tying together the [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christian]] eras in [[Norwegian history]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">The '''Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas''' (''National Indigenous Languages Institute'', better known by its acronym '''INALI''') is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] federal public agency, created 13 March 2003 by the enactment of the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas]] (''General Law of Indigenous Peoples' Linguistic Rights'') by the administration of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox Quesada]].

It is a decentralized agency of the [[Government of Mexico|Federal Public Administration]], attached to the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] (''Secretaría de Educación Pública'', or SEP). Its supreme organ is the National Council, of which the [[Secretary of Public Education]] serves as president, with a Director General in charge of its day-to-day activities.

INALI works to promote and protect the use of [[Languages of Mexico|Mexico's indigenous languages]], which it divides into 68 [[mother tongue|living]] "linguistic groups" and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Languages/INALI names for Mexican languages|hundreds of "linguistic varieties"]]. While many of the "groups" have traditionally been considered single languages, INALI recommends that the "varieties" be considered as separate languages in all matters of justice, education, health, and civil administration or information. One of INALI's main tasks is to prevent the disappearance and extinction of indigenous languages that have survived from pre-Hispanic times.

The '''internal–external distinction''' is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an [[ontology]] into two parts: an internal part consisting of a linguistic framework and observations related to that framework, and an external part concerning practical questions about the utility of that framework. This division was introduced by [[Rudolf Carnap]] in his work ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology''.&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt; It was subsequently criticized at length by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in a number of works,&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt; and was considered for some time to have been discredited. However, recently a number of authors have come to the support of some or another version of Carnap's approach.&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllspectorKelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Linguistic framework==
Carnap introduced the idea of a 'linguistic framework' or a 'form of language' that uses a precise specification of the definitions of and the relations between entities. The discussion of a proposition within a framework can take on a logical or an empirical (that is, factual) aspect. The logical aspect concerns whether the proposition respects the definitions and rules set up in the framework. The empirical aspect concerns the application of the framework in some or another practical situation.
{{quote| “If someone wishes to speak in his language about a new kind of entities, he has to introduce a system of new ways of speaking, subject to new rules; we shall call this procedure the construction of a linguistic framework for the new entities in question.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}
{{quote|“After the new forms are introduced into the language, it is possible to formulate with their help internal questions and possible answers to them. A question of this kind may be either empirical or logical; accordingly a true answer is either factually true or analytic.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}

The utility of a linguistic framework constitutes issues that Carnap calls 'external' or 'pragmatic'.
{{quote|“To be sure, we have to face at this point an important question; but it is a practical, not a theoretical question; it is the question of whether or not to accept the new linguistic forms. The acceptance cannot be judged as being either true or false because it is not an assertion. It can only be judged as being more or less expedient, fruitful, conducive to the aim for which the language is intended. Judgments of this kind supply the motivation for the decision of accepting or rejecting the kind of entities.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}
{{quote|“the decisive question is not the alleged ontological question of the existence of abstract entities but rather the question whether the rise of abstract linguistic forms or, in technical terms, the use of variables beyond those for things (or phenomenal data), is expedient and fruitful for the purposes for which semantical analyses are made, viz. the analysis, interpretation, clarification, or construction of languages of communication, especially languages of science.”|Rudolf Carnap|Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology}}

The distinction between 'internal' and 'external' arguments is not as obvious as it might appear. For example, discussion of the [[imaginary unit]] {{radic|−1}} ''might'' be an internal question framed in the language of [[complex number]]s about the correct usage of {{radic|−1}}, or it {{em|might}} be a question about the utility of complex numbers: whether there is any practical advantage in using {{radic|−1}}.&lt;ref name=Yablo/&gt; Clearly the question of utility is not completely separable from the way a linguistic framework is organized. A more formal statement of the internal-external difference is provided by Myhill:
{{quote|"A question...is internal relative to [a linguistic framework] ''T'' if the asker accepts ''T'' at the time of his asking, and is prepared to use ''T'' in order to obtain an answer; external otherwise, in particular if the question is part of a chain of reflections and discussions aimed at choosing between ''T'' and some rival theory."&lt;ref name=Myhill/&gt;|John R Myhill| Review of W. V. Quine: "On Carnap's Views on Ontology"}}

==Quine's critique==
Quine disputed Carnap's position from several points of view. His most famous criticism of Carnap was ''Two dogmas of empiricism'', but this work is not directed at the internal-external distinction but at the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]] brought up by Carnap in his work on logic: ''Meaning and Necessity''.&lt;ref name=Quine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carnap2/&gt; Quine's criticism of the internal-external distinction is found in his works ''On Carnap's views on Ontology'' and ''Word and Object''.&lt;ref name=Quine2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quine3/&gt;

Quine's approach to the internal-external division was to cast internal questions as ''subclass'' questions and external questions as ''category'' questions. What Quine meant by 'subclass' questions were questions like "what are so-and-so's?" where the answers are restricted to lie within a specific linguistic framework. On the other hand, 'category' questions were questions like "what are so-and-so's?"  asked outside any specific language where the answers are not so-restricted.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; The term ''subclass'' arises as follows: Quine supposes that a particular linguistic framework selects from a broad ''category'' of meanings for a term, say ''furniture'', a particular or subclass of meanings, say ''chairs''.

Quine argued that there is always possible an overarching language that encompasses both types of question and the distinction between the two types is artificial.
{{quote|It is evident that the question whether there are numbers will be a category question only with respect to languages which appropriate a separate style of variables for the exclusive purpose of referring to numbers. If our language refers to numbers through variables that also take classes other than numbers as values, then the question whether there are numbers becomes a subclass question...Even the question whether there are classes, or whether there are physical objects becomes a subclass question if our language uses a single style of variables to range over both sorts of entities. Whether the statement that there are physical objects and the statement that there are black swans should be put on the same side of the dichotomy, or on opposite sides, comes to depend upon the rather trivial consideration of whether we use one style of variables or two for physical objects and classes.|Willard van Orman Quine| Carnap's views on ontology}}

So we can switch back and forth from internal to external questions just by a shift of vocabulary. As Thomasson puts it,&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; if our language refers to 'things' we can ask of all the ''things'' there are, are any of them ''numbers''; while if our language includes only 'numbers', we can ask only narrower questions like whether any ''numbers'' are ''prime numbers''. In other words, Quine's position is that "Carnap's main objection to metaphysics rests on an unsupported premise, namely the assumption that there is some sort of principled plurality in language which blocks Quine's move to homogenize the [[existential quantifier]]."&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; "What is to stop us treating all ontological issues as internal questions within a single grand framework?"&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;

==Later views==
A view close to Quine’s subclass/category description is called ‘’conceptual relativity’’.&lt;ref name=Putnam/&gt; To describe conceptual relativity, Putnam points out that while the pages of a book are regarded as part of book when they are attached, they are things-in-themselves if they are detached. My nose is only part of an object, my person. On the other hand, is my nose the same as the collection of atoms or molecules forming it? This arbitrariness of language is called conceptual relativity, a matter of conventions.&lt;ref name=Putnam2/&gt; The point is made that if one wishes to refer only to 'pages', then books may not exist, and ''vice versa'' if one wishes to admit only to books. Thus, in this view, the Carnapian multiplicity of possible linguistic frameworks proposes a variety of 'realities' and the prospect of choosing between them, a form of what is called [[ontological pluralism]], or multiple realities.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eklund/&gt;  The notion of 'one reality' behind our everyday perceptions is common in everyday life, and some find it unsettling that what 'exists' might be a matter of what language one chooses to use.  This belief, however, is rendered somewhat plastic by the fact that we cannot see this underlying 'reality' directly, raising a philosophical issue called the [[subject–object problem]].

A related idea is [[quantifier variance]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt; Loosely speaking a [[existential quantifier|'quantifier expression']] is just a function that says ''there exists at least one such-and-such''. Then 'quantifier variance' combines the notion that the same object can have different names, so the quantifier may refer to the same thing even though different names are employed by it, and the notion that quantifier expressions can be formed in a variety of ways. Hirsch says this arbitrariness over what 'exists' is a quandary only due to Putnam's formulation, and it is resolved by turning things upside down and saying things that exist can have different names. In other words, Hirsch agrees with Quine that there is an overarching language that we can adapt to different situations. The Carnapian internal/external distinction in this view, as with the subclass/category distinction, is just a matter of language, and has nothing to do with 'reality'.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1/&gt;

More recently, some philosophers have stressed that the real issue is not one of language as such, but the difference between questions asked ''using'' a linguistic framework and those asked somehow before the adoption of a linguistic framework, the difference between questions about the construction and rules of a framework, and questions about the decision whether to use a framework.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt; This distinction is called by Thomasson and Price the difference between ‘’using’’ a term and ‘’mentioning’’ a term.&lt;ref name=Thomasson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; As Price notes, Carnap holds that there is a mistake involved in "assimilating issues of the existence of numbers (say) and of the existence of physical objects...the distinctions in question are not grounded at the syntactical level."&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; Price suggests a connection with Ryle's view of different functions of language:
{{quote|Ryle's functional orientation attention – his attention to the question as to what a linguistic category ''does'' –  will instead lead us to focus on the difference between the ''functions'' of talk of beliefs and talk of tables; on the issue of what the two kinds of talk are ''for'', rather than that of what they are ''about''.&lt;ref name=Ryle/&gt;|Huw Price |Metaphysics after Carnap: The ghost who walks, p. 331}}

Although not supporting an entire lack of distinction like the subclass/category view of Quine, as a ''pragmatic'' issue, the use/mention distinction still does not provide a sharp division between the issues of forming and conceptualizing a framework and deciding whether to adopt it: each informs the other.&lt;ref name=convention/&gt; An example is the well-known tension between mathematicians and physicists, the one group very concerned over questions of logic and rigor, and the other inclined to sacrifice a bit of rigor to explain observations.&lt;ref name=Lutzen/&gt;
{{quote|But the poor mathematician translates it into equations, and as the symbols do not mean anything to him he has no guide but precise mathematical rigor and care in the argument. The physicist, who knows more or less how the answer is going to come out, can sort of guess part way, and so go along rather rapidly. The mathematical rigor of great precision is not very useful in physics. But one should not criticize the mathematicians on this score...They are doing their own job.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt; |Richard Feynman |The character of physical law, pp. 56-57}}
One approach to selecting a framework is based upon an examination of the conceptual relations between entities in a framework, which entities are more 'fundamental'. One framework may then 'include' another because the entities in one framework apparently can be derived from or [[Supervenience|'supervene']] upon those in the more fundamental one.&lt;ref name=supervene/&gt;  While Carnap claims such decisions are pragmatic in nature, external questions with no philosophical importance, Schaffer suggests we avoid this formulation. Instead, we should go back to Aristotle and look upon nature as hierarchical, and pursue philosophical ''diagnostics'': that is, examination of criteria for what is fundamental and what relations exist between all entities and these fundamental ones.&lt;ref name=Schaffer/&gt; But "how can we discover what grounds what?...questions regarding not only what grounds what, but also what the grounding consists in, and how one may discover or discern grounding facts, seem to be part of an emerging set of relational research problems in metaphysics."&lt;ref name=Thomasson2/&gt;

Some caution is warranted here.

'''Irula''' is a [[Dravidian language]] spoken by the [[Irulas]] who inhabit the area of the [[Nilgiri mountains]], in the states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Karnataka]], [[India]].{{sfnp|Perialwar|1979|p=1}} It is written in the [[Tamil script]].

== Origins ==
The language was first described and classified by indologist [[Kamil Zvelebil]], who in 1955 showed that the Irula language is an independent Southern Dravidian language that is akin to [[Tamil language|Tamil]], particularly [[Old Tamil]], with some [[Kannada]]-like features. Before that, it was traditionally denied or put to doubt, and Irula was described as a crude or corrupt mixture of Tamil and Kannada. 

According to a tentative hypothesis by Kamil Zvelebil, a pre-Dravidian Melanid population that forms the bulk of the Irulas anthropologically began to speak an ancient pre- or proto-Tamil dialect, which was superimposed almost totally on their native (pre-Dravidian) speech. That then became the basis of the language, which must have subsequently been in close contact with the other tribal languages of the Nilgiri area as well as with the large surrounding languages such as Kannada, Tamil, and Malayalam.

'''Iyive''', also referred to as Uive, Yiive, Ndir, Asumbos, is a severely endangered [[Bantoid]] language spoken in [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/550 ‘’The Endangered Language Project’’]&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic group defined by use of this language is the Ndir.&lt;ref&gt;[Alan S. &amp; Regnier, C. (2008). Tivoid Survey. Cameroon: SIL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Brenzinger, M. (Eds.). (2007). Language Diversity Endangered. New York, NY: Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/uiv ‘’Iyive’’], ‘’Ethnologue Languages of the World’’&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==

Iyive is an indigenous [[Tivoid language]] of the [[Cameroons]] close to [[Tiv language|Tiv proper]].&lt;ref&gt;[Otheguy, O.G.(2008). Minority language use in Cameroon and educated indigenes' attitude to	their languages. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Volume 2008, Issue 189]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[William, F. R. (2003). Tivoid Languages. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken in the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] in the Manyu division, northeast of Akwaya town on the Nigeria border, Yive village.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/uiv ‘’Iyive’’], ‘’Ethnologue Languages of the World’’&lt;/ref&gt; Although they live in Cameroon, the majority of Iyive’s linguistic population has been forced to relocate to Nigeria due to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, S.

'''Levi Yehoshua Shapiro''' ([[Yiddish]]: '''ל. שאַפּיראָ''', born 1878, died 1948), better known as "''Lamed'' Shapiro", (''[[Lamedh|lamed]]'' is the Yiddish name of the letter [[ל]]), was an American Yiddish author. His stories are best known for such themes as [[murder]], [[rape]], and [[cannibalism in humans|cannibalism]].{{sfn|Becerra}}

==Biography==
He was born on March 10, 1878, in [[Rzhyshchiv]], [[Ukraine]].  In 1896, he traveled to [[Warsaw]], struggled to work for two years, then returned to Ukraine. He experienced a [[pogrom]], fell in love and attempted suicide, and was later [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. These experiences would influence much of his rather dark, fictional themes. Shapiro returned to Warsaw in 1903, and [[I. L. Peretz]] helped him publish his first literary works: ''Di Fligl'' ("The Wings"); and, the next year, a longer story called ''Itsikl Mamzer'' ("Little Isaac the Bastard"), published in a journal edited by [[Avrom Reyzen]]. To Peretz he would dedicate one of his works, ''Smoke'', a tale of the [[Old World]] (Peretz would serve as an early benefactor of another famous Yiddish writer, [[Der Nister]]).

Shapiro left for America in 1905.  He stayed for a year in London, where he befriended the Hebrew writer [[Yosef Haim Brenner]].  After arriving in New York in 1906, and working for ''[[The Forward]]'', he began publishing his gruesome pogrom tales: "The Kiss" (1907); "Pour Out Thy Wrath" (1908); "The Cross" (1909); "In The Dead Town" (1910).  Shapiro's work marks a break from that of the three classic Yiddish writers in its foregrounding of violence and psychological realism, rather than satirical commentary. Shapiro subsequently returned to Warsaw for a year, then returned permanently to the United States in 1911.  By 1919, Shapiro had written what are considered his two greatest pogrom stories: "White Challah" and "The Jewish Government."&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;"Lamed Shapiro" (2001), in ''Norton Anthology'', p. 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The two stories "remain some of the most aesthetically nuanced and psychologically complex treatments of the pogrom theme in modern Jewish literature."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman (2002), p. 987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro and his family moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1921. His wife, Freydl, died there in 1927, and he then returned to New York.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;  Back in New York yet again, Shapiro worked at several literary periodicals, was active in the Communist party, and was employed by the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in 1937.  Shapiro returned to LA in 1939, where he lived at 544 Heliotrope Drive in East Hollywood.

==Death==
Shapiro died in Los Angeles in 1948 while living in a friend's garage.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen&lt;/ref&gt;  He died an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and poor.  He was buried at the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (Los Angeles, California)|Mount Zion Cemetery]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] next to his wife and his tombstone was inscribed with the words: "Lamed Levi Shapiro, Author of the Yiddishe Melukhe".{{sfn|Becerra}}

[[Curt Leviant]], noted translator of Yiddish literature and a novelist in his own right, wrote his MA thesis on Shapiro: “Lamed Shapiro: Master Craftsman of the Yiddish Short Stories”, Columbia University, 1957.

[[David G. Roskies]], professor of Yiddish literature at [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], has done critical work on Lamed Shapiro, and places him in the context of [[World War I]]-era Jewish writers like [[Isaac Babel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roskies|first=David G.|authorlink=David G.

[[File:Ethnolinguistic map of Burma 1972 en.svg|thumb|300px|A map of languages used in Burma.]]
There are approximately a hundred languages spoken in [[Myanmar]] (also known as Burma).&lt;ref name="goddard"&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2005|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burmese language|Burmese]], spoken by two thirds of the population, is the [[official language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ethnolink|mya|Burmese}} at ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages spoken by ethnic minorities represent six [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]], &lt;ref name="ethno"&gt;{{harvnb|Simons and Fennig|2018|loc=[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/MM/languages Languages of Myanmar]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an incipient national standard for [[Burmese sign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathur &amp; Napoli, 2010, ''Deaf around the World: The Impact of Language''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burmese ==
{{Further|Burmese language}}
Burmese is the [[First language|native language]] of the [[Bamar people]] and related sub-ethnic groups of the Bamar, as well as that of some ethnic minorities in Burma like the [[Mon people|Mon]]. Burmese is spoken by 32 million people as a first language. Burmese is spoken as a second language by another 10 million people, particularly ethnic minorities in Burma and those in neighbouring countries.

Burmese is a [[Sino-Tibetan language]] belonging to the [[Burmish languages|Southern Burmish]] branch of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]]. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the Tibeto-Burman languages and among the Sino-Tibetan languages, the second most widely spoken, after the [[Sinitic language]]s.{{sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147}} Burmese was the fourth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]], and [[Tangut script|Tangut]].{{sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147}}

As far as [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) research dealing with interaction of computers and Burmese human-spoken language is concerned, during the period spanning more than 25 years, from 1990 to 2016, notable work has been done and annotated in the areas of Burmese language Word Identification, Segmentation, Disambiguation, Collation, Semantic Parsing and Tokenization followed by Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagging, Machine Translation Systems (MTS), Text Keying/Input, Text Recognition and Text Display Methods.{{sfn|Saini|2016|p=1}}  The scope for further research too has been explored for areas of parallel corpus development as well as development of Search Engine and WordNet for the Burmese language.{{sfn|Saini|2016|p=1}}English Zawgyi

==Indigenous languages==
Aside from Myanmar (Burmese) and its dialects, the hundred or so languages of Myanmar include [[Shan language|Shan]] (Tai, spoken by 3.2 million), [[Karen languages]] (spoken by 2.6 million), [[Jingpho language|Kachin]] (spoken by 900,000), various [[Chin languages]] (spoken by 780,000), and [[Mon language|Mon]] (Mon–Khmer, spoken by 750,000).&lt;ref name="goddard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ethno"/&gt; Most of these languages use the Myanmar (Burmese) script.

In Myanmar, usage of its minority languages is discouraged.&lt;ref name="Lintner2003p189"&gt;{{harvnb|Lintner|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fDCsD-1zitUC&amp;pg=PA189 189]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's not clear if there are one or two [[Burmese sign language]]s.

'''Massep''' (Masep, Potafa, Wotaf) is a poorly documented [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken by fewer than 50 people in a single village. Despite the small number of speakers, however, language use is vigorous. 

Donohue and colleagues (2002) conclude that it definitely is not a [[Kwerba languages|Kwerba language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-01.sil.org/silesr/2002/SILESR2002-078.pdf|title=Survey Report of the North Coast of Irian Jaya|last1=Clouse|first1=Duane|last2=Donohue|first2=Mark|last3=Ma|first3=Felix|year=2002|website=SIL|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had been classified by Wurm (1975). They did not notice connections to any other language family. 

''Ethnologue'' and ''Glottolog'' list it as a [[language isolate]],&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; but it has not been included in wider surveys, such as Ross (2005). The pronouns are not dissimilar from those of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]], but Massep is geographically distant from that family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The '''[[Kiiti Morita|Morita]] conjectures''' in [[general topology]] are certain problems about [[normal space]]s, now solved in the affirmative. They asked 

# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[discrete space|discrete]]?
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal P-space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[metrizable]]?&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiiti Morita|K. Morita]], "Some problems on normality of products of spaces"  J. Novák (ed.) , Proc. Fourth Prague Topological Symp. (Prague, August 1976) , Soc. Czech. Math. and Physicists , Prague  (1977)  pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal countably [[paracompact]] space ''Y'', is ''X'' metrizable and [[sigma-locally compact]]?

The answers were believed to be affirmative. Here a '''normal P-space''' ''Y'' is characterised by the property that the product with every metrizable ''X'' is normal; thus the conjecture was that the converse holds.

K. Chiba, T.C. Przymusiński and [[Mary Ellen Rudin]]
&lt;ref&gt;K. Chiba,   T.C. Przymusiński,   M.E. Rudin,   "Normality of products and Morita's conjectures"  ''Topol. Appl.'' '''22'''  (1986)  19–32&lt;/ref&gt; proved conjecture (1) and showed that conjectures (2) and (3) cannot be proven false under the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for mathematics (specifically that the conjectures hold under the [[axiom of constructibility]] ''V=L''). 

Fifteen years later, [[Zoltán Tibor Balogh|Z. Balogh]] succeeded in proving conjectures (2) and (3) true.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Balogh, Non-shrinking open covers and K. Morita's duality conjectures, ''Topology Appl.'', '''115''' (2001) 333-341&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muriel Elizabeth Morley''' {{post-nominal|unlinked=FRCSLT}} {{post nominals|UK|OBE}} (1899&amp;ndash;1993) was an English [[speech and language therapist]] who specialised in the management of [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]]. She was the president of the [[Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists]].

==Early years==
Morley was born on 20 February 1899 in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax, Yorkshire]]. She was the eldest daughter of Samuel Edwin Morley and Helen Ann Monk (née Fletcher). Morley attended high schools in Halifax and [[Monkseaton]] and went on to read physics and biology at [[Colleges of Durham University#Colleges in Newcastle|Armstrong College]], a college of [[Durham University]] located in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1920 she graduated with a BSc and a certificate of education. She taught physics at the [[Newcastle upon Tyne Church High School|Church High School]] in Newcastle for ten years before taking up a teaching post in India. Whilst working in India, Morley contracted dysentery and upon her return to England she was advised that she was no longer strong enough for work in the classroom.&lt;ref name='ONDB'&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=52304|title=Morley, Muriel Elizabeth (1899-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech and language therapy==
In 1932, after working as a secretary due to her forced change of career, Morley responded to an advertisement placed by William Wardell, a plastic surgeon located in Newcastle upon Tyne. Wardell had developed a new type of [[Augmentation pharyngoplasty|pharyngoplasty]] for children with cleft palate and wanted an "educated woman" to assess the speech skills of the children before and after surgery, to help determine the effectiveness of the operation. Through this work, Morley began specialising as a speech therapist working with cleft palate patients. She subsequently trained formally as a speech therapist by working with colleagues in Liverpool and London in hospitals and school clinics. In 1938 she gained the diploma of the British Society of Speech Therapists.&lt;ref name='ONDB' /&gt;

Morley was appointed as a therapist at the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]] in Newcastle upon Tyne. Whilst working for two sessions a week, she spent time preparing a thesis on cleft palate, which later became the basis for her book ''Cleft Palate and Speech'', passed in April 1939. It is around this time that she also gained membership of the British Society of Speech Therapists; its members were admitted to the College of Speech Therapists founded in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcslt.org/honours_roll_call_1945-2016 |title=RCSLT Honours Roll Call |publisher=Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morley's book gave thorough descriptions of the anatomy of cleft palate, surgery, associated speech problems and practical suggestions for treatment. It became a source of standard work in this field when published in 1945.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Between 1940 and 1945 people were becoming increasingly aware of speech therapy and the profession gained more recognition. By 1945 Morley had set up Newcastle's hospital speech therapy service and was now working full-time as a therapist in three different hospitals. Her treatment covered a variety of speech, language and communication disorders including [[aphasia|aphasic]] ex-servicemen suffering from head injuries sustained in World War II. As Morley's practice expanded, she was obliged to involve parents in the treatment of their child's speech and language disorder to manager her bulging caseload. However, soon she recognised the benefits of this and became an exponent of parental involvement in speech therapy.&lt;ref name= 'Cranio'&gt;{{cite web |title=Honorary Member Biopgraphies: DR MURIEL MORLEY |url=http://www.craniofacialsociety.org.uk/info/honmems.html#morley |author1=Lesser, R. |publisher=Craniofacial Society of Britain and Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
One of her major studies, with colleagues in Child Health, Neurology and Statistics was conducted between 1950 and 1953. During this time, Morley's department researched into the normal and abnormal development of speech in a group of over 1000 children at ages 2,4,6 and 15 as part of the [[Thousand Families Study, Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle Thousand Families survey]]. In 1957 she published part of this study together with examples of her work in multidisciplinary clinics as The Development and Disorders of Speech in Childhood. This work was regarded as a landmark in [[Speech language pathology|speech pathology]] in the United States of America. In 1958, on the basis of this book, Morley was awarded the degree of DSc by the University of Durham.

Morley made her first of several visits to the USA in 1951 where she found the standard of clinical work was below that of the UK, but that academically the training was more extensive. Upon her return to the UK, Morley hoped that a university degree course might persuade more people into the profession. Eventually, she persuaded the university in Newcastle, still then part of the University of Durham, to investigate the possibility of setting up a degree. In 1959, Morley's idea was realised and she delayed her retirement in order to establish the course. She was appointed lecturer in speech and speech pathology in the departments of child health and education, founding head of what became the first department of Speech in Britain.&lt;ref name= 'Cranio' /&gt;

==Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (1959)==
Morley joined the ultimately successful campaign against registration under the Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine because she was convinced that the profession, in order to survive, must exist as a discipline completely separate from general medicine.&lt;ref name='ONDB' /&gt; A national referendum of speech therapists followed, the profession stood firm and, despite government anger, they were removed from the Bill. The Professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill was enacted in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/66/contents |title=Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Morley's contribution to the profession of speech therapy was considerable. She eventually retired from what was by then the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], however in retirement she became the founding editor of the College of Speech Therapists' ''[[International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders|journal]]'' from 1966 - 1971, then known as the ''British Journal of Disorders of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Editorial |author1=Morley, M. E. |date=1966 |journal=British Journal of Disorders of Communication |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morley served as its third president from 1971&amp;ndash;1973. Throughout her career, she forged strong links with speech therapy profession in the USA, Australia and New Zealand where she travelled widely as a visiting professor. She was involved in achieving reciprocal recognition of speech therapy qualifications in the USA and was made an honorary member of the American Cleft Palate Association and honorary fellow of the Australian College of Speech Therapists.

In 1980, Morley was appointed OBE in acknowledgement of her pioneering work in research and education in speech therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/48212/supplement/1 |title=SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 14TH JUNE 1980 |publisher=The Gazette: Official Public Record |date=14 June 1980 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Court, professor of child health at Newcastle and her former colleague, described Morley in 1984 as a "remarkable woman", likening her to Cromwell's soldiers, "she knew what she fought for and loved what she knew".

During her retirement, Morley lived in Northumberland where she enjoyed the last thirty years of her life. The photography that she learned as part of her original cleft palate work remained a lifelong hobby. Morley never married but was described as being devoted to her family. She died of [[bronchopneumonia]] on 15 September 1993 in [[Alnwick]], Northumberland.&lt;ref name='ONDB' /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2829">'''N. S. Lakshminarayan Bhatta''' (born 1936) is a [[Kannada]] poet from [[Shivamogga]] district. He was awarded the [[Karnataka]] [[Sahitya Akademi]] in 1974. After completing a M.A., from Maharaja's college in Mysore and a PhD at Bangalore University, he served briefly as a teacher of Kannada literature at Acharya Pata Shala (APS College) in Bangalore before joining Bangalore University where he served as a professor and chairman of the department for more than 20 years serving as the dean (1990) of the Arts College prior to his retirement from the University. Bhat is a scholar-poet widely read in Kannada, English and Sanskrit literature.

His very early work Horalu Daariyalli Kaavya (Poetry on a fun road), in the early 1970s earned him the Sahitya Academy award and announced him to the literary world as a poet of much skill. Dr. Bhatta has translated 50 sonnets of [[William Shakespeare]], the poetry of TS Elliot and works of poet Yeats into Kannada language. The [[Masti Venkatesh Iyengar|Masti]] Award was given to poet N.S. Lakshminarayana Bhatta in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/25/stories/2007062558430500.htm Masti Award]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been recognized for his contribution to modern Kannada poetry and literary criticism with numerous awards and honors.  His effort related to popularizing the works of the bard Shishunala Sharif led to a renaissance in the Kannada Bhavageetha movement, earning Dr. Bhatta the moniker of "Sharif Bhatta".

His work "Readings in Kannada" on making Kannada more accessible to the masses has been among the popular books ever written in that realm and sold over 200,000 copies over several editions.  He has been honored with numerous awards including the Central Sahitya Academy Award and The AnaKru Prashasthi.  He is widely recognized as the foremost scholar of the history of Kannada literature and his numerous lectures during workshops conducted in the United States has been captured in the links below

His latest work, Samagra Kannada Sahitya Charitre (A Comprehensive History of Kannada Literature) was published in early 2014.

'''On the fly''' is a phrase used to describe something that is being changed while the process that the change affects is ongoing. It is used in the automotive, computer, and culinary industries. In cars, on the fly can be used to describe the changing of the cars configuration while it is still driving. Processes that can occur while the car is still driving include switching between two wheel drive and four wheel drive on some cars and opening and closing the roof on some convertible cars. In computing, on the fly CD writers can read from one CD and write the data to another without saving it on a computer's memory. Switching programs or applications on the fly in multi-tasking operating systems means the ability to switch between native and/or emulated programs or applications that are still running and running in parallel while performing their tasks or processes, but without pausing, freezing, or delaying any, or other unwanted events. Switching computer parts on the fly means computer parts are replaced while the computer is still running. It can also be used in programming to describe changing a program while it is still running. In restaurants and other places involved in the preparation of food, the term is used to indicate that an order needs to be made right away.

==Colloquial usage==
In colloquial use, "on the fly" means something created when needed. The phrase is used to mean:
# something that was not planned ahead
# changes that are made during the execution of same activity: [[wiktionary:ex tempore|ex tempore]], [[wiktionary:impromptu|impromptu]].

==Automotive usage==
In the automotive industry, the term refers to the circumstance of performing certain operations while a vehicle is driven by the engine and moving. In reference to [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles, this term describes the ability to change from two to four-wheel drive while the car is in gear and moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://4wheeldrive.about.com/cs/offroadingtips/a/aa021401a.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-05-04|title=4WD vs 2WD: The Differences Between 4x4 And 4x2|last=Walczak|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[convertible]] models, the roof can be folded electrically on the fly, whereas in other cases the car must be stopped.
In harvesting machines, newer monitoring systems let the driver track the quality of the grain, while enabling them to adjust the rotor speed on the fly as harvesting progresses.

==Computer usage==
In multitasking computing an operating system can handle several programs, both native applications or emulated software, that are running independent, parallel, together in the same time in the same device, using separated or shared resources and/or data, executing their tasks separately or together, while a user can switch on the fly between them or groups of them to use obtained effects or supervise purposes, without waste of time or waste of performance. In operating systems using [[GUI]] very often it is done by switching from an active window (or an object playing similar role) of a particular software piece to another one but of another software.  

A computer can compute results on the fly, or retrieve a previously stored result.

It can mean to make a copy of a removable media ([[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], etc.) directly, without first saving the source on an intermediate medium (a [[harddisk]]); for example, copying a CD-ROM from a CD-ROM drive to a [[Optical disc recorder|CD-Writer]] drive. The copy process requires each block of data to be retrieved and immediately written to the destination, so that there is room in the working memory to retrieve the next block of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.freeotfe.org/|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used for encrypted data storage, ''on the fly'' the [[data stream]] is automatically encrypted as it is written and decrypted when read back again, transparently to software. The acronym [[On-the-fly encryption|OTFE]] is typically used. &lt;!-- changed redirect as there is a merge proposal, though apparently now double redirects now work --&gt;

On-the-fly programming is the technique of modifying a program without stopping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On-the-fly Programming|date=2002|url=http://on-the-fly.cs.princeton.edu/|last1=Wang|last2=Cook|first1=G. E.|first2=Perry|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept, [[hot swapping]], refers to on-the-fly replacement of computer hardware.

==On-the-fly computing==
On-the-fly computing (OTF computing) is about automating and customizing software tailored to the needs of a user. According to a requirement specification, this software is composed of basic components, so-called basic services, and a user-specific setting of these basic components is made. Accordingly, the requested services are compiled only at the request of the user and then run in a specially designed data center to make the user the functions of the (on-the-fly) created service accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On-The-Fly Computing: A novel paradigm for individualized IT services.

To '''pinky swear''', or to make a '''pinky promise''', is the touching of the [[Little finger|pinkies]] of two people to signify that a [[promise]] has been made.

In the United States, the pinky swear has been believed to have existed since at least 1996 originally to have been invented by a young man named Blake Fournier accompanied by his best friend (Jake) during a second grade recess at the Doris French Elementary School on the Eastside of Las Vegas. The boys were only a young 7 years of age at the time of this unexpectedly viral breakthrough onto the (previously unreliable) promise making whenscene. '' Dictionary of Americanisms'' listed the following accompanying promise:

:''Pinky, pinky bow-bell,''
:''Whoever tells a lie''
:''Will sink down to the bad place'' {{sic}}
:''And never rise up again.''&lt;ref name=pinky&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=42UPAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=pinky#v=snippet&amp;q=pinky&amp;f=false|title=Pinky|publisher=googlebooks|work=Bartlett's Dictionary of Americanisms|accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinky swearing presumably started in Japan, where it is called {{Nihongo||指切り|'''yubikiri'''|"finger cut-off"}} and often additionally confirmed with the vow {{Nihongo|"Finger cut-off, ten thousand fist-punchings, whoever lies has to swallow thousand needles."|指切拳万、嘘ついたら針千本呑ます|"Yubikiri genman, uso tsuitara hari senbon nomasu"}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daijirin]]&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture may be connected to the Japanese belief that soulmates are connected by a [[red string of fate]] attached to each of their pinkies.

Recently in South Korea, the hooked pinky has been followed by a “seal,” wherein the thumbs touch each other while the pinkies are still hooked. 

In modern times, pinky swearing is a more informal way of sealing a promise. It is most common among school-age children and close friends. The pinky swear signifies a promise that can never be broken.&lt;ref&gt;Iwai, H . Byōri Shūdan: "Sheishin-Shobō", p. 225. 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proclamation of the Republic''' ({{lang-ga|Forógra na Poblachta}}), also known as the '''1916 Proclamation''' or the '''Easter Proclamation''', was a document issued by the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] during the [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland, which began on 24 April 1916.  In it, the Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], styling itself the "[[Provisional Government of the Irish Republic]]", proclaimed Ireland's independence from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The reading of the proclamation by [[Patrick Pearse]] outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) on Sackville Street (now called [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin's main thoroughfare, marked the beginning of the Rising. The proclamation was modelled on a similar independence proclamation issued during the 1803 rebellion by [[Robert Emmet]].

== Principles of the proclamation ==
Though the Rising failed in military terms, the principles of the Proclamation to varying degrees influenced the thinking of later generations of Irish politicians. The document consisted of a number of assertions:

* that the Rising's leaders spoke for Ireland (a claim historically made by Irish insurrectionary movements);
* that the Rising marked another wave of attempts to achieve independence through force of arms;
* that the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] were central to the Rising;
* "the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland"
* that the form of government was to be a republic;
* a guarantee of "religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens", the first mention of gender equality, given that Irish women under British law were not allowed to vote;
* a commitment to [[universal suffrage]], a phenomenon limited at the time to only a handful of countries, not including the UK;
* a promise of "cherishing all the children of the nation equally". Although these words have been quoted since the 1990s by [[children's rights]] advocates,  "children of the nation" refers to all Irish people;&lt;ref&gt;De Paor 1997, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;
* disputes between nationalists and unionists are attributed to "differences carefully fostered by an alien government", a rejection of what was later dubbed  [[Two Nations Theory (Ireland)|two-nations theory]].

== The printing and distribution of the text ==
The proclamation had been printed secretly prior to the Rising on a Summit Wharfedale Stop Cylinder Press, located in [[Liberty Hall]], Eden Quay (HQ of the [[Irish Citizen Army]]). Because of its secret printing, problems arose which affected the layout and design. In particular, because of a shortage of [[metal type|type]], the document was printed in two halves, printing first the top then the bottom on the same pieces of paper. The typesetters were Willie O'Brien, Michael Molloy and Christopher Brady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irish Transport and General Workers' Union|title=Fifty years of Liberty Hall: the golden jubilee of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union 1909–1959|publisher=Three Candles|location=Dublin|year=1959|pages=69|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zrtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Brady+Molloy+O%27Brien+proclamation&amp;q=Brady+Molloy+O%27Brien#search_anchor|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lacked a sufficient supply of type in the same size and font, and as a result the some parts of the document use ''e''s from a different font, which are smaller and do not quite match.

The language suggested that the original copy of the proclamation had actually been signed by the Rising's leaders. However no evidence has ever been found, nor do any contemporary records mention, the existence of an ''actually signed'' copy, though had such a copy existed, it could easily have been destroyed in the aftermath of the Rising by someone (in the British military, a member of the public or a Rising participant trying to destroy potentially incriminating evidence) who did not appreciate its historic importance. Molloy claimed in later life to have set the document from a handwritten copy, with signatures on a separate piece of paper which he destroyed by chewing while in prison, but this was disputed by other participants.&lt;ref name="Molloy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Witness statement WS 716 (Michael J. Molloy)|url=http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0716.pdf#page=6|publisher=Bureau of Military History|page=5|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy also recalled that Connolly had asked for the document to resemble an auctioneer's notice in general design.&lt;ref name="Mosley 1" /&gt;

There are about 30 original copies still remaining, one of which can be viewed in the National Print Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalprintmuseum.ie/permanent.html|title=Permanent Exhibitions|year=2011|publisher=National Print Museum (Ireland)|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726180848/http://www.nationalprintmuseum.ie/permanent.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions were later made, which have sometimes been misattributed as originals.&lt;ref name="Mosley 1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=The image of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic 1916|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/image-of-proclamation-of-irish-republic.html|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mosley 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=The Proclamation of the Irish Republic: notes from Dublin|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/the-proclamation-of-irish-republic.html|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the British soldiers recaptured Liberty Hall, they found the press with the type of the bottom of the proclamation still fully set up, and reportedly ran off some copies as souvenirs, leading to a proliferation of these 'half-copies'.&lt;ref name="Mosley 1" /&gt; [[James Mosley]] notes that complete originals rapidly became rare in the chaos, and that over a month later the Dublin police had failed to find one for their files.&lt;ref name="Mosley 1" /&gt;

== The signatories ==
{{see also|Provisional Government of the Irish Republic}}
The signatories (as their names appeared on the Proclamation):
* [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas J. Clarke]]
* [[Seán Mac Diarmada]]
* [[Thomas MacDonagh]]
* [[Patrick Pearse|P. H. Pearse]]
* [[Éamonn Ceannt]]
* [[James Connolly]]
* [[Joseph Plunkett]]

One question sometimes raised is why the first name among the 'signatories' was not Pearse but Tom Clarke, a veteran republican. Had the arrangement of names been alphabetical, Éamonn Ceannt would have appeared on top. Clarke's widow maintained that it was because the plan had been for Clarke, as a famed veteran, to become the ''President of the Provisional Republic''. Such an explanation would certainly explain his premier position. However others associated with the Rising dismissed her claims, which she made in her memoirs. Later documents issued by the rebels gave Pearse pride of place, though as 'Commanding in Chief the Forces of the Irish Republic, and President of the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Republic|Provisional Government]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://source.southdublinlibraries.ie/handle/10599/9779 |title=Pamphlet: "The Provisional Government to the Citizens of Dublin on the Momentous occasion of the proclamation of a Sovereign Independent Irish State" |date=1916 |work=South Dublin Libraries |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 'President of the Republic'. Whether the plan had ever been to have Clarke as a symbolic head of state and Pearse as head of government, or was simply that Pearse was always to be central but with statements ambiguously describing his title, remains a mystery about which historians still speculate.

All seven signatories of the proclamation were executed by the British military (James Connolly who had been wounded in the fighting was executed sitting down in a chair) in the aftermath of the Rising, being viewed as having committed [[treason]] in wartime (i.e. the [[First World War]]).&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;''[[Dublin Gazette]]'', Proclamation of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]], on 9 May 1916 had proclaimed Dublin under martial law, with the statement that subsequent actions by the [[Dublin Castle administration in Ireland|Dublin Castle administration]] would be taken in accordance with that declaration.&lt;/ref&gt; British political leaders regarded the executions initially as unwise, later as a catastrophe, with the [[British Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] and later prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] stating that they regretted allowing the British military to treat the matter as a matter of military law in wartime, rather than insisting that the leaders were treated under civilian criminal law. Though initially deeply unsympathetic to the Rising (the leading Irish nationalist newspaper, the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' called for their execution), Irish public opinion switched and became more sympathetic due to manner of their treatment and executions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Eventually Asquith's government ordered a halt to the executions and insisted that those not already executed be dealt with through civilian, not military, law. By that stage all the signatories and a number of others had been executed.

== The document today ==
Full copies of the Easter Proclamation are now treated as a revered Irish national icon, and a copy was sold at auction for €390,000 in December, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History under the Hammer|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=8 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy owned (and later signed as a memento) by Rising participant [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] was presented by him to the Irish parliament buildings, [[Leinster House]], during his tenure as [[President of Ireland]]. It is currently on permanent display in the main foyer. Other copies are on display in the GPO (headquarters of the Rising and the place where the Proclamation was first read), the National Museum of Ireland, the [[Trinity College Library]]'s Long Room and other museums worldwide. Facsimile copies are sold as [[souvenir]]s in Ireland, and copies of the text are often displayed in Irish schools and in Irish pubs throughout the world. The proclamation is read aloud by an Officer of the Irish Defence Forces outside the GPO during the Easter Rising commemorations on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] of each year.

POBLACHT NA hÉIREANN&lt;br&gt;
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
OF THE
IRISH REPUBLIC
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN:&lt;br&gt; In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien Government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God, Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline, and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

'''Question answering''' ('''QA''') is a computer science discipline within the fields of [[information retrieval]] and [[natural language processing]] (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a [[natural language]].

==Overview==
A QA implementation, usually a computer program, may construct its answers by querying a structured [[database]] of knowledge or information, usually a [[knowledge base]]. More commonly, QA systems can pull answers from an unstructured collection of natural language documents.

Some examples of natural language document collections used for QA systems include:

* a local collection of reference texts
* internal organization documents and web pages
* compiled [[newswire]] reports
* a set of [[Wikipedia]] pages
* a subset of [[World Wide Web]] pages

QA research attempts to deal with a wide range of question types including: fact, list, [[definition]], ''How'', ''Why'', hypothetical, semantically constrained, and cross-lingual questions.

* ''Closed-domain'' question answering deals with questions under a specific domain (for example, medicine or automotive maintenance), and can be seen as an easier task because NLP systems can exploit domain-specific knowledge frequently formalized in [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. Alternatively, ''closed-domain'' might refer to a situation where only a limited type of questions are accepted, such as questions asking for [[descriptive knowledge|descriptive]] rather than [[procedural knowledge|procedural]] information. QA systems in the context of machine reading applications have also been constructed in the medical domain, for instance related to Alzheimers disease&lt;ref&gt;Roser Morante, Martin Krallinger, Alfonso Valencia and  Walter Daelemans. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.366.3461 Machine Reading of Biomedical Texts about Alzheimer's Disease]. CLEF 2012 Evaluation Labs and Workshop. September 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Open domain#References|Open-domain]]'' question answering deals with questions about nearly anything, and can only rely on general ontologies and world knowledge. On the other hand, these systems usually have much more data available from which to extract the answer.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Two early QA systems were BASEBALL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GREEN JR|first1=Bert F|title=Baseball: an automatic question-answerer|journal=Western joint IRE-AIEE-ACM computer conference|date=1961|pages=219–224|display-authors=etal|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist289/p219-green.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and LUNAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=William A|last2=Kaplan|first2=R.|title=Lunar rocks in natural English: Explorations in natural language question answering|journal=Linguistic structures processing 5|date=1977|volume=5|pages=521–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASEBALL answered questions about the US baseball league over a period of one year. LUNAR, in turn, answered questions about the geological analysis of rocks returned by the Apollo moon missions. Both QA systems were very effective in their chosen domains. In fact, LUNAR was demonstrated at a lunar science convention in 1971 and it was able to answer 90% of the questions in its domain posed by people untrained on the system. Further restricted-domain QA systems were developed in the following years. The common feature of all these systems is that they had a core database or knowledge system that was hand-written by experts of the chosen domain. The language abilities of BASEBALL and LUNAR used techniques similar to [[ELIZA]] and [[DOCTOR]], the first [[chatterbot]] programs.

[[SHRDLU]] was a highly successful question-answering program developed by [[Terry Winograd]] in the late 60s and early 70s. It simulated the operation of a robot in a toy world (the "blocks world"), and it offered the possibility of asking the robot questions about the state of the world. Again, the strength of this system was the choice of a very specific domain and a very simple world with rules of physics that were easy to encode in a computer program.

In the 1970s, [[knowledge base]]s were developed that targeted narrower domains of knowledge. The QA systems developed to interface with these [[expert system]]s produced more repeatable and valid responses to questions within an area of knowledge. These [[expert systems]] closely resembled modern QA systems except in their internal architecture. Expert systems rely heavily on expert-constructed and organized [[knowledge base]]s, whereas many modern QA systems rely on statistical processing of a large, unstructured, natural language text corpus.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the development of comprehensive theories in [[computational linguistics]], which led to the development of ambitious projects in text comprehension and question answering. One example of such a system was the Unix Consultant (UC), developed by [[Robert Wilensky]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]] in the late 1980s. The system answered questions pertaining to the [[Unix]] operating system. It had a comprehensive hand-crafted knowledge base of its domain, and it aimed at phrasing the answer to accommodate various types of users. Another project was LILOG, a [[natural language understanding|text-understanding]] system that operated on the domain of tourism information in a German city. The systems developed in the UC and LILOG projects never went past the stage of simple demonstrations, but they helped the development of theories on computational linguistics and reasoning.

Recently, specialized natural language QA systems have been developed, such as [http://bitem.hesge.ch/content/eagli-eagle-eye EAGLi] for health and life scientists.

==Architecture==
As of 2001, QA systems typically included a ''question classifier'' module that determines the type of question and the type of answer.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, L. &amp; Gaizauskas, R. (2001) [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=96167 Natural Language Question Answering. The View from Here]. Natural Language Engineering (2001), 7:4:275-300 Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''multiagent'' question-answering architecture has been proposed, where each domain is represented by an agent which tries to answer questions taking into account its specific knowledge; a meta–agent controls the cooperation between question answering agents and chooses the most relevant answer(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Galitsky B, Pampapathi R|title=Can many agents answer questions better than one|journal=First Monday |volume = 10| Number=1 |date=2005 | url = http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1204/1124 |doi=10.5210/fm.v10i1.1204
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question answering methods==
QA is very dependent on a good search [[text corpus|corpus]] - for without documents containing the answer, there is little any QA system can do. It thus makes sense that larger collection sizes generally lend well to better QA performance, unless the question domain is orthogonal to the collection. The notion of [[data redundancy]] in massive collections, such as the web, means that nuggets of information are likely to be phrased in many different ways in differing contexts and documents,&lt;ref&gt;Lin, J. (2002). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.6371&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The Web as a Resource for Question Answering: Perspectives and Challenges]. In Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; leading to two benefits:

# By having the right information appear in many forms, the burden on the QA system to perform complex NLP techniques to understand the text is lessened.
# Correct answers can be filtered from [[false positive]]s by relying on the correct answer to appear more times in the documents than instances of incorrect ones.

Some question answering systems rely heavily on [[automated reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, Dan, et al. "[http://anthology.aclweb.org/N/N03/N03-1022.pdf Cogex: A logic prover for question answering]." Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology-Volume 1.

Ai Communications 23.2-3 (2010): 241-265.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of question answering systems designed in [[Prolog]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galitsky |first=Boris |title=Natural Language Question Answering System: Technique of Semantic Headers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkNmAAAACAAJ |series=International Series on Advanced Intelligence |volume=Volume 2 |year=2003 |publisher=Advanced Knowledge International |location=Australia |isbn=978-0-86803-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[logic programming]] language associated with [[artificial intelligence]].

===Open domain question answering===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In [[information retrieval]], an open domain question answering system aims at returning an answer in response to the user's question. The returned answer is in the form of short texts rather than a list of relevant documents. The system uses a combination of techniques from [[computational linguistics]], [[information retrieval]] and [[knowledge representation]] for finding answers.

The system takes a [[natural language]] question as an input rather than a set of keywords, for example, "When is the national day of China?" The sentence is then transformed into a query through its [[logical form]]. Having the input in the form of a natural language question makes the system more user-friendly, but harder to implement, as there are various question types and the system will have to identify the correct one in order to give a sensible answer. Assigning a question type to the question is a crucial task, the entire answer extraction process relies on finding the correct question type and hence the correct answer type.

Keyword [[Data extraction|extraction]] is the first step for identifying the input question type. In some cases, there are clear words that indicate the question type directly. i.e. "Who", "Where" or "How many", these words tell the system that the answers should be of type "Person", "Location", "Number" respectively. In the example above, the word "When" indicates that the answer should be of type "Date". [[part-of-speech tagging|POS (Part of Speech) tagging]] and syntactic parsing techniques can also be used to determine the answer type. In this case, the subject is "Chinese National Day", the predicate is "is" and the adverbial modifier is "when", therefore the answer type is "Date". Unfortunately, some interrogative words like "Which", "What" or "How" do not give clear answer types. Each of these words can represent more than one type. In situations like this, other words in the question need to be considered. First thing to do is to find the words that can indicate the meaning of the question. A lexical dictionary such as [[WordNet]] can then be used for understanding the context.

Once the question type has been identified, an [[Information retrieval]] system is used to find a set of documents containing the correct key words. A tagger and NP/Verb Group chunker can be used to verify whether the correct entities and relations are mentioned in the found documents. For questions such as "Who" or "Where", a Named Entity Recogniser is used to find relevant "Person" and "Location" names from the retrieved documents. Only the relevant paragraphs are selected for ranking.

A [[vector space model]] can be used as a strategy for classifying the candidate answers. Check if the answer is of the correct type as determined in the question type analysis stage. Inference technique can also be used to validate the candidate answers. A score is then given to each of these candidates according to the number of question words it contains and how close these words are to the candidate, the more and the closer the better. The answer is then translated into a compact and meaningful representation by parsing. In the previous example, the expected output answer is "1st Oct."

==Issues==
In 2002, a group of researchers presented an unpublished and largely unsourced report as a funding support document, in which they describe a 5-year roadmap of research current to the state of the question answering field at that time.

==Progress==
QA systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Maybury, M. T. editor. 2004. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120105774321055 New Directions in Question Answering.] AAAI/MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, systems have been developed to automatically answer temporal and geospatial questions, questions of definition and terminology, biographical questions, multilingual questions, and questions about the content of audio, images, and video. Current QA research topics include:

* interactivity—clarification of questions or answers
* answer reuse or caching

'''Reification''' in [[natural language processing]] refers to where a natural language statement is transformed so actions and events in it become [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiable]] variables. For example "John chased the duck furiously" can be transformed into something like

:(Exists e)(chasing(e) &amp; past_tense(e) &amp; actor(e,John) &amp; furiously(e) &amp; patient(e,duck)).

Another example would be "Sally said John is mean", which could be expressed as something like

:(Exists u,v)(saying(u) &amp; past_tense(u) &amp; actor(u,Sally) &amp; that(u,v) &amp; is(v) &amp; actor(v,John) &amp; mean(v)).

Such representations allow one to use the tools of classical [[First-order logic|first-order predicate calculus]] even for statements which, due to their use of tense, modality, adverbial constructions, propositional arguments (''e.g.'' "Sally said that X"), etc., would have seemed intractable. This is an advantage because predicate calculus is better understood and simpler than the more complex alternatives (higher-order logics, modal logics, temporal logics, etc.), and there exist better automated tools (''e.g.'' [[automated theorem prover]]s and [[model checker]]s) for manipulating it.

Reified forms can be used for other purposes besides the application of first-order logic; one example is the automatic discovery of synonymous phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Dekang Lin and Patrick Pantel, "DIRT&amp;nbsp;– Discovery of Inference Rules from Text", (2001) KDD01-Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poon"&gt;Hoifung Poon and Pedro Domingos "Unsupervised Semantic Parsing" (2009) EMNLP09: Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing&lt;/ref&gt;

The reified forms are sometimes called '''quasi-logical forms''', and the existential variables are sometimes treated as [[Skolem constant]]s.&lt;ref name="Poon" /&gt;

Not all natural language constructs admit a uniform translation to first order logic. See [[donkey sentence]] for examples and a discussion.

[[Image:Wien Staatsoper Innenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The ornately decorated safety curtain of the [[Vienna State Opera]] House.]]

A '''safety curtain''' (or '''fire curtain''' in America) is a [[fire safety]] precaution used in large [[proscenium]] [[Theater (structure)|theatres]]. It is usually a heavy [[fibreglass]] or [[iron]] curtain located immediately behind the [[proscenium arch]].  [[Asbestos]]-based materials were originally used to manufacture the curtain, before the dangers of asbestos were widely publicized. The safety curtain is sometimes referred to as an '''iron''' in British theatres, regardless of the actual construction material.

[[Occupational safety and health]] regulations state that the safety curtain must be able to resist [[fire]] and thereby prevent (or at least hinder) fires starting on stage from spreading to the [[auditorium]] and the rest of the theatre, reducing injuries to [[Patrons|audience members]] and members of staff.

The curtain is extremely heavy and therefore requires its own dedicated operating mechanisms. In an emergency, the [[Stage management|stage manager]] can usually pull a lever backstage which will cause the curtain to fall rapidly into position. Alternatively, heat-sensitive components can be built into the rigging to automatically close this curtain in case of fire.  Finally, it may be released electronically by a building's fire control system if any alarm box is operated. It can also be [[fly system|flown]] in and out, as regulations in some jurisdictions state that it must be shown to the [[audience]], to prove its effective operation, for a certain amount of time during every [[performance]]. This usually occurs during the [[intermission]].

In smaller theatres, a safety curtain is not usually required. Specifically, most United States building codes only require a fire curtain in theatres with a stage height of more than {{convert|50|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;''2006 International Building Code'', 410.3.4, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy, flame-retardant [[tabs (stage)|house tabs]] can provide some degree of fire separation.

In the UK, it is a requirement that a safety curtain must be fully down within the proscenium opening within 30 seconds of being released. In 1794 the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] became the first theatre to feature an iron safety curtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre |title=History of theatres: Eighteenth-century theatre|publisher=The Theatres Trust |date= |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other serious fires, notably that at the [[Theatre Royal, Exeter]] in 1887, led to the introduction of safety curtains on a wider scale.

Chicago's 1903 [[Iroquois Theatre fire]] resulted in over 600 deaths when the theater's safety curtain got stuck midway down, along with other structural deficiencies in the building.

==Related stage fire safety devices==
{{unreferencedsection|date=February 2017}}
The safety curtain can be combined with other safety devices, such as:

*'''Smoke pockets''' - are steel channels located at either side of the proscenium arch that the safety curtain travels within to create a physical barrier between the auditorium and the stage.  The safety curtain is not intended to create an air seal but rather prevent material from falling from the stage house into the audience.
*'''[[Fire door]]s''' - heavy, fireproof doors that are designed to automatically close any doorway onto the stage in the event of a fire. These doors are usually on a slightly pitched track, and are rigged in a way that causes them to automatically close when heated to a certain temperature.
*'''Smoke doors''' or '''stage lantern''' - vents above the stage which, when opened in case of fire, will draw [[smoke]] out of the auditorium and up out of the roof of the theatre, enabling safer evacuation of the audience. The vents are often attached to compressed springs, so that when activated, they will stay open.
*'''Drencher''' or '''deluge system''' - a large reservoir of water stored above the stage which, when released in case of fire, will [[flood]] the stage in an attempt to extinguish any flames. This type of system can be problematic, as water interacting with onstage electrical circuits can cause fire.
*'''Water Curtain'''- a system similar to the deluge system, except instead of having the water drench the stage itself, the water flows from [[sprinkler head]]s or other nozzles directly in front of the [[Proscenium arch|proscenium]] to prevent sparks from flying off the stage or to extinguish any burning material (such as a set) which may fall through the [[Proscenium arch|proscenium]].

In the event of a fire, the use of smoke doors and fire curtains means that the stage area effectively functions as a chimney.  The heated air rises and leaves through the smoke doors, and this puts the building into [[negative room pressure|negative pressure]], which in turn draws fresh air in through any open exit doors.  Patrons waiting to exit will have fresh breathing air until the exit doors close.  The exit doors which open out will be drawn closed tightly by this draft once they are no longer held open by evacuees. Once the doors are closed, the fire loses its oxygen source. If the doors are then opened again, a [[backdraft]] can occur.

'''Salim Khan''' (born 24 November 1935) is an [[Indian film]] actor, producer and [[screenwriter]]. As a screenwriter, he wrote the screenplays, stories and scripts for numerous [[Bollywood]] films.

==Early years==
Salim Khan was born in the city of [[Indore]] in [[Indore State]] a [[princely state]] in [[British Raj|British India]] (modern day [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]) into an affluent family. Khan's grandfather, Anwar Khan, was an [[Alakozai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] who migrated from British madras]] to India in the mid-1800s and served in the cavalry of the [[British Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/the-kingdom-of-khan |title=The Kingdom of Khan |publisher=[[OPEN (magazine)|OPEN]] |quote=Salim Khan, scriptwriter and father of [[Salman Khan]], remembers the [[Afghan]] tribe his family historically belongs to. “It is [[Achakzai]],” he says. “My family came to Indore 150 years ago, and worked as [part of the] cavalry in the time of the British.” Salman Khan is a fifth-generation Khan in India. |first=Shubhangi |last=Swarup |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://in.news.yahoo.com/khans-bollywood-afghan-traces-pathan-roots-074154652.html |title=Khans in Bollywood: Afghan traces their Pathan roots |publisher=IANS |first=Devirupa |last=Mitra |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2017}}. Khan's family tended to look for employment in government service, and eventually settled in Indore.

Salim Khan was the youngest child of his parents, both of whom died by the time he was 14 years old. His father, Abdul Rashid Khan, had joined the [[Indian Imperial Police]] and had risen to the rank of [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]]-Indore, which was the highest police rank open to an Indian in British India. Salim's mother died when he was only nine years old. She had suffered from [[tuberculosis]] for four years before her death, and therefore it was forbidden for the younger children come close to her or hug her; Salim therefore had little contact with his mother even before her early death. His father also died in January 1950, when he was only fourteen years old. Two months later, in March 1950, Salim (who attended St. Raphaels' School in Indore) appeared for his matriculation examination. He did moderately well, and enrolled in Holkar College, Indore, and completed his BA. His elder brothers supported him with funds drawn from the family's substantial wealth, to the extent that he was given a car of his own while he was a college student. He excelled in sports, especially cricket, and it was for being a star cricketer that he was allowed by the college to enroll for a master's degree at the end of his bachelors. He was also a trained pilot.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia"&gt;{{cite news|title=We were more successful than most leading pairs|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1101114/jsp/7days/story_13173933.jsp|work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these years, he also became enamored of films, and received encouragement from classmates, who told him that with his exceptional good looks, he should try to become a film star.

==Career==

===Acting phase (1960–1969)===
While he was an MA student in Indore, Salim attended the wedding of Kamal Barjatya, son of film producer [[Tarachand Barjatya]] (founder of [[Rajshri Productions]]). Here, he was spotted by film director [[K. Amarnath]], who was impressed by his good looks and offered him a supporting role in his forthcoming film ''Baraat''. He would be paid Rs.1000/- as a signing amount and a monthly salary of Rs.400/- for the period of shooting. Salim accepted and moved to Mumbai, living in a small rented apartment in [[Mahim]]. While ''Baraat'' was duly made and released in 1960, it did not do too well, and in any case, his role was a minor one.

Working under the name Prince Salim,&lt;ref name="telegraphindia"/&gt; he got into the usual 'struggle' situation of wannabe actors, working in minor roles, being typecast as a good-looking supporting actor, and gradually descending into B-grade films. Over the next decade, he acted in what he calls “indifferent roles," playing minor characters in about two dozen films, but so minor were his appearances that his name does not appear on the credits of several of these films; his credits amount to a total of 14 films till 1970, and one final appearance in 1977. These included ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' (1966), ''Sarhaadi Lootera'' (1966) and ''Diwaana'' (1967). His most substantial role, for which he did receive some notice, was in ''Teesri Manzil'', where his role as the hero's friend was a meaty one, and his entry scene got a very good build-up.

===Screenwriting transition (1969–1971)===
After working in 25 films, he eventually understood that he "was not cut out to be an actor because I lacked the art of projection. But by then it was too late — how could I have gone back to Indore?"&lt;ref name="telegraphindia"/&gt; In the late 1960s, Salim Khan, who was struggling financially, decided to start shifting his focus away from acting and towards writing scripts, and continued to use the name Prince Salim. One of his more notable film scripts was ''[[Do Bhai (1969 film)|Do Bhai]]'' (1969). He also began working with [[Abrar Alvi]] as a writing assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=Diptakirti|title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema’s Greatest Screenwriters|date=2015|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|isbn=9789352140084|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23|language=en|quote=Salim had decided to cut down on his acting assignments in order to concentrate on writing and though money was hard to come by, he had not lost his flamboyance. In ''Do Bhai'', he was credited as Prince Salim. During this period, he joined Abrar Alvi as a writing assistant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salim-Javed phase (1971–1982)===
{{main|Salim-Javed}}

Salim met Javed Akhthar for first time during the making of the film ''Sarhadi Lootera,'' which was to be Salim's last acting appearance. Javed, who served as a clapper boy when shooting began, was later made the dialogue writer for the film by director S.M. Sagar. Their friendship began while both were working in this film, and developed further because their bosses were neighbours to each other. Salim Khan got a job assisting writer/director Abrar Alvi in finalizing screenplays and dialogues, while Javed Akhtar began assisting Kaifi Azmi in a similar capacity, with focus on honing poetry. Abrar Alvi and Kaifi Azmi were neighbours, and therefor Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar used to see a lot of each other. The duo hit it off well and formed a script-writing team that came to be known as [[Salim-Javed]]. Salim used to form stories and plots, whereas Javed used to develop the dialogues and occasionally the song-lyrics for those films. They used to brainstorm and come to conclusions regarding the final draft of the film.

[[Rajesh Khanna]] is credited with giving them their first break as script writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More facts about Rajesh Khanna|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-19/news-interviews/32731341_1_rajesh-khanna-consecutive-solo-superhits-record-in-indian-film|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javed Akhtar accepted in an interview that "One day, he (Rajesh Khanna) went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magic of Haathi Mere Saathi|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/features/type/view/id/3718/|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was their first break as script-writers, and the film, ''[[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|Haathi Mere Saathi]],'' went on to become a big hit.
The [[Salim-Javed]] duo were hired by G. P. Sippy to work for Sippy Films as resident screenwriters. They produced the screenplays for several successful films like Andaz, Seeta Aur Geeta, Sholay and Don. Their first big success was the script for ''[[Andaz (1971 film)|Andaz]]'', followed by Adhikar (1971), ''[[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|Haathi Mere Saathi]]'' and ''[[Seeta Aur Geeta]]'' (1972). They also had hits in ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973), ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), Haath Ki Safai (1974), ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), Chacha Bhatija (1977), Don (1978), ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), Dostana (1980), ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), ''[[Zamana (1985 film)|Zamana]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films&amp;nbsp;– [[Premada Kanike]] and [[Raja Nanna Raja]]. Of the 24 films they wrote 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote but which were not successful at box office include Aakhri Dao (1975), Immaan Dharam (1977), Kaala Patthar (1979) and Shaan (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into films later like ''Zamana'' and ''Mr. India'' which became successful. Salim-Javed, many a time described as "the most successful scriptwriters of all-time",&lt;ref&gt;Sholay, through the eyes of Salim Khan, ''[http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-salim-khan/20120228.htm]'', Rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt; are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] to achieve star status.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia of Hindi cinema"/&gt;

The Salim-Javed duo were also notable for causing several changed to be made in the way scriptwriters were perceived and treated within the Hindi film industry. Until the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same people write screenplay, story and dialogue. Nor were writers usually named in the credits of the film; junior, struggling writers in particular were simply paid and sent away. Salim-Javed changed this situation. Since their scripts were so successful, they had the power to make demands on film-makers. They not only insisted on being paid much more than what had been the norm until then, but also ensured that their name was on the film credits, and also that they were involved at many stages of the process, including screenplay and dialogues.

While credited under the name "Salim-Javed", the screenplay of ''Zanjeer'' was almost entirely written by Salim Khan alone, before bringing Javed Akhtar on board and crediting it under the name "Salim-Javed".&lt;ref name="timesofindia"/&gt; Salim Khan was also instrumental in launching the career of [[Amitabh Bachchan]],&lt;ref name="timesofindia"/&gt; who was a struggling actor before being discovered by Salim-Javed, who were impressed by his acting abilities and insisted on casting him in the lead roles for their films.&lt;ref name="indianexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title=Revisiting Prakash Mehra’s Zanjeer: The film that made Amitabh Bachchan|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/revisiting-prakash-mehra-zanjeer-the-film-that-made-amitabh-bachchan-4714064/|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Deewaar was the perfect script: Amitabh Bachchan on 42 years of the cult film|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/deewaar-was-the-perfect-script-amitabh-bachchan-on-42-years-of-the-cult-film/story-x2hy87zQ0ebVlsVMV59U2I.html|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=29 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salim Khan was also personally responsible for introducing Bachchan to directors such as [[Prakash Mehra]] and [[Manmohan Desai]].&lt;ref name="timesofindia"/&gt;

===Later years (1983–2003)===
Salim Khan, after splitting, from Javed wrote script and dialogues for successful movies like ''[[Angaaray (1986 film)|Angaaray]]'' (1986), ''[[Naam (1986 film)|Naam]]'' (1986), ''[[Kabzaa]]'' (1988) and ''[[Jurm (1990 film)|Jurm]]'' (1990). For ''Angaaray'', Rajesh Khanna asked director Rajesh Sethi to go to Salim Khan and rework on the script he had.

Salim was not very active in films from 1996 as the fold he wrote like Akayla, Toofan and others between 1988 and 1996 flopped. He wrote scripts for thirteen films from 1983 to 1996, after his split with Javed Akhthar. These included ''Majdhaar'' and the hit film ''[[Patthar Ke Phool]]'' which starred his son [[Salman Khan]]. Other notable hits were the scripts for ''[[Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1998 film)|Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya]]'' and ''[[Auzaar]],'' both of which were produced by his youngest son [[Sohail Khan]] and starred Salman.

His last unofficial partnership with Javed Akhtar was for the film ''[[Baghban (film)|Baghban]]'' (2003). Amitabh Bachchan requested to Javed Akhtar to write his final speech. Salman Khan, for his speech prior to that, requested to his father Salim Khan to write his speech. However, neither Salim Khan nor Javed Akhtar were credited.&lt;ref name="Chaudhuri595"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=Diptakirti|title=Bollybook: The Big Book of Hindi Movie Trivia|date=2014|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|isbn=9789351187998|page=595|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gq-CBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT595|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greg gets 59m high score in Solipskier.webm|thumb|300px|A video of a player scoring in ''[[Solipskier]]'']]
In [[game]]s, '''score''' refers to an abstract quantity associated with a player or team.  Score is usually measured in the abstract unit of points, and events in the game can raise or lower the score of different parties. Most games with score use it as a quantitative indicator of success in the game, and in competitive games, a goal is often made of attaining a better score than one's opponents in order to win.

==Video games==
In [[video games]] that features scoring, points are usually optional, side component of gaming. Players may achieve points through normal gameplay, but their score will often not have an immediate relevance to the game itself. Instead, playing to beat a "high score" set by the game program, another player or oneself becomes an extra challenge, adding [[replay value]].

In modern gaming, the presence of a score is not as ubiquitous as it was in the past. During the era of [[arcade games]], when, because of the technical limitations of the time, games could not be "won" or "completed" but were instead endless cycles of continuous [[gameplay]], points had a much greater relevance. Many modern games no longer keep track of scores, and many no longer feature an option to save or record high scores. However, some games, such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing games]], have [[experience point]]s, [[skill point]]s, and use [[Virtual economy|money or treasure]], which can all be used to buy or [[Glossary of video game terms#U|upgrade]] skills and objects.

In [[fighting game]]s, scoring a very high number of points could result in [[unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] players or modes. In some games, reaching certain scores gives an [[extra life]], or a [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#Continue|continue]].

===Scoring===
In puzzle games, scores are usually gained by solving the puzzles quickly. Higher scores can be gained by performing combos of puzzle solving. There is often a time bonus which can add extra points. The level number is often a multiplier on the points, so higher scores are possible on harder levels. Level multipliers can also be picked up in some games, to further multiply your points bonus.

In other games, points are typically gained from defeating monsters and enemies. When defeating a [[Boss (video games)|boss]], a proportionally large number of points is usually rewarded. Extra points can be gained from gathering [[item (gaming)|items]], such as power-ups or other pick-ups.

Usually, when a player gets a certain number of points, they may get an [[1-up|extra life]] or go on to a [[Experience level|higher level]]. Points can be often used as currency which can be redeemed for rewards and player upgrades.

===High score===
The '''high score''' of a [[video game]] is usually the highest logged point value. Many games will have a list of several high scores, called the '''high score table.'''

==History==
[[File:Seawolfscreenshot.png|right|thumb|''[[Sea Wolf (video game)|Sea Wolf]]'', the first video game to use the term "high score".]]

The concept of a high score first achieved cultural significance with the rise in popularity of [[pinball]] machines and [[Arcade game#Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical]] [[arcade game]]s. Players who achieve a high score are often greeted with a congratulatory message and are able to enter their [[initials]] or name into the machine. Their score and name will remain there until someone "knocks" them off the high score list by achieving a higher score. For this reason, high scores are inherently competitive and may sometimes involve [[one-upmanship]] against other players.

The high score has a close association to the "free game."  When in an arcade, many games will offer a player a free chance at another game if they achieve a high score.  This has declined in popularity in recent years, as players are often allowed to play for as long as they can without losing, but not given free games even if they achieve a high score.

The first video game to use the term "high score" was [[Midway Games|Midway]]'s ''[[Sea Wolf (video game)|Sea Wolf]]'' (1976). In these early video games, the player would attempt to reach a pre-determined high score within an allotted time period, after which they would win bonus playing time, since it was not possible to save the top score.&lt;ref name="Symonds"/&gt; Though the term "high score" was not used, the concept of reaching pre-determined scores to win bonus playing time was featured in earlier arcade video games such as [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s [[Racing video game|racing game]] ''[[Speed Race]]'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{KLOV game|9709|Speed Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high score concept changed in 1978 with the release of [[Taito]]'s [[shoot 'em up]] ''[[Space Invaders]]'', where high scores were determined by gamers playing for as long as they could to stay alive, as high scores kept rising.&lt;ref name="Symonds"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Face of Winning in Video Games|author=Shannon Symonds|date=2010-11-19|publisher=[[International Center for the History of Electronic Games]]|url=http://www.icheg.org/blog/chegheads/2010/11/the-changing-face-of-winning-in-video-games/|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible due to being the first game to [[Saved game|save]] the player's score.&lt;ref name="IGN-10"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://games.ign.com/articles/840/840621p1.html| title = IGN's Top 10 Most Influential Games| publisher = IGN| author = Geddes, Ryan|author2=Hatfield, Daemon | date = 2007-12-10| accessdate = 2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astounding popularity of ''Space Invaders'' stemmed from players returning to beat the current high scores, as players could now compete with each other over who had the highest score.&lt;ref name="Symonds"/&gt; In 1979, ''[[Space Invaders Part II]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Definitive Space Invaders|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/894697/the_definitive_space_invaders_part_1.html|work=NowGamer|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Star Fire]]'' allowed players to enter initials next to their score.&lt;ref name="Symonds"/&gt; Since this data was stored in the machine's [[Random access memory|RAM]], it was deleted every time the machine lost power, which in practice would almost invariably happen every night as operators preferred to leave the machines unplugged when the arcade was closed to avoid incurring unnecessary power costs.

The popularity of the high score has made it nearly ubiquitous among modern video games, become a defining feature for many games. [[video game magazine|Magazines]] such as [[Nintendo Power]] and [[Sega Visions]] would often publish high scores submitted by their readers. The high score became most popular when, starting in 1982, the [[Twin Galaxies]] Scoreboard began to appear in the pages of Video Games Magazine, Joystik Magazine, Computer Games Magazine, VideoGiochi Magazine, Video Games Player Magazine and Electronic Fun Magazine. Later, in the 1990s, all performances would have to be [[videotape]]d to verify the achievement.

The high score also exists in online games in various forms. The spread of the Internet has made it possible to compete with the rest of the world, rather than the players of a single machine or game. Many modern games have the ability to post his/her high score to a central webpage. Online multiplayer games, especially [[first-person shooter|first person shooters]], [[real-time strategy|real time strategies]], and [[role-playing video game]]s often have [[rank up|ranking systems]]. These new high score lists and ranking systems often are more complex than conventional high score lists. Some are based on tournaments, while others track game servers continuously, keeping statistics for all players.

Some games include default "high scores" that do not actually represent real players, but are displayed whenever the machine's memory is reset, often with generic initials such as "AAA."  These scores often represent certain levels of achievement for a player to aspire to, ensuring that there is always something for players to compete with. Many video games also have default high scores built in, sometimes attributed to fictitious entities (e.g. ''[[Commander Keen]]'') or to members of the game's development team.

==In popular culture==
The high score's prominence in video game culture, and even mainstream society has led to various pieces of art and entertainment.  There is a [[cartoon]] titled ''[[High Score (webtoon)|High Score]]''. There is also a [[book]] entitled ''[[High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games]]''. A 2007 documentary, ''[[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'', follows the attempts to beat the high score in ''Donkey Kong''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In [[The Frogger|an episode]] of the [[television program|TV series]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'', George is astonished to find that the ''[[Frogger]]'' machine he played as a teen still retains his high score. With the owners wanting to get rid of it, George decides to keep the machine for posterity, the catch being that he has to move the game without unplugging it, because if he unplugs the game the high score will be erased. Unfortunately, the machine is destroyed when he unsuccessfully tries to move it across the street in a [[Parody|spoof]] of the [[gameplay]].

On September 24, 2005, Twin Galaxies issued Poster #59, which publicized a $1,000 prize to the first gamer who could break George Costanza's fictitious Frogger high score of 863,050 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/images/generalinfo/poster_frogger_reward_600.jpg Twin Galaxies'  Poster #59, September 24, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021155526/http://www.twingalaxies.com/images/generalinfo/poster_frogger_reward_600.jpg |date=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1982, the [[Twin Galaxies]] Intergalactic Scoreboard issued a colorful poster that listed the world record high scores for more than two dozen arcade video games. The poster was distributed among arcades worldwide. This was the first poster (#1) in a series of colorful posters that continues today, with poster #131 issued in October, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1191 Twin Galaxies' Tradition of Video Game Posters, 1982-2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328112858/http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=19&amp;id=1191 |date=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of ''[[Friends]]'' Chandler Bing puts in dirty words on all the high score positions on a PacMan machine. He then finds out that they are not blanked when the machine is reset so he has to break all his high scores to remove the offending words. (This is not possible on an actual PacMan machine; such machines only record one high score and do not allow the winning player to enter initials.) {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==In the media==
According to the [[Twin Galaxies]] Intergalactic Scoreboard, "high-score" attempts enjoyed as much press coverage as any other video-game-related topic reported in the media during the 1982-1985 period. Though the media was often focused on the amazing growth of the video game industry, it was equally as fascinated with the human side of gaming, as typified by the "player vs machine" showdowns that led to new world record high scores set on nearly a daily basis. In fact, Twin Galaxies reports that during that early era it was not unusual for there to be multiple new world records reported in the media on a single day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The '''Vangelo''' is a high rank within the [['Ndrangheta]], a criminal organisation in [[Calabria]] ([[Italy]]). Vangelo literally means '''Gospel'''&lt;ref&gt;Vangelo derives from the Greek word evagelio (ευαγγελιο) or its more popular rendition vangelio (βαγγελιο)&lt;/ref&gt; and a member is called a ''vangelista'' (plural: ''vangelisti''). The rank was established around 1978, when the rank of ''santista'' (a member of [[La Santa]]) became inflated because the original membership of 33 expanded.&lt;ref name=paoli114&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', pp. 114-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The grade was revealed by the historical [[pentito]] of the 'Ndrangheta [[Pino Scriva]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929031031/http://www.fondazionecesar.it/uploads/tx_useregidoc/Ndrangheta.pdf 'Ndrangheta 2005], Nisio Palmieri, Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell’Associazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''vangelisti'' are “superior personalities who know the rights and obligations of the honoured society with decision-making duties at the highest level,” according to the pentito [[Francesco Fonti]].&lt;ref name=palmieri/&gt;&lt;ref name=gratteri74&gt;{{it icon}} Gratteri &amp; Nicaso, ''Fratelli di Sangue'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The referential religious figures are all the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] and [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], while the historical figures are [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] as the founder and promoter of secret societies in general, and [[Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]] representing the mind of a statesman.&lt;ref name=palmieri/&gt; 

Later, the rank of ''vangelista'' was followed by the institution of the position of ''[[trequartino]]'' (three-quarters) or ''quintino'' (fifth). Finally, the current highest rank of ''[[associazione]]'' (society) was established – reserved for the supreme bosses of the 'Ndrangheta.&lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt; 

Important ''vangelista'' were [[Giuseppe Muià]] from [[Siderno]], [[Domenico Martino]], [[Sebastiano Romeo]], [[Antonio Pelle]] and members from the Nirta family from [[San Luca]].&lt;ref name="gratteri74"/&gt;

'''Vietnamese''' ({{lang|vi|tiếng Việt}}) is an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] that originated in [[Vietnam]], where it is the [[national language|national]] and [[official language]]. It is the [[native language]] of the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]], as well as a [[first language|first]] or [[second language|second]] language for the many [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minorities of Vietnam]]. As a result of [[overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese emigration]] and cultural influence, Vietnamese speakers are found throughout the world, notably in East and Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and Western Europe. Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the [[Czech Republic]].

Vietnamese is the Austroasiatic language with by far the most speakers, several times as many as the rest of the family combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=austroasiatic+languages+number+speakers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qRcBVPyJHsj3iwKBnICQAw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=austroasiatic%20languages%20number%20speakers&amp;f=false|title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook|pages=264|author=George van Driem|year=2001|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|quote=Of the approximately 90 millions speakers of Austroasiatic languages, over 70 million speak Vietnamese, nearly ten million speak Khmer and roughly five million speak Santali.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vocabulary has borrowings from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and it formerly used a modified set of [[Chinese characters]] called [[chữ nôm]] given vernacular pronunciation. The [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (chữ quốc ngữ) in use today is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] with additional [[diacritic]]s for [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] and certain letters.

==Geographic distribution==
As a national language, Vietnamese is the official language used by everyone in Vietnam. It is similar to Yue Yu (越语) spoken by the [[Gin people|Gin]] in southern [[Guangxi|Guangxi Province]] in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China |given=Linda |surname=Tsung |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4411-4235-1 |page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the language spoken by the Gin is unintelligible to Vietnamese, although they share many similarities. A significant number of native speakers also reside in neighboring [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Cambodia]] and [[Vietnamese people in Laos|Laos]].

In the United States, Vietnamese is the fifth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are concentrated in a handful of states. It is the third most spoken language in Texas and Washington; fourth in Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia; and fifth in Arkansas and California.&lt;ref name="Language Map Data Center"&gt;{{Citation| url=https://apps.mla.org/map_data| title=MLA Language Map Data Center| work=MLA Language Map Data Center| publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese is the seventh most spoken language in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2098.html#as CIA World factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, it is the most spoken Asian language and the eighth most spoken immigrant language at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ined.fr/fichier/t_publication/65/publi_pdf1_pop_et_soc_francais_376.pdf La dynamique des langues en France au fil du XXe siècle] Insee, enquête Famille 1999. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official status===
Vietnamese is the sole official and national language of Vietnam. It is the first language of the majority of the Vietnamese population, as well as a first or second language for the country's [[ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority groups]].
&lt;ref name="Vietnamese language"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Czech Republic]], Vietnamese has been recognized as one of 14 minority languages, on the basis of communities that have resided in the country either traditionally or on a long-term basis.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.vlada.cz/en/pracovni-a-poradni-organy-vlady/rnm/historie-a-soucasnost-rady-en-16666/ Government Council for National Minorities], Belorussian and Vietnamese since 4 July 2013, see [http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vietnamci-oficialni-narodnostni-mensinou-fiq-/domaci.aspx?c=A130703_133019_domaci_jj Česko má nové oficiální národnostní menšiny. Vietnamce a Bělorusy]&lt;/ref&gt; This status grants Czech citizens from the [[Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic|Vietnamese community]] the right to use Vietnamese with public authorities and at courts anywhere in the country. Moreover, it also grants the use of Vietnamese in public signage, election information, cultural institutions, and access to legal information and assistance in municipalities where at least 10% of the population is of the minority group.

===As a foreign language===
Vietnamese is increasingly being taught in schools and institutions outside of Vietnam. In countries with strongly established Vietnamese-speaking communities such as Australia, Canada, France, and the United States, Vietnamese language education largely serves as a cultural role to link descendants of Vietnamese immigrants to their ancestral culture. Meanwhile, in countries near Vietnam such as Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, and Thailand, the increased role of Vietnamese in foreign language education is largely due to the growth and influence of Vietnam's economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&amp;a=3 More Thai Students Interested in Learning ASEAN Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110064409/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&amp;a=3 |date=2015-01-10 }}.

Since the 1980s, Vietnamese language schools ({{lang|vi|trường Việt ngữ}}) have been established for youth in many Vietnamese-speaking communities around the world, notably [[Vietnamese American|in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnamese in the United States|editor1-first=Angie|editor1-last=Nguyen|editor2-first=Lien|editor2-last=Dao|publisher=[[California State Library]]|date=May 18, 2007|page=82|accessdate=January 10, 2015|url=http://www.library.ca.gov/services/docs/vietnamese.pdf|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200121/http://www.library.ca.gov/services/docs/vietnamese.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Vietnamese Immigration|first=Ha|last=Lam|work=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|editor-first=Josué M.|editor-last=González|location=Thousand Oaks, California|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|year=2008|pages=884–887|isbn=978-1-4129-3720-7|url=//books.google.com/books?id=c_5yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic and stronger trade and diplomatic relations with Vietnam and a growing interest among the [[Vietnamese people in France|French Vietnamese]] population (one of France's most established non-European ethnic groups) of their ancestral culture have also led to an increasing number of institutions in France, including universities, to offer formal courses in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Blanc|first=Marie-Eve|contribution=Vietnamese in France|editor-last=Ember|editor-first=Carol|title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World|pages=1162|publisher=Springer|publication-date=2004|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC&amp;pg=PA1162|isbn=978-0-306-48321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, the [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese German]] community has enlisted the support of city governments to bring Vietnamese into high school curricula for the purpose of teaching and reminding Vietnamese German students of their mother-tongue. Furthermore, there has also been a number of Germans studying Vietnamese due to increased economic investment in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vietteachlearnoverwhelminggermany" &gt;[http://www.vietnambreakingnews.com/2013/09/vietnamese-teaching-and-learning-overwhelming-germany/ Vietnamese teaching and learning overwhelming Germany].

==Linguistic classification==
Vietnamese was identified more than 150 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Mon–Khmer languages: The Vietic branch
  | publisher = SEAlang Projects
  | url = http://sealang.net/mk/vietic-intro.htm
  | accessdate =November 8, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]] (a family that also includes [[Khmer language|Khmer]], spoken in [[Cambodia]], as well as various tribal and [[regional language]]s, such as the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Khasi language|Khasi]] languages spoken in eastern India, and others in southern China). Later, [[Muong language|Muong]] was found to be more closely related to Vietnamese than other Mon–Khmer languages, and a Viet–Muong subgrouping was established, also including [[Thavung language|Thavung]], [[Chut language|Chut]], [[Cuoi language|Cuoi]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus, Michel. 1996. Langues et peuples viet-muong. Mon-Khmer Studies 26. 7–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Vietic" was proposed by Hayes (1992),&lt;ref name = "Hayes"&gt;Hayes, La Vaughn H. (1992). "Vietic and Việt-Mường: a new subgrouping in Mon-Khmer". ''Mon-Khmer Studies'' '''21''', 211–228.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed to redefine Viet–Muong as referring to a subbranch of Vietic containing only Vietnamese and [[Muong language|Muong]]. The term "[[Vietic languages|Vietic]]" is used, among others, by [[Gérard Diffloth]], with a slightly different proposal on subclassification, within which the term "Viet–Muong" refers to a lower subgrouping (within an eastern Vietic branch) consisting of Vietnamese dialects, Muong dialects, and [[Nguồn language|Nguồn]] (of [[Quảng Bình Province]]).&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth, Gérard. (1992). "Vietnamese as a Mon-Khmer language". ''Papers from the First Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'', 125–128. Tempe, Arizona: Program for Southeast Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicon==
&lt;!--
* Note: mention the two layers of Chinese borrowings at different time periods
* mention other languages (with examples)
--&gt;
As a result of [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|1000 years of Chinese rule]], much of the Vietnamese [[lexicon]] relating to science and politics is derived from Chinese — see [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]]. Some 30% to 60% of the lexical stock has naturalized word borrowings from Chinese, although many compound words are composed of native Vietnamese words combined with naturalized word borrowings (i.e. having Vietnamese pronunciation).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As a result of French occupation, Vietnamese has since had many words borrowed from the French language, for example {{lang|vi|cà phê}} (from French {{lang|fr|café}}). Nowadays, many new words are being added to the language's lexicon due to heavy Western cultural influence; these are usually borrowed from English, for example TV (though usually seen in the written form as {{lang|vi|tivi}}). Sometimes these borrowings are [[calque]]s literally translated into Vietnamese (for example, ''software'' is calqued into {{lang|vi|phần mềm}}, which literally means "soft part"). Some borrowings nowadays, usually names, are multi-syllabic, for example, {{lang|vi|Campuchia}} ([[Cambodia]]).

===Similes===
Vietnamese has two types of similes: Meaning Similes and Rhyming Similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

: {{lang|vi|'''Nghèo''' như con '''mèo'''}}
: {{IPA-vi|ŋɛ̀w ɲɨ̄ kɔ̄n mɛ̀w|}}
: "Poor as a cat"

Compare the above rhyming Vietnamese example to the English phrase "(as) drunk as a skunk", which is also a rhyming simile, and "(as) poor as a church mouse", which is only semantic.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 98 in Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012), "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nguyen_Thuy_Nga3/publication/301812363_Stupid_as_a_Coin_Meaning_and_rhyming_similes_in_Vietnamese/links/57296bc208aef7c7e2c0d500.pdf Stupid as a Coin: Meaning and Rhyming Similes in Vietnamese]", ''International Journal of Language Studies'' '''6'''(4), 97–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
{{Main|Vietnamese phonology}}

===Vowels===
Like other Southeast Asian languages, Vietnamese has a comparatively large number of [[vowel]]s. 

Below is a [[vowel diagram]] of Hanoi Vietnamese (including [[centering diphthong]]s):

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! &amp;nbsp;
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[Centering diphthong|Centering]]
| ''ia~iê'' {{IPA|[iə̯]}}
| ''ưa~ươ'' {{IPA|[ɨə̯]}}
| ''ua~uô'' {{IPA|[uə̯]}}
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| ''i/y'' {{IPA|[i]}}
| ''ư'' {{IPA|[ɨ]}}
| ''u'' {{IPA|[u]}}
|-
! [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]/&lt;br&gt;[[Mid vowel|Mid]]
|''ê'' {{IPA|[e]}}

| ''ô'' {{IPA|[o]}}
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]/&lt;br&gt;[[Open vowel|Open]]
|''e'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}}
| ''a'' {{IPA|[aː]}}&lt;br&gt;''ă'' {{IPA|[a]}}
| ''o'' {{IPA|[ɔ]}}
|}

Front and central vowels (''i'', ''ê'', ''e'', ''ư'', ''â'', ''ơ'', ''ă'', ''a'') are [[Roundedness|unrounded]], whereas the back vowels (''u'', ''ô'', ''o'') are rounded. The vowels ''â'' {{IPA|[ə]}} and ''ă'' {{IPA|[a]}} are pronounced very short, much shorter than the other vowels. Thus, ''ơ'' and ''â'' are basically pronounced the same except that ''ơ'' {{IPA|[əː]}} is of normal length while ''â'' {{IPA|[ə]}} is short – the same applies to the vowels long ''a'' {{IPA|[aː]}} and short ''ă'' {{IPA|[a]}}.&lt;ref&gt;There are different descriptions of Hanoi vowels. Another common description is that of Thompson (1965):

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! rowspan="2" |
! rowspan="2" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! rowspan="2" | [[Central vowel|Central]]
! colspan="2" | [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! unrounded
! rounded
|-
! [[Centering diphthong|Centering]]
| ''ia~iê'' {{IPA|[iə̯]}}
|
| ''ưa~ươ'' {{IPA|[ɯə̯]}}
| ''ua~uô'' {{IPA|[uə̯]}}
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| ''i'' {{IPA|[i]}}
|
| ''ư'' {{IPA|[ɯ]}}
| ''u'' {{IPA|[u]}}
|-
! [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]
| ''ê'' {{IPA|[e]}}
|
| ''ơ'' {{IPA|[ɤ]}}
| ''ô'' {{IPA|[o]}}
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
| ''e'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}}
| ''ă'' {{IPA|[ɐ]}}
| ''â'' {{IPA|[ʌ]}}
| ''o'' {{IPA|[ɔ]}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| ''a'' {{IPA|[a]}}
| colspan="2" |
|}

This description distinguishes four degrees of vowel height and a rounding contrast (rounded vs. unrounded) between back vowels. The relative shortness of ''ă'' and ''â'' would then be a secondary feature. Thompson describes the vowel ''ă'' {{IPA|[ɐ]}} as being slightly higher ([[Near-open vowel|upper low]]) than ''a'' {{IPA|[a]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centering diphthongs are formed with only the three high vowels (''i'', ''ư'', ''u''). They are generally spelled as ''ia'', ''ưa'', ''ua'' when they end a word and are spelled ''iê'', ''ươ'', ''uô'', respectively, when they are followed by a consonant.

In addition to single vowels (or [[monophthong]]s) and centering diphthongs, Vietnamese has closing [[diphthong]]s&lt;ref&gt;In Vietnamese, diphthongs are ''âm đôi''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[triphthong]]s. The closing diphthongs and triphthongs consist of a main vowel component followed by a shorter semivowel [[offglide]] {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}.&lt;ref&gt;The closing diphthongs and triphthongs as described by Thompson can be compared with the description above:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

| ''uôi'' {{IPA|[uə̯j]}}
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| ''iu'' {{IPA|[iw]}}
| ''ưu'' {{IPA|[ɯw]}}

|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Open-mid]]
| ''eo'' {{IPA|[ɛw]}}
| ''oi'' {{IPA|[ɔj]}}
|-

| ''ai'' {{IPA|[aj]}}&lt;br&gt;''ay'' {{IPA|[ɐj]}}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
&lt;/ref&gt; There are restrictions on the high offglides: {{IPA|/j/}} cannot occur after a front vowel (''i'', ''ê'', ''e'') nucleus and {{IPA|/w/}} cannot occur after a back vowel (''u'', ''ô'', ''o'') nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;The lack of diphthong consisting of a ''ơ'' + back offglide (i.e., {{IPA|[əːw]}}) is an apparent gap.&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''ai'' {{IPA|[aːj]}}&lt;br&gt;''ay'' {{IPA|[aj]}}
| ''oi'' {{IPA|[ɔj]}}
|}

The correspondence between the orthography and pronunciation is complicated. For example, the offglide {{IPA|/j/}} is usually written as ''i''; however, it may also be represented with ''y''. In addition, in the diphthongs {{IPA|[āj]}} and {{IPA|[āːj]}} the letters ''y'' and ''i'' also indicate the pronunciation of the main vowel: ''ay'' = ''ă'' + {{IPA|/j/}}, ''ai'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/j/}}. Thus, ''tay'' "hand" is {{IPA|[tāj]}} while ''tai'' "ear" is {{IPA|[tāːj]}}. Similarly, ''u'' and ''o'' indicate different pronunciations of the main vowel: ''au'' = ''ă'' + {{IPA|/w/}}, ''ao'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/w/}}. Thus, ''thau'' "brass" is {{IPA|[tʰāw]}} while ''thao'' "raw silk" is {{IPA|[tʰāːw]}}.

Some consonant sounds are written with only one letter (like "p"), other consonant sounds are written with a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] (like "ph"), and others are written with more than one letter or digraph (the velar stop is written variously as "c", "k", or "q").

Not all dialects of Vietnamese have the same consonant in a given word (although all dialects use the same spelling in the written language). See the [[#Language variation|language variation section]] for further elaboration.

The analysis of syllable-final orthographic ''ch'' and ''nh'' in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis has final ''ch'', ''nh'' as being phonemes {{IPA|/c/, /ɲ/}} contrasting with syllable-final ''t'', ''c'' {{IPA|/t/, /k/}} and ''n'', ''ng'' {{IPA|/n/, /ŋ/}} and identifies final ''ch'' with the syllable-initial ''ch'' {{IPA|/c/}}. The other analysis has final ''ch'' and ''nh'' as predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} that occur after the upper front vowels ''i'' {{IPA|/i/}} and ''ê'' {{IPA|/e/}}; although they also occur after ''a'', but in such cases are believed to have resulted from an earlier ''e'' {{IPA|/ɛ/}} which diphthongized to ''ai'' (cf. ''ach'' from ''aic'', ''anh'' from ''aing''). (See [[Vietnamese phonology#Analysis of final ch.2C nh|Vietnamese phonology: Analysis of final ''ch'', ''nh'']] for further details.)

===Tones===
[[File:VietnameseToneNorthern.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Pitch contours and duration of the six Northern Vietnamese tones as spoken by a male speaker (not from Hanoi). [[Fundamental frequency]] is plotted over time. From Nguyễn &amp; Edmondson (1998).]]

Each Vietnamese syllable is pronounced with an inherent [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]],&lt;ref&gt;Called {{lang|vi|thanh điệu}} or ''thanh'' in Vietnamese&lt;/ref&gt; centered on the main vowel or group of vowels. Tones differ in:
* length (duration)
* [[pitch contour]] (i.e. pitch melody)
* pitch height
* [[phonation]]

Tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel (most of the tone diacritics appear above the vowel; however, the ''nặng'' tone dot diacritic goes below the vowel).&lt;ref&gt;Note that the name of each tone has the corresponding tonal diacritic on the vowel.&lt;/ref&gt; The six tones in the northern varieties (including Hanoi), with their self-referential Vietnamese names, are:

{| class="wikitable"

| align="center" | '''&amp;nbsp;̣''' ([[dot (diacritic)|dot below]])
| ''mạ'' &amp;nbsp;'rice seedling'
| align="center" | {{Audio|Vi nang tone.ogg|ạ}}
|}

Other dialects of Vietnamese have fewer tones (typically only five).

In Vietnamese poetry, tones are classed into two groups:

{| class="wikitable"
! Tone group
! Tones within tone group
|-
| ''bằng'' "level, flat"
| ''ngang'' and ''huyền''
|-
| ''trắc'' "oblique, sharp"
| ''sắc'', ''hỏi'', ''ngã'', and ''nặng''
|}

Words with tones belonging to a particular tone group must occur in certain positions within the poetic verse.

[[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholics]] practice a distinctive style of prayer recitation called {{lang|vi|[[đọc kinh]]}}, in which each tone is assigned a specific note or sequence of notes.

==Language variation==

The Vietnamese language has several [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] regional varieties (or [[dialect]]s). The five main dialects are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Sources on Vietnamese variation include: Alves (forthcoming), Alves &amp; Nguyễn (2007), Emeneau (1947), Hoàng (1989), Honda (2006), Nguyễn, Đ.-H. (1995), Pham (2005), Thompson (1991[1965]), Vũ (1982), Vương (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese has traditionally been divided into three dialect regions: North, Central, and South. However, Michel Ferlus and Nguyễn Tài Cẩn offer evidence for considering a North-Central region separate from Central. The term ''Haut-Annam'' refers to dialects spoken from northern Nghệ An Province to southern (former) Thừa Thiên Province that preserve archaic features (like consonant clusters and undiphthongized vowels) that have been lost in other modern dialects.

These dialect regions differ mostly in their sound systems (see below), but also in vocabulary (including basic vocabulary, non-basic vocabulary, and grammatical words) and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Some differences in [[grammatical word]]s are noted in [[Vietnamese grammar#Demonstratives|Vietnamese grammar: Demonstratives]], [[Vietnamese grammar#Pronouns|Vietnamese grammar: Pronouns]].&lt;/ref&gt; The North-central and Central regional varieties, which have a significant amount of vocabulary differences, are generally less [[mutually intelligible]] to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions due to its relatively late settlement by Vietnamese speakers (in around the end of the 15th century). The North-central region is particularly conservative; its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, while more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for [[sociolinguistic]] attitudes, the North-central varieties are often felt to be "peculiar" or "difficult to understand" by speakers of other dialects, despite the fact that their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; this is typically because of various words in their vocabulary which are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).

The large movements of people between North and South beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing to this day have resulted in a sizeable number of Southern residents speaking in the Northern accent/dialect and, to a greater extent, Northern residents speaking in the Southern accent/dialect. Following the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords of 1954]] that called for the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|temporary division of the country]], about a million northerners (mainly from Hanoi, [[Haiphong]] and the surrounding Red River Delta areas) moved south (mainly to Saigon and heavily to [[Biên Hòa]] and [[Vũng Tàu]], and the surrounding areas) as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]]. About 3% (~30,000) of that number of people made the move in the reverse direction (''Tập kết ra Bắc'', literally "go to the North.)

Following the reunification of Vietnam in 1975–76, Northern and North-Central speakers from the densely populated Red River Delta and the traditionally poorer provinces of Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình have continued to move South to look for better economic opportunities, beginning with the Hanoi government's "New Economic Zones program" which lasted from 1975–85.&lt;ref name=Desbarats&gt;{{cite web|last=Desbarats|first=Jacqueline|title=Repression in the Socialist Republic  of Vietnam:  Executions and Population Relocation|url=http://jim.com/repression.htm|work=Indochina report ; no. 11|publisher=Executive Publications, Singapore 1987|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of the program (1975–80), resulted in 1.3 million people sent to the New Economic Zones (NEZs), majority of which were relocated in the southern half of the country in previously uninhabited areas, of which 550,000 were Northerners.&lt;ref name=Desbarats /&gt; The second half (1981–85) saw almost 1 million Northerners relocated to the NEZs.&lt;ref name=Desbarats /&gt; As well, government and military personnel, many from Northern and north-central Vietnam, are posted to various locations throughout the country, often away from their home regions. More recently, the growth of the free market system has resulted in business people and tourists traveling to distant parts of Vietnam. These movements have resulted in some small blending of the dialects, but more significantly, have made the Northern dialect more easily understood in the South and vice versa. Most Southerners, when singing modern/old popular Vietnamese songs, do so in the Northern accent. This is true in Vietnam as well as in the overseas Vietnamese communities.

The [[syllable]]-initial ''ch'' and ''tr'' digraphs are pronounced distinctly in North-central, Central, and Southern varieties, but are merged in Northern varieties (i.e. they are both pronounced the same way). The North-central varieties preserve three distinct pronunciations for ''d'', ''gi'', and ''r'' whereas the North has a three-way merger and the Central and South have a merger of ''d'' and ''gi'' while keeping ''r'' distinct. At the end of syllables, palatals ''ch'' and ''nh'' have merged with alveolars ''t'' and ''n'', which, in turn, have also partially merged with velars ''c'' and ''ng'' in Central and Southern varieties.

In addition to the regional variation described above, there is also a merger of ''l'' and ''n'' in certain rural varieties:

|-

| rowspan="2" | {{IPA|[n]}}
|-
! ''l''

|}

Variation between ''l'' and ''n'' can be found even in mainstream Vietnamese in certain words. For example, the numeral "five" appears as ''năm'' by itself and in compound numerals like ''năm mươi'' "fifty" but appears as {{lang|vi|lăm}} in {{lang|vi|mười lăm}} "fifteen" (see [[Vietnamese grammar#Cardinal]]). In some northern varieties, this numeral appears with an initial ''nh'' instead of ''l'': {{lang|vi|hai mươi nhăm}} "twenty-five" vs. mainstream {{lang|vi|hai mươi lăm}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gregerson (1981) notes that this variation was present in de Rhodes's time in some initial consonant clusters: ''mlẽ'' ~ ''mnhẽ'' "reason" (cf. modern Vietnamese ''lẽ'' "reason").&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonant clusters that were originally present in Middle Vietnamese (of the 17th century) have been lost in almost all modern Vietnamese varieties (but retained in other closely related [[Vietic languages]]). However, some speech communities have preserved some of these archaic clusters: "sky" is {{lang|vi|blời}} with a cluster in Hảo Nho (Yên Mô prefecture, [[Ninh Bình Province]]) but ''trời'' in Southern Vietnamese and {{lang|vi|giời}} in Hanoi Vietnamese (initial single consonants {{IPA|/ʈ/, /z/}}, respectively).

===Tones===
Generally, the Northern varieties have six tones while those in other regions have five tones. The ''hỏi'' and ''ngã'' tones are distinct in North and some North-central varieties (although often with different [[pitch contour]]s) but have merged in Central, Southern, and some North-central varieties (also with different pitch contours). Some North-central varieties (such as {{lang|vi|Hà Tĩnh}} Vietnamese) have a merger of the ''ngã'' and ''nặng'' tones while keeping the ''hỏi'' tone distinct. Still other North-central varieties have a three-way merger of ''hỏi'', ''ngã'', and ''nặng'' resulting in a four-tone system. In addition, there are several phonetic differences (mostly in pitch contour and [[phonation]] type) in the tones among dialects.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Vietnamese grammar|Vietnamese morphology}}

Vietnamese, like many languages in Southeast Asia, is an [[analytic language|analytic]] language. Vietnamese does not use [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] marking of [[Grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]] or [[grammatical tense|tense]] (and, as a result, has no [[finite verb|finite]]/[[Non-finite verb|nonfinite]] distinction).&lt;ref&gt;
Comparison note: As such its grammar relies on word order and sentence structure rather than morphology (in which word changes through [[inflection]]). Whereas European languages tend to use morphology to express tense, Vietnamese uses [[grammatical particles]] or syntactic constructions.&lt;/ref&gt; Also like other languages in the region, Vietnamese syntax conforms to [[subject–verb–object]] [[word order]], is [[head-initial]] (displaying modified-[[Grammatical modifier|modifier]] ordering), and has a noun [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] system. Additionally, it is [[pro-drop]], [[wh-in-situ]], and allows [[verb serialization]].

==Dates and numbers writing formats==
Vietnameses speak date in the format "[date] [month] [year]". Each month's name is just the ordinal of that month appended after the word ''tháng'', which means "month". Traditional Vietnamese however assigns other names to some months and these names are mostly used in the [[lunar calendar]].

The Vietnamese prefer writing numbers with a comma as the decimal separator, and either spaces or dots to group the digits. An example is 1 629,15 (one thousand six hundred twenty-nine point fifteen). Because a comma is used as the decimal separator, a semicolon is used to separate two numbers instead.

[[File:HoaloHaNoi070720091321.jpg|thumb|A sign at the [[Hỏa Lò Prison]] museum in Hanoi lists rules for visitors in both Vietnamese and English.]]

Up to the late 19th century, two writing systems based on [[Chinese characters]] were used in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Colonialism and language policy in Viet Nam | first = John | last = DeFrancis | authorlink = John DeFrancis | publisher = Mouton | year = 1977 | isbn = 978-90-279-7643-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
All formal writing, including government business, scholarship and formal literature, was done in [[Classical Chinese]] (''chữ nho'' {{vi-nom|𡨸儒}} "scholar's characters").

Folk literature in Vietnamese was recorded using the ''[[chữ Nôm]]'' script, in which many Chinese characters were borrowed and many more modified and invented to represent native Vietnamese words. Created in the 13th century or earlier, the ''Nôm'' writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in Nôm, most notably [[Nguyễn Du]] and [[Hồ Xuân Hương]] (dubbed "the Queen of Nôm poetry").
However it was only used for official purposes during the brief [[Hồ dynasty|Hồ]] and [[Tây Sơn dynasty|Tây Sơn]] dynasties.

A [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholic]], [[Nguyễn Trường Tộ]], sent petitions to the Court which suggested a Chinese character-based syllabary which would be used for Vietnamese sounds; however, his petition failed. The French colonial administration sought to eliminate the Chinese writing system, Confucianism, and other Chinese influences from Vietnam by getting rid of Nôm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David G.|authorlink=David G. Marr|title=Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkcZ_nGkW-oC&amp;pg=PA145|year=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-90744-7|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[romanization]] of Vietnamese was codified in the 17th century by the French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1591–1660), based on works of earlier [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese missionaries]] Gaspar do Amaral and António Barbosa. This [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (''chữ quốc ngữ'' or "national script") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public.
However, the Romanized script did not come to predominate until the beginning of the 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population.
Under [[French Indochina]] colonial rule, French superseded Chinese in administration.
Vietnamese written with the alphabet became required for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French Résident Supérieur of the protectorate of Tonkin. By the middle of the 20th century virtually all writing was done in ''chữ quốc ngữ'', which became the official script on independence. Chữ nho was still in use on early [[North Vietnam]]ese and late [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] banknotes issued after World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/icpaper/p83.html |title=French Indochina 500 Piastres 1951 |website=art-hanoi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/vnpaper/ho5d.html |title=North Vietnam 5 Dong 1946 |website=art-hanoi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but fell out of official use shortly thereafter.
Only a few scholars and some extremely elderly people are able to read ''chữ Nôm'' today. In China, members of the [[Gin people|Jing]] minority still write in chữ Nôm. 

Changes in the script were made by French scholars and administrators and by conferences held after independence during 1954–1974. The script now reflects a so-called ''Middle Vietnamese'' dialect that has vowels and final consonants most similar to northern dialects and initial consonants most similar to southern dialects (Nguyễn 1996). This Middle Vietnamese is presumably close to the Hanoi variety as spoken sometime after 1600 but before the present.  (This is not unlike how [[English orthography]] is based on the Chancery Standard of [[Middle English#Late Middle English|Late Middle English]], with many spellings retained even after the [[Great Vowel Shift]].)

===Computer support===
{{main|Vietnamese language and computers}}

The [[Unicode]] character set contains all Vietnamese characters and the Vietnamese currency symbol. On systems that do not support Unicode, many 8-bit Vietnamese [[code page]]s are available such as [[Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (VSCII) or [[Windows-1258]]. Where [[ASCII]] must be used, Vietnamese letters are often typed using the [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]] convention, though this is largely unnecessary with the increasing ubiquity of Unicode. There are many software tools that help type true Vietnamese text on US keyboards, such as [http://winvnkey.sf.net WinVNKey] and [http://unikey.sf.net Unikey] on Windows, or [http://macvnkey.sf.net MacVNKey] on Macintosh.

==History==

It seems likely that in the distant past, Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and a richer set of [[consonant cluster]]s, which have subsequently disappeared from the language. However, Vietnamese appears to have been heavily influenced by its location in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], with the result that it has acquired or converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and phonemically distinctive [[tonal language|tones]], through processes of [[tonogenesis]]. These characteristics have become part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for example, [[Tsat language|Tsat]] (a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group within [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]), and Vietnamese each developed tones as a phonemic feature.

The ancestor of the Vietnamese language is usually believed to have been originally based in the area of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] in what is now northern Vietnam.  However, Chamberlain argues that the Red River Delta region was originally [[Tai languages|Tai]]-speaking and became Vietnamese-speaking only between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, as a result of immigration from the south, i.&amp;nbsp;e., modern central Vietnam, where the highly distinctive and conservative North-Central Vietnamese dialects are spoken today.  Therefore, the region of origin of Vietnamese (and the earlier Viet–Muong) was well south of the Red River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamberlain|first1=James R.|editor1-last=Burusphat|editor1-first=Somsonge|title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Tai Studies, July 29–31, 1998|date=2000|publisher=Institute of Language and Culture for Rural Development, Mahidol University|location=Bangkok, Thailand|isbn=974-85916-9-7|pages=97–127|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/chamberlain1998origin.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2014|format=PDF|chapter=The origin of the Sek: implications for Tai and Vietnamese history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the ethnonym [[Lao people|Lao]], the name [[Baiyue|Yue/Việt]] originally referred to Tai–Kadai-speaking groups. In northern Vietnam, these later adopted Viet–Muong and further north Chinese varieties, where the designation [[Yue Chinese]] preserves the ethnonym. (Both in Vietnam and southern China, however, many Tai–Kadai languages remain in use.) This explains the fact that the same ethnonym Yue ~ Việt is associated with groups that speak Tai–Kadai, Austroasiatic and Chinese languages, which are typologically similar and share significant amounts of lexicon, but have different origins.

Linguists Sagart (2011) and Bellwood (2013) favour the middle Yangzte, although there is no direct linguistic evidence for this, and the expansion of the phylum in its present form would have to begin further south.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger (2014), ''[http://www.rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/Blench%20AA%20prehistory%20final.pdf Reconstructing Austroasiatic prehistory]''. Chapter in the forthcoming Jenny, M. &amp; P. Sidwell (eds.). forthcoming 2015. Handbook of the Austroasiatic Languages. Leiden: Brill, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive tonal variations emerged during the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into what is now central and southern Vietnam through conquest of the ancient nation of [[Champa]] and the [[Khmer people]] of the [[Mekong Delta]] in the vicinity of present-day [[Ho Chi Minh City]], also known as Saigon.

Vietnamese was primarily influenced by Chinese, which came to predominate politically in the 2nd century BC.  After Vietnam achieved independence in the 10th century, the ruling class adopted [[Classical Chinese]] as the medium of government, scholarship and literature.  With the dominance of Chinese came radical importation of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical influence.  A portion of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese words]] (They comprise about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon, and may account for as much as 60% of the vocabulary used in formal texts.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=8}})

When France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as ''đầm'' (dame, from ''madame''), ''ga'' (train station, from ''gare''), ''sơ mi'' (shirt, from ''chemise''), and ''búp bê'' (doll, from ''poupée''). In addition, many Sino-Vietnamese terms were devised for Western ideas imported through the French.

[[Henri Maspero]] described six periods of the Vietnamese language:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Études sur la phonétique historique de la langue annamite|trans-title=Studies on the phonetic history of the Annamite language|first=Henri|last=Maspero|journal=Bulletin de l'[[École française d'Extrême-Orient]]|year=1912|volume=12|issue=1|page=10|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_1912_num_12_1_2713|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{note|newsounds|1}} According to Ferlus, *{{IPA|/tʃ/}} and *{{IPA|/ʄ/}} are not accepted by all researchers.  Ferlus 1992&lt;ref name="ferlus1992"/&gt; also had additional phonemes *{{IPA|/dʒ/}} and *{{IPA|/ɕ/}}.

{{note|fricative|2}} The fricatives indicated above in parentheses developed as allophones of stop consonants occurring between vowels (i.e. when a [[minor syllable]] occurred).  These fricatives were not present in Proto-Viet–Muong, as indicated by their absence in Muong, but were evidently present in the later Proto-Vietnamese stage.  Subsequent loss of the minor-syllable prefixes phonemicized the fricatives.  Ferlus 1992&lt;ref name="ferlus1992"/&gt; proposes that originally there were both voiced and voiceless fricatives, corresponding to original voiced or voiceless stops, but Ferlus 2009&lt;ref name="ferlus2009"/&gt; appears to have abandoned that hypothesis, suggesting that stops were softened and voiced at approximately the same time, according to the following pattern:
*{{IPA|*p, *b}} &gt; {{IPA|/β/}}
*{{IPA|*t, *d}} &gt; {{IPA|/ð/}}
*{{IPA|*s}} &gt; {{IPA|/r̝/}}
*{{IPA|*c, *ɟ, *tʃ}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʝ/}}
*{{IPA|*k, *ɡ}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɣ/}}

{{note|v|3}} In [[Middle Vietnamese]], the outcome of these sounds was written with a hooked ''b'' ([[File:B with flourish.svg|10px|alt=ȸ|b with flourish]]), representing a {{IPA|/β/}} that was still distinct from ''v'' (then pronounced {{IPA|/w/}}).  See below.

{{note|sigma|4}} It is unclear what this sound was.  According to Ferlus 1992,&lt;ref name="ferlus1992"/&gt; in the Archaic Vietnamese period (c. 10th century AD, when [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] was borrowed) it was *{{IPA|r̝}}, distinct at that time from *{{IPA|r}}.

The following initial clusters occurred, with outcomes indicated:
* *pr, *br, *tr, *dr, *kr, *gr &gt; {{IPA|/kʰr/}} &gt; {{IPA|/kʂ/}} &gt; ''s''
* *pl, *bl &gt; MV ''bl'' &gt; Northern ''gi'', Southern ''tr''
* *kl, *gl &gt; MV ''tl'' &gt; ''tr''
* *ml &gt; MV ''ml'' &gt; ''mnh'' &gt; ''nh''
* *kj &gt; ''gi''

Note also that a large number of words were borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]], forming part of the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].  These caused the original introduction of the retroflex sounds {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ʈ/}} (modern ''s'', ''tr'') into the language.

===Origin of the tones===

Proto-Viet–Muong had no tones to speak of.  The tones later developed in some of the daughter languages from distinctions in the initial and final consonants.  Vietnamese tones developed as follows:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! [[Register (phonology)|Register]]
! Initial consonant
! Smooth ending
! Glottal ending
! Fricative ending
|-
! High (first) register
| Voiceless
| A1 ''ngang'' "level"
| B1 ''sắc'' "sharp"
| C1 ''hỏi'' "asking"
|-
! Low (second) register
| Voiced
| A2 ''huyền'' "hanging"
| B2 ''nặng'' "heavy"
| C2 ''ngã'' "tumbling"
|}

Glottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, while fricative-ending syllables ended with {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}.  Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}).

At some point, a [[tone split]] occurred, as in many other [[Southeast Asian languages]].  Essentially, an [[allophonic]] distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced differently from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced [[allotone]]s were pronounced with additional [[breathy voice]] or [[creaky voice]] and with lowered pitch.  The quality difference predominates in today's northern varieties, e.g. in [[Hanoi]], while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones.  Note that the implosive stops were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior is common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)

As noted above, Proto-Viet–Muong had [[sesquisyllabic]] words with an initial [[minor syllable]] (in addition to, and independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable).  When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's initial consonant was [[intervocalic]] and as a result suffered [[lenition]], becoming a voiced fricative.  The minor syllables were eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred.  As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and not the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Viet–Muong that produced the fricative.  For similar reasons, words beginning with {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976&lt;ref name="thompson1976"/&gt; reconstructed voiceless resonants to account for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at least by Ferlus.)

===Middle Vietnamese===
The writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] for his 1651 ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]''. It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that time, a stage commonly termed ''Middle Vietnamese'' ({{lang|vi|tiếng Việt trung đại}}).  The pronunciation of the "rime" of the syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional {{IPA|/w/}} glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation.  On the other hand, the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in fact is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.

The following diagram shows the orthography and pronunciation of Middle Vietnamese:

It has a rounded hook that starts halfway up the left side (where the top of the curved part of the b meets the vertical, straight part) and curves about 180 degrees counterclockwise, ending below the bottom-left corner.&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|yod|3}} {{IPA|[j]}} does not occur at the beginning of a syllable, but can occur at the end of a syllable, where it is notated ''i'' or ''y'' (with the difference between the two often indicating differences in the quality or length of the preceding vowel), and after {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{IPA|/β/}}, where it is notated ''ĕ''.  This ''ĕ'', and the {{IPA|/j/}} it notated, have disappeared from the modern language.

Note that ''b'' {{IPA|[ɓ]}} and ''p'' {{IPA|[p]}} never contrast in any position, suggesting that they are allophones.

The language also has three clusters at the beginning of syllables, which have since disappeared:

*''tl'' {{IPA|/tl/}} &gt; modern ''tr''
*''bl'' {{IPA|/ɓl/}} &gt; modern ''gi'' (Northern), ''tr'' (Southern)
*''ml'' {{IPA|/ml/}} &gt; ''mnh'' {{IPA|/mɲ/}} &gt; modern ''nh''

Most of the unusual correspondences between spelling and modern pronunciation are explained by Middle Vietnamese.  Note in particular:
*de Rhodes' system has two different b letters, a regular b and a "hooked" b in which the upper section of the curved part of the b extends leftward past the vertical bar and curls down again in a semicircle.  This apparently represented a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/β/}}.  Within a century or so, both {{IPA|/β/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} had merged as {{IPA|/v/}}, spelled as ''v''.
*de Rhodes' system has a second medial glide {{IPA|/j/}} that is written ''ĕ'' and appears in some words with initial ''d'' and hooked ''b''.  These later disappear.
*''đ'' {{IPA|/ɗ/}} was (and still is) [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], whereas ''d'' {{IPA|/ð/}} was dental.  The choice of symbols was based on the dental rather than alveolar nature of {{IPA|/d/}} and its [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ð]}} in Spanish and other Romance languages.  The inconsistency with the symbols assigned to {{IPA|/ɓ/}} vs. {{IPA|/β/}} was based on the lack of any such place distinction between the two, with the result that the [[stop consonant]] {{IPA|/ɓ/}} appeared more "normal" than the fricative {{IPA|/β/}}.  In both cases, the [[implosive consonant|implosive]] nature of the stops does not appear to have had any role in the choice of symbol.
*''x'' was the [[alveolo-palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɕ/}} rather than the [[dental fricative|dental]] {{IPA|/s/}} of the modern language.  In 17th-century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the common language of the Jesuits, ''s'' was the [[voiceless alveolar fricative|apico-alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s̺/}} (as still in much of Spain and some parts of Portugal), while ''x'' was a [[Palato-alveolar consonant|palatoalveolar]] {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.  The similarity of apicoalveolar {{IPA|/s̺/}} to the Vietnamese [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|/ʂ/}} led to the assignment of ''s'' and ''x'' as above.

[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, breve acute apex.png|thumb|right|de Rhodes's entry for {{lang|vi|dĕóu᷄}} shows distinct [[breve]]s, [[acute accent|acutes]] and [[apex (diacritic)|apices]].]]
De Rhodes's orthography also made use of an [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] diacritic to indicate a final [[labial-velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ͡m/}}, an allophone of {{IPA|/ŋ/}} that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. This diacritic is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.

==Word play==
A [[language game]] known as ''[[nói lái]]'' is used by Vietnamese speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn Đ.-H. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nói lái'' involves switching the tones in a pair of words and also the order of the two words or the first consonant and [[Syllable rime|rime]] of each word; the resulting ''nói lái'' pair preserves the original sequence of tones. Some examples:

:{| class="wikitable"
! Original phrase !! !! Phrase after ''nói lái'' transformation !! Structural change
|-
| ''đái dầm'' "(child) pee " || → || ''dấm đài'' (nonsense words) || word order and tone switch
|-
| ''chửa hoang'' "pregnancy out of wedlock" || → || ''hoảng chưa'' "scared yet?" || word order and tone switch
|-
| ''bầy tôi'' "all the king's subjects" || → || ''bồi tây'' "French waiter" || initial consonant, rime, and tone switch
|-
| ''bí mật'' "secrets" || → || ''bật mí'' "revealing secrets"|| initial consonant and rime switch
|}

The resulting transformed phrase often has a different meaning but sometimes may just be a nonsensical word pair. ''Nói lái'' can be used to obscure the original meaning and thus soften the discussion of a socially sensitive issue, as with ''dấm đài'' and ''hoảng chưa'' (above) or, when implied (and not overtly spoken), to deliver a hidden subtextual message, as with ''bồi tây''.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyễn Đ.-H. (1997: 29) gives the following context: "... a collaborator under the French administration was presented with a congratulatory panel featuring the two Chinese characters ''quần thần''. This Sino-Vietnamese expression could be defined as ''bầy tôi'' meaning 'all the king's subjects'. But those two syllables, when undergoing commutation of rhyme and tone, would generate ''bồi tây'' meaning 'servant in a French household'."&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, ''nói lái'' can be used for a humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222075952/http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html |date=2008-02-22 }}, Language Log's [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html], and [http://tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html] for more examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another word game somewhat reminiscent of [[pig latin]] is played by children. Here a nonsense syllable (chosen by the child) is prefixed onto a target word's syllables, then their initial consonants and rimes are switched with the tone of the original word remaining on the new switched rime.

:{| class="wikitable"
! Nonsense syllable !! Target word !! !! Intermediate form with prefixed syllable !! !! Resulting "secret" word
|-
| ''la'' || ''phở'' "beef or chicken noodle soup" || → || ''la phở'' || → || ''lơ phả''
|-
| ''la'' || ''ăn'' "to eat" || → || ''la ăn'' || → || ''lăn a''
|-
| ''la'' || ''hoàn cảnh'' "situation" || → || ''la hoàn la cảnh'' || → || ''loan hà lanh cả''
|-
| ''chim'' || ''hoàn cảnh'' "situation" || → || ''chim hoàn chim cảnh'' || → || ''choan hìm chanh kỉm''
|}

This language game is often used as a "secret" or "coded" language useful for obscuring messages from adult comprehension.

==Examples==
''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' is an epic narrative poem by the celebrated poet [[Nguyễn Du]], ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:阮攸|阮攸]]}}), which is often considered the most significant work of [[Vietnamese literature]]. It was originally written in Chữ Nôm (titled ''Đoạn Trường Tân Thanh'' {{vi-nom|[[wikt:斷腸新聲|斷腸新聲]]}}) and is widely taught in [[Vietnam]] today.

A '''vocal register''' is a range of tones in the human voice produced by a particular vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s. These registers include [[modal voice]] (or normal voice), [[vocal fry]], [[falsetto]], and the [[whistle register]].&lt;ref name=Large&gt;{{cite journal

Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name=Large/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appelman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book

In [[speech pathology]], the vocal register has three components: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Although this view is also adopted by many [[vocal pedagogy|vocal pedagogists]], others define vocal registration more loosely than in the sciences, using the term to denote various theories of how the human voice changes, both subjectively and objectively, as it moves through its pitch range.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt; There are many divergent theories on vocal registers within [[vocal pedagogy]], making the term somewhat confusing and at times controversial within the field of [[singing]]. Vocal pedagogists may use the term vocal register to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name=McKinney/&gt;

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|350x350px|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords.]]

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process
* A certain vocal [[timbre]]
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

Manuel Garcia II was one of the first to develop a scientific definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and vocal teachers today
	"A register is a series of homogeneous sounds produced by one mechanism, differing essentially from another series of equally homogeneous sounds produced by another 	mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Manuel. Hints on Singing. London: E. Ascherberg, 1894. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another definition worth considering is from Clifton Ware. 
	"A series of distinct, consecutive, homogeneous vocal tones that can be maintained in 	pitch and loudness throughout a certain range."&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Clifton. Basics of Vocal Pedagogy: The Foundations and Process of Singing. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same mechanical system whereas registration is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve artistic singing. For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Clifton. Basics of Vocal Pedagogy: The Foundations and Process of Singing. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term “register” originated in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different “voices”. As teachers started to notice how different the ranges on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, they were compared to different sets of pipes in an [[pipe organ|organ]]. These clusters of pipes were called registers, so the same term was adopted for voices.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Richard. Complete Handbook of Voice Training. West Nyack, NY: Parker Pub., 1979. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number==
Vocal registers arise from different vibratory patterns produced by the vocal cords. Research by speech pathologists and some vocal pedagogists has revealed that the [[vocal cords]] are capable of producing at least four distinct vibratory forms, although not all persons can produce all of them. The first of these vibratory forms is known as natural or normal voice;&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt; another name for it is '''[[modal voice]]''', a term currently widely used in both speech pathology and vocal pedagogy publications. In this usage, modal refers to the natural disposition or manner of action of the vocal cords. The other three vibratory forms are known as '''vocal fry''', '''falsetto''', and '''whistle'''. Each of these four registers has its own vibratory pattern, its own pitch area (although there is some overlapping), and its own characteristic sound. Arranged by the pitch areas covered, [[vocal fry]] is the lowest register, [[modal voice]] is next, then [[falsetto]], and finally the [[whistle register]].&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

While speech pathologists and scholars of phonetics consistently divide the voice into these four registers, vocal pedagogists are divided on this issue. Indiscriminate use of the word register has led to much confusion and controversy about the number of registers in the human voice within vocal pedagogical circles. This controversy does not exist within speech pathology and the other sciences, because vocal registers are viewed from a purely physiological standpoint that is concerned with laryngeal function. Various writers concerned with the art of singing state that there are anywhere from one to seven registers present. The diversity of opinion is quite wide and there is no consensus or single point of view.&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;{{cite book

The prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are designated "chest", "head", and "falsetto" and women's voices are "chest", "middle", and "head". This way of classifying registers, however, is not universally accepted. Many vocal pedagogists partially blame this confusion on the incorrect use of the terms '''"[[chest register]]"''' and '''"[[head register]]"'''. These professionals argue that, since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are [[resonance]] phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms '''"[[chest voice]]"''' and '''"[[head voice]]"''' over the term register. Many of the problems described as register problems are actually problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the multiplicity of registers which some vocal pedagogists advocate.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt; For more information on resonance, see [[Vocal resonation]].

The confusion which exists concerning the definition and number of registers is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the [[vocal fold]]s are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.&lt;ref name=Large /&gt;

If a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, her [[larynx|laryngeal]] function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur, with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a [[passaggio]] or a [[ponticello]].&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Opera. John Warrack and Ewan West, {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocal pedagogists teach that, with study, a singer can move effortlessly from one register to another with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who prefer the theory of "blending registers" usually help students through the "passage" from one register to another by hiding their "lift" (where the voice changes).

However, many pedagogists disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has affected the different views on vocal registration.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

==Vocal fry register==
{{Main|Vocal fry register}}
The vocal fry register is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose [[glottal closure]] which will permit air to bubble through with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. The chief use of vocal fry in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency which are not available in [[modal voice]]. This register may be used therapeutically to improve the lower part of the modal register. This register is not used often in singing, but male quartet pieces, and certain styles of folk music for both men and women have been known to do so.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

==Modal voice register==
{{main|Modal voice register}}
The modal voice is the usual register for speaking and singing, and the vast majority of both are done in this register. As pitch rises in this register, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their edges become thinner. A well-trained singer or speaker can [[phonation|phonate]] two octaves or more in the modal register with consistent production, beauty of tone, dynamic variety, and vocal freedom. This is possible only if the singer or speaker avoids static [[larynx|laryngeal]] adjustments and allows the progression from the bottom to the top of the register to be a carefully graduated continuum of readjustments.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

==Falsetto register==
{{main|Falsetto register}}
The falsetto register lies above the modal voice register and overlaps the modal register by approximately one [[octave]]. The characteristic sound of falsetto is flute-like with few overtones present. Both men and women can [[phonation|phonate]] in the falsetto register.&lt;ref name=Large /&gt; The essential difference between the modal and falsetto registers lies in the amount and type of [[vocal cord]] involvement. The falsetto voice is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords, in whole or in part, and the main body of the fold is more or less relaxed. In contrast, the modal voice involves the whole vocal cord with the [[glottis]] opening at the bottom first and then at the top. The falsetto voice is also more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voice.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

==Whistle register==
{{main|Whistle register}}
The whistle register is the highest register of the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vocalist.org.uk/voice_registers.html|title=Voice Registers: Chest, head and other voices at Vocalist.org.uk|last=Vocalist.org.uk|website=www.vocalist.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whistle register is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register are similar to that of a whistle or the upper notes of a [[flute]], whereas the modal register tends to have a warmer, less shrill timbre. Women of all voice types can use the whistle register. With proper vocal training, it is possible for most women and some men to develop this part of the voice. Children can also phonate in the whistle register, without conscious effort.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

WordNet: An online lexical database. Int. J. Lexicograph. 3, 4, pp. 235–244.&lt;/ref&gt; It groups English [[word]]s into sets of [[synonyms]] called ''[[synsets]]'', provides short definitions and usage examples, and records a number of relations among  these synonym sets or their members.

== History and team members ==
WordNet was created in the [[Cognitive Science]] Laboratory of [[Princeton University]] under the direction of  [[psychology]] [[professor]] [[George Armitage Miller]] starting in 1985 and has been directed in recent years by [[Christiane Fellbaum]]. The project received funding from government agencies including the [[National Science Foundation]], [[DARPA]], the [[Disruptive Technology Office]] (formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity), and REFLEX. George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum were awarded the 2006 [[European Language Resources Association#Antonio Zampolli Prize|Antonio Zampolli Prize]] for their work with WordNet.

== Database contents ==
[[File:Hamburger WordNet.png|thumb|Example entry "Hamburger" in WordNet]]

As of November 2012 WordNet's latest Online-version is 3.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version/ |title=Current WordNet version |publisher=Wordnet.princeton.edu |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  database contains 155 327 words organized in 175 979 [[synsets]] for a total of 207 016  word-sense pairs; in [[data compression|compressed]] form, it is about 12 [[megabyte]]s in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/wnstats.7WN.html |title=WordNet Statistics |publisher=Wordnet.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WordNet includes the lexical categories [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s but ignores [[preposition]]s, [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]s and other function words.

Words from the same lexical category that are roughly synonymous are grouped into [[synsets]]. Synsets include simplex words as well as [[collocation]]s like "eat out" and "car pool." The different senses of a [[polysemous]] word form are assigned to different synsets. The meaning of a synset is further clarified with a short defining ''gloss'' and one or more usage examples. An example adjective synset is:

: good, right, ripe – (most suitable or right for a particular purpose; "a good time to plant tomatoes"; "the right time to act"; "the time is ripe for great sociological changes")

All synsets are connected to other synsets by means of semantic relations. These relations, which are not all shared by all lexical categories, include:
* [[Noun]]s
**''[[hypernym]]s'': ''Y'' is a hypernym of ''X'' if every ''X'' is a (kind of) ''Y'' (''canine'' is a hypernym of ''[[dog]]'')
**''[[hyponym]]s'': ''Y'' is a hyponym of ''X'' if every ''Y'' is a (kind of) ''X'' (''dog'' is a hyponym of ''canine'')
**''coordinate terms'': ''Y'' is a coordinate term of ''X'' if ''X'' and ''Y'' share a hypernym (''wolf'' is a coordinate term of ''dog'', and ''dog'' is a coordinate term of ''wolf'')
**''[[meronymy|meronym]]'': ''Y'' is a meronym of ''X'' if ''Y'' is a part of ''X'' (''window'' is a meronym of ''building'')
**''[[holonymy|holonym]]'': ''Y'' is a holonym of ''X'' if ''X'' is a part of ''Y'' (''building'' is a holonym of ''window'')
* [[Verb]]s
**''hypernym'': the verb ''Y'' is a hypernym of the verb ''X'' if the activity ''X'' is a (kind of) ''Y'' (''to perceive'' is an hypernym of ''to listen'')
**''[[troponym]]'': the verb ''Y'' is a troponym of the verb ''X'' if the activity ''Y'' is doing ''X'' in some manner (''to lisp'' is a troponym of ''to talk'')
**''[[entailment]]'': the verb ''Y'' is entailed by ''X'' if by doing ''X'' you must be doing ''Y'' (''to sleep'' is entailed by ''to snore'')
**''coordinate terms'': those verbs sharing a common hypernym (''to lisp'' and ''to yell'')

These semantic relations hold among all members of the linked synsets. Individual synset members (words) can also be connected with  lexical relations. For example, (one sense of) the noun "director" is linked to (one sense of) the verb "direct" from which it is derived via a "morphosemantic" link.

The morphology functions of the software distributed with the database try to deduce the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] or [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] form of a [[word]] from the user's input. Irregular forms are stored in a list, and looking up "ate" will return "eat," for example.

== Knowledge structure ==
Both nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies, defined by [[hypernym]] or ''[[is-a|IS A]]'' relationships. For instance, one sense of the word ''dog'' is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent synset members.  Each set of synonyms has a unique index.
{{tree list}}
* {{Tree list/final branch}}dog, domestic dog, Canis familiaris
** {{Tree list/final branch}}canine, canid
*** {{Tree list/final branch}}carnivore
**** {{Tree list/final branch}}placental, placental mammal, eutherian, eutherian mammal
***** {{Tree list/final branch}}mammal
****** {{Tree list/final branch}}vertebrate, craniate
******* {{Tree list/final branch}}chordate
******** {{Tree list/final branch}}animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna
********* {{Tree list/final branch}}...
{{tree list/end}}
At the top level, these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner "trees" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called ''lexicographic files'' at a maintenance level).  All are linked to a unique beginner synset, "entity".
Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies

Adjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees. Instead, two "central" antonyms such as "hot" and "cold" form binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as "steaming" and "chilly" connect to their respective poles via a "similarity" relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as "dumbbells" rather than as "trees".

== Psycholinguistic aspects ==

The initial goal of the WordNet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s.  Psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic, hierarchical fashion. Retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to "traverse" to access the knowledge. Thus, speakers could more quickly verify that ''canaries can sing'' because a canary is a songbird, but required slightly more time to verify that ''canaries can fly'' (where they had to access the concept "bird" on the superordinate level) and even more time to verify ''canaries have skin'' (requiring look-up across multiple levels of hyponymy, up to "animal").&lt;ref&gt;Collins A., Quillian M. R. 1972. Experiments on Semantic Memory and Language Comprehension. In ''Cognition in Learning and Memory''. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
While such experiments and the underlying theories have been subject to criticism, some of WordNet's organization is consistent with experimental evidence. For example, [[anomic aphasia]] selectively affects speakers' ability to produce words from a specific semantic category, a WordNet hierarchy. Antonymous adjectives (WordNet's central adjectives in the dumbbell structure) are found to co-occur far more frequently than chance, a fact that has been found to hold for many languages.

== As a lexical ontology ==

WordNet is sometimes called an ontology, a persistent claim that its creators do not make. The hypernym/hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories. In other words, WordNet can be interpreted and used as a lexical [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]] in the [[computer science]] sense. However, such an ontology should be corrected before being used, because it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies; for example there are, (i) common specializations for exclusive categories and (ii) redundancies in the specialization hierarchy. Furthermore, transforming WordNet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve (i)&amp;nbsp;distinguishing the specialization relations into ''subtypeOf'' and ''instanceOf'' relations, and (ii)&amp;nbsp;associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category. Although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part of the integration of WordNet&amp;nbsp;1.7 into the cooperatively updatable knowledge base of WebKB-2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.phmartin.info |url=http://www.webkb.org/doc/wn/ |title=Integration of WordNet 1.7 in WebKB-2|publisher=Webkb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; most projects claiming to re-use WordNet for knowledge-based applications (typically, knowledge-oriented information retrieval) simply re-use it directly.

WordNet has also been converted to a formal specification, by means of a hybrid bottom-up top-down methodology to automatically extract association relations from WordNet, and interpret these associations in terms of a set of conceptual relations, formally defined in the [[Upper ontology (computer science)#DOLCE and DnS|DOLCE foundational ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A. |last1=Gangemi |first2=R. |last2=Navigli |first3=P. |last3=Velardi |url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/WNET/ODBASE-OWN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The OntoWordNet Project: Extension and Axiomatization of Conceptual Relations in WordNet |work= Proc. of International Conference on Ontologies, Databases and Applications of SEmantics (ODBASE 2003) |location=Catania, Sicily (Italy) |year=2003 |pages= 820–838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most works that claim to have integrated WordNet into ontologies, the content of WordNet has not simply been corrected when it seemed necessary; instead, WordNet has been heavily re-interpreted and updated whenever suitable. This was the case when, for example, the top-level ontology of WordNet was re-structured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = A. | last1 = Oltramari | first2 = A. | last2 = Gangemi | first3 = N. | last3 = Guarino | first4 = C. | last4 = Masolo | date = 2002 | title = Restructuring WordNet's Top-Level: The OntoClean approach | citeseerx = 10.1.1.19.6574 | conference = OntoLex'2 Workshop, Ontologies and Lexical Knowledge Bases (LREC 2002) | location = Las Palmas, Spain | pages = 17–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[OntoClean]] based approach or when WordNet was used as a primary source for constructing the lower classes of the SENSUS ontology.

== Limitations ==

WordNet does not include information about the [[etymology]] or the pronunciation of words and it contains only limited information about usage. WordNet aims to cover most of everyday English and does not include much domain-specific terminology.

WordNet is the most commonly used computational lexicon of English for [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD), a task aimed to assigning the context-appropriate meanings (i.e. synset members) to words in a text.&lt;ref&gt;R. Navigli. [http://www.dsi.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/ACM_Survey_2009_Navigli.pdf Word Sense Disambiguation: A Survey], ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 41(2), 2009, pp. 1–69&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that WordNet encodes sense distinctions that are too fine-grained. This issue prevents WSD systems from achieving a level of performance comparable to that of humans, who do not always agree when confronted with the task of selecting a sense from a dictionary that matches a word in a context. The granularity issue has been tackled by proposing [[cluster analysis|clustering]] methods that automatically group together similar senses of the same word.&lt;ref&gt;E. Agirre, O. Lopez. 2003.

=== Licensed vs. Open WordNets ===
Some wordnets were subsequently created for other languages. A 2012 survey lists the wordnets and their availability.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bond and Kyonghee Paik 2012a. [http://web.mysites.ntu.edu.sg/fcbond/open/pubs/2012-gwc-wn-license.pdf A survey of wordnets and their licenses]. In Proceedings of the 6th Global WordNet Conference (GWC 2012). Matsue. 64–71&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to propagate the usage of WordNets, the Global WordNet community had been slowly re-licensing their WordNets to an open domain where researchers and developers can easily access and use WordNets as language resources to provide [[ontology|ontological]] and [[lexicon|lexical]] knowledge in [[Natural Language Processing]] tasks.

The Open Multilingual WordNet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/|title=Open Multilingual Wordnet|author=|date=|website=compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides access to [[Open-source license|open licensed]] wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages.

== Applications ==

WordNet has been used for a number of purposes in information systems, including [[word-sense disambiguation]], [[information retrieval]], [[Document classification|automatic text classification]], [[Automatic summarization|automatic text summarization]], [[machine translation]] and even automatic crossword puzzle generation.

A common use of WordNet is to determine the [[semantic similarity|similarity]] between words. Various algorithms have been proposed, including measuring the distance among words and synsets in WordNet's graph structure, such as by counting the number of edges among synsets. The intuition is that the closer two words or synsets are, the closer their meaning. A number of WordNet-based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a [[Perl]] package called WordNet::Similarity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/similarity.html |title=Ted Pedersen - WordNet::Similarity |publisher=D.umn.edu |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package called [[NLTK]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://likegeeks.com/nlp-tutorial-using-python-nltk NLP using Python NLTK]/&lt;/ref&gt;. Other more sophisticated WordNet-based similarity techniques include ADW,&lt;ref&gt;M. T. Pilehvar, D. Jurgens and R. Navigli.

WordNet can also be used to inter-link other vocabularies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ballatore A, etal |volume=20|issue=2| arxiv=1404.5372| journal=Annals of GIS |title=Linking geographic vocabularies through WordNet |publisher= |date=2014|bibcode=2014arXiv1404.5372B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related projects and extensions ==
WordNet is connected to several databases of the [[Semantic Web]]. WordNet is also commonly re-used via mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies. Most often, only the top-level categories of WordNet are mapped.

===Global WordNet Association===
The Global WordNet Association (GWA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Global WordNet Association |url=http://www.globalwordnet.org/ |title=globalwordnet.org |publisher=globalwordnet.org |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world. The GWA also promotes the standardization of wordnets across languages, to ensure its uniformity in enumerating the synsets in human languages. The GWA keeps a list of wordnets developed around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wordnets in the World|url=http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/wordnet_table.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021114613/http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/wordnet_table.html |archivedate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this project, a freely available XML-based WordNet editor was developed. This editor – VisDic – is not in active development anymore, but is still used for the creation of various WordNets. Its successor, DEBVisDic, is client-server application and is currently used for the editing of several WordNets (Dutch in Cornetto project, Polish, Hungarian, several African languages, Chinese).
