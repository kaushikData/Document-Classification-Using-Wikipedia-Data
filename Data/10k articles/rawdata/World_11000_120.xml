[[File:Ordino03.jpg|thumb|Church of St Martin, Ordino]]
The '''Catholic Church in Andorra''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].

There are over 60,000 Catholics in Andorra, over 90% of the total population, and the country forms part of the Spanish [[Diocese of Urgell]], whose bishop is also one of the country's [[Co-Prince of Andorra|Co-Princes]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Organization==

The country has never had a [[diocese]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Diocese of Urgell]], whose [[bishop]], together with the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]], shares the role of [[head of state]] of the tiny country.

From a historical point of view Andorra was evangelized through the bishopric of Urgell, in the reign of St. Just, in the mid-sixth century.

The principality is divided into seven parishes: Canillo, Encamp, Ordino, La Massana, Andorra la Vella, Sant Julia de Loria and Escaldes-Engordany.

==Apostolic Nunciature==

The [[Apostolic Nunciature|apostolic nunciature]] in Andorra was established on 16 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_20010123_holy-see-relations_it.html vatican.va]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Apostolic Nuncio is also nuncio in Spain and lives in Madrid.

The current Apostolic Nuncio is the Archbishop [[Renzo Fratini]], appointed by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on 20 April 2009.

[[File:3d10 fm de vilafranca.jpg|thumb|Catalan ''[[castell]]ers'' collaborate, working together with a shared goal]]

'''Collaboration''' is the process of two or more people or [[organization]]s working together&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;field-12668446=Collaboration&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&amp;sortorder=score]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; to complete a task or achieve a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Marinez-Moyano, I. J. ''Exploring the Dynamics of Collaboration in Interorganizational Settings'', Ch. 4, p. 83, in Schuman (Editor). [http://www.culture-of-collaboration.com ''Creating a Culture of Collaboration''.] Jossey-bass, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7879-8116-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboration is similar to [[cooperation]]. Most collaboration requires [[leadership]], although the form of leadership can be social within a [[decentralized]] and [[egalitarian]] group.&lt;ref name="spencelecture"&gt;Spence, Muneera U. ''"Graphic Design: Collaborative Processes = Understanding Self and Others."'' (lecture) Art 325: Collaborative Processes. Fairbanks Hall, [[Oregon State University]], [[Corvallis, Oregon]]. 13 April 2006. [http://revolutionphiladelphia.aiga.org/resources/content/2/5/7/0/documents/MSpence.pdf See also].&lt;/ref&gt; Teams that work collaboratively often access greater resources, recognition and rewards when facing competition for finite resources.&lt;ref name="wagner_and_leydesdorff"&gt;[[Caroline S. Wagner]] and [[Loet Leydesdorff]]. ''[http://users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/cswagner07/index.htm Globalisation in the network of science in 2005: The diffusion of international collaboration and the formation of a core group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825174955/http://users.fmg.uva.nl/lleydesdorff/cswagner07/index.htm|date=2007-08-25}}.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Structured methods of collaboration encourage [[introspection]] of behavior and communication.&lt;ref name="spencelecture" /&gt; Such methods aim to increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative [[problem-solving]].

Collaboration is present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of [[adversarial collaboration]], though this is not a common use of the term.

In its applied sense,"(a) collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/842851754|title=Collaborative leadership : developing effective partnerships for communities and schools|last=1952-|first=Rubin, Hank,|isbn=1299395651|edition= 2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=842851754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples ==
===Trade===
[[File:The farmer's market near the Potala in Lhasa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[trade]] of goods is an economic activity providing mutual benefit]]

Trade is a form of collaboration between two societies that produce different portfolios of goods. Trade began in [[prehistoric]] times and continues because it benefits all of its participants. Prehistoric peoples bartered goods and services with each other without a modern currency. [[Peter Watson (business writer)|Peter Watson]] dates the [[History of international trade|history of long-distance commerce]] from [[circa]] 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Watson, Peter | title=Ideas : A History of Thought and Invention from Fire to Freud | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2005| isbn=0-06-621064-X}} Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade exists because different communities have a [[comparative advantage]] in the production of tradable goods.

===Community organization: Intentional Community===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2007}}
[[File:Second aliyah Pioneers in Migdal 1912 in kuffiyeh.jpg|right|thumb|Organization and cooperation between community members provides economic and social benefits]]

{{main|intentional community}}
The members of an intentional community typically hold a common [[social]], [[political]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] vision. They share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[cohousing]], residential [[trust (property)|land trusts]], [[ecovillage]]s, [[commune (intentional community)|commune]]s, [[kibbutz]]im, [[ashram]]s, and [[housing cooperative]]s. Typically, new members of an intentional community are selected by the community's existing membership, rather than by real estate agents or land owners (if the land is not owned by the community).&lt;ref name="Ahomeincommunity"&gt;{{cite web|title=AHI - Intentional Communities|url=http://www.ahomeincommunity.org/resources.html|website=A Home in Community|publisher=A Home in Community|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hutterite, Austria (16th century) ===

In [[Hutterites|Hutterite]] communities housing units are built and assigned to individual families, but belong to the colony with little personal property. Meals are taken by the entire colony in a common long room.

=== Oneida Community, [[Oneida, New York]] (1848) ===
The [[Oneida Community]] practiced ''[[Communalism]]'' (in the sense of communal property and possessions) and ''Mutual Criticism'', where every member of the community was subject to criticism by committee or the community as a whole, during a general meeting. The goal was to eliminate bad character traits.

=== Kibbutz (1890) ===

A [[Kibbutz]] is an [[Israel]]i collective community. The movement combines [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]] seeking a form of practical [[Labor Zionism]]. Choosing communal life, and inspired by their own ideology, kibbutz members developed a communal mode of living. The kibbutzim lasted for several generations as [[utopian]] communities, although most became capitalist enterprises and regular towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-the-kibbutz-movement|title=The Kibbutz &amp; Moshav: History &amp; Overview|last=Rubinstein|first=Amnon|date=July 10, 2007|website=Jewish Virtual Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous Collaboration===

Collaboration in indigenous communities, particularly in the Americas, often involves the entire community working toward a common goal in a horizontal structure with flexible leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching In to Family and Community Endeavors: An Orientation|url=https://www.karger.com/?doi=10.1159/000356757|journal=Human Development|volume=57|issue=2-3|pages=69–81|doi=10.1159/000356757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children in some indigenous American communities collaborate with the adults. Children can be contributors in the process of meeting objectives by taking on tasks that suit their skills.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 55–66"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|title=Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55–66|doi=10.1037//0012-1649.38.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous learning techniques comprise [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. For example, a study of Mayan fathers and children with traditional Indigenous ways of learning worked together in collaboration more frequently when building a 3D model puzzle than Mayan fathers with western schooling.&lt;ref name="Chavajay 55–66"/&gt; Also, Chillihuani people of the Andes value work and create work parties in which members of each household in the community participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing up in a culture of respect: Childrearing in highland Peru|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=Austin|pages=72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children from indigenous-heritage communities want to help around the house voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mejía-Arauz|first=Rebeca|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|last3=Dexter|first3=Amy|last4=Najafi|first4=Behnosh|date=2007-05-01|title=Cultural Variation in Children's Social Organization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01046.x/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=1001–1014|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01046.x|issn=1467-8624|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023129/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01046.x/abstract|archivedate=2010-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mazahua Indigenous community of Mexico, school children show initiative and autonomy by contributing in their classroom, completing activities as a whole, assisting and correcting their teacher during lectures when a mistake is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|date=1994-06-01|title=Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to Be Separate-But-Together|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w/abstract|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–172|doi=10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w|issn=1548-1492|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110094050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aeq.1994.25.2.05x0907w/abstract|archivedate=2015-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifth and sixth graders in the community work with the teacher installing a classroom window; the installation becomes a class project in which the students participate in the process alongside the teacher. They all work together without needing leadership, and their movements are all in sync and flowing. It is not a process of instruction, but rather a hands-on experience in which students work together as a synchronous group with the teacher, switching roles and sharing tasks. In these communities, collaboration is emphasized, and learners are trusted to take initiative. While one works, the other watches intently and all are allowed to attempt tasks with the more experienced stepping in to complete more complex parts, while others pay close attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|last2=De Haan|first2=Mariëtte|date=2009-06-01|title=Responsibility and Reciprocity: Social Organization of Mazahua Learning Practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x/abstract|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|language=en|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187–204|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x|issn=1548-1492|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144925/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x/abstract|archivedate=2017-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration in the free market===
[[Ayn Rand]] said that one way people pursue their rational self-interest is by building strong relationships with other people. According to Rand, participants in [[capitalism]] are connected through the voluntary division of labor in the free market, where value is exchanged always for value. Rand's theory of [[rational egoism]] claims that acting in one's self-interest entails looking out for others in order to protect the innocent from injustice, and to aid friends, allies, and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal|date=1966|author=Ayn Rand}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=August 2018}}

===Game theory===
[[Game theory]] is a branch of applied mathematics, computer science, and economics that looks at situations where multiple players make decisions in an attempt to maximize their returns. The first documented discussion of game theory is in a letter written by [[James Waldegrave, 1st Earl Waldegrave]] in 1713. [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]]'s ''Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth'' in 1838 provided the first general theory. In 1928 it became a recognized field when [[John von Neumann]] published a series of papers. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in the 1944 book The ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/|title=Game Theory|last=Ross|first=Don|date=December 9, 2014|origyear= January 25, 1997 |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military-industrial complex===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
The term [[military-industrial complex]] refers to a close and [[symbiotic]] relationship among a nation's [[armed forces]], its [[private industry]], and associated [[political]] interests. In such a system, the military is dependent on industry to supply material and other support, while the defense industry depends on government for revenue.

=== Skunk Works ===
[[Skunk Works]] is a term used in engineering and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy unhampered by bureaucracy, tasked with advanced or secret projects. One such group was created at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in 1943. The team developed highly innovative aircraft in short time frames, notably beating its first deadline by 37 days.&lt;ref name="bennis_biederman"&gt;Bennis, Warren and Patricia :Ward Biederman. ''Organizing Genius: The Secrets of Creative Collaboration.'' Perseus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manhattan Project ===
The [[Manhattan Project]] was a collaborative project during [[World War II]] among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] that developed the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] . It was a collaborative effort by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]].

The value of this project as an influence on organized collaboration is attributed to [[Vannevar Bush]]. In early 1940, Bush lobbied for the creation of the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Frustrated by previous bureaucratic failures in implementing technology in World War I, Bush sought to organize the scientific power of the United States for greater success.&lt;ref name="bennis_biederman" /&gt;

The project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945: a [[nuclear testing|test detonation]] of a [[plutonium]] implosion bomb on July 16 (the [[Trinity test]]) near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]; an [[enriched uranium]] bomb code-named "[[Little Boy]]" on August 6 over [[Hiroshima]], Japan; and a second [[plutonium]] bomb, code-named "[[Fat Man]]" on August 9 over Nagasaki, Japan.

===Project management===
[[File:SS John W Brown.jpg|thumb|right|The 2,751 [[Liberty ship]]s built in four years by the United States during World War II required new approaches in organization and manufacturing]]
As a discipline, Project Management developed from different fields including construction, engineering and defense. In the United States, the forefather of project management is [[Henry Gantt]], who is known for his use of the [[Gantt chart|"bar" chart]] as a project management tool, for being an associate of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s theories of [[scientific management]] and for his study of the management of Navy ship building. His work is the forerunner to many modern project management tools including the [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) and resource allocation.

The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern project management era. Again, in the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an [[ad hoc]] basis using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s, and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project scheduling models were developed: (1) the "[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]]" or PERT, developed as part of the [[United States Navy]]'s (in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]]) [[Polaris missile]] submarine program;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 Booz Allen Hamilton - History of Booz Allen 1950s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607025332/http://www.boozallen.com/about/history/history_5 |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) the "[[Critical Path Method]]" (CPM) developed in a joint venture by both [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.

In 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed to serve the interest of the project management industry. The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the [[software industry]] to the construction industry. In 1981, the PMI Board of Directors authorized the development of what has become ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK), standards and guidelines of practice that are widely used throughout the profession. The [[International Project Management Association]] (IPMA), founded in Europe in 1967, has undergone a similar development and instituted the IPMA Project Baseline. Both organizations are now participating in the development of a global project management standard.

However, the exorbitant cost overruns and missed deadlines of large-scale infrastructure, military R&amp;D/procurement and utility projects in the US demonstrates that these advances have not been able to overcome the challenges of such projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/07/us-has-epidemic-of-big-project-failures-will-watch-china-press-its-railgun-advantage.html|title=US has epidemic of big project failures – will watch China press its railgun advantage|date=2018-07-06|work=NextBigFuture.com|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===

==== Black Mountain College ====
Founded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier and other former faculty of [[Rollins College]], [[Black Mountain College]] was experimental by nature and committed to an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, attracting a faculty which included leading visual artists, poets and designers.

Operating in a relatively isolated rural location with little budget, Black Mountain fostered an informal and collaborative spirit. Innovations, relationships and unexpected connections formed at Black Mountain had a lasting influence on the postwar American art scene, [[high culture]] and eventually [[popular culture|pop culture]]. [[Buckminster Fuller]] met student [[Kenneth Snelson]] at Black Mountain, and the result was the first [[geodesic dome]] (improvised out of slats in the school's back yard); [[Merce Cunningham]] formed his dance company; and [[John Cage]] staged his first [[happening]].

Black Mountain College was a consciously directed [[liberal arts]] school that grew out of the [[progressive education|progressive education movement]]. In its day it was a unique educational experiment for the artists and writers who conducted it, and as such an important incubator for the American [[avant garde]].

==== Learning ====
[[File:Evergreen clocktower.jpg|thumb|right|The Evergreen signature clock tower]]

(2006) Contradictions in theorising and implementing communities in education.  Educational Research Review, 1, (1), pp27–40.&lt;/ref&gt; that until the early 1990s the individual was the 'unit of instruction' and the focus of research. The two observed that researchers and practitioners switched&lt;ref&gt;Lave, J. (1988) Cognition in practice: Mind, mathematics and culture in everyday life.

In other words, that children take part in the construction of consensual domains, and 'participate in the negotiation and institutionalization of … meaning'. In effect, they are participating in [[Learning community|learning communities]]'''.'''
:This analysis does not consider the appearance of Learning communities in the United States in the early 1980s. For example, [[The Evergreen State College]], which is widely considered a pioneer in this area, established an intercollegiate learning community in 1984. In 1985, this same college established The Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, which focuses on collaborative education approaches, including learning communities as one of its centerpieces. The school later became notorious for less-successful collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/evergreen-copes-with-fallout-months-after-day-of-absence-sparked-national-debate|title=Evergreen copes with fallout, months after 'Day of Absence' sparked national debate|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical music===
{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}

Although relatively rare compared with collaboration in popular music, there have been some notable examples of music written collaboratively by classical composers. Perhaps the best-known examples are:

* ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]'', a set of [[Variation (music)|variations]] for solo [[piano]] on a theme from [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I puritani]]''. It was written and first performed in 1837. The contributors were [[Franz Liszt]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Carl Czerny]], [[Sigismond Thalberg]], [[Johann Peter Pixis]], and [[Henri Herz]].
* The ''[[F-A-E Sonata]]'', a [[sonata]] for [[violin]] and piano, written in 1853 as a gift for the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. The composers were [[Albert Dietrich]] (first movement), [[Robert Schumann]] (second and fourth movements), and [[Johannes Brahms]] (third movement).

===Arts===

==== Figurative arts ====
The romanticized notion of a lone, genius artist has existed since the time of [[Giorgio Vasari]]’s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'', published in 1568. Vasari promulgated the idea that artistic skill was endowed upon chosen individuals by gods, which created an enduring and largely false popular misunderstanding of many artistic processes. Artists have used collaboration to complete large scale works for centuries, but the myth of the lone artist was not widely questioned until the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Judith. "Collaboration." The Power of Feminist Art. Norma Broude and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. London: Thames and Hudson, 1994. 226-245. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Collaborative art groups=====

*[[Dada]] (1913)
*[[Fluxus]] (1957)
*[[Situationist International]] (1957)
*[[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (1967)
*[[Mujeres Muralistas]] (1973)
*[[Colab]] (1977)
*[[Guerrilla Girls]] (1985)
*[[SITO (artist collective)|SITO]] (1993)
*[[2 Easy Fashion]] (2008)

====Ballet====
[[Ballet]] is a collaborative art form. Ballet entails music, dancers, costumes, a venue, lighting, etc. Hypothetically, one person could control all of this, but most often every work of ballet is the by-product of collaboration. From the earliest formal works of ballet, to the great 19th century masterpieces of [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Marius Petipa]], to the 20th century masterworks of [[George Balanchine]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], to today’s ballet companies, feature strong collaborative connections between choreographers, composers and costume designers are essential. Within dance as an art form, there is also the collaboration between choreographer and dancer. The choreographer creates a movement in her/his head and then physically demonstrates the movement to the dancer, which the dancer sees and attempts to either mimic or interpret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christopherbest.net/data/articles/dance%20theatre%20jounal.pdf|title=Choreographers and composers, why collaborate?|last=Best|first=Christopher|date=|website=Christopher Best|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music ====
{{main|Classical music written in collaboration}}
Musical collaboration occurs when musicians in different places or groups work on the piece. Typically, multiple parties are involved (singers, songwriters, lyrisits, composers, and producers) come together to create one work. For example, one specific collaboration from recent times (2015) was the song "[[FourFiveSeconds]]". This single represents a type of collaboration because it was developed by pop idold [[Rihanna]], [[Paul McCartney]] (former bassist, composer and vocalist for [[The Beatles]]), and rapper/composer [[Kanye West]]. Websites and software  facilitate musical collaboration over the [[Internet]], resulting in the emergence of [[Online Bands]].

Several awards exist specifically for collaboration in music:

*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]—awarded since 1988
*[[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]—awarded since 1995
*[[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]—awarded since 2002

Collaboration has been a constant feature of Electroacoustic Music, due to the technology's complexity. Embedding technological tools into the process stimulated the emergence of new agents with new expertise: the musical assistant, the technician, the computer music designer, the music mediator (a profession that has been described and defined in different ways over the years) – aiding with writing, creating new instruments, recording and/or performance. The musical assistant explains developments in musical research and translates artistic ideas into programming languages. Finally, he or she transforms those ideas into a score or a computer program and often performs the musical piece during the concerts.&lt;ref&gt;L. Zattra, N. Donin (2016) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1029864915624136 "A questionnaire-based investigation of the skills and roles of Computer Music Designers"] Musicae Scientiae, September 2016 20: 436–456, doi:10.1177/1029864915624136. (referenced 12/13/16).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of collaboration include [[Pierre Boulez]] and Andrew Gerzso, Alvise Vidolin and [[Luigi Nono]], [[Jonathan Harvey (composer)|Jonathan Harvey]] and Gilbert Nouno, among others.

====Entertainment====
Collaboration in entertainment dates from the origin of theatrical productions, millenia ago. It takes the form of writers, directors, actors, producers and other individuals or groups work on the same production. In the twenty-first century, new technology has enhanced collaboration. A system developed by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]] for the TV series title ''Bar Karma'' on CurrentTV facilitates plot collaboration over the [[Internet]]. Screenwriter organizations bring together professional and amateur writers and filmmakers.

=== Business ===
{{See also|Management cybernetics}}

Collaboration in business can be found both within and across organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Bell |first2=Simon J. |year=2008 |title=Managing Networks of Interorganizational Linkages and Sustainable Firm Performance in Business-to-Business Service Contexts |journal=Journal of Services Marketing |volume=22 |pages=494–504 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1747570&amp;show=html |doi=10.1108/08876040810909631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranges from [[partnership]] and [[crowd funding]] to the complexity of a [[multinational corporation]]. Inter-organizational collaboration brings participating parties to invest resources, mutually achieve goals, share information, resources, rewards and responsibilities, as well as make joint decisions and solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=Felix T.

It is a way of coordinating different ideas from numerous people to generate a wide variety of knowledge. Collaboration with a selected few firms has been shown to positively impact firm performance and innovation outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Rubera |first2=Gaia |last3=Seifert |first3=Matthias |date=May 2009 |title=Managing Service Innovation and Interorganizational Relationships for Firm Performance: To Commit or Diversify? |journal=Journal of Service Research |volume=11 |pages=344–356 |url=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/11/4/344.short |doi=10.1177/1094670508329223 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510093053/http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/11/4/344.short |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology has provided the internet, wireless connectivity and collaboration tools such as blogs and wikis, and has as such created the possibility of "[[mass collaboration]]". People are able to rapidly communicate and share ideas, crossing longstanding geographical and cultural boundaries. Social networks permeate business culture where collaborative uses include [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. Journalist [[Evan Rosen]] claims that command-and-control organizational structures inhibit collaboration and replacing such structures allows collaboration to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Voyles, Bennett [http://knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/2015/09/14/employment/firing-the-annual-performance-review/ “Firing the Annual Performance Review,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045035/http://knowledge.ckgsb.edu.cn/2015/09/14/employment/firing-the-annual-performance-review/ |date=2015-12-08 }} September 14, 2015, ''CKGSB Knowledge''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that collaboration can increase achievement and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poquérusse|first=Jessie|title=The Neuroscience of Sharing|url=https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|accessdate=16 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508192042/https://www.uniiverse.com/neuroscience|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration found that successful collaboration can be rapidly derailed through external policy steering, particularly where it undermines relations built on trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan|title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4368/1/Fischer_M_D__Ferlie_E_%28authors%27_post-print_version%29_Accounting_Organizations_and_Society.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coworking]] spaces are businesses that provide space for freelancers to work with others in a collaborative environment.

===Education===
[[File:Development of "Mathe für Nicht-Freaks" from Sep 2009 to June 2016.webm|thumb|Visualization of the collaborative work in the German textbook project [[b:de:Mathe für Nicht-Freaks|Mathe für Nicht-Freaks]]]]
In recent years, co-teaching has become more common, found in US classrooms across all grade levels and content areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rytivaara, A., &amp; Kershner, R. (2012). Co-teaching as a context for teachers' professional 	learning and joint knowledge construction. Teaching and Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies, 28(7), 999-1008, p.85. doi:10.1016/j.tate.2012.05.006&lt;/ref&gt; Once regarded as connecting [[special education]] and general education teachers, it is now more generally defined as “…two professionals delivering substantive instruction to a diverse group of students in a single physical space."&lt;ref&gt;Cook, L., &amp; Friend. M. (1995). Co-Teaching: Guidelines for creating effective practices. Focus on Exceptional Children, 28(3), 1-16 ; McDuffie, K. A., Mastropieri, M. A., &amp; Scruggs, T. E. (2009). Differential effects of peer tutoring in co-taught and non-co-taught classes: Results for content learning and student- teacher interactions. Exceptional Children, 75(4), 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

As American classrooms have become increasingly diverse, so have the challenges for educators. Due to the diverse needs of students with designated special needs, [[English-language learner|English language learners]] (ELL), and students of varied academic levels, teachers have developed new approaches that provide additional student support.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J Graziano, &amp; Lori A Navarrete. (2012). Co-teaching in a teacher education classroom: Collaboration, compromise, and creativity. Issues in Teacher Education, 21(1), 112 ; Rytivaara, A. (2012). Collaborative classroom management in a co-taught primary school classroom. International Journal of Educational Research, 53, 182. doi:10.1016/j.ijer.2012.03.008&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, students remain in the classroom and receive instruction by both their general teacher and special education teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Rytivaara, A., &amp; Kershner, R. (2012). Co-teaching as a context for teachers' professional learning and joint knowledge construction. Teaching and Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies, 28(7), 999-1008. doi:10.1016/j.tate.2012.05.006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1996 report "What Matters Most: Teaching for America’s Future" economic success could be enhanced if students developed the capacity to learn how to “manage teams… and…work together successfully in teams”.&lt;ref name="NCTAF"&gt;What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Students, National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers increasingly use [[collaborative software]] to establish [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs). This allows them to share learning materials and feedback with both students and in some cases, parents. Approaches include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://online.tarleton.edu/Home_files/EDTC_538/Week_2/Week_27.html|title=Online Collaboration and Communication Tools: Web 2.0|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Tarleton State University|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing===
{{see also|Collaborative writing|Collaborative fiction}}Collaboration in publishing can be as simple as dual-authorship or as complex as [[commons-based peer production]]. Tools include [[Usenet]], [[Electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]], [[blog]]s and [[Wiki]]s while '[[Brick and mortar business|brick and mortar]]' examples include [[monograph]]s (books) and periodicals such as newspapers, journals and magazines. One approach is for an author to publish early drafts/chapters of a work on the Internet and solicit suggestions from the world at large. This approach helped ensure that the technical aspects of the novel ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' were as accurate as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-martian-rise-serial-publishing/|title=The Martian, and the Rise of Serial Publishing|work=MakeUseOf|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{see also|Science 2.0}}Scientific collaboration rapidly advanced throughout the twentieth century as measured by the increasing numbers of coauthors on published papers. Wagner and [[Loet Leydesdorff|Leydesdorff]] found international collaborations to have doubled from 1990 to 2005.&lt;ref name="wagner_and_leydesdorff" /&gt; While [[collaborative authorship]]s within nations has also risen, this has done so at a slower rate and is not cited as frequently.&lt;ref name="wagner_and_leydesdorff" /&gt;

===Medicine===
While nurses have long collaborated with doctors, the [[physician assistant]] - [[physician]] relationship is more recent. A collaborative plan is filed with each [[Federated state|state]] board of medicine where the PA works. This plan formally delineates the scope of practice approved by the physician.

===Technology===
[[File:ALMA Trilateral Agreement Signed.jpg|thumb|Trilateral agreement between [[ESO]], the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Institutes of Natural Sciences]] for the operation of [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALMA Trilateral Agreement Signed|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15097/|accessdate=21 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222145419/http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15097/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Collaboration in technology encompasses a broad range of tools that enable groups of people to work together including social networking, instant messaging, team spaces, web sharing, audio conferencing, video, and telephony. Many large companies adopt collaboration platforms to allow employees, customers and partners to intelligently connect and interact.

Enterprise collaboration tools focus on encouraging [[collective intelligence]] and staff collaboration at the organization level, or with partners. These include features such as staff networking, expert recommendations, information sharing, expertise location, [[peer feedback]], and real-time collaboration. At the personal level, this enables employees to enhance social awareness and their profiles and interactions Collaboration encompasses both asynchronous and synchronous methods of communication and serves as an umbrella term for a wide variety of software packages. Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous collaboration is web conferencing, but the term can encompass IP telephony, instant messaging, and rich video interaction with telepresence, as well.

The effectiveness of a collaborative effort is driven by three critical factors:

* Communication
* Content Management
* Workflow

==== The Internet ====
The Internet's low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made collaborative work dramatically easier. Not only can a group cheaply communicate, but the wide reach of the Internet allows groups to easily form, particularly among dispersed, niche participants. An example of this is the [[free software movement]] in software development which produced [[GNU]] and [[Linux]] from scratch and has taken over development of [[Mozilla]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] (formerly known as [[Netscape Communicator]] and [[StarOffice]]).

==== Commons-based peer production ====
[[Commons-based peer production]] is a term coined by [[Yale]] Law professor [[Yochai Benkler]] to describe a new model of economic production in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated (usually with the aid of the internet) into large, meaningful projects, mostly without hierarchical organization or financial compensation. He compares this to firm production (where a centralized decision process decides what has to be done and by whom) and [[Market economy|market-based production]] (when tagging different prices to different jobs serves as an attractor to anyone interested in doing the job).

Examples of products created by means of commons-based peer production include [[Linux]], a [[computer]] [[operating system]]; [[Slashdot]], a news and announcements website; [[Kuro5hin]], a discussion site for technology and culture; [[Wikipedia]], an online [[encyclopedia]]; and [[Clickworkers]], a collaborative scientific work. Another example is [[Socialtext]], a software solution that uses tools such as wikis and weblogs and helps companies to create a collaborative work environment.

==== Massively distributed collaboration ====
The term [[Mass collaboration|massively distributed collaboration]] was coined by [[Mitchell Kapor]], in a presentation at [[UC Berkeley]] on 2005-11-09, to describe an emerging activity of [[wiki]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s and [[blog]]s and other content-creating [[virtual communities]] online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3130">'''Cornelis de Heem''' (8 April 1631 (baptized) – 17 May 1695 (buried) &lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36837]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[still-life]] painter associated with both [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Sam Segal, "Cornelis (Jansz.) de Heem," ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 21 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of a large family of still-life specialists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Cornelis+de+heem&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;page=1&amp;subjectid=500018142 Getty Union name Index] explicates the relationships (though clearly erroneous in one of the Jan Jansz. birth-dates)&lt;/ref&gt; of which his father, [[Jan Davidszoon de Heem]] (1606–1684), was the most significant.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Segal, "Jan Davidsz. de Heem," ''[[Grove Art Online]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 21 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelis was [[baptise]]d in [[Leiden]] on 8 April 1631,&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; and moved with his family to Antwerp in 1636. He appears to have been trained by his father in Antwerp, who, like him, was born in the [[Dutch Republic]] but died in the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Jan's subsequent career, like many painters—especially after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648—moved fluidly between the two traditionally-connected areas of the north and south [[Low Countries]]. He became a member of the [[Antwerp painters' guild]] in 1660, and from 1667 until the late 1680s he was variously active in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[IJsselstein]], and [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; It is often not easy to distinguish the works of the different members of the family, which included his brother [[Jan Janszoon de Heem|Jan Jansz.]], nephew Jan Jansz. II, and son [[David Corneliszoon de Heem|David Cornelisz.]] (1663–after? 1718), who all painted mostly flower and fruit pieces in a similar style and probably often collaborated.&lt;ref&gt;Neil MacLaren, ''The Dutch School, 1600-1800, Volume I'', National Gallery Catalogues'', p. 163-4, 1991, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-947645-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelis's works, however, tend to be small, display a preference for strong blues, and, over time, shifted away from the painterly style preferred by his father.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;  He died in [[Antwerp]], aged 64.

'''DD Chennai''' formerly known as DD Madras  is a state owned TV channel telecasting from [[Doordarshan]] Kendra [[Chennai]].

==History==
[[File:Madras TV Tower.jpg|thumb|210px|Television tower of Doordarshan Kendra, Chennai]]
Doordarshan Kendra Chennai was inaugurated on 15 August 1975. The service had been extended to the entire state in phased manner by installing Terrestrial Transmitters of different capacities ( HPTs, LPTs, VLPTs ) at different parts of the state. Only one channel with limited time for regional language i.e. Tamil was telecasted, the duration of the entire telecast was not for 24 hours. During 1985 colour transmission was started; in 1988 a second channel was started. Meanwhile, in 1986 Tamil serials were telecasted for the first time.   
 
DD Chennai is one of the oldest kendras in the country, having been begun in the mid- 1970s.

In addition to the Terrestrial transmission, Chennai programmes were beamed through satellite and cable networks. The channel is owned and operated by [[Doordarshan]], a television network of [[Prasar Bharati|Prasar Bharati Broadcasting Corporation]] and is based in Chennai, India. Prasar Bharati is an autonomous corporation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India and comprises Doordarshan television network and [[All India Radio]].

===The Early Years===

The channel began broadcast on an experimental basis on 15 August 1975 from a makeshift studio at Chennai Doordarshan Kendra in [[Chennai]] as part of [[All India Radio]]. It started with 20 TV receivers in and around Chennai and transmitted one-hour educational and developmental programs twice a week. Regular daily transmission started in 1975.

In 1976, the [[Government of India|Indian government]] constituted Doordarshan, the public television broadcaster, as a separate Department under the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. 
Doordarshan Kendra chennai has transformed from the initial setup of Television Base Production Center during 1975.

Television Base Production Center was established for SITE ( Satellite Instructional Television Experiment ) Project conducted from 1975 to 1976. This Experiment was envisaged by Govt. of India to Educate rural population by producing and telecasting Area Specific Programmes on the subjects ranging from Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Health &amp; Nutrition and Adult Education through Satellite. Based on research villages had been selected to install DR Sets ( Direct Reception Sets ) viewing Telecasts. This experiment was conducted Tamil Nadu and other five states.

These programmes were telecast through "ATS – 6" Satellite borrowed from NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, USA).
On successful completion of SITE Project, these programmes were continued as INSAT project and was telecast through India’s own Satellite INSAT.
In addition to the Terrestrial transmission, chennai programmes were beamed through satellite and Cable Networks.

==Technology==

*'''DD Chennai to relay on "high definition" signal:'''
The country's largest public broadcaster, Doordarshan Kendra Chennai was under the process of modernization during the forthcoming commonwealth games, DD would relay its signals on latest technology of High Definition.

"Process of establishing four Regional DD studios including, DD Delhi, DD Mumbai, DD Kolkata and DD Chennai is already on and well before the coming commonwealth games it will be ready"
The High Definition studios would help to relay digital signal to all the viewers of DD as it would drastically improve the quality of picture and sound of the channel.

Process of digitalization of the transmission system was already under process and it was expected that in the years to come the process would be completed, DD adding that for the modernization of the DD, new equipments were being purchased.

== Criticisms ==

=== Citiations of Bias ===
*Doorsharshan does not have an independent editorial control unlike the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. Prasar Bharathi, its parent body has all board members appointed by the [[Government of India]] acting through the Information and Broadcasting Ministry. This control is evident in a budget that allows expenditure on "propaganda and public relations".
*It has been actively used especially during the [[Indian Emergency|Emergency]] for government propaganda.
*In 2004, it censored the airing of a controversial documentary on [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], one of the opposition leaders during the Emergency.
*DD National broadcasts a programme 'Pakistan Reporter' which reports on the events in Pakistan with an active propaganda tilt. The introduction voice over proclaims that Pakistan has enough to worry about and goes on to portray Pakistan as unstable.
*It has in association with All India Radio established high power transmitters along the India-Pakistan Border to counter Pakistani propaganda with its own.
*During Operation Bluestar, only government sources were used for reporting the story. Here Doordarshan was complicit in the production of a video that claimed acts of violence which when investigated by independent journalists were found to be false.
*Sporadic efforts to boost regional Kendra channels like DD Chennai's programming fare over the last year or two have floundered. Currently its transmission is bad, its programming is uninspiring, and its packaging of the channel's regional fare pretty dismal. Serial makers cannot get sponsors, because the kind of viewership the regional Kendra has does not get advertisers. Hindustan Lever, the biggest advertiser on television, is slowly deserting both the satellite and terrestrial Tamil programmes on DD.

'''Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn''' (Cross of Honour of the Order of the Dannebrog) ([[post-nominals]]: D.Ht.) is a meritous award connected to the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Order of the Dannebrog]]. The cross was instituted by King [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway]] on 28 June 1808, and was named '''Dannebrogsmændenes Hæderstegn''' (D.M.) until 1952.

The cross may be awarded to Danes who have provided a service to "the fatherland" through a noble deed. It is also worn by the individual members of the royal family. The cross is of lesser rank than the Order of the Dannebrog, but is considered an additional recognition if awarded (and in modern times it is only awarded) to someone who is already a holder of the Order.

The cross is identical to the knight's cross of the Order of the Dannebrog, except in plain silver; it is worn on a ribbon (gentlemen) or bow (ladies) of the Order, white with red edges, nowadays with [[Rosette (decoration)|rosette]], on the left chest.

[[File:DeVirgaDetail.jpg|thumb|400px|The '''De Virga world map''' (1411–1415)]]

The '''De Virga world map''' was made by [[Albertinus de Virga]] between 1411 and 1415. The map contains a mention in small letters:
:''"A. 141.. Albertin diuirga me fecit in vinexia"
:"Made by Albertinius de Virga in [[Venice]] in 141.." 
(the last digit of the date is erased by a fold in the map)
 
Albertinus de Virga, a Venetian, is also known for a 1409 map of the Mediterranean, also made in Venice.

The map disappeared, together with its owners, a Jewish family from Heidelberg, at the end of the 1930s.

==Structure==
[[File:DeVirgaWorldMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The full map, with calendar plates.]]
The map is circular with a diameter of 410 mm. It is drawn on a piece of [[parchment]] 696×440 mm which also includes a calendar and two tables. One table was for calculating lunar changes, the other the date of Easter.&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, Antoine "Monumenta Cartographica Vetustioris Aevi, Vol. I. Mappaemundi. Mappemondes A. D. 1200–1500.

The map is oriented to the North, with a wind rose centered in Central Asia, possibly the observatory of [[Ulugh Beg]] in the [[Mongol]] city of [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]], or the western shore of the [[Caspian sea]]. The wind rose divides the map into eight sectors.

The map is colored: the seas are left white, although the [[Red Sea]] is colored in red. Continental land is colored in yellow, and several colors are used for islands. The mountains are in brown, the lakes are in blue, and rivers are in brown.

The extension shows a calendar with depictions of the signs of the [[zodiac]] and a table to calculate lunar positions.

The map is generally consistent with the [[Fra Mauro map]] (1457), also drawn before the rounding of the [[Cape of Good Hope]], which is currently on display in Venice.

==Regions==
The ocean surrounding the continental mass bears the mention "Mari Oziano Magno".

Jerusalem is indicated (Jordan and Gorlan), although not at the exact center of the map. The three continents are rather clearly represented, and labeled "Europa", "Africa" and "Axia". The [[Indian Ocean]] contains many colored islands, in a style reminiscent of Arab maps.

===Atlantic Ocean===
The [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] and the [[Azores]] are depicted, showing an influence by Genoese and Catalan nautical maps.&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, Antoine "Monumenta Cartographica Vetustioris Aevi, Vol. I. Mappaemundi. Mappemondes A. D. 1200–1500. Catalogue préparé par la Commission des Cartes Anciennes de l'Union Géographique Internationale by Marcel Destombes" ''Imago Mundi'' Vol. 22 (1968), pp. 121–126 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1150447]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Africa contains depictions of the [[Atlas mountains]] and the [[Nile river]], with mention of the territory of [[Prester John]] ("Pre. Joanes") in [[Ethiopia]].

The [[Garden of Eden]] is depicted at the southernmost tip of Africa with the symbol of two concentric rings, from which emerge the four rivers mentioned in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].

===Asia===
The locations described in Asia are consistent with [[Mongols|Mongolian]] rule: ''Medru'', ''Calcar'', ''Monza sede di sedre'' ("the Mangi of northern China"), and ''Bogar Tartarorum'' ("the Great Bulgarian" or "[[Golden Horde]]"). On the emplacement of [[Karakorum]], fortifications are depicted, with the mention "M[on]gol". The names shown for Chinese rivers and cities are those used by [[Marco Polo]].

The shores of the Indian Ocean contain show the kingdoms of Mimdar and Madar ([[Zamorin|Malabar]]?) and probably [[Sri Lanka]] with the mention "Ysola d alegro suczimcas magna".  A large island in the Indian Ocean labelled "Caparu sive Java magna" possibly combines Marco Polo's descriptions of Java and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Edson, Evelyn ''The World Map, 1300–1492'' The Johns Hopkins University Press; illustrated edition (30 May 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8589-1}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In northern Europe, various places are mentioned, such as "Ogama, Goga" [[Gog and Magog]], "Rotenia" [[Russia]], Naia, Samolica, and a peninsula or promontory showing the southern end of "Norveca" [[Norway]]. Iceland/Thule is not named or shown on the map.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, Kirsten "Cartographic controversy: Albertin de Virga and the Far North" ''Mercator's World'' 2:6, 1997 [https://web.archive.org/web/20030118140023/http://www.mercatorsworld.com/article.php3?i=41]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the map==
The map was re-discovered in a second-hand bookshop in 1911 in [[Šibenik]], [[Croatia]] by Albert Figdor, an art collector. Albert Figdor died 1927 in Vienna. The map was analyzed by Doctor Professor Franz von Wieser, of the [[University of Vienna]]. Authenticated photographs were taken, which are today in the [[British Library]].

In literature, there are hints that the map was retracted from the auction (piece no. 56, 14/15.June 1932) by the auction-house Gilhofer and Ranschburg (Alpenstrasse nr.6) in [[Lucerne]]. The story is not clear. The map later disappeared with its owners a Jewish family from [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Edson, Evelyn, ''The world map, 1300-1492.

'''Dish Network Corporation''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Multichannel television|television provider]]. Based in [[Meridian, Colorado|Meridian]], [[Colorado]], it is the owner of the [[Satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] provider '''Dish''' (stylized '''DISH''', formerly and still commonly known as '''Dish Network'''), and the [[Over-the-top media services|over-the-top]] [[IPTV]] service [[Sling TV]]. {{as of|November 2016}}, the company provided services to 13.7 million television and 580,000 broadband subscribers.&lt;ref name=2016results&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/DISH/4041188784x0xS1558370-17-748/1001082/filing.pdf|title=DISH Network Corporation Form 10-K|publisher=Dish Network|date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has approximately 17,000 employees.&lt;ref name="10-K" /&gt;

== History ==
In January 2008, Dish Network was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from its former parent company [[EchoStar]], which was founded by [[Charlie Ergen]] as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980.&lt;ref name=dishnetworkprofile/&gt; The company began using Dish Network as its consumer brand in March 1997{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} after the successful launch of its first satellite, [[EchoStar I]], in December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://about.dish.com/company-info|title=Company Info {{!}} About DISH|website=about.dish.com|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=23754|title=Technical details for satellite ECHOSTAR 1|website=N2YO.com - Real Time Satellite Tracking and Predictions|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; That launch marked the beginning of its [[Subscription business model|subscription]] television services, and EchoStar has since launched numerous satellites, with nine owned and leased satellites in its fleet as of January 2013. EchoStar continues to be the primary technology partner to Dish Network.

Joseph Clayton became president and [[chief executive officer]] of the company in June 2011,&lt;ref name="Avery 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avery|first=Greg|title=New Dish Network CEO sees changed company soon|journal=Business Journal|date=16 May 2011|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2011/05/16/ergen-leaving-as-president-ceo-of-dish.html|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Charlie Ergen remained chairman.

Dish Network officially began operations on March 4, 1996, as a service of EchoStar. EchoStar, a precursor to Dish Network, was formed in 1980 by its [[chairman]] and chief executive officer, [[Charlie Ergen]] along with colleagues Candy Ergen and Jim Defranco,&lt;ref name=dishnetworkprofile&gt;{{Citation
 |title=At a Glance |work=DISH Network Press Center |publisher=DISH Network |url=http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8789 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721175637/http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8789 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a distributor of [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] satellite television systems. In 1987, EchoStar applied for a [[Satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] [[broadcast license]] with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west [[longitude]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Growth of Dish Network |url=http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8777 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714065003/http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8777 |archivedate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of [[News Corporation]] and [[MCI Communications|MCI]] Worldcom, called ASkyB (for ''[[Sky plc|American Sky Broadcasting]]'', named after News Corp's [[Sky UK|BSkyB]] service in Britain); the two companies had nearly merged (which called for Dish Network being renamed Sky) before it was called off due to Charlie Ergen's clashes with News Corp. executives. With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° West orbital slot, more than doubling existing [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]] broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million; some of the other assets were picked up by rival [[PrimeStar]], which was sold to DirecTV in 1999. The acquisition (which also included an uplink center in [[Gilbert, Arizona]]) inspired the company to introduce a multi satellite system called Dish 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one Dish. In the same year, EchoStar, partnering with [[Bell Canada]], launched [[Bell TV|Dish Network Canada]].

On December 7, 2007, EchoStar announced that it would spin off its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, after which the remainder of the company would be renamed Dish Network Corporation. The spun-out EchoStar began trading on January 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Hachman |first1=Mark |date=December 7, 2007 |title=Echostar to Change Name to DISH, Spin off Set-Tops |trans-title= |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2230153,00.asp |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=Ziff Davis |access-date=December 1, 2017 |via= |subscription= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/echostar-spinoff-begins-trading/|title=EchoStar Spinoff Begins Trading|work=DealBook|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisitions and expansion ===
In 2011, Dish Network spent over $3 billion in acquisitions of companies in bankruptcy,&lt;ref name="Sherman &amp; Grover"&gt;{{cite news |title=A Deeper Dish Network|first1=Alex|last1=Sherman|first2=Ronald|last2=Grover |date=October 13, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-deeper-dish-network-10132011.html |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[The Motley Fool]]'s Anders Bylund described as "a veritable buying rampage in the bargain bin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is DISH Building the Perfect Beast? |author=Anders Bylund |work=Motley Fool |date=July 1, 2011 |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2011/07/01/is-dish-building-the-perfect-beast.aspx |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the April 6, 2011, purchase of [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Inc.]] in a bankruptcy auction in New York, agreeing to pay $322 million in cash and assume $87 million in liabilities and other obligations for the nationwide video-rental company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/07/business/la-fi-ct-dish-blockbuster-20110407|title=Dish Network wins bidding for assets of bankrupt Blockbuster |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times|first=Ben|last=Fritz|date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dish Network also acquired the defunct companies DBSD and [[TerreStar Corporation|Terrestar]].&lt;ref name="Sherman &amp; Grover"/&gt; Dish Network also made a bid to purchase [[Hulu]] on October 2011, but Hulu's owners chose not to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hulu no longer for sale, owners say |author=Ryan Nakashima |date=October 14, 2011 |work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2011-10-14/hulu-not-for-sale/50770090/1 |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also speculation that Dish Network might purchase [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint Nextel]] or [[Clearwire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dish Network Looks Ready To Dance With Clearwire or Sprint |date=September 27, 2011 |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2011/09/27/dish-looks-ready-to-dance-with-clearwire-or-sprint/ |accessdate=October 14, 2011 |first=Great |last=Speculations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Dish made a bid for both companies. CEO Charles Ergen plans on adding wireless internet and mobile video services{{when|date=June 2018}} that can compete with [[Netflix]] and cable companies.&lt;ref name="Sherman &amp; Grover"/&gt; About the new markets, Ergen said, "Given the assets we've been accumulating, I don't think it's hard to see we're moving in a different direction from simply pay-TV, which is a market that's becoming increasingly saturated."&lt;ref name="Sherman &amp; Grover"/&gt;

Dish Network put its Blockbuster acquisition to work by making available Dish Movie Pack for Dish Network subscribers and [[Sling TV]] for non-Dish Network subscribers. Blockbuster also has agreements that allow it to receive movies 28 days before [[Netflix]] and [[Redbox]] which could encourage customers to use these services.&lt;ref name="Sherman &amp; Grover"/&gt;

Dish Network also plans on offering high-speed internet.{{when|date=June 2018}} The company plans a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile broadband service. In 2011, it petitioned the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to combine the S-Band spectrum it acquired from DBSD and Terrestar, and combine this spectrum with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]. Unlike [[LightSquared]], Dish's spectrum has minimal risk of disrupting [[Global Positioning System]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dish's wireless plan unveiled: satellite-terrestrial LTE-Advanced network |author=Phil Goldstein |date=August 23, 2011 |work=Fierce Wireless |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/dishs-wireless-plan-unveiled-satellite-terrestrial-lte-advanced-network/2011-08-23 |accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Dish Network announced a corporate rebranding, under which the company would publicly refer to itself as just "Dish" rather than "Dish Network".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vuong | first = Andy | title = Dish reboots business at the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show | newspaper = Denver Post | date = January 10, 2012 | url = http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_19708554 | accessdate =March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After changing the position of a satellite orbital position from being over [[Mexico]] to [[Brazil]] in 2011, Dish Network sought companies that could make a deal, among them [[Telefónica]]. However, nothing ever came of this, and Dish decided to enter the country itself. According to the [[National Telecommunications Agency (Brazil)|Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications]] (Anatel), they await the authorization of the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiziack|first=Julio|title=TV paga terá novo competidor estrangeiro|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/1249150-tv-paga-tera-novo-competidor-estrangeiro.shtml|work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|publisher=Folha.com|date=20 March 2013|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services and devices ==
Dish's main service is satellite television. Its offerings are similar to other satellite and cable companies. Viewers can choose from a series of service bundles, paying more money for more channels. A la carte programming is available, however limited other than premium channels. The company is currently working on diversifying its offerings. With its purchase of [[Blockbuster LLC]], it now owns the Blockbuster trademarks and has used its intellectual property agreement to offer streaming and mail-order video services.

=== DishNET ===
{{See also|Satellite Internet access}}
On September 27, 2012, Dish Network announced a satellite broadband service called DishNET, aimed at rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3417404/dish-national-satellite-broadband-rural|title=Dish launching satellite broadband service aimed at rural areas on October 1st|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical information ==
=== Broadcast technology ===
While for years Dish Network has used standard [[MPEG-2]] for broadcasting, the addition of bandwidth-intensive HDTV in a limited-bandwidth world has called for a change to an [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] system. Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. Dish Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, Dish Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as [[HD Lite]] and is practiced by other TV providers as well.

Both a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) are available to subscribers. The Dish Network ViP722 HD DVR (Record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD), up to 55 hours of high-definition (HD)) replacement to the ViP622 has received generally positive reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-video-recorders-dvrs/Dish-network-vip622-hd/4505-6474_7-31778299.html |title=Dish Network ViP622 HD DVR Digital Video Recorder (DVR) reviews |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2006 |author=David Katzmaier |author2=John P. Falcone}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[CNET]] and others.

Both a standard receiver and a DVR (digital video recorder) are available to subscribers for an upgrade fee. Beginning in January 2010, Dish Network charges $7.00 as a DVR service fee, which covers cost of licensing EPG (electronic program guide) listings from [[Rovi Corporation]], with the ''[[TV Guide]]'' logo displayed on listings screens to signify the partnership.

==== High-definition television (HDTV) ====
In January 1999, the company released the industry's first [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) [[tuner (television)|tuner]]. In August 2003, the company launched EchoStar IX, the first satellite equipped with commercial Ka band payload for broadband service over the United States. This led the company in 2004 to be the first satellite TV service to offer local channels to all 50 states. In that year, the company also introduced the nation's first interactive TV multiple picture-in picture application for the Olympic Games, offering coverage from multiple channels at once. This year the company also acquired its ten millionth customer.

In January 2005, EchoStar bought the broadcasting assets of the troubled HDTV satellite provider [[Voom]], including its Rainbow 1 satellite co-located with EchoStar 3 at 61.5° West. On April 29, EchoStar announced that it would expand its HDTV programming by adding the first 10 of 21 original Voom channels and mirror the channels on a CONUS slot. Dish Network added CNN HD in Spanish along with other packages in its Latino HD lineup.

=== Receivers and devices ===
==== Satellite antennas ====
Dish Network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining [[Wiktionary:signal|signals]] from its diverse satellite fleet. Most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]] to [[EchoStar]] specifications. Prior to the December 2001 merger of SCI Systems and Sanmina, Dish Network receivers were produced at factories in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama and [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]], Colorado. Currently,{{When|date=November 2009}} receiver assembly takes place in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico and [[India]].

==== Earlier satellite dishes ====
Dish Network's first [[Satellite dish|satellite antenna]] was simply called the "Dish Network" Dish. It was retroactively named the "Dish 300" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming Dish 500 systems. It uses one [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] to obtain signals from the 119°W orbital location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.Dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080117031239/http://www.dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 17, 2008 |title=Dish 300 and 500 Pointing Guide |publisher=Dish Network |format=PDF |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was commonly used as a second Dish to receive additional high-definition or ethnic programming from either the 148°W or 61.5°W orbital locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |title=Channels at 61.5°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095710/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |title=Channels at 148°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095705/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 119°W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110°W, that provide core services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |title=Channels at 110°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013237/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |title=Channels at 119°W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219040945/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and [[MCI Inc.|MCI WorldCom]], it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110°W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119°W orbital location it developed the Dish 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one Dish and an innovative dual-[[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] assembly. Although the new 20-inch Dish 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch Dish 300 and DirecTV Dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The Dish 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to Dish 500, Dish Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the Dish 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are [[H2 (TV channel)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], [[The Science Channel|Science]], [[Destination America|Planet Green]], [[Sprout (TV network)|PBS Kids Sprout]] and [[Comedy Central]].

==== Higher capacity satellite dishes ====
[[File:Dish 1000.2.jpg|thumb|Dish 1000.2 (with TurboHD branding) mounted on a residential apartment railing]]
In spite of all this capacity, EchoStar still needed to fulfill the dream of nationwide [[high-definition television]] and conceived the Dish 1000 system to receive signals from 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations. Originally, Dish Network high-definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes. Currently, Dish Network subscribers can receive nationwide HDTV channels using the 129°W orbital location or 61.5°W orbital location. Because of issues with low signal strength, the older model Dish 1000 has been replaced with the Dish 1000.2. The 1000.2 has a 10% larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated LNB for easier installation. The Dish 1000.2 is {{convert|23|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Even with the larger size, there are still many reports of customers consistently losing signal on the 129°W orbital location. This has forced some customers to either use a 2nd separate Dish Network brand dish, or an aftermarket 30" dish, aimed specifically at the 129°W orbital location. On several satellite related web support forums, customers have critically suggested that the new Dish 1000.2 wasn't nearly large enough and should have been 20–30% larger to properly deal with rain fade. Later Dish Network took the approach of splitting the US into two regions. Subscribers west of Chicago use Dish 1000.2 antennas aimed at the 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations (referred to as the western arc). Subscribers east of Chicago use Dish 1000.4 antennas aimed at the 61.5°W, 72°W and 77°W orbital locations (referred to as the eastern arc).

[[File:SuperDISH121.jpg|left|thumb|SuperDish 121 mounted on a roof]]
During Dish Network's quest for capacity, they had accumulated an array of satellite broadcasting technologies, orbital locations, and surplus capacity using non-mainstream technologies requiring larger dish sizes. To capitalize on these broadcasting assets, Dish Network started providing extensive ethnic programming from lower-powered satellites broadcasting in the non-DBS portion of the FSS band. Dish Network offers specialized equipment for these customers including larger dish antennas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The [[SuperDish]], Dish 500+, and Dish 1000+ systems receive DBS signals from both of the primary 110°W and 119°W locations (129°W for Dish 1000+) as well as lower-powered FSS signals from either 121°W, 105°W, or 118.75°W. The Dish 500+ and 1000+ systems receive circularly polarized signals in the non-DBS portion of the FSS band—the only American satellite television service to do so.

==== Tailgater ====
Tailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350, The Tailgater is now being supported by a Wally receiver, to replace the still supported 211k model. Customers only need pay for the period of time where the receiver is active on the account, monthly cost for a Vip211k or Wally is $7 per month, if the receiver is the only one on the account, there is no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/dish-network-tailgater-portable-satellite|title=Dish Network Tailgater Portable Satellite Weighs Just 10lbs|first=|last=http://www.gadgetreview.com/|date=2 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It weighs ten pounds, is protected from weather, and automatically searches for a signal. The only satellites that are currently compatible with the Tailgater are at Dish's 119 (SD/HD TV), 110 (SD/HD TV), and 129 (SD/HD TV) orbital slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2392032,00.asp|title=DISH Launches 'Tailgater,' a Robotic Mobile Satellite TV Antenna|last=Hachman|first=Mark|work=[[PC Magazine]]|date=2011-08-29|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopper is a line of multi-tuner set-top boxes first introduced in 2012; they are [[digital video recorder]]s that can be networked with accompanying "Joey" set-top boxes for multi-room access to recordings. Dish Network subsequently introduced updated versions of the Hopper, including Hopper with Sling (which adds integrated [[placeshifting]] capabilities), and the Hopper 3, which features [[4K resolution|4K]] support and 16 tuners.

==== Sling TV ====
{{Main|Sling TV}}

In May 2012, Dish launched DishWorld, a subscription-based [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[internet television|streaming]] [[IPTV]] service, as an app on [[Roku]] devices, offering access to over 50 international television channels via [[broadband]] streaming.&lt;ref name=bandc-dishworld&gt;{{cite web|title=DishWorld Launches on Roku|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/technology/dishworld-launches-roku/49281|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dish Network began to reach carriage deals with broadcasters for a new over-the-top service that would be aimed towards [[cord cutter]]s as a low-cost alternative to traditional pay television.&lt;ref name=variety-scrippsott&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Adds Food Network, HGTV and Other Scripps Cable Nets to Internet TV Lineup|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/dish-adds-food-network-hgtv-and-other-scripps-cable-nets-to-internet-tv-lineup-1201306655/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2015, Dish Network officially unveiled [[Sling TV]], an over-the-top IPTV service designed to compliment subscription video on-demand services such as [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref name=variety-slingunveil&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Unveils Internet Pay-TV Service, Sling TV, Starting at $20 per Month|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/dish-unveils-internet-pay-tv-service-sling-tv-starting-at-20-monthly-1201392262/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some broadcasters have been hesitant about over-the-top services such as Sling TV, showing concern that they may undermine their carriage deals with larger conventional [[cable television|cable]], [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] and Internet TV providers. Time Warner initially noted that the carriage of its channels on the service was only for a "trial" basis, while both Time Warner's CEO [[Jeffrey Bewkes]] and an analyst from the firm [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie Capital]] disclosed that current contract language in Dish's OTT carriage deals with the service's content distributors would cap the number of subscribers that the service is allowed to have at any given time to 5 million. Neither Dish Network or its content providers have confirmed any such cap.&lt;ref name="SlingCap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Sling TV Subscriber Cap Revealed|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2480368,00.asp|author=David Murphy|periodical=PC Magazine|publisher=Ziff Davis|date=April 5, 2015|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-unveil&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Unveils Sling TV|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/technology/dish-unveils-sling-tv/386592|author=Mike Farrell|website=Multichannel News|publisher=NewBay Media|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thestreet-toopopular&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Network Doesn't Want Sling TV to Become Too Popular|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13004971/1/dish-network-doesnt-want-sling-tv-to-become-too-popular.html|author=Jeff Berman|website=TheStreet|date=January 9, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|October 2016}}, the service has approximately 1 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-26/dish-s-sling-tv-service-seen-exceeding-1-million-subscribers|title=Dish’s Sling Seen Passing 1 Million Users in Cord-Cutting Race|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms and controversies ==
{{Main|Criticism of Dish Network}}
Since the early 2000s, Dish Network received criticism regarding controversial technology and carriage disputes with programming providers. Most notably, when the Hopper digital video recorder provided an easy way for viewers to watch certain programming without [[Television advertisement|commercials]], major [[Television network|networks]] sued Dish Network.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/business/media/dish-networks-hopper-cuts-ads-and-causes-tremors-at-tv-upfronts.html?pagewanted=all|title=A DVR Ad Eraser Causes Tremors at TV Upfronts|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-05-16|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AutoHop ===
Dish Network's Hopper [[digital video recorder]], announced in January 2012, led to controversy over a feature, called "AutoHop", which allows viewers to watch some programming without commercials, subject to time restrictions.

AutoHop is an extension of the DVR's prime time recording capability. When enabled, the feature records but hides commercials, giving viewers the option of viewing prime time programming on the four major networks commercial-free. Commercials cannot be skipped until 1 am [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and the viewer must choose to do this. Recorded programs are available for eight days after they have aired. News of AutoHop met with an immediate, polarized response. The feature was deemed a "dream come true" for consumers, but for networks, a nightmare undercutting the revenue model. Dish asserted that AutoHop would encourage its customers to sample new programming. [[Les Moonves|Leslie Moonves]], CBS chief executive, asked rhetorically how he is to produce ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' without the revenue stream of commercials. [[News Corporation]] refused to accept Dish advertising for the device. A [[Forrester Research]] analyst said the move demonstrated Dish's desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the Internet.&lt;ref name=Bauder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/auto-hop-dish-network-dvr_n_1536992.html|title=Auto Hop Ad Zapper: Dish's New DVR Feature Has TV Networks Worried|last=Bauder|first=David|agency=Associated Press|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DishRelease_DishSues&gt;{{cite news|title=DISH Sues Networks in Federal Court|url=http://dish.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=676918|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Dish's press release|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120525-713036.html |title=Moody's: Dish's Ad-Skipping 'Auto Hop' Could Hurt TV Industry |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |agency=[[Dow Jones Newswires]] |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604014657/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120525-713036.html |archivedate=June 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy surrounding AutoHop contributed to one small-market station group, [[Hoak Media]] Corporation, removing its 14 stations channels from the service on June 6, 2012. In negotiations, Hoak sought a 200 percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the AutoHop feature. David Shull, Dish senior vice president of programming, accused Hoak of effectively telling Dish's customers that they must watch commercials, disrespecting customer control over its services. Eight days later, the two companies announced a distribution deal. Terms were not disclosed.&lt;ref name=nyt-hoak-autohop&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Dish claims broadcaster pulled signals in part because of AutoHop|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-dish-hoak-20120606,0,1493640.story?track=rss|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ljs-hoakautohop&gt;{{cite web|title=Because of dispute, DISH customers lose Hastings' KHAS-TV|url=http://journalstar.com/business/local/because-of-dispute-dish-custmers-lose-hastings-khas/article_364e9e83-3b1a-5b98-8d85-b41f03d363fa.html|publisher=Lincoln Journal Star|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimesHoakDishSettle&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=Dish Network and Hoak Media reach new deal|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-hoak-20120614,0,7790835.story|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2012, Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen told the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|United States House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]] that the feature would enable parents to protect their children from alcohol and [[fast food advertising]].&lt;ref name=AP_Errgan&gt;{{cite news|title=Dish Networks chairman Ergen says ad-skipping DVR protects kids from junk food, alcohol ads|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/dish-networks-chairman-ergen-says-ad-skipping-dvr-protects-kids-from-junk-food-alcohol-ads/2012/06/27/gJQAMnBH7V_story.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=June 27, 2012}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Michael Petricone of the [[Consumer Technology Association|Consumer Electronics Association]] spoke to the subcommittee, likening Hopper to earlier [[time shifting]] devices. He argued that Hopper is legal and that AutoHop entices people to watch more television, thereby expanding television's market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.twice.com/article/486577-CEA_Supports_AutoHop_Innovation.php |title=CEA Supports AutoHop Innovation |last=Tarr |first=Greg |work=[[Twice (magazine)|TWICE]] |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2012-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704130734/http://www.twice.com/article/486577-CEA_Supports_AutoHop_Innovation.php |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNET]] was also forced by parent company CBS to disqualify the newest ''Hopper with Sling'' model from the [[International CES|CES]] Best in Show award for 2013 because of its active litigation with the company. CEO Joe Clayton said that Dish was "saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy handed tactics."&lt;ref name="hopper-cnet-litigation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish Recorder Snubbed for CNET Award Over CBS Legal Scuffle|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/01/10/dish-recorder-snubbed-for-cnet-award-over-cbs-legal-scuffle/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dish Network directly attacked CBS for its decision in an advertisement for the device on its website. The ad proclaimed the DVR as being CNET's "Best in Show", but with a [[Note (typography)|footnote]] stating that "CBS will go to any lengths to keep you from enjoying ad-skipping technology—even censoring its own writers and throwing out their decision to name Hopper 'Best In Show.' Your vote is the only one that really matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish gives Hopper the award denied to it by CBS|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/18/3891316/dish-gives-hopper-the-ces-award-denied-to-it-by-cbs|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telemarketing violations ===
Dish Network independent dealers have repeatedly been charged and fined for employing illegal telemarketing tactics, such as violating do not call lists and making calls in which a live telemarketer does not connect promptly after the call is answered. Dish Network terminated agreements with some independent dealers in relation to these charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ago.mo.gov/newsreleases/2005/050505.htm |title=Dish Network to pay $50,000 for violating state No Call law |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |date=May 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204170618/http://www.ago.mo.gov/newsreleases/2005/050505.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2006/01/16/story6.html |title=PUC issues warning to Dish Network over do-not-call violations |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |author=Catherine Dominguez |date=January 13, 2006 |work=[[American City Business Journals|San Antonio Business Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/07/Dishtm.shtm |title=FTC Charges Dish Network Marketers with Do Not Call and Abandoned Call Violations |accessdate=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] charged Dish Network and two of its dealers with multiple violations of the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/03/echostar.shtm |title=FTC Charges Dish Network, Formerly Known as EchoStar, with Multiple Do Not Call Violations |date=March 25, 2009 |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Dish Network was fined $280 million by the FTC for Do Not Call Registry violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2017/06/court-orders-280-million-dish-network-largest-ever-do-not|title=Court orders $280 million from Dish Network, largest ever Do Not Call penalty|date=2017-06-08|work=Federal Trade Commission|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hidden fees ===
In January 2004, thirteen states charged that Echostar, then the parent company of Dish Network, had not disclosed termination fees to potential customers and had debited customers' bank accounts for hidden fees. The company settled the lawsuit, paid $5 million, and promised to disclose all terms prior to signing contracts with potential customers.&lt;ref name=wisc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/2788823/detail.html |title=Have A Complaint About Dish Network? |date=January 23, 2004 |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |publisher=Channel 3000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009185351/http://www.channel3000.com/news/2788823/detail.html |archivedate=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dish has also begun to collect shipping fees on equipment that needs to be returned after customers cancel their service with Dish. The shipping cost back in September 2014 was $17. As of June 6, 2017, the shipping cost is now $12. This fee applies regardless of whether the fee was included in the initial contract customers signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nathaniel.themccallums.org/2011/11/30/dish-network-goes-back-on-their-word/|title=Dish Network Goes Back on their Word - Nathaniel McCallum|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123120303/http://nathaniel.themccallums.org/2011/11/30/dish-network-goes-back-on-their-word/|archivedate=23 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
Dish has been sued and countersued dozens of times. In fact, Dish uses litigation as a profit center. Charlie Ergen said, "I may be the only CEO who likes to go to depositions. You can live in a bubble, and you're probably not going to get a disease. But you can play in the mud and the dirt, and you're probably not going to get a disease either, because you get immune to it. You pick your poison, and I think we choose to go play in the mud." In 2001, Dish admitted to using over 100 law firms over a ten-year period.&lt;ref name="Bloomie"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-02/dish-network-the-meanest-company-in-america |title=Dish Network, the Meanest Company in America |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AutoHop ====
On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court, the Dish case in [[Manhattan]] and the networks' cases in [[Los Angeles]]. On May 30, U.S. District Judge [[Laura Taylor Swain]] ruled the networks' cases should not be filed in Los Angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to New York.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-05/dish-s-ad-skip-tool-may-benefit-from-cablevision-dvr-case.html |title=Dish’s Ad-Skip Tool May Benefit From Cablevision DVR Case |last=Jeffrey |first=Don |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 9 [[preliminary ruling|preliminary judgement]], Swain denied Dish's request to set aside the issue of copyright violation, ruling that Dish's argument lacked specificity. She also ruled that the case could be heard in Los Angeles, thereby eliminating New York as a potential venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-hop-venue-20120709,0,7267617.story|title=Networks score in AutoHop fight against Dish|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=July 10, 2012|first=Joe|last=Flint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] denied Fox's motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because 1) PTAT and AutoHop did not infringe copyright and did not breach the contract; and 2) while QA copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract, the harm from the copies was not irreparable, but was compensable with money.&lt;ref name="DistrictCourtOpinion1"&gt;{{Cite court

==== Frequency acquisition subsidies ====
Dish Network received about $3 billion in subsidies from the federal government to buy wireless bandwidth. Dish Network used the 1934 Federal Communications Act to win subsidies for the purchases it made at the January 2015 auction of wireless spectrum. Under the terms of that act, "designated entities" qualify for a 25 percent discount on the market price of such licenses. Dish used small subsidiaries such as Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless in order to qualify. Dish only paid $10 billion for licenses that would have otherwise cost $13 billion. The difference would have been paid to the federal government. The FEC and the United States Senate opened investigations into the matter after numerous public complaints.&lt;ref name="Hoarding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/215589/dish-network-fcc-subsidies/|title=Ergen-omics: Charlie Ergen uses federal subsidies for small businesses to turn his billion-dollar Dish Network into a wireless player - Watchdog.org|date=4 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Off-the-job marijuana use ====
Dish fired a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic man, Brandon Coats, from his job as a telephone operator in 2010 for using medical-marijuana during off-work hours. Coats used marijuana to control muscle spasms. His paralysis was due to injuries from a car crash. Coats failed a random drug test. Coats sued claiming that marijuana use was legal and that he was a model employee. Coats suit relied under a Colorado law called the Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statute that prohibits employers from firing employees for doing legal things during their personal time. The trial court and Colorado Court of Appeals ruled in Coats v. Dish Network that since marijuana is banned by federal law it does not qualify as legal activity despite being permitted by state law. The trial court ruled that Coats should have to pay Dish's legal fees; the appeals court overturned this ruling.&lt;ref name="Pot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23104820/colorado-appeals-court-oks-firing-off-duty-marijuana|title=Colorado court upholds firing for off-the-job medical marijuana use|date=25 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voom ====
In April 2005, [[Rainbow Media]] and Dish Network entered into a 15-year affiliation agreement whereby EchoStar's Dish Network obtained the right to distribute the Voom channels until 2020 and agreed that it would pay Rainbow Media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement. The subscription fees started at $3.25 per subscriber in the first year of the agreement, and were to increase to $6.43 per subscriber by the year 2020.&lt;ref name="Voom Files Against EchoStar"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sat-universe.com/showthread.php?t=70924|title=Voom Files Against EchoStar|journal=Inside Satellite TV|date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate agreement, EchoStar's Dish obtained a 20% ownership interest in Rainbow Media (the business unit that contained the Voom HD channels) and Rainbow agreed to invest $100 million into the Voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/133245-Dish_Lowers_Boom_On_Rest_Of_Voom.php|title=Dish Lowers Boom On Rest Of Voom|journal=Multichannel News|date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, EchoStar's Dish Network announced that they would be adding ten of Voom's original 21 channels to their lineup starting May 1; the remaining channels were added on February 1, 2006.

In January 2008, EchoStar's Dish Network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that Voom had failed to invest $100 million in the service during 2006 although [[Cablevision]] and Rainbow provided Dish Network with the financial statements documenting their compliance. Dish Network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on May 12, 2008, with the remaining five removed the next day,&lt;ref name="Dish Lowers Boom On Rest Of Voom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Dish Network: No Room For Voom|url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6560688.html|publisher = Multichannel News|date = 2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving coverage limited to Cablevision's systems in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and parts of Pennsylvania. Cablevision and Rainbow sued Dish Network for breach of contract and sought more than $2.5 billion in damages. Citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation, Cablevision announced on December 18 that the Voom HD suite would be discontinued as of January 15, 2009, to be replaced by other HD programming.&lt;ref name=voomdone&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/161077-Rainbow_Pulls_Plug_On_Voom_HD_Service.php "Rainbow Pulls Plug On Voom HD Service"] from ''Multichannel.com'' 18 Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (Ultimately, the channels ceased operations on January 20, and were replaced by multiplexed HD content from premium providers.)&lt;ref&gt;Linda Moss, [http://www.multichannel.com/article/162483-Cablevision_Replaces_Voom_Suite_With_Premium_HD_Services.php "Cablevision replaces Voom suite with premium HD services,"] from ''Multichannel News,'' 21 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery process, the court granted Voom's motion for sanctions.&lt;ref name="Van Voris"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-24/echostar-s-egregious-acts-in-destroying-e-mail-threaten-court-defense.html|title=EchoStar's 'Egregious' Acts in Destroying E-Mail Threaten Court Defense|journal=Bloomberg.net
|date=24 November 2010 | first=Bob | last=Van Voris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Supreme Court found that EchoStar's Dish Network "systematically destroyed evidence" in the case and stated that "it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by EchoStar demonstrated that EchoStar knew all along that there was no breach...and would prove Voom's case." The Judge also stated that he would tell jurors that Dish Network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to Voom's case.&lt;ref name="Van Voris"/&gt;

According to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a recent Wall Street Journal article, "cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party." In this case, the judge told the jury that EchoStar failed to preserve certain evidence; he barred Dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444433504577651720795569832 |title=Dolans, Dish Take Old Spat to Court|journal=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 September 2012 | first=Shalini | last=Ramachandran}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the court stated in its November 3, 2010 ruling: "In conclusion, the court notes EchoStar's pattern of egregious conduct and questionable—and, at times, blatantly improper—litigation tactics. EchoStar's spoliation in this action, and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions, is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court. Similarly egregious is EchoStar's last minute finagling with expert reports, believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/docket/2010/11/25/more-on-echostars-questionable-litigation-tactics/|title=More on EchoStar's Questionable Litigation Tactics|journal=Forbes.com
|date=25 November 2010 | first=Geoffrey | last=Manne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial commenced on September 19, 2012 in the New York State Supreme Court. During the summer of 2012, financial analysts who cover Dish urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial, as "the odds would … appear to be heavily in Cablevision's/AMC's favor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/07/11/dish-facing-doom-in-voom-litigation-analysts-say/|title=Dish Facing Doom in Voom Litigation, Analysts Say|journal=PaidContent.org
|date=11 July 2012 | first=Daniel | last=Frankel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dish chose to settle. The terms of the settlement required Dish to pay $700 million for spectrum licenses covering 500 megahertz and capable of serving 150 million people.&lt;ref name="Voom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/21/3535294/dish-voom-hd-settle-amc-programming-return|title=Dish Network and Voom HD settle lawsuit, AMC programming to return as soon as tonight|first=Dan|last=Seifert|date=21 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== TiVo patent lawsuit ====
{{Main|TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp.}}
On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of [[TiVo]]'s technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest. On May 3, 2011, Dish Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo's technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704436004576298854049714800 |author=Steven Russolillo |title=Dish, EchoStar Settle TiVo Patent Litigation |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lawsuit took more than ten years to resolve. One of the judges involved said that the conduct of Dish's lawyers didn't "even meet law-school student behavior," and "presented the saddest day I have seen in my many years in court."&lt;ref name="Bloomie"/&gt;

==== Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar &amp; Scott ====
Dish sued its own law firm, Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar &amp; Scott of Chicago, for malpractice. The firm countersued and won a $40 million judgement against Dish. A panel from the American Arbitration Association said that Dish's allegations were "patently false" and "egregious."&lt;ref name="Bloomie"/&gt;

=== Related party transactions ===
In 2012, Dish invested $500,000 in a technology startup, Yottabyte Ventures LLC, in which Christoper Ergen, the son of CEO Charlie Ergen, has 7.1 percent equity. Yottabytes develops mobile video applications. At the end of 2012, Dish held 71.4% of that company's equity. In 2011, Dish paid $100,000 to an online marketing company that Chase Ergen, another son of Charlie Ergen, owns 50% of. As part of a reseller agreement, Dish paid another firm owned by Chase Ergen $101,000 during 2010 and 2011. Candy Ergen, Charlie Ergen's wife, is paid between $100,000 to $110,000 per year in consulting fees. Other unnamed children of Ergen received about $25,000 in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="Related"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22878463/dishs-spending-ventures-tied-ergen-family-draws-scrutiny|title=Dish’s spending on ventures tied to Ergen family draws scrutiny|date=26 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These transactions were criticized by analysts. Lev Janashvili, managing director at GMI Ratings, which tracks governance, accounting and other risks in publicly traded companies, said, "These are things to be concerned about because they raise reasonable questions about conflicts of interest and the overall integrity of governance at the company." Janashvili also said, "The investment in Yottabytes Ventures LLC is a classic example of (a related party transaction) that warrants a closer scrutiny of the company's governance practices, especially because this transaction is part of a broader pattern of behaviors that run counter to the interests of shareholders. Dish is a 'controlled company' whose majority shareholder can insulate himself from the opinions of other investors."&lt;ref name="Related"/&gt;

=== Investor relations ===
Dish has reportedly been criticized for treating analysts and major shareholders poorly. Craig Moffett, senior analyst of U.S. telecommunications, U.S. cable, and satellite broadcasting at [[AllianceBernstein|Sanford C. Bernstein]] once requested time with management to learn about how Dish does business. Ergen told him, "We're too busy creating value around here to sit down and talk about it. Thanks but no thanks."&lt;ref name="Bloomie"/&gt; Chris Marangi, a money manager for Gamco Investors, which held about four million shares in Dish, said that the company is very uncooperative. He says that despite traveling to Denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with Ergen or any other Dish senior manager. "They're probably the least transparent company of any I've ever dealt with." Dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors, who are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;ref name="Bloomie"/&gt;

=== Carriage disputes involving Dish ===
==== AMC Networks ====
{{see also|AMC Networks#Dish Network carriage dispute}}
On March 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the [[AMC Networks]] family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider's distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in [[retransmission consent]] payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels.&lt;ref name="AMC-Dish"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dishnetwork.com/campaigns/fair_satellite/locals/heritage/default.aspx |title=CORRECTED: DISH subscribers could lose 'Mad Men' in dispute |last=Baker |first=Liana B. |last2=Adegoke |first2=Yinka |date=May 4, 2012 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506195924/http://www.dishnetwork.com/campaigns/fair_satellite/locals/heritage/default.aspx |archivedate=May 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMC Networks responded to Dish's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 [[breach of contract]] lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's [[Voom HD Networks]], in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after).&lt;ref name="Dish Lowers Boom On Rest Of Voom"&gt;{{cite news|title = Dish Lowers Boom On Rest Of Voom|url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6561003.html|publisher = Multichannel News|date = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.&lt;ref name="AMC-Dish"/&gt;

On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, [[WE tv]], and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WE tv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were, respectively, replaced with [[AXS TV|HDNet]], [[Style Network|Style]] and [[MoviePlex]] multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of ''[[Mad Men]]'' urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider with Dish stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2012/06/dish-network-kicks-amc-networks-channels-to-nosebleed-section-of-the-dial/ Dish Network Kicks AMC Networks Channels To Nosebleed Section Of The Dial], ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', June 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2012, Dish dropped the three AMC Networks properties, replacing AMC with HDNet movies, IFC with HDNet (which subsequently became [[AXS TV]] two days later), and WE tv with Style. The move coincided with a new agreement between Dish and [[AT&amp;T U-verse]].&lt;ref name=EngadgetAMC_Dropped&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawler|first=Richard|title=AMC dropped from Dish Network, cuts a new deal to stay on with AT&amp;T U-verse|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/07/01/amc-dish-network-att-uverse/|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=Engadget|date=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2012, AMC said in an e-mailed statement that it would stream over the Internet the season premiere of "Breaking Bad" to DISH customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blessing |first=Kelly |title=amc-to-stream-breaking-bad-premiere-to-dish-customers |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/amc-to-stream-breaking-bad-premiere-to-dish-customers |publisher=Business Week |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713180431/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-12/amc-to-stream-breaking-bad-premiere-to-dish-customers |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Dish subscribers can register online starting July 13 for the show, which airs on July 15. We want to give Dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moraes|first=Lisa de|title=amc-vs-dish-viacom-vs-directv-brawling-satellite-providers-and-cable-companies-take-different-tactics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/amc-vs-dish-viacom-vs-directv-brawling-satellite-providers-and-cable-companies-take-different-tactics/2012/07/12/gJQAGnaLgW_blog.html|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish Lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amcnetworks.com/release_release_press.jsp?nodeid%3D6595 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319162414/http://www.amcnetworks.com/release_release_press.jsp?nodeid=6595 |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.dishnetwork.com/press-releases/dish-network-and-voom-reach-settlement-nasdaq-dish-0944283|title=News - About DISH|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, DISH simultaneously brought back FUSE, and all 4 channels were moved from "America's Top 200" to 120.

====='''Remarks on rural viewers'''=====
During a conference call Ergen stated after being asked about the removal of AMC channels, "Our customers are not looking at zombies in New York City. They live in farms and ranches ... We have data, real data from our customers. And for whatever reason, our customers don't watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper, perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever." Ergen also said "I've had satellite television for as long as satellite television has been around, and there's never been one minute that I know of that anybody in my family or anybody who's came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels. They have no clue about zombies in New York City marching around saying, 'Where is my AMC?'" Soon after the call, ''Business Insider'' blared the headline, "Dish CEO says customers don't care about AMC because they live on 'farms and ranches.'"&lt;ref name="Rural"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3000321/dish-network-says-ranchers-farmers-dont-care-about-amc-so-we-asked-real-ranchers-farmers|title=Dish Network Says Ranchers, Farmers Don't Care About AMC, So We Asked Real Ranchers, Farmers|date=9 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MSG ====
[[MSG (TV channel)|MSG]], a [[regional sports network]] serving [[New York (state)|New York state]], was dropped on October 1, 2010. Although MSG shares ownership with Voom and AMC (all three companies being controlled by the Dolan family), it was not included in the 2012 settlement. As of 2017, the carriage dispute has never been resolved, leaving MSG, its sister networks [[MSG Plus]] and later addition [[MSG Western New York]], unavailable on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/article207853.ece|title=Dish NEtwork Drops MSG|date=2010-10-01|work=Buffalo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fox ====
{{Main|Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network, LLC}}
On December 21, 2014, Dish Network dropped [[Fox News Channel]] and [[Fox Business Network]]. A failed first attempt to reach a deal on the 18th of the same month resulted in the [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fox-news-channels-go-dark-on-dish-as-contract-talks-stall/|title=Fox News channels go dark on Dish as contract talks stall|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two parties blamed each other; Dish said Fox tried to unfairly tie in a sister channel and charge unreasonable rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/news/fox-news-channel-dish-ratchet-211147116.html?.tsrc=lgwnthis|title=Fox News Channel And Dish Ratchet Up War Of Words Over Carriage Talks Stalemate|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox pointed out the recent pattern Dish had created with other networks. A deal was finally reached on January 14, 2015 with undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2015/01/16/fox-news-and-dish-network-finally-come-to-terms/|title=Fox News and Dish Network finally come to terms - Hot Air|date=16 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hearst Television ====
On March 3, 2017, at midnight, ET, Dish network has dropped the [[Hearst Television]]-owned local stations from their line-up. This includes 32 stations in 28 markets, affiliated with [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[The CW]], and [[MyNetworkTV]] in cities including [[Boston]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[New Orleans]]. The stations were restored on April 26, 2017, at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET.

==== Turner Networks ====
On October 21, 2014, during the early morning hours, Dish entered a dispute with [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. Dish removed [[CNN]], [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]], [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Adult Swim]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], [[TruTV]], [[Turner Classic Movies]], and [[CNN en Español]] as the contract to carry those channels expired on October 20. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] were not removed, as they are carried under a different contract. The channels were pulled without warning leaving many with questions.
Dish&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dishstandsforyou.com|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/cnn-cartoon-network-dropped-turner-dish-carriage-dispute-856513/|title=CNN Among Several Turner Networks Dropped By Dish In Carriage Dispute|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=21 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced CNN and HLN with [[MSNBC]], replaced Cartoon Network and Boomerang with [[Nicktoons (United States)|Nicktoons]] (except for the West Feed which was replaced by a message about the removal of the channels), replaced Turner Classic Movies with [[FX Movie Channel|FXM]], and replaced TruTV with [[Esquire Network]] during the duration of the dispute. The dispute was settled and the Turner Network Channels restored on November 21, 2014.

==== CBS ====
On Monday November 20, 2017 at 11:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern, Dish entered a dispute with [[CBS Corporation]]. Dish subscribers lost access to [[CBS Television Stations]] (which own and operate select [[CBS]] and [[The CW]] affiliates in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], among 14 other markets) [[CBS Sports Network]] and [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]] as the contract to carry those channels expired that day. [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], and [[Flix (TV channel)|Flix]] were not affected as the premium networks are carried in a different contract. Dish Network claimed in a statement the following day that "CBS chose to black out Dish customers' access to its channels in an effort to raise rates and gain negotiating leverage." However, CBS rebutted those claims on Wednesday November 22, saying that Dish Network is "desperate to retain subscribers" and "clearly, pulling content providers off the air is Dish's way of doing things."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/11/22/cbs-dish-network-dispute-could-mean-no-cowboys-chargers-game-subscribers/888811001/ CBS, Dish Network dispute could mean no Cowboys-Chargers game for subscribers] - ''[[USA Today]]'' (accessed November 23, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Customers in the Los Angeles and Dallas markets were unable to watch the Thanksgiving Day football game between the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] unless they watched it [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] via a [[Digital terrestrial television|DTV]] [[Television antenna|antenna]]. The TV stations and cable channels were restored on November 24, 2017 after a new agreement was reached.

This wasn't Dish Network's first blackout with CBS. Back in March 2004, Dish briefly removed all of the original [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] assets (including CBS and [[UPN]] O&amp;O TV affiliates before its 2005 split into CBS Corporation) before reaching a new long-term agreement to restore those services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040310005883/en/Viacom-DISH-Network-Reach-Long-Term-Agreement-CBS Viacom and DISH Network Reach Long-Term Agreement; CBS, MTV Networks and BET Restored] - ''[[Business Wire]]'' (published March 11, 2004; accessed November 23, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Univision ====
On June 30, 2018, Dish loses rights to all Univision Networks channels just before 7PM.

'''Globecast''' is a service company for the radio, television and [[media (communication)|media]] industry, providing solutions for media and [[content management]], aggregation, formatting, processing, transmission and distribution. These contents are feeding various television and radio platforms: [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS), [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT), [[cable TV]], [[IPTV]], TV for internet connected screens ([[Internet television|OTT TV]]), [[digital signage]] networks, cinema theaters ([[Digital Cinema Package|DCP]] and live events delivery). Globecast is a key player in this industry, serving the needs for top 100 television broadcasters in the world.

Globecast has an established presence in Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Middle-East and Australia, through nineteen points of presence, among them twelve satellite telecommunication [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleports]] and technical operation centers, all of them linked via an international terrestrial telecommunication network.

The company is fully owned by [[Orange S.A.|Orange]]. It is currently led by Philippe Bernard (previous CEO was Olivier Barberot; and before him Christian Pinon, Alain Baget).

In 2013, Globecast changed its visual identity ([[logo]]) and its name lost the uppercase C (former writing was '''GlobeCast''').

== History ==
* Autumn 1996: in France, activities of [[France Telecom]] in the broadcast industry are split between two new entities: Division Multimedia (DMM) and Division des Entreprises Audiovisuelles (DEA).

The DEA is composed by the [[TDF Group|TDF]] (TéléDiffusion de France) company and Direction des Transmissions Audiovisuelles (DTA). DTA will then become known as GlobeCast.

The DEA also covers:
# the "Audiovisuel International" (AVI) marketing department of France Telecom Réseaux &amp; Services Internationaux (FTRSI);
# the shares of the following companies: 100% of Maxat (UK), 40% of Keystone (USA) and 20% of TIBA (Argentina);
# the services of Direction des Opérations of TDF;
# three operation centers of FTRSI, TDF and the Direction des réseaux Nationaux (DRN);
# the "delegation of the image service", which purpose was the promotion of the '''Telecom 2''' satellite.

== SERTE ==
The technical operation center of Globecast in Paris (France), located at 61 rue des Archives, was long time known as '''SERTE'''. This name is still used sometimes by television professionals, even outside France, because it was used for many years. This technical center is a major routing node for television and radio feeds.

The SERTE acronym used to refer to: Service d'Exploitation Radio Télévision Extérieur (in English, Foreign radio and television operation center).

A brief history of SERTE:
* 1947: creation of Centre des Liaisons Radio-Électriques - CLR
* 1962: first satellite transmission operated at CLR
* 1980: CLR becomes SERTE, the national center, then international, for television and radio transmitions
* 1989: incorporation to the France Télécom group
* since 1980: it is one of the prime international hub for television and radio transmitions, either via satellite and terrestrial telecom networks
* 2002: GlobeCast is incorporated, including the technique operation center in Paris, rue des Archives (ex-SERTE)

== Digital cinema ==
In France, Globecast operates a service to deliver digital film copies ([[Digital Cinema Package|DCP]]) to theaters via terrestrial telecom networks.

== World TV and MyGlobeTV ==

In the USA, Globecast operated a television bouquet via satellite under the name '''[[GlobeCast World TV|World TV]]''' and an internet television bouquet under the name '''MyGlobeTV'''.

The '''Green Party''' ({{lang-cs|Strana zelených}}) is a political party in the [[Czech Republic]].

The party held a single seat ([[Jaromír Štětina]]) in the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (upper house of the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]]) between 2004 and 2010. In the [[Czech legislative election, 2006|2006 legislative election]] the party received 6.3% of the vote and won six seats in the lower house – the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]]. This subsequently led to taking part in the governing coalition, together with the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democrats]] (ODS) and the [[Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]] (KDU–ČSL) from January 2007 to March 2009 (for more details see [[Mirek Topolánek's Second Cabinet]]). However the Green Party was unable to repeat its success in [[Czech legislative election, 2010|2010 elections]], losing all seats in both chambers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">The '''Hasdingi''' were the southern tribes of the [[Vandals]], an [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]].  They lived in areas of today's southern [[Poland]], [[western Ukraine]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. They participated in the migratory movements of the Vandals into the [[Iberian peninsula]], and subsequently to [[North Africa]].

The Hasdingi [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed]] the [[Rhine]] into [[Gaul]] in 406 AD, although their king [[Godigisel]] [[Battle of Mainz (406)|lost his life in battle]] against the [[Franks]] during the crossing. The Hasdingi settled as [[foederati]] in [[Gallaecia]] (today [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]] and the north of [[Portugal]]) along with the [[Suebi]] in 409 AD and their kingdom was one of the earliest [[Barbarian kingdom|Barbarian territories]] to be founded after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

[[Gunderic]], Godegisel's successor as king of the Hasdingi, lost his kingdom to king [[Hermeric]] of the Suebi in 419 after the [[Battle of the Nervasos Mountains]] where the Vandals were overwhelmed by an allied force of Suebi and [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. He fled to [[Baetica]] with his army where he became king of the [[Silingi]] Vandals and of the [[Alans]]. Gunderic was succeeded by his brother [[Genseric]] in 428 AD, who subsequently fled from Iberia to [[North Africa]] where he established a [[Vandal Kingdom|kingdom]] at [[Carthage]].

'''Helen Amanda Fricker''' (born 1969) is a [[glaciologist]] and professor at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at the [[University of California]], San Diego and won the 2010 Martha T. Muse Prize for Science and Policy in Antarctica.

== Early life and education ==
Helen attended [[Altrincham Grammar School for Girls]], where she encountered Melissa Lord, a young and energetic female physics teacher who steered her onto the path of becoming a scientist.&lt;ref name="antarcticsun.usap.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=2247|title=The Antarctic Sun: News about Antarctica – Taking the Prize|website=antarcticsun.usap.gov|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, she received her B.Sc. in Mathematics and Physics from [[University College London]] (UCL), with first-class honours.&lt;ref name="scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/hafricker/biocv|title=Bio|website=Research Profiles|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her final year at UCL, she took an Earth science course from a lecturer, [[Chris Rapley]],  who was leader of the Remote Sensing Group at UCL and would later become the director of the [[British Antarctic Survey]]. Chris Rapley, encouraged her to do a dissertation on using remote-sensing data to track icebergs in the Antarctic during her final year. This course turned her attention toward Antarctica — and got her started on a career in glaciology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2010-09-15|title=Helen Amanda Fricker|url=http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7313-359a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=467|issue=7313|pages=359–359|doi=10.1038/nj7313-359a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned her Ph.D. in glaciology from the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies, [[University of Tasmania]], Australia in 1998. In 1999, Fricker began her work at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] as a postgraduate researcher. Fricker is now a Professor of Geophysics in the Cecil H. and Ida M. Green Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/hafricker|title=Research Profiles|website=Research Profiles|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband Glyn Fricker have three daughters.

== Career and impact ==
Fricker has authored over 80 publications relating to the [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|satellite remote sensing]] of Antarctica's [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]] and active [[Subglacial lake|subglacial lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glaciology.weebly.com/publications.html|title=Publications|website=glaciology.weebly.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker is widely recognized for her discovery of active subglacial lakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fricker|first=Helen Amanda|last2=Scambos|first2=Ted|last3=Bindschadler|first3=Robert|last4=Padman|first4=Laurie|date=2007-03-16|title=An Active Subglacial Water System in West Antarctica Mapped from Space|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5818/1544|journal=Science|language=en|volume=315|issue=5818|pages=1544–1548|doi=10.1126/science.1136897|pmid=17303716|bibcode=2007Sci...315.1544F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has shown that these lakes form dynamic hydrologic systems, where one lake can drain into another in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="antarcticsun.usap.gov"/&gt; Fricker was the first to describe [[Lake Whillans]] in 2007, an active subglacial lake in West Antarctica, which was subsequently the first such environment to be sampled and found to contain life.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130205-antarctica-ice-life-moons-science-environment-lakes/|title=Life Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice for First Time?|date=5 February 2013|publisher=National Geographic Daily News|author=Kaufman, Marc|accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also known for her innovative research into Antarctic ice shelf mass budget processes such as iceberg calving and basal melting and freezing.&lt;ref name="scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu"/&gt; Her research focuses on ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland and their role in the climate system and on subglacial hydrology. She uses a combination of satellite radar and laser altimetry and other remote-sensing data to understand ice sheet processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glaciology.weebly.com/projects.html|title=Projects|website=glaciology.weebly.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some specific processes Fricker investigates include subglacial hydrology by monitoring the activity of subglacial lakes under the ice streams, ice flexure from tidal activity in the grounding zone, basal melting and freezing under the ice shelves, and the propagation and evolution of active ice shelf rifts, which eventually lead to iceberg calving.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fricker was one of the primary investigators on the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wissard.org/about/wissard-personnel|title=Personnel {{!}} WISSARD|website=www.wissard.org|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the first group to drill into an Antarctic subglacial lake, Subglacial Lake Whillans, in 2013&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Douglas|date=2014-08-21|title=Lakes under the ice: Antarctica’s secret garden|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lakes-under-the-ice-antarctica-s-secret-garden-1.15729|journal=Nature|volume=512|issue=7514|pages=244–246|doi=10.1038/512244a|pmid=25143097|bibcode=2014Natur.512..244F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21231380|title=Drill reaches Antarctica's under-ice Lake Whillans|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=28 January 2013|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fricker has held numerous positions relating to her study of the [[cryosphere]], including Chair of AGU's Cryospheric Sciences Focus Group from 2004–2006, Elected Member of the ICESat Science Team from 2006–present, as part of the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation ([[ICESat]]) mission from 1999–present and the [[ICESat-2]] Science Definition Team and the NASA Sea Level Change Team. She runs the Scripps Glaciology group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

== Awards and honors ==
Fricker received the Royal Tasmania Society Doctoral Award for her PhD in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rst.org.au/awards/past-recipients/|title=Past Recipients|website=rst.org.au|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the [[NASA Group Achievement Award|NASA Group Achievement]] Award for her role in the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite ([[ICESat]]) Mission Development Team in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/antarctic_plumb_bios_prt.htm|title=NASA – Biographies|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she was awarded the Martha T.

The '''Riga French Lyceum''' ({{lang-lv|Rīgas Franču licejs}}, {{lang-fr|Lycée Français de Riga}}) is a [[:category:French international schools|French international school]] that was founded in September 1921 in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfl.lv/ Lycée Français de Riga official site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a school, where studies take place from grade 1 to 12 and the only school in Latvia, where [[French language|French]] can be learned at an advanced level starting from primary school. Studies can also be commenced in grade 7 or 10.

==History==
Marsels Etjēns Segrests, the former Director of the Lycée Marsels, was one of the first teachers at the school. In addition to teaching French he also taught the [[Latvian language]] and literature. He was joined by Angelika Gailīte, a history teacher. It was located at Krisjana Valdemara street.

In 1965 the school was renamed as the [[Henri Barbusse]] Riga 11th secondary school. At this time it was located at 8 Meness Street, Riga.  On 21 September 1991 the original name, Lycée Français de Riga, was restored.

'''NOVA Cyprus''' is a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[digital television|digital]] satellite [[Pay TV|pay television]] service owned by [[Multichoice Cyprus]].  NOVA launched in July 2004 and was the first DTH satellite provider to launch in Cyprus.  It is one of two satellite platforms, the other being [[Athina Sat]].

From November 2007, NOVA Cyprus was also available via PrimeTV IPTV service of [[PrimeTel]] but a few years later Nova Cyprus was removed from the IPTV service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dmeurope.com/default.asp?ArticleID=27853 | title=PrimeTel adds NOVA channels to IP TV platform | accessdate=2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOVA offers Cypriot subscribers an array of programming choices from News, Sports, Movies, Children's &amp; Entertainment.

From 1 July 2011 both LTV and Alfa removed definitely from NOVA Cyprus because the two sides were not able to come to an agreement after the dissolution of Multichoice Cyprus. Then NOVA Cyprus is under the control of [[Forthnet]] and Multichoice Hellas and during the summer were added HD service (NovaCinema1,2 HD, NovaSports1,2 HD etc.) from [[NOVA Greece]] and some other channels.

From 1 February 2012 all Nova channels (Novacinema 1-4 and Novasports 1-7) are available through the [[IPTV]] service of [[CytaVision]].

==Dispute with LTV==

"In July 2006, [[Lumiere TV|LTV]] pulled their service from the NOVA lineup, due to a dispute with Multichoice.  In August 2006, [[Alfa TV]] was also removed from the NOVA line-up due to the same dispute."  The channels then went on to sign with rival DTH provider [[Athina Sat]].

In 2008, the two sides resumed negotiations and were able to come to an agreement.  As of March 3, 2008, both LTV and Alfa are now once again available through NOVA Cyprus &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politis.com.cy/cgibin/hweb?-A=777153&amp;-V=archive&amp;-w=NOVA@CYPRUS@&amp;-P Πολιτησ Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOVA Greece''' is a Greek [[digital satellite]] [[pay TV]] platform owned by [[Multichoice Hellas]]. It was launched in December 1999.

NOVA offers Greek subscribers an array of international and domestic programmes (including news, sports, movies, music, children's programmes and general entertainment channels) plus the majority of popular Greek terrestrial TV channels along with a number of Greek terrestrial radio stations. International programmes are offered in their original soundtrack, with Greek subtitles. Some interactive services like games, cinema &amp; theatre listings, lottery numbers, news headlines and weather reports are also provided.

On April 14, 2008, Greek telecommunications company [[Forthnet]] acquired Netmed, parent firm of NOVA Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iii.co.uk/news/?type=afxnews&amp;articleid=6656016&amp;action=article Business finance news - currency market news - online UK currency markets - financial news - Interactive Investor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Nova Greece had 363,679 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2011/03/17/greek-satellite-subs-at-all-time-high/ |title=Greek satellite subs at all time high |publisher=Broadband TV News |date=2011-04-18 |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Nova Greece had 391,252 subscribers. HD service counted 52,968 subscribers in 2011, an 86,8% rise from 28,356 subscribers in 2010.

In the end June 2015 the platform had 509,088 subscribers, while one year later, June 2016 it had 460,252 (-9,6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvinfo.gr/news/media-news/item/18027-thilia-sti-syndromitiki-tileorasi-i-kyvernitiki-forologisi|title=Θηλιά στη συνδρομητική τηλεόραση η κυβερνητική φορολόγηση|date=5 Σεπτεμβρίου 2016|website=digitaltvinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016 the OTE TV platform surpassed Nova Greece subscribers number, by reaching 462,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.gr/money/epixeiriseis/story/45255/h-forologia-frenare-tin-agora-syndromitikis-tileorasis|title=Η φορολογία "φρέναρε" την αγορά συνδρομητικής τηλεόρασης|date=6 Σεπτεμβρίου 2016|website=Cnn Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 it was referred that NOVA Greece had 430,000 subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/Columns/panos-voglis/h-ert-sthrigma-ths-kentrikhs-diaxeirishs.4758743.html|title=Η ΕΡΤ στήριγμα της κεντρικής διαχείρισης|date=10 Ιουλίου 2017|website=Cnn Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical information ==

Nova broadcasts in standard definition using the [[DVB-S]] [[MPEG-2]] format and (since September 2010) in [[High-definition video|high definition]] using the DVB-S [[MPEG-4]] format through [[Hotbird]] 8 satellite at 13°E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eutelsat.com/satellites/13ehb8_popd.html |title=Eutelsat Hotbird 8 |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is encrypted with [[Irdeto Access|Irdeto]] [[conditional access]] system. Until recently the subscribers had the option of buying a specific set-top box, or using any DVB-S Irdeto enabled set-top box, but since September 2009 new subscribers are only allowed to use the company's own set-top box. This change of policy has raised some significant controversy.

Nova has also introduced a [[personal video recorder|PVR]] service, accessible only through a (different) specific set-top box. This service requires an extra subscription fee but also provides the subscriber with the option to watch two different channels on two different TV sets in the same household.

Nova channels were also available through the [[IPTV]] service of [[On Telecoms]]. On Telecoms]subscribers could sign up to watch all the channels offered by Nova but had to pay a separate fee for that service.

===Digital satellite receivers===
Nova Satellite Package includes digital satellite receivers manufactured by [[Pace plc|Pace]]. The current models are NovaBox HD 831 and NovaBox HD PVR 865. Older models were Panasat 1110, Panasat 910, as well as the older Panasat 720i, Panasat 700 and Panasat 642, manufactured by Panasat.

== Channel list ==
NOVA Greece currently has over 50 subscription channels in its line-up, from Greece, Europe and abroad as well as access to over 200 FTA channels. The line-up also includes over 100 radio stations, and most are available FTA.

== Criticism ==
It is said by most television enthusiasts in Greece that the sum of Nova's characteristics show that total customer satisfaction is not by any means comparable to that of subscribers of other European satellite providers,  like [[SKY Italia]], [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky UK]] or [[Sky Deutschland]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Degradation to the picture quality due to extensive use of heavy [[MPEG]] compression (a technique that offers more available programs at the price of lower total image quality per channel added) also affects terrestrial [[repeaters]] and that practice seriously degrades picture of all commercial national television stations nationwide, since they are fed by Nova.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

'''Padang Lawas''' is an archaeological site in [[Indonesia]] in [[Padang Lawas Regency]] and [[North Padang Lawas Regency]] in [[North Sumatra]].

The remains of Hindu-Buddhist temple complex are located there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EypGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Padang+Lawas+temple%22&amp;dq=%22Padang+Lawas+temple%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7__oUNOzEcTMtAbzkIHgDA&amp;redir_esc=y ICOM '89: museums : generators of culture : reports and comments : The International Council of Museums], 15th General Conferences, 27 August-6 September 1989, The Hague, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-preserved temple are the [[Bahal temple]] complex, however most of other temples are in ruins. There are, however, no effective controls over the management of the remains of the numerous temples at the site.  A research worker from the Medan State University recently (2011) expressed the view that up to half of the 16 temples in the area were at risk of being illegally excavated and noted that groups of thieves had been observed working at some of the temples.&lt;ref&gt;Apriadi Gunawan, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/18/thieves-target-ancient-temples-north-sumatra.html Thieves target ancient temples in North Sumatra'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Party of the Poor was founded in 1991, by the nun and politician [[Angèle Bandou]], formerly a member of the ''Rassemblement pour la Défense des Pauvres et des Chomeurs au Congo''. As the first ever woman to do so in Congo-Brazzaville, she ran for president in the [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], receiving less than 1% of the popular vote.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark|first=John Frank|date=2012|title=Historical Dictionary of Republic of the Congo|url= |location=[[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=57|isbn=081-084-919-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandou and the Party of the Poor ran again for president, in the [[Republic of the Congo presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]]. She received 27,849 votes and came in third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=La Cour suprême du Congo proclame les résultats définitifs du scrutin présidentiel |url=http://www.brazzaville-adiac.com/index.php?action=depeche&amp;dep_id=713&amp;oldaction=liste&amp;regpay_id=0&amp;them_id=0&amp;cat_id=0&amp;ss_cat_id=0&amp;LISTE_FROM=60&amp;select_month=0&amp;select_year=0|deadurl=yes|language=French|newspaper=Les Dépêches de Brazzaville|location=[[Brazzaville]]|date= 29 March 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226070154/http://www.brazzaville-adiac.com/index.php?action=depeche&amp;dep_id=713&amp;oldaction=liste&amp;regpay_id=0&amp;them_id=0&amp;cat_id=0&amp;ss_cat_id=0&amp;LISTE_FROM=60&amp;select_month=0&amp;select_year=0|archivedate=2012-02-26|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7427">'''Powell Alexander Janulus''' (born 1939) is a Canadian [[Polyglotism|polyglot]] who lives in [[White Rock, British Columbia]], and entered the [[Guinness World Records]] in 1985 for fluency in 42 languages.&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;Boehm, David A.; and Maris Cakars, Cyd Smith, Jim Benagh (1984). ''Guinness Book of World Records 1985.'' Sterling Publishing Co. {{ISBN|978-0806902647}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify, he had to pass a two-hour conversational fluency test with a native speaker of each of the 42 different languages he spoke at that time.

==Early life==

Powell Janulus was born in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. He was exposed to many [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages as a child. His [[Poles|Polish]] mother spoke six languages while his [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] father spoke at least four. He could speak 13 languages fluently at the age of 18. He attended [[Asian studies|Asian Studies]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] where he attempted to learn [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. In an interview he states that he struggled with the academic teaching style.&lt;ref name="Nikulicheva"&gt;Nikulicheva, D.B. (2009). ''How to Find your Way to Foreign Languages.'' Flinta. {{ISBN|978-5976508279}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became curious about the process of language learning and in the way that children learn languages so easily.&lt;ref name="Dilts"&gt;Dilts, Robert (1998). ''Modeling with NLP.'' Meta Publications. Capitola, CA. {{ISBN|978-0916990466}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to learn [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] by having conversations and talking with as many Mandarin speakers as possible.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;Atkinson, Marilyn; and Paul Gossen (2015). ''Velocity Instant Fluency.'' Velocity Learning. {{ISBN|978-0978375515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his early 20s, he began to develop his methodology for fast language acquisition. In his thirties, he became a court translator and got paid for each language he could translate. He worked to learn two or three languages per year, as each language allowed him to earn more at his job. He was authorized by the [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]], as a court translator in 28 languages. He states that he later became interested in language variations and could quickly learn related languages such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In his 40s, he learned less common languages such as [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Later in life, he opened the Geneva Language Institute, a language school in Vancouver.

==World record holder for fluency==
In 1985, Powell was entered into the Guinness World Records for spoken [[fluency]] in 42 languages. To qualify, he had to pass a two-hour conversational fluency test with a native speaker of each language he spoke at that time. This testing took place over a one-month period. Powell states that he considers himself skilled in 64 languages and says that he has studied at least 80 languages in total. In an interview, Powell claims that the late [[John Candy]] hired him to help him speak [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] for the movie ''[[Who's Harry Crumb?]]'' He once appeared on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] where talk show host [[Johnny Carson]] invited speakers of 48 different languages to test Janulus.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Stacy|title=Multilingual Speaker to Give Area Seminar|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MULTILINGUAL+SPEAKER+TO+GIVE+AREA+SEMINAR.-a083809089|website=Daily News (Los Angeles)|date=January 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Powell speaks the following 42 languages: [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], [[Lusatian language|Lusatian]], [[Sorbian languages|Wendish]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hindi languages|Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. This list does not include [[English language|English]], which is his [[First language|native language]], or the many other languages in which he has some proficiency.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

==Recent years==

Powell was reported to have died in 2006, however this was inaccurate. In an interview he stated that his disappearance was due to a stroke he suffered at that time.  He reported that he lost his ability to speak English, due to brain damage. He claimed to have regained his English spoken ability by speaking Dutch with a nurse. He is currently retired and living in [[White Rock, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;
In August 2013, he was again the subject of a language testing event during which he spoke at least 20 languages and modeled the learning process with [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

'''Qibo''' ({{zh|c=岐伯|p=Qíbó|w=Chi Bo}}), was a mythological Chinese doctor, employed by [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) as his minister. It is said that he was enlightened with the knowledge of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] by an [[Non-physical entity|ethereal being]] from the heavens.

He was a doctor in ''[[shanggu shidai]]'' ({{zh|t=上古時代|s=上古时代|p=shànggǔ shídài}}) in [[legend]]. He lived in [[Beidi (Place)|Beidi]] ({{zh|c=北地|p=běidì}}, now [[Qingyang]]).

It is said that he had learned medicine from some [[celestial being]] like [[Guangchengzi]], [[Chisongzi]] ({{zh|c=赤松子|p=chìsōngzǐ}}), [[Zhongnanzi]] ({{zh|c=中南子|p=zhōngnánzǐ}}). He recognized [[medicinal herb]] in daylight, learned [[Tao]] of [[health maintenance]] and mastered [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|jingluo]] medicine. Zhongnanzi recommended Qibo to Yellow Emperor, while Yellow Emperor asked Tao to Guangchengzi in [[Kongtong Mountains]]. Qibo became the chancellor of Yellow Emperor. He sampled medicinal herbs by the order of Yellow Emperor. ''[[Yellow Emperor Neijing]]'' is a book comprising the dialogues regarding medicinal problems between Yellow Emperor and Qibo.

== Think Green Awareness ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Suhail Al Zarooni started [[Bright green environmentalism|think green]] awareness to explore and preserve environment in 2007 through displaying his one of the car collection of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] in green. The global demand for energy grows every year. His idea behind this [[Environmentalism|think green]] awareness was that we can reduce the [[energy consumption]] number by [[recycling]] and [[Reuse|reusing]] what we produce, and by reducing our consumption of [[resource]]s like [[fuel]].

A 1974 [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]], from the Al Zarooni Car Collection was displayed in [[City Centre Mirdif|Mirdif City Centre]] Dubai for another vital cause-Think Green.

Together they have begun to act on these demands for a [[Green plant|greener planet]].

A healthy home makes for healthy planet. More recently he is working towards this Think Green Awareness in bigger way with collaboration with Artists who can promote this Think green awareness all across the globe.

'''''The Emperor: Downfall of an Autocrat''''', published in 1978, is [[Poles|Polish]] [[journalist]] [[Ryszard Kapuściński]]'s analysis of the decline and fall of [[Haile Selassie|Haile Selassie's]] regime in [[Ethiopia]].  In 1974, while the [[Derg|Ethiopian Army]] was still busy consolidating power, Kapuściński "traveled to Ethiopia to seek out and interview Selassie's servants and closest associates on how the Emperor had ruled and why he fell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=0679722033 |title=The Emperor by Ryszard Kapuscinski - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large part, the book is a study of the workings of a [[royal court]]. It is said that this book is intended to be allegorical of the government of Poland, especially [[Edward Gierek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/29/books/the-dictator-s-downfall.html |title=The Dictator'S Downfall |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1983-05-29 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transport in Europe''' provides for the movement needs of over 700 million people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp |title=World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision |date=11 March 2009 |publisher=''[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]]'' |accessdate=18 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012190153/http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp |archivedate=12 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated freight. The political geography of Europe divides the continent into over 50 sovereign states and territories. This fragmentation, along with increased movement of people since the [[industrial revolution]], has led to a high level of cooperation between European countries in developing and maintaining transport networks. [[Supranational]] and intergovernmental organisations such as the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] have led to the development of international standards and agreements that allow people and freight to cross the borders of Europe, largely with unique levels of freedom and ease.

Road, rail, air and water transportation are all prevalent  and important across Europe. Europe was the location of the world's first railways and motorways and is now the location of some of the world's busiest ports and airports. The [[Schengen Area]] enables border control-free travel between 26 European countries. Freight transportation has a high level of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] compatibility and the [[European Economic Area]] allows the free movement of goods across 30 states.

A review of critical success factors for the delivery of transport infrastructure projects in Europe is presented in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Invernizzi|first2=Diletta Colette|last3=Brookes|first3=Naomi J.|date=2017-04-01|title=Project characteristics and performance in Europe: An empirical analysis for large transport infrastructure projects|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856416300817|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=98|pages=108–122|doi=10.1016/j.tra.2017.01.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rail transport==
[[File:Bruxelles-Midi 0005.jpg|thumb|right|221x221px|A German [[ICE 3]], a French [[Thalys]] and a French-British [[Eurostar]] at [[Brussels South railway station]].]]
{{Main|Rail transport in Europe}}

Powered rail transport began in England in the early 19th century with the invention of the [[steam engine]]. The modern European rail network spans the entire continent and provides passenger and freight movement. There are significant [[high-speed rail]] passenger networks such as the [[TGV]] in [[France]] and the [[High-speed rail in Spain|LAV]] in Spain. The [[Channel Tunnel]] connects the [[United Kingdom]] with [[France]], [[Belgium]] and thus the whole of the European rail system, and was called one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asce.org/history/seven_wonders.cfm Seven wonders of the modern world]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various method of [[rail electrification]] are used, as well as much unelectrified track. [[Standard gauge]] is widespread in Central and Western Europe, while [[Russian gauge]] predominates in parts of Eastern Europe – mainline services on the [[Iberian peninsula]] and the island of [[Ireland (island)|Ireland]] use the rarer [[Iberian gauge]] and [[Irish gauge]] respectively. The [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] is an EU initiative to create a Europe-wide standard for train signalling.

Rail infrastructure, freight transport and passenger services are provided by a combination of local and national governments and private companies. Passenger ticketing varies from country to country and service to service. The [[Eurail Pass]] is a rail pass for 18 European countries; it is only available for persons who do not live in Europe, [[Morocco]], Algeria and [[Tunisia]]. [[Inter Rail]] passes allow multi-journey travel around Europe for people living in Europe and surrounding countries.

=== Rapid Transit ===
[[File:London Underground full map.svg|thumb|189x189px|A geographic map of London's rapid transit service, known as the [[London Underground]].]]
Many [[Lists of cities in Europe|cities]] across Europe have a [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]], commonly referred to as a metro, which is an electric railway. The world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, was opened in London in 1863. It is now part of London's rapid transit system referred to as the [[London Underground]], which is part of the [[Transport in London|city's public transportation system]] managed by [[Transport for London|TfL]]. Other European cities with a rapid transit system include: [[Paris Métro|Paris]], [[Prague Metro|Prague]] and [[Copenhagen Metro|Copenhagen]].

==Coach Transport in Europe==

In the last few years, many countries in Europe have decided to liberalise the market for medium/long distance coach transportation. This move has already proven to be helping both the economies and the Europeans.

The bus is the cheapest method of transportation but this doesn’t mean that the trip is unbearable. Many companies are making adjustments so that their fleets can be as comfortable as trains. Toilettes and power have been added to the coaches and always more are being equipped with WiFi.

In order to make it even easier and even cheaper, platforms for comparison have been created. And now some, like [[SoBus]], have integrated the booking process without redirection to the company's website.

==Air transport==
[[File:BCN-T1.jpg|thumb|250px|Aircraft from [[LOT Polish Airlines]], [[Brussels Airlines]], [[airBaltic]] and [[Air Europa]] at [[Barcelona Airport]].]]
Despite an extensive road and rail network, 43% of international travel within the EU was by air in 2013.&lt;ref name="intra-EU flows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Tourism_statistics_-_intra-EU_tourism_flows|title=Tourism statistics - intra-EU tourism flows |publisher=Eurostat|date=June 2015|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air travel]] is particularly important for peripheral nations such as [[Spain]] and [[Greece]] and island nations such as [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]], where a large majority of border crossings are by air.&lt;ref name="intra-EU flows"/&gt; A large tourism industry also attracts many visitors to Europe, most of whom arrive into one of Europe's many large international airports – [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|major hubs]] include [[London Heathrow]], [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport|Istanbul Atatürk]], [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles De Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam Schiphol]]. The advent of [[low cost carriers]] in recent years{{when|date=November 2017}} has led to a large increase in air travel within Europe. Air transportation is now often the cheapest way of travelling between cities. This increase in air travel has led to problems of airspace overcrowding and environmental concerns. The [[Single European Sky]] is one initiative aimed at solving these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/ses/public/standard_page/sk_ses.html|title=The Single European Sky|date=13 January 2009|publisher=''[[European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation]]''|accessdate=18 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729121951/www.eurocontrol.int/ses/public/standard_page/sk_ses.html|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the European Union, the complete [[freedoms of the air]] and the world's most extensive [[cabotage]] agreements allow [[budget airline]]s to operate freely across the EU.&lt;ref name="havel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Havel|first1=Brian F.|title=The Principles and Practice of International Aviation Law|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107020528|pages=50–53|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=C8H2AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=ShuKdGSAP2&amp;dq=chile%20cabotage&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheap air travel is spurred on by the trend for regional airports levying low fees to market themselves as serving large cities quite far away. [[Ryanair]] is especially noted for this, since it primarily flies out of regional airports up to 150 kilometres away from the cities they are said to serve. A primary example of this is the [[Weeze]]-[[Skavsta]] flight, where Weeze mainly serves the [[Nijmegen]]/[[Kleve]] area, while Skavsta serves [[Nyköping]]/[[Oxelösund]]. Ryanair however, markets this flight as [[Düsseldorf]]-[[Stockholm]], which are both 80–90 kilometres away from these airports, resulting in up to four hours of ground transportation just to get to and from the airport.

The [[Port of Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]] is the largest port in Europe and one of the busiest ports in the world, handling some 440 million metric tons of cargo in 2013.&lt;ref name="RPA Stat13"&gt;{{cite press release |date=1 June 2014 |title=Port Statistics 2013 |url=http://www.portofrotterdam.com/en/Port/port-statistics/Documents/Port-statistics-2013.pdf |page=8 |publisher=Rotterdam Port Authority |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the associated [[Europoort]] industrial area is included, Rotterdam is by certain measurements the [[world's busiest port]]. Two thirds of all inland water freight shipping within the [[European Union|E.U.]], and 40% of containers, pass through the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="NFIA Seaports"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfia.com/seaports.html |title=Seaports - Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency |date=c. 2010 |website=www.nfia.com |publisher=Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other large ports are the [[Port of Hamburg]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Port of Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]]. They are all a part of the so-called "Northern Range".

The [[English Channel]] is one of the world's busiest seaways carrying over 400 ships per day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/the_dover_strait.htm| title=The Dover Strait| publisher=[[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]]| year=2007| accessdate=8 October 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831173118/http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga07-home/emergencyresponse/mcga-searchandrescue/mcga-hmcgsar-sarsystem/channel_navigation_information_service__cnis_/the_dover_strait.htm| archivedate=31 August 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; between Europe's [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] ports and the rest of the world.

As well as its role in freight movement, sea transport is an important part of Europe's energy supply. Europe is one of the world's major [[oil tanker]] discharge destinations. Energy is also supplied to Europe by sea in the form of [[LNG]]. The [[South Hook LNG terminal]] at [[Milford Haven]], Wales is Europe's largest LNG terminal.&lt;ref name=bbc200309&gt;{{cite news| publisher= [[BBC News]]| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/7952415.stm| title= Port awaits liquid gas delivery| date=20 March 2009| accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USA-232''', also known as '''GPS IIF-2''', and '''GPS SVN-63''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the second of twelve [[GPS Block IIF|Block IIF]] satellites to be launched.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

Built by [[Boeing]] and launched by [[United Launch Alliance]], USA-232 was launched at 06:41 UTC on 16 July 2011, atop a [[Delta IV]] carrier rocket, flight number D355, flying in the Medium+(4,2) configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Space Launch Complex 37B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-232 directly into [[medium Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="satcat"/&gt;

As of 24 July 2011, USA-232 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20452|km|sp=us}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20463|km|sp=us}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 729.16 minutes, and 55.0 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to broadcast the PRN 01 signal, and operates in slot 2 of plane D of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a design life of 15 years and a mass of {{convert|1630|kg}}.

'''United States of Poland''' ({{Lang-pl|Stany Zjednoczone Polski}}) was an unrealized political concept of reborn [[Poland]], created by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] (1860–1941). It was first presented in Paderewski Memorial, given to US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] on 11 January 1917.

Paderewski's idea postulated rebuilding a Polish state as [[federation]], in which [[constitution]] and law would guarantee equality to citizens, ethnic and religious groups. Territory would engulf most of pre-[[Partitions of Poland|partitioned]] territory. Taking into account of that time population, the country would have 54 million citizens. On its head would be a President with a title of the [[King]] of [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Polesia]] and [[Halych]].&lt;ref name= "zw"&gt;Joanna Gierowska-Kałłaur ''Zarząd Cywilny Ziem Wschodnich (19 lutego 1919 – 9 września 1920)'', Neriton, Instytut Historii PAN, Warszawa 2003, p.19, {{ISBN|83-88973-60-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative regions==
United States of Poland were to be a number of [[Autonomous area|autonomous states]] including:
*Kingdom of Poland
*Kingdom of Lithuania
*Kingdom of Polesia
*Kingdom of Galitia-Podole
*Kingdom of Volhynia

Later the concept of Galitia-Podole was supplanted by Kingdom of [[Halych]], in separate memorial there was also postulate of incorporating a [[Eastern Prussia]] into it.&lt;ref name="zw" /&gt;

===Ukrainian problem===

The postulate of creation of Kingdoms of Halych and Polesia on lands which were inhabited by large numbers of [[Ukrainians]] did not satisfy their appetites for creation of independent state. Paderewski did not pursue the matter due to large percentage of Ukrainian population living in those regions with a different politics and demography.
