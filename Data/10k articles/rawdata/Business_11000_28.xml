[[File:Acquisition Initiation Process-Data Diagram.jpg|thumb|240px|Process-data model acquisition initiation (ISPL)]]
[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.activities.mcalukin.jpg|thumb|240px|Acquisition Initiation activities]]
[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.concepts.mcalukin.jpg|thumb|240px|Acquisition Initiation concepts]]
'''Acquisition Initiation''' is the initial process within the [[Information Services Procurement Library|Information Services Procurement Library (ISPL)]] and is executed by a customer organization intending to procure [[Information broker|Information Services]]. The process is composed of two main activities: the making of the acquisition goal definition and the making of the acquisition planning. During the acquisition initiation, an [[Iteration|iterative]] process arises in which questions about the goal of the acquisition are usually asked. In response to these questions the Library provides details of the requirements, covering areas such as cost, feasibility and timelines. An example of such requirements is the "planning of the acquisition", a component that may also lead to more questions about the acquisition goal (thus, it is reasonable to state that a relationship exists between the acquisition goal and the acquisition planning).

The [[Process-data diagram|process-data model]] shown in the following section displays the acquisition initiation stages. It shows both the process and the data ensuing from the process, and parts of the image will also be used as references in the body of this article.&lt;ref&gt;The image was made by the author of this article for the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Method engineering|method engineering]] course of [[Utrecht University]].&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and data found in the model are explained in separate tables which can be found in the section immediately following the model. A textual, and more thorough, explanation of the activities and concepts that make up the Acquisition Initiation process can be found in the remainder of this article.

== Draft acquisition goal ==
[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.modelpart1.mcalukin.jpg|thumb|left|Partial process-data diagram for the draft acquisition goal]]The draft acquisition goal is the description of the global goal that is to be achieved by starting procurement. It is inspired by the business needs or [[business strategy]]. It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the [[PRINCE2#Starting up a project|project brief]] in [[PRINCE2]]. It is the first draft of the acquisition goal, containing at least a (short) problem definition and a (short) goal definition. The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those people who will have to make the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not. It may thus also encapsulate items like a cost-benefit analysis, stakes &amp; stakeholders and other items that will be further refined during the actual Acquisition Initiation.
It is, in this sense, ''not'' an activity of the acquisition initiation process, but it is the input for starting the process.

The problem definition is a statement about the problem that could be resolved by starting the acquisition process.
:E.g.: The production process is becoming increasingly inefficient, in part because of aged software
The goal definition is a statement about the goal that will have to be reached when the acquisition is executed:
:E.g.: The production process will see a 20% increase in both cost and time efficiency, when the software that is used in the process is updated

The draft acquisition goal can be made as short or as long as is needed by the organization, as long as it serves to be a good basis to make the initial decision to start of an acquisition process.

== Acquisition goal definition ==
[[Image:Acquisition Initiation Process-Data Diagram2.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Partial process-data diagram for the refining of the acquisition goal]]When the decision is made to start an acquisition process, the first activity of the acquisition initiation is to define the acquisition goal.

The acquisition goal is the whole of defined systems and services requirements, attributed by costs &amp; benefits and stakes &amp; stakeholders, with a defined target domain serving as the boundary. The acquisition goal is the basis of the acquisition process and for formulating the acquisition strategy during the acquisition planning. Input can be the draft acquisition goal and the business needs (of the target domain). The business needs can be derived from strategic business plans or information system plans.

=== Defining the target domain ===
The target domain is that part of the customer organization that is involved in, or influenced by an information service. It is defined in terms of business processes, business actors, business information, business technology and the relations between these four aspects. The target domain is identified to ensure a fitting acquisition goal with fitting requirements for the systems and services to be acquired.

;''[[Business process]]es'' :are a set of activities within the organization to realize some sort of output or goal.
::E.g.: the marketing-processes, intended to create and maintain a market for the products or services of the organization.

;''Business information'' :is the information that is used as input in the business process, the output or results of the process or the information concerning a method to execute the business process.
::E.g.: sales figures, market researches etc; the marketing theories and methods used in the marketing process; a result of the process in the form of a new marketing strategy involving new types of advertising.

;''A business actor'' :is either a person or a computer system (or a part of it) that operates within an information system or in relation to that system, executing certain processes within that system, using the information needed for the process.
::E.g.: a marketing-employee using a computer with tools used to execute the marketing-process.

;''Business technology'' :consists of all information systems, tools, software and methods, used by business actors to execute his processes.
::E.g.: a marketing theory on how to approach new customers, a graphical tool to make posters, etc.

''A limited description of a target domain can thus be, for example:''&lt;br&gt;The part of customer organization that uses the software program MarketingUnlimited (fictional), involving the marketing-process, several types of information related to the marketing-department of the customer organization, the employees working in the marketing department and the production platform for MarketingUnlimited consisting of an application server, several workstations, and tools related to MarketingUnlimited.

=== Refining the acquisition goal ===
;The acquisition goal :the deliverables, systems and services should be delivered within the acquisition and with what requirements they will have to comply.
;A [[requirement]] :A documented representation of an essential condition that has to be satisfied by the system or service, in favor of an actor’s need to achieve an objective.
::E.g.: the new marketing software package will have to have a response time of between 0 and 3 seconds for a database query.
The acquisition goal is then described by system descriptions and service descriptions:

;'''System description''' :A description of a system, documenting the requirements of a system.
:A [[system]] is an integrated composite that consists or one or more of the processes, hardware, software, facilities and people that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objective (definition by ISO/IEC 12207).

;'''Service description''' :A description of a service, documenting the requirements that describe the service.
:A '''service''' is a process that a person or organization executes in favor of another. ISPL defines two types of services:
:*'''projects''', which are limited by time (e.g.: the implementation of an ERP package), and
:*'''ongoing services''', which are unlimited by time (e.g.: helpdesk services).

::'''Projects''' are described by documenting:
::*''the initial state'': what descriptive and operational items are already presents, and what items should be present at the start of the project
::*''the final state'': describe which descriptive and operational items will be required and used after the project has been completed

::'''Ongoing services''' are described by documenting:
::*''the type of process'' that will be performed in the ongoing service,
::*''the operational items'' that are object of the service,
::*''the service properties'': the properties that characterize the service:
:::*[[investment]] properties: the properties that provide the rationale or the goals for attracting the service.  Relates to the costs &amp; benefits analysis,
:::*functional properties: the properties of the business process and work practices that are executed in the service,
:::*[[Quality (business)|quality]] properties: the service level required by the users or the organization’s strategy.

:When the requirements set in the (initial) system and service descriptions do not offer enough basis for:
:* the customer organization to accurately estimate costs &amp; benefits or
:* for the supplier organization to produce a satisfactory proposal,
:a more thorough [[requirements analysis]], using an acknowledged method, may be necessary.

Other information on how [[Information Services Procurement Library#Specifying Deliverables|ISPL defines the deliverables]] of the acquisition can be found in the general [[ISPL|ISPL entry]].

=== Costs–benefits analysis ===
[[Cost–benefit analysis]] concerns the analysis of:
;''Costs'': resources to be spent on the information services to be procured and
;''Benefits'': the resources to be gained from acquiring the information services,
to successfully evaluate the investment issues of the acquisition.

:'''Benefits''' must be evaluated, even if they are not quantifiable, but preferably identified by using financial terms or other quantifiable [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]].
::e.g.: The software to be acquired will enable the marketing department to handle the data of past activities at a 10% more efficient rate as with the current system.
:'''Costs''' must be evaluated thoroughly, depending mostly, but not solely, on the systems and services requirements and the acquisition strategy that will be adopted. Costs are thus not only related to hardware or [[software]] purchase (or development), but with the costs of all activities within the acquisition.
::e.g.: Acquisition management, quality assurance and trainings for actors.

=== Stakes and stakeholders analysis ===
;A [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] :is an actor within the organization or target domain that will be affected by the acquisition at hand.
It is important to identify all actors affected, and in what way they are affected (their stake), because a negative attitude of actors may negatively influence the success of the acquisition. ISPL proposes to perform a [[SWOT analysis]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) for the actors involved to properly and thoroughly identify the stakes of the actors. The results of this analysis can serve as input for the situation &amp; risk analysis.

== Acquisition planning ==
[[File:Acquisition Initiation Process-Data Diagram3.jpg|thumb|right|Partial process-data diagram for the acquisition planning stage]]The information contained within the Acquisition Goal is used to produce the acquisition plan. The acquisition plan is the master plan of the entire acquisition. In this plan delivery scenarios are determined and the situation and risks evaluated. And upon the basis of the scenario’s, situation and risks, a strategy is formed to manage the acquisition, its situation and risks. Furthermore, the acquisition plan will hold the main decision points, in which decisions are made about the deliverables within the acquisition and the acquisition organization (similar to a project organization) is formed.

=== Service delivery scenario ===
On the basis of the acquisition goal, which contains among others the systems and services requirements and descriptions, scenarios can be formed for the deliveries of the information services to be acquired. Multiple scenarios may be built, which will then be evaluated and used in the design of the acquisition strategy. The scenarios are built with the priorities and interdependence of the deliverables in mind.

====Priority====
Priorities are related to the importance of each delivery: which delivery has time-preference over another.
:Priorities can flow from:
:*''[[Strategy]]'': some deliverables may give a competitive advantage to the organization;
:*''[[Finance]]s'': deliverables may lead reduce the costs of organizational operation;
:*''[[Politics]]'': some departments may have more political power within the organization, enabling them to influence the priority of the deliveries related or important to that department.

====Dependency====
Some deliveries may be dependent on each other, requiring one services to be delivered before the next one can be.
:These [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] may be:
:*''[[Technology|Technological]]'': some deliverables have to be delivered before other can be.
::E.g.: New hardware must installed before the software can be.
:*''Functional'': some functions of one deliverable have to be delivered before another deliverable is able to function.
::E.g.: Core-functionality of an ERP package has to be configured before modules can be activated and configured.
:*''Related to reuse'': If a deliverable is reusable in multiple situations and another that is related to it is not, than it would make sense to produce the reusable deliverable first, because of its wider uses.
::E.g.: When the USB-port was thought up, the USB-port was probably first developed, before computers were developed that could make use of it.

[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.scenario.mcalukin.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a scenario for a product software implementation]]''Example:''
During a project to make ISPL more specific for generic product software implementations, a number of scenario’s were made. One of these was for an approach of a one-shot implementation. The below picture shows a diagram of the scenario that was made. An example of a scenario for the implementation of software is shown in the thumbnail on the right.

In this example, the general deliverables within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently as time goes by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent on the outcome of the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can get a feel for the use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.

=== Situation and risk analysis ===
ISPL adheres to a situational approach to manage an acquisition. The situational approach takes into account properties of the problem situation, which are called situational factors. ISPL provides a number of these situational factors. Some of these situational factors affect events that have adverse consequences: the risks. Thus, the situational factors and risks within ISPL are related to each other. This makes it possible to provide a number of heuristics on which factors have an influence on certain risks.
First the situation is analysed, then ISPL proposes a number of risks which may arise from the situation at hand. With this information, an acquisition strategy can be formed to mitigate both the situation and risks in a number of areas.
Other information of the [[Information Services Procurement Library#Managing Risks and Planning Deliveries|situation &amp; risk analysis of ISPL]] can be found in the [[ISPL|ISPL entry]].

==== Situation ====
:The situation of the acquisition is first assessed. ISPL provides a checklist of situational factors to analyze the situation, the knowledge about the situation to effectively use the checklist is gained by the analysis of documents and by interviewing key actors within the acquisition. The checklist that ISPL provides is, of course, neither definitive nor exhaustive but gives an idea of some main points that may describe the situation at hand.

:The situation is described with two dimensions, which together can be used to assess the situation:
:*''Knowledge dimension'': this dimension groups the knowledge about the situation into:
:**''Complexity'': the difficulty to manage the available knowledge, scaled into three values: simple à moderate à complex
:**''Uncertainty'': ;a lack of available knowledge, scaled into three values: certain à moderate à uncertain
:*'''Domain dimension''': which determines what (part of the) organization has to be investigated and considered. Two domains are identified within ISPL:
:**''Target domain'': the part of the (customer) organization affected by the acquisition
:**''Service domain'': the organization that delivers the services to be acquired
::Both are grouped into four classes: process, information, actors, technology.

:An example of a situational factor related the complexity of processes in the target-domain (taken from the ISPL book: Managing risks and planning deliveries (see external links)) is found in the image below.
::[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.situationfactor.mcalukin.jpg|An example of a situational factor]]

:After all situational factors have been analyzed for their measure or complexity or uncertainty, the overall situation must be evaluated:
:*All factors with ‘complex’ and ‘uncertain’ values are listed, and their influence on the overall complexity and uncertainty is determined;
:*The moderate factors are listed and their influence on the overall complexity and uncertainty is determined;
:*The factors with ‘simple’ and ‘certain’ values are listed, and the amount in which they counteract overall complexity and uncertainty is determined.
:The overall uncertainty and complexity is determined with expertise present within the organization.

===== Service domain definition =====
::For the situation analysis to work and properly identify all possible risks concerned with the acquisition, knowledge is needed about the complexity and uncertainty involved with the service domain: the service provider. This is because the service domain may influence the success of the acquisition. The service domain is identified in a similar way as the target domain.
::It may be difficult in this early stage of the ISPL process to thoroughly identify the service domain though, because it may be that external suppliers will be attracted to deliver some of the deliverables. External suppliers are, at this point unknown. This is why, during the course of the acquisition, the situation &amp; risk analysis must be repeated for re-evaluation.

==== Risk ====
:;A risk :A [[risk]] is the possible occurrence of the adverse consequences of an event.
::Risk analysis is:
::*the ''identification'' of risks,
::**the assessment of their ''[[probability]]'' of occurrence,
::**the assessment of the ''impact'' of an eventual occurrence,
::*the determination of critical risks.

:ISPL has determined a set of risks, divided over two classes:
:*''Risks for the business'': influencing the performance of the business as a whole;
:*''Risk for the service'': influencing the performance the services (to be) acquired.
:The risks are related to the situational factors that ISPL provides.

:''Example of a risk'' that is related to the example of the situational factor given above:
:When
:*the “complexity of quality properties of the business processes” within the target domain is assessed as ‘High’,
::then possible risks may be:
:**Poor quality of service/system
:**Service/system not accepted by business actors
:**Non-attainment of business stakes
: (taken from the ISPL book: Managing risks and planning deliveries (see external links))

=== Acquisition Strategy ===
[[Image:Acquisition Initiation Process-Data Diagram4.jpg|thumb|right|Partial process-data diagram for the Acquisition Strategy (part of the acquisition planning)]]The acquisition strategy within ISPL acts as the design of a [[risk management]] strategy. The risk management strategy provides choices for options that reduce the probability and/or effect of risks. ISPL provides several options, divided over four classes:
#options for customer situation,
#supplier relations,
#project and
#services.
Options are chosen based on their efficiency, costs and the related delay for delivery.
:The following is very much a summary of ISPL, which is much more extensive in its explanations. For these, see the external links.

==== Options for customer situation ====
:Three main options:
:*''Change situational factors within the target domain''
::If possible, the organization may decide to change its situation, to delete possible risks related to the current situation
:*''Change or refine the requirements'' that were set up within the Acquisition Goal
::The requirement may have been too complex or too simple, or otherwise ineffective for the situation of the acquisition.
:*''Define a strategy regarding standards''
::The customer organization may adopt certain standards to, for example, ensure openness within the organization and towards external parties, maximizing interoperability between services/systems, etc.

==== Options for supplier relations ====
:Five main options:
:*''Choice between external or internal suppliers''
::The choice depends, among others, the knowledge about the service, costs and time-efficiency of delivery, the actors needed and possible benefits of contracting.
:*''Determine types of [[tendering]]''
::Particular types of tendering may be chosen related to the required type of relationship with a supplier. Types of tendering are:
:**open procedure,
:**restricted procedure,
:**negotiated procedure,
:**design contest.
:::For more elaborate explanations of these types of tendering, see the external links.
:*''Determine the interaction with suppliers''
::Within complex and/or uncertain situations regarding the service domain, certain choices in the communications with a supplier may be made.
:::E.g.: Decide to require information from a suppliers about its services before a ‘[[request for proposal]]’ is made.
:*''Determine the flexibility of [[contract]]s''
::When the situation for the service domain is complex or uncertain, certain contractual elements may be made less (or more) flexible to accommodate a healthy relationship with the supplier.
:*''Identify contracts and sequence constraints''
::A decision may be made to split the acquisition into multiple contracts to make the situation for the customer organization more certain (although a bit more complex).

==== Options for projects ====
:Two main options:
:*''Decide to buy or develop''
::Decide to buy when for example: sufficient products are available, complexity of requirements are not high and/or the ability of actors is low.
:::E.g.: buy an ERP [[product software]] like SAP.
:*''Determine requirements of project delivery strategy''
::The project delivery strategy concerns four approaches: installation, construction, description and project control. During the acquisition, at least the installation strategy can be set, the construction approach may also be set. The approaches for construction and installation that ISPL identifies are:
:**''One shot'': Construct/install in one try. This approach is somewhat related to [[Adoption (software implementation)|the 'big bang' approach for the adoption of software]].
:::E.g.: Develop a program in one try and no successive installation are needed.
:**''Incremental'': Construct/install in parts.
:::E.g.: An ERP package is bought for which the most basis module is first installed, after which successive functional modules are (bought and) installed when they are needed. This approach is somewhat related to [[Adoption (software implementation)|the 'phased' approach for the adoption of software]].
:**''Evolutionary'': Construct/install in full, but multiple versions.
:::E.g.: A program is fully developed and installed. Then a second version of it is fully constructed (or the first version completely revised) and installed. This approach is somewhat related to [[Adoption (software implementation)|the 'phased' approach for the adoption of software]].

==== Options for ongoing services ====
:Two main options:
:*''Determine service arrangements''
::Choices are made concerning the services in relation to the supplier.
::E.g.: Agreement with supplier to share a service with other organization (helpdesk from supplier), the ownership of application server can be determined to lie with the supplier giving the responsibility for the machine with them.
:*''Determine requirements of service control approach''
::Choices are made in what degree the customer organization want to have control over the delivery of ongoing services.
::E.g.: The required hours of availability of the helpdesk service are determined and set within a [[service level agreement]] over which the customer organization can take control.

=== Decision points planning ===
Based upon all the previous activities, the decision points planning is made. This is a time-set planning of decision points.

==== Decision point ====
;A decision point
:A decision point is a set point in time where the customer, with or without the supplier, makes a decision about the services and the deliverables bound to the services.
A decision point is described by:
:*The deliverables serving as the preconditions for the making of the decision
:*The organization and time schedule
:*The costs involved with the decision point
:*The roles involved with the decision
:*The purpose of the decision

[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.decisionpointplanning.mcalukin.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a decision point planning for a product software implementation]]An example of a decision points planning can be found through the thumbnail on the right. In this planning the decisions points are planned through time (top to bottom, left to right). This planning was taken from a study to make ISPL more specific for product software implementations. The decision points planning is thus aimed at a part of the process of a software implementation.

A shortened example of a decision point description can be found in the image below. This description was taken from the same study to make ISPL more specific for product software implementations.
[[Image:AcquisitionInitiation.decisionpoint.mcalukin.JPG|A short decision point description for a product software implementation]]

=== Acquisition organization ===
The acquisition organization is set, which is similar to a project organization.  Although the acquisition organization is more focused on the (legal) relationship that it has to maintain with the supplier organization.

;Contract authority
:Person with the authority to resolve issues with(in) a contract

;Service authority
:Person with the authority to resolve issues with a (delivered) service

;Legal advisor
:Person or group that, based on their expertise and abilities, can aid the authorities within the acquisition to form and founded opinion on legal matters.

;Financial advisor
:Person or group that, based on their expertise and abilities, can aid the authorities within the acquisition to form a founded opinion on financial matters.

;Technological advisor
:Person or group that, based on their expertise and abilities, can aid the authorities within the acquisition to form a founded opinion on technological matters.

'''Agricultural economics''' is an applied field of [[economics]] concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber.  Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with [[land use|land usage]], it focused on maximizing the [[crop yield]] while maintaining a good [[soil science|soil ecosystem]].  Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.  [[Agricultural]] economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Karl A. Fox (1987). "agricultural economics," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Gardner (2001), "Agriculture, Economics of," ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 1, pp. 337-344.

(2010)"&gt;Daniel A. Sumner, Julian M. Alson, and Joseph W. Glauber (2010). "Evolution of the Economics of Agricultural Policy", ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 403-423.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, [[econometrics]], [[development economics]], and [[environmental economics]].  Agricultural economics influences [[food policy]], [[agricultural policy]], and [[environmental policy]].

Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimizing the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century.  The field of agricultural economics can be traced out to works on land economics.  [[Henry Charles Taylor]] was the greatest contributor with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Wisconsin in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Story of The Department of Agricultural Economics: 1909-1972 | author = Shaars, Marvin A. | year=  1972 | url = http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/AAEStory.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner [[Theodore Schultz]], was among the first to examine [[development economics]] as a problem related directly to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Theodore |title=Economic Growth and Agriculture |location=New York |publisher=MacGraw-Hill |year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz was also instrumental in establishing [[econometrics]] as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in "shifting sand", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Theodore W. |last=Schultz |year=1956 |title=Reflections on Agricultural Production, Output and Supply |journal=Journal of Farm Economics |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=748–762 |jstor=1234459 |doi=10.2307/1234459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:

"Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the [[theory of the firm]] with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics.  The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods.  In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=1 (abstract)|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the [[cobweb model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Mordecai Ezekiel]]|title=The Cobweb Theorem|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=February 1938|volume=52|issue=2|pages=255–280|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|doi=10.2307/1881734|access-date=2015-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616073821/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hedonic regression]] pricing models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1230278 | last1 = Waugh | first1 = F. | year = 1928 | title = Quality Factors Influencing Vegetable Prices | jstor = 1230278| journal = Journal of Farm Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 185–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; new technology and diffusion models ([[Zvi Griliches]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1905380 | last1 = Griliches | first1 = Zvi | authorlink = Zvi Griliches | year = 1957 | title = Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technical Change | jstor = 1905380| journal = Econometrica | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 501–522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[multifactor productivity]] and efficiency theory and measurement,&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, M.J., "The Measurement of Productive Efficiency," ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' Series A, General 125 Part 2(1957): 252-267.  Farrell's frequently cited application involved an empirical application of state level agricultural data&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Wesley Ruttan]], "Technological Progress in the Meatpacking Industry, 1919-47," USDA Marketing Research Report No. 59, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and the random coefficients regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2284029 | last1 = Hildreth | first1 = H. | last2 = Houck | first2 = J. | year = 1968 | title = Some Estimators for a Linear Model with Random Coefficients | jstor = 2284029| journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 63 | issue = 322| pages = 584–595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the [[perfect competition]] economic paradigm.

In Asia, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.

Since the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to a scholar in the field: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=15-16|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major topics in agricultural economics==

===Agricultural environment and natural resources===
In the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences.&lt;ref name="Kling et al. (2010)"&gt;Catherine L. Kling, Kathleen Segerson and Jason F. Shogren (2010). "Environmental Economics: How Agricultural Economists Helped Advance the Field" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 487-505.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.&lt;ref name="Lichtenberg et al. (2010)"&gt;Erik Lichtenberg, James Shortle, James Wilen and David Zilberman (2010). "Natural Resource Economics and Conservation: Contributions of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Economists" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 469-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and consumer economics===
While at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.&lt;ref name="Unnevehr et al. (2010)"&gt;Laurian Unnevehr, James Eales, Helen Jensen, Jayson Lusk, Jill McCluskey and Jean Kinsey (2010). "Food and Consumer Economics" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 506-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production economics and farm management===
Agricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as [[water scarcity]] and global climate change.&lt;ref name="Chavas et al. (2010)"&gt;Jean-Paul Chavas, Robert G. Chambers and Rulon D. Pope (2010). "Production Economics and Farm Management" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 356-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development economics===
Development economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Gollin et al. (2002)"&gt;Douglas Gollin, Stephen Parente and Richard Rogerson (2002). "The Role of Agriculture in Development" ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', v. 92, pp. 160-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timmer (2002)"&gt;C. Peter Timmer (2002). "Agriculture and economic development" ''[[Handbook of Agricultural Economics]]'', Vol 2, Part A, pp. 1487-1546.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

The International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal ''Agricultural Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaae-agecon.org/journal/journal.html ''Agricultural Economics'']&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists [AAAE]and an [[Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society]]. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]].

In the United States, the primary professional association is the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]] (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' and ''[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]]''.

==Careers in agricultural economics==

Graduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, commodities markets, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor's degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Careers in Agricultural Economics: Job Options and Requirements | author = Education Portal | year=  2014 | url = http://education-portal.com/articles/Careers_in_Agricultural_Economics_Job_Options_and_Requirements.html | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's the Value of an Agricultural Economics Degree? | authors = Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics, the Ohio State University | year=  2014 | url = http://aede.osu.edu/about-us/news/what%E2%80%99s-value-agricultural-economics-degree-answer-987-chance-you%E2%80%99ll-have-job-after | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's It Worth?

'''''American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company''''' is a book written by [[Bryce G. Hoffman]] about the turnaround of [[Ford Motor Company]] under the leadership of CEO [[Alan Mulally]]. The book offers a brief history of the automaker and explores the problems that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy in 2006, and then chronicles Mulally's transformation of the company's culture, products, and perception in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=NPR Staff|title=How Ford's CEO Helped Restore The 'American Icon'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148298794/how-fords-ceo-helped-restore-the-american-icon|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was the only American automakers to avoid both bankruptcy and a government bailout during the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ian|title=Rejecting bailout wins political capital for Ford|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/78211-rejecting-bailout-wins-political-capital-for-ford|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Icon'' examines how Ford was able to fix its internal issues without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=John|title=The outsider who pulled Ford back from the brink|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cdd3f41e-7804-11e1-b437-00144feab49a.html#axzz1qjUmfnZS|accessdate=6 April 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Sr. in 1909.jpg|thumb|Biddle as a boxer in 1909]]
'''Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle I''' (1874–1948) was an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] millionaire  whose fortune allowed him to pursue theatricals, self-published writing, athletics, and Christianity on a full-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;p.253 Baltzell, Edward Digby ''Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class'' 1958 Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the man upon whom the book ''My Philadelphia Father'' and the [[Play (theatre)|play]] and film ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'' were based.&lt;ref name="mill"&gt;{{cite news |title= The Theater: New Plays in Manhattan |date= December 3, 1956 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866393,00.html |accessdate= March 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained men in [[hand-to-hand]] combat in both World War I and World War II,&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; was a fellow of the [[American Geographical Society]] and founded a movement called "Athletic Christianity" that eventually attracted 300,000 members around the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/shantytownsketches00biddiala/shantytownsketches00biddiala_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Foreign Service: Athletic Christian |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |date= August 5, 1935 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711672,00.html |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1955 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article called him "boxing's greatest amateur" as well as a "major factor in the re-establishment of boxing as a legal and, at that time, estimable sport."&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite news |title= Events &amp; Discoveries |work= [[Sports Illustrated]] |date= May 9, 1955 |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1129593/4/index.htm |accessdate= March 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born on October 1, 1874 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to Edward Biddle II and Emily Drexel.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography'', v.7, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; He was grandson of banker [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]], and great-grandson of banker [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the editor |work= [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] |date= October 25, 1943 |page= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BVcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2  |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biddle was a graduate of Germany's [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;''Philadelphia Inquirer'', Friday Morning, 28 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
An officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]], Biddle was an expert in close-quarters fighting and the author of ''Do or Die: A Supplementary Manual on Individual Combat'', a book on combat methods, including knives and empty-hand skills, training both the [[United States Marine Corps]] in two world wars and Special Agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].  He can be seen training Marines in the [[RKO]] short documentary ''[[Soldiers of the Sea]]''.  He was considered not just an expert in fighting, but also a pioneer of United States Marine Corps training in the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat.  He based his style on fencing, though this approach was sometimes criticized as being unrealistic for military combat.&lt;ref name="fatwing"&gt;{{cite news |title= On the Art of Hand to Hand: An Interview with Col. A. J. Drexel Biddle, USMCR |author= James N. Wright |url= http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jimmy_fatwing/Military/biddle.htm |date= April 1940 |work= [[Leatherneck Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having joined the Marines in 1917 at the age of 41, he also convinced his superiors to include boxing in Marine Corps recruit training.&lt;ref name="svinth"&gt;{{cite news |title= Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, USMC CQB Pioneer |author= Joseph R. Svinth |date= December 2001 |work= Journal of Non-Lethal Combatives |url= http://ejmas.com/jnc/jncart_Svinth_1201.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919, he was promoted to the rank of major, and became a lieutenant colonel in 1934.  In [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania]], right outside of Philadelphia, Biddle opened a military training facility, where he trained 4,000&amp;nbsp;men. His training included long hours of [[calisthenics]] and gymnastics, and taught skills such as machete, saber, dagger, and bayonet combat, as well as hand grenade use, boxing, wrestling, [[savate]] and [[jiujitsu]].&lt;ref name="svinth"/&gt; He also served two years in the [[Army National Guard|National Guard]].

A keen boxer, Biddle sparred with [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and taught boxing to [[Gene Tunney]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt; He even hosted "boxing teas" in his home, where other boxers would spar a couple of rounds with him and then join the family for dinner. A February 1909 match with [[Philadelphia Jack O'Brien]] was attended by society leaders including women in elegant [[evening gown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Women See Biddle Box: Bout with "Jack" O'Brien for Society Friends at Philadelphia |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 24 February 1909 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/02/24/106117845.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a judge in the fight between [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Jess Willard]] on 4&amp;nbsp;July 1919.
 
On the 5th of February 1920, Biddle, as chairman of the Army Navy and Civilian Board of Boxing Control of New York, became a member the [[International Boxing Union (1913–1946)|International Boxing Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} {{cite news |title= Le congrès de l'International Boxing Union |work= [[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]] |date= February 6, 1920 |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k243913f/f5.item|accessdate= May 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
Biddle also worked in and on periodicals. He spent time as a sports reporter for the ''Public Ledger'', and jokingly referred to himself as "the poorest and richest reporter in Philadelphia". He also revived the ''Philadelphia Sunday Graphic'' for a short interval, before it was forced to fold, and founded a short-lived "society weekly"–type publication, ''The People''. After organizing the also short-lived Drexel Biddle Publishing House, he acted as its head for two years.&lt;ref name="philly"/&gt;

Books written by Biddle include:

* ''A dual rôle: and other stories''. The Warwick Book Publishing Company. 1894.
* ''The Madeira Islands''. Philadelphia: Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley Publishing Company. 1896.
* ''Shantytown Sketches''. Philadelphia: Drexel, Biddle &amp; Bradley Publishing Company. 1897.

The '''Bachelor of Business Administration''' ('''BBA''' or '''B.B.A.''') is a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[commerce]] and [[business administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/bba-degree-in-dubai/bachelor-of-business-administration|title=Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) Degree - UOWD|author=|date=|website=www.uowdubai.ac.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the degree is conferred after four years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. In Europe, the degree is conferred after three years of full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations. The BBA program usually includes general business courses and advanced courses for specific [[Academic major|concentration]]s.

==Structure==
The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular area. B.B.A. programs thus expose students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow students to specialize in a specific academic area; see aside. 

The degree also develops the student's practical, managerial and communication skills, and business decision-making capability. Many programs incorporate [[training]] and practical experience, in the form of [[case study|case projects]], presentations, [[internship]]s, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry. 

General educational requirements emphasize [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] (history, economics, and literature). Coverage of mathematics is generally business related, and is often limited to "Quantitative Applications for Business" or, alternatively, courses in [[Business_mathematics#University_level|Calculus for business]] or [[Calculus 101]], and [[business statistics|business-]] or general-statistics.

===BSBA===
The B.S.B.A., '''Bachelor of Science in Business Administration''', is a quantitative variant on the BBA. General educational requirements are relatively mathematics intensive; further, the general focus may also be more analytic, often allowing additional quantitative optional coursework.

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, [[undergraduate]] Business Administration programs may be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]], thus indicating that the school's educational curriculum meets specific quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AACSB accredited schools|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/AccreditedMembers.asp|publisher=AACSB|access-date=2010-10-22|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AOGQe8CN?url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accreditedmembers.asp|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Executive Director''': Sagip Bansa Filipinas Foundation Inc., an NGO dedicated to helping provide jobs and houses and lots to the poorest of the poor in Philippine society. Starting last year to put into actual action this advocacy, Sagip Bansa with the acquiescence of the Spartan Mining and Development Corporation of DPP’s Chairman Luis G. Ramos has provided decent and well paying jobs (hand-magnetizing iron sand) to more than a thousand displaced Aetas around Mt. Pinatubo while preparing to provide jobs and homes (200&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lots with 50&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; houses for each family) to the thousands of families and informal settlers of Metro Manila (Smokey Mountain, Payatas, Farola, North Triangle, Baseco etc.) collocating them decently in Brgy. Villar, Botolan Zambales. In this regard, he has led efforts to the securitization of this project which will create a new city (tentatively captioned “Magnificat City”) of the poor, for the poor, and by the poor empowering themselves towards decent sufficiency, while at the same time restoring Manila to its original grandeur, of which great Filipino writer Nick Joaquin constantly exulted.

==Special Skills==
*'''Securitization''': the ability/special know-how (he learned from special tutors here and abroad) to create Asset Pool Trusts with selected banks to raise from the Trust departments of banks and high-net-worth individuals and juridical entities critical capital funds for viable projects through domestic and international bond flotation enhanced by third party guarantors/ insurers. (Unknown to many, the combined trust money in the Trust Department of Philippine Banks now amounts to close to Three (3) Trillions Pesos. The major monetary instrument / access tool to these inefficiently and unequitably utilized funds (a luxurious plaything of the few rich, comfortable and powerful) is Securitization. Bal Cordero Falcone can initiate the Securitization of Viable Projects in each city and province to increase the provincial revenues (besides its IRA) as well as solve the unemployment problem of each province city and town.

The '''Business Motivation Model''' ('''BMM''') in [[enterprise architecture]] provides a scheme and structure for developing, communicating, and managing [[business plan]]s in an organized manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/1.1/PDF/|title=BMM 1.1|work=omg.org|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Business Motivation Model does all of the following:
* identifies factors that motivate the establishing of business plans;
* identifies and defines the elements of business plans; and 
* indicates how all these factors and elements inter-relate.

== History ==
Initially developed by the Business Rules Group (BRG),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; in September 2005, the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) voted to accept the Business Motivation Model as the subject of a Request for Comment (RFC).  This meant that the OMG was willing to consider the Business Motivation Model as a specification to be adopted by the OMG, subject to comment from any interested parties.  Adoption as an OMG specification carries the intention that the Business Motivation Model would, in time, be submitted to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/bmm.shtml|title=BRG:  Business Motivation Model|work=businessrulesgroup.org|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 version 1.0 was released by OMG.

In May 2015, version 1.3 of BMM specification &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omg.org/spec/BMM/1.3/ version 1.3 of BMM specification]&lt;/ref&gt; was released and as of May 2015 it is the latest stable release.

== Elements ==
"BMM captures business requirements across different dimensions to rigorously capture and justify why the business wants to do something, what it is aiming to achieve, how it plans to get there, and how it assesses the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/0401_amsden/|title=Capturing requirements with Business Motivation Model, IBM Rational RequisitePro, and IBM Rational Software Modeler|work=ibm.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main elements of BMM are:
* Ends: ''What'' (as opposed to ''how'') the business wants to accomplish
* Means: ''How'' the business intends to accomplish its ''ends''
* Directives: The ''rules'' and ''policies'' that ''constrain'' or ''govern'' the available means
* Influencers: Can cause changes that affect the organization in its employment of its means or achievement of its ends. Influencers are ''neutral'' by definition.
* Assessment: A ''judgment'' of an Influencer that affects the organization's ability to achieve its ends or use its means.

Founded on July 16, 1950 the '''Computer Research Corporation (CRC)''' was an early developer of [[minicomputer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The founding owners of CRC were [[Floyd Steele]], Donald Eckdahl, Hrant (Harold) Sarkinssian, Richard Sprague, and [[Irving S. Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Reed, all members of the CRC had been on the design team for the [[MADDIDA]], a special-purpose digital computer developed from 1946-49 for [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]].&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that a [[Problem-Oriented Language (POL)]] could be used to make a general-purpose computer function as a [[differential analyzer]], the MADDIDA design team left Northrup in 1950 to focus on designing general-purpose computers, leading to them to found the CRC.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; After developing the [[Cadac (computer)|Cadac]], an early minicomputer, the CRC was sold to [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register (NCR)]] in February 1953, launching NCR into the digital computing business.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 2003, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cone Health''' is a private, not-for-profit, healthcare delivery system based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. It includes [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]] , [[Wesley Long Hospital]] , [[Women's Hospital]], and  [[Cone Health Behavioral Health Hospital]] all located in Greensboro.  The Cone Health network also includes [[Alamance Regional Medical Center]] ([[Burlington, North Carolina]]), [[Annie Penn Hospital]] ([[Reidsville, North Carolina]]), MedCenter High Point, MedCenter Kernersville, MedCenter Mebane, and a wide range of Cone Health Medical Group physician practices.

The [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]], the flagship of the system, opened in 1953 on {{convert|63|acre|m2}} near downtown Greensboro. Bertha Cone established it in honor of her husband, [[Moses H. Cone]]. Moses Cone was a textile magnate and founder of [[Cone Mills Corporation|Cone Mills]].

In January 2005, the health system became the first five-hospital system in the Southeast to be awarded the Magnet Recognition for Nursing Excellence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/724-complete-issue.pdf|title=Future of Nursing in North Carolina|work=ncmedicaljournal.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017185145/http://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/724-complete-issue.pdf|archivedate=2011-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grade of approval for quality nursing care.

In 2014, The Cone Health, listed as The [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]], was ranked as one of the best hospitals for 2014-15 in North Carolina by U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/nc/moses-h-cone-memorial-hospital-6360002|title=US News Top Hospitals |work=health.usnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Data warehouse architecture.jpg|thumb|360px|The basic architecture of a data warehouse]]

In [[computing]], a '''data warehouse''' ('''DW''' or '''DWH'''), also known as an '''enterprise data warehouse''' ('''EDW'''), is a system used for [[Business reporting|reporting]] and [[data analysis]], and is considered a core component of [[business intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Dedić|first1=Nedim|last2=Stanier|first2=Clare|year=2016|editor1-last=Hammoudi|editor1-first=Slimane|editor2-last=Maciaszek|editor2-first=Leszek|editor3-last=Missikoff|editor3-first=Michele M. Missikoff|editor4-last=Camp|editor4-first=Olivier|editor5-last=Cordeiro|editor5-first=José|title=An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development|url=http://eprints.staffs.ac.uk/2770/|journal=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS 2016)|publisher=SciTePress|volume=1|pages=196–206|conference=International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, 25–28 April 2016, Rome, Italy|conferenceurl=https://eprints.staffs.ac.uk/2770/1/ICEIS_2016_Volume_1.pdf|doi=10.5220/0005858401960206|isbn=978-989-758-187-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/12/04/10-common-mistakes-when-building-a-data-warehouse/|publisher=blog.rjmetrics.com|title=9 Reasons Data Warehouse Projects Fail|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.&lt;ref name="spotlessdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data stored in the warehouse is [[upload]]ed from the [[operational system]]s (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an [[operational data store]] and may require [[data cleansing]]&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"/&gt; for additional operations to ensure [[data quality]] before it is used in the DW for reporting.

The typical [[extract, transform, load]] (ETL)-based data warehouse&lt;ref name="spotlessdata2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217144032/https://spotlessdata.com/what-big-data|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=What is Big Data?|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[Staging (data)|staging]], [[data integration]], and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an [[operational data store]] (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a [[star schema]]. The access layer helps users retrieve data.&lt;ref name=IJCA96Patil&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/proceedings/icwet/number9/2131-db195 |author1=Patil, Preeti S. |author2=Srikantha Rao |author3=Suryakant B. Patil |title=Optimization of Data Warehousing System: Simplification in Reporting and Analysis |work=IJCA Proceedings on International Conference and workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology (ICWET) |year=2011 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=33–37 |publisher=Foundation of Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of the data is [[data cleansing|cleansed]], transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for [[data mining]], [[OLAP|online analytical processing]], [[market research]] and [[decision support]].&lt;ref&gt;Marakas &amp; O'Brien 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the [[data dictionary]] are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes [[business intelligence tools]], tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve [[metadata]].

==Benefits==
A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
* Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.
* Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running, analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
* Maintain [[Provenance#Data provenance|data history]], even if the source transaction systems do not.
* Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.
* Improve [[data quality]], by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
* Present the organization's information consistently.
* Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source.
* Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
* Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the [[operational system]]s.
* Add value to operational business applications, notably [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems.
*Make decision–support queries easier to write.
*Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idera.com/resourcecentral/whitepapers/modern-data-architecture|title=Modern Data Architecture {{!}} IDERA|last=|first=|date=|website=www.idera.com|publisher=|accessdate=2016-09-18|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic environment==
The environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:

* Source systems that provide data to the warehouse or mart;
* Data integration technology and processes that are needed to prepare the data for use;
* Different architectures for storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts;
*Different tools and applications for the variety of users;
*Metadata, data quality, and governance processes must be in place to ensure that the warehouse or mart meets its purposes.

In regards to source systems listed above, R. Kelly Rainer states, "A common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases, which can be relational databases".&lt;ref name=rainer2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainer|first=R. Kelly|first2=Casey G. |last2=Cegielski |title=Introduction to Information Systems: Enabling and Transforming Business, 4th Edition (Kindle Edition)|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Wiley|pages=127, 128, 130, 131, 133 |isbn=978-1118129401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding data integration, Rainer states, "It is necessary to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse".&lt;ref name=rainer2012/&gt;

Rainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Metadata are data about data. "IT personnel need information about data sources; database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and data usage measures".&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Today, the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities. A key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; A "data warehouse" is a repository of historical data that are organized by subject to support decision makers in the organization.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; Once data are stored in a data mart or warehouse, they can be accessed.

==Related systems (data mart, OLAP, OLTP, predictive analytics)==
A [[data mart]] is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/html/E10312_01/dm_concepts.htm |title=Data Mart Concepts |publisher=Oracle |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system. Given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse, they are often easier and faster to implement.

Types of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.{{clarify |date=March 2017 |reason= }}

[[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP) is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems, response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by [[Data Mining]] techniques. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually [[star schema]]s). OLAP systems typically have data latency of a few hours, as opposed to data marts, where latency is expected to be closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are : Roll-up (Consolidation), Drill-down and Slicing &amp; Dicing.

[[Online transaction processing]] (OLTP) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining [[data integrity]] in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually [[Third normal form|3NF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html |title=OLTP vs. OLAP |year=2009 |website=Datawarehouse4u.Info |quote=We can divide IT systems into transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP). In general we can assume that OLTP systems provide source data to data warehouses, whereas OLAP systems help to analyze it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.

[[Predictive analytics]] is about [[pattern recognition|finding]] and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to [[prediction|predict]] future outcomes. Predictive analysis is different from OLAP in that OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature, while predictive analysis focuses on the future. These systems are also used for [[customer relationship management]] (CRM).

==History==
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0,10801,70102,00.html |title=The Story So Far |date=2002-04-15 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708182105/http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0%2C10801%2C70102%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the "business data warehouse". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to [[decision support system|decision support environments]]. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as [[legacy system]]s), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from "[[data mart]]s" that was tailored for ready access by users.

Key developments in early years of data warehousing were:

* 1960s – [[General Mills]] and [[Dartmouth College]], in a joint research project, develop the terms ''dimensions'' and ''facts''.&lt;ref name="kimball16"&gt;Kimball 2002, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970s – [[ACNielsen]] and IRI provide dimensional data marts for retail sales.&lt;ref name="kimball16" /&gt;
* 1970s – [[Bill Inmon]] begins to define and discuss the term: Data Warehouse.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* 1975 – [[Sperry Univac]] introduces [[MAPPER]] (MAintain, Prepare, and Produce Executive Reports) is a database management and reporting system that includes the world's first [[Fourth-generation programming language|4GL]]. First platform designed for building Information Centers (a forerunner of contemporary data warehouse technology)
* 1983 – [[Teradata]] introduced the [[DBC 1012|DBC/1012]] database computer specifically designed for decision support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Will Teradata revive a market? |author= Paul Gillin |pages= 43, 48 |work= Computer World |date= February 20, 1984 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5pw6ePUC8YYC&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate= 2017-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1984 – [[Metaphor Computer Systems]], founded by [[David Liddle]] and Don Massaro, released a hardware/software package and GUI for business users to create a database management and analytic system.
* 1985 - [[Sperry Corporation]] publish an article (Martyn Jones and Philip Newman) on information centres, where they introduce the term MAPPER data warehouse in the context of information centres.
* 1988 – Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy publish the article ''An architecture for a business and information system'' where they introduce the term "business data warehouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5387658|title=An architecture for a business and information system|journal=IBM Systems Journal | doi=10.1147/sj.271.0060|volume=27|pages=60–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990 – Red Brick Systems, founded by [[Ralph Kimball]], introduces Red Brick Warehouse, a database management system specifically for data warehousing.
* 1991 – Prism Solutions, founded by [[Bill Inmon]], introduces Prism Warehouse Manager, software for developing a data warehouse.
* 1992 – [[Bill Inmon]] publishes the book ''Building the Data Warehouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|title=Building the Data Warehouse|year=1992|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-56960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1995 – The Data Warehousing Institute, a for-profit organization that promotes data warehousing, is founded.
* 1996 – [[Ralph Kimball]] publishes the book ''The Data Warehouse Toolkit''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit|last=Kimball|first=Ralph|publisher=Wiley|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-14977-5|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 – [[Dan Linstedt]] release in the public domain the [[Data vault modeling]] conceived in 1990 as an alternative to Inmon and Kimball to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems, with emphasis on tracing, auditing and resiliance to change of the source data model.
* 2012 – [[Bill Inmon]] developed and made public technology known as "textual disambiguation". Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL. Textual disambiguation is useful wherever raw text is found, such as in documents, Hadoop, email, and so forth.

==Information storage==

===Facts===
A fact is a value or measurement, which represents a fact about the managed entity or system.

Facts, as reported by the reporting entity, are said to be at raw level. E.g. in a mobile telephone system, if a BTS ([[base transceiver station]]) received 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, it allocates for 820, and rejects the remaining, it would report three '''facts''' or measurements to a management system:
* tch_req_total = 1000
* tch_req_success = 820
* tch_req_fail = 180

Facts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] to extract more service or business-relevant information from it. These are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts.

For instance, if there are three BTS in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated from the BTS to the city level in the network dimension. For example:

* tch_req_success_city = tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3
* avg_tch_req_success_city = (tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3) / 3

===Dimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data===
There are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse&amp;nbsp;— the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.

====Dimensional approach====
The dimensional approach refers to [[Ralph Kimball]]'s approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/[[star schema]]. The normalized approach, also called the [[Third normal form|3NF]] model (Third Normal Form) refers to Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.

In a [[Star schema|dimensional approach]], [[transaction data]] are partitioned into "facts", which are generally numeric transaction data, and "[[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.

A key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.

The model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as [http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/dcubes/dcubes.html data cube]. Where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.

The main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following:
# To maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems is complicated.
# It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization adopting the dimensional approach changes the way in which it does business.

====Normalized approach====
In the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, [[database normalization]] rules. Tables are grouped together by ''subject areas'' that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svrtechnologies.com/datastage-training/data-warehouse-online-training |title=Data Warehouse kimball |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the [[data structure]] of the data warehouse.

Both normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization (also known as [[Database normalization#Normal forms|Normal Forms]]). These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).

In ''Information-Driven Business'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=Robert|title=Information-Driven Business|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-62577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Small_Worlds_Data_Transformation_Measure |title=Information Theory &amp; Business Intelligence Strategy - Small Worlds Data Transformation Measure - MIKE2.0, the open source methodology for Information Development |publisher=Mike2.openmethodology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design methods==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===Bottom-up design===
In the ''bottom-up'' approach, [[data mart]]s are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific [[business process]]es. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of "the bus", a collection of [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimension]]s and [[Facts (data warehouse)#Types|conformed fact]]s, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://decisionworks.com/2003/09/the-bottom-up-misnomer/|title=The Bottom-Up Misnomer - DecisionWorks Consulting|website=DecisionWorks Consulting|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-down design===
The ''top-down'' approach is designed using a normalized enterprise [[data model]]. [[Data element|"Atomic" data]], that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gartner, Of Data Warehouses, Operational Data Stores, Data Marts and Data Outhouses, Dec 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid design===
Data warehouses (DW) often resemble the [[hub and spokes architecture]]. [[Legacy system]]s feeding the warehouse often include [[customer relationship management]] and [[enterprise resource planning]], generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the [[extract transform load]] process, data warehouses often make use of an [[operational data store]], the information from which is parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.

A hybrid DW database is kept on [[third normal form]] to eliminate [[data redundancy]]. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The DW provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a [[master data management]] repository where operational, not static information could reside.

The [[data vault modeling]] components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and [[star schema]]. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.

==Data warehouse characteristics==
There are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.

===Subject-Oriented===
Unlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise ([[database normalization]]). Subject orientation can be really useful for decision making.
Gathering the required objects is called subject oriented.

===Integrated===
The data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.

===Time-variant===
While operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting, If a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/662453070|title=Data warehousing fundamentals for IT professionals|last=Paulraj.|first=Ponniah,|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Ponniah, Paulraj.|isbn=9780470462072|edition= 2nd |location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=662453070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonvolatile===
The data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61762085|title=Building the data warehouse|last=H.|first=Inmon, William|date=2005|publisher=Wiley Pub|isbn=9780764599446|edition= 4th |location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=61762085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarized===
In the data warehouse, data is summarized at different levels.The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Data warehouse architecture==
The different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Satinder Bal|last2=Mittal|first2=Aditya|title=Introduction to Database Management System|year=2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Database_Management_Syst.html?id=fyQTae6c9l4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus operational system==
Operational systems are optimized for preservation of [[data integrity]] and speed of recording of business transactions through use of [[database normalization]] and an [[entity-relationship model]]. Operational system designers generally follow [[Codd's 12 rules]] of [[database normalization]] to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. [[Relational database]]s are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. To improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.

Data warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns. Analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever 'select *' as is more common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access patterns, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented DBMS whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a [[column-oriented DBMS]]. Unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business, data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse.

==Evolution in organization use==
These terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:

; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this stage of evolution are updated on a regular time cycle (usually daily, weekly or monthly) from the operational systems and the data is stored in an integrated reporting-oriented data
; Offline data warehouse: Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.
; On time data warehouse: Online Integrated Data Warehousing represent the real time Data warehouses stage data in the warehouse is updated for every transaction performed on the source data
; Integrated data warehouse: These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/data-warehouse.html |title=Data Warehouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Gardiner''' (May 29, 1784 &amp;ndash; February 28, 1844) was the father of [[Julia Gardiner Tyler]], second wife of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John Tyler]].

==Early life==
Gardiner was born on May 29, 1784, the son of Abraham Gardiner (1763–1796) and Phebe Dayton (1757–1810). He was a descendant of [[Lion Gardiner]] (1599–1663) who was an early English settler and soldier that founded the first [[English people|English]] settlement in what became the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] on Long Island, including [[Gardiners Island]].&lt;ref name=Gardiner84&gt;Gardiner, 84&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1804 along with future U.S. Senator from South Carolina, [[John Calhoun]].&lt;ref name="JRBiography"/&gt;

==Career==
He practiced law for several years, but beginning in 1815 when he married Juliana McLachlan, one of the wealthiest women in New York, he managed her extensive real estate holdings in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="JRBiography"/&gt;  He was elected to one four-year term as a member of the [[New York State Senate]] representing the 1st District of Suffolk County from 1824 to 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=11 |title=First Lady Biography: Julia Tyler |publisher= National First Ladies' Library and Historic Site |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gardiner was a supporter of [[John Quincy Adams]], member of the People's Party, which was opposed to the emerging [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]].&lt;ref name="JRBiography"/&gt;

He later lived at 430 Lafayette Street in Manhanttan, "when that sections was one of the social centres of the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annual Report of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society|title= The Old Colonnade of Lafayette Place| date=May 3, 1917 |publisher= Assembly of the State of New York | volume = 51| page=141| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5tw6AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, he took his family to Washington, D.C., for several months of the year, in part to find an appropriate husband for his daughter [[Julia Gardiner Tyler|Julia]]. His family became part of the social circle of President John Tyler and his family.

===Death aboard the ''Princeton''===
[[Image:Explosion aboard USS Princeton.jpg|thumb|275px|Contemporary [[Currier &amp; Ives]] lithograph depicting the explosion]]
Gardiner died in an explosion aboard the [[USS Princeton disaster of 1844|USS ''Princeton'']] on February 28, 1844. President Tyler had proposed to his daughter Julia in February 1843. She had refused him at first but sometime in 1843 they agreed to marry at some future time out of respect for the fact that the President had only been a widow since September 1842. David Gardiner and his daughters Julia and Margaret were aboard a pleasure cruise on the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name="TylerWHHA"/&gt; As the {{USS|Princeton|1843|6}} neared [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]], a cannon that was being demonstrated exploded, killing Gardiner and five others. Funeral services for the five white victims were held in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Manor of Gardiners Island |journal= Magazine of American History |url =https://books.google.com/?id=gc82AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 | first= John Austin |last= Stevens | date=January 1885 |volume = 13 |page=28 | accessdate = March 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardiner was interred in the [[Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] His remains were later moved to the Gardiner family plot at the South End Cemetery in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]], New York.

President Tyler proposed marriage several more times before being accepted. He and Julia Gardiner wed on June 26, 1844. They named their first child [[David Gardiner Tyler]] in honor of his maternal grandfather.&lt;ref name="TylerWHHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Julia Tyler|url=https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/julia-tyler|website=whitehousehistory.org|publisher=[[White House Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Kraiselburd''' (1912–1974) was an Argentine journalist, newspaper publisher, and lawyer, best known for his commitment and actions against military regimes and political violence of both right- and left-wing extraction. He was assassinated shortly after the beginning of the Dirty War—in mid-1974—and shortly before the military coup.

==Life and times==
David Kraiselburd was born into a working-class [[Ukrainian Jews|Ukrainian Jewish]] family in [[Berisso]], an industrial city north of [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]], in 1912. In his teens, a high-school writing contest earned him an internship in La Plata's main daily, ''[[El Día (La Plata)|El Día]]'', after the end of which he was hired by the paper as a sports commentator. He enrolled in the prestigious [[University of La Plata]], and, at the paper, he was promoted to university affairs correspondent. He was also involved in university politics—he had anarchist sympathies, and had protested [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]'s execution a few years earlier. After earning the equivalent of a JD degree from Law School, he became a representative of the alumni association (''Graduados''). To broaden his background, he re-enrolled in the university and earned another degree in History. Also in those early years, the paper sent him to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War.

Gradually, he rose up in the journalistic ranks and became a prominent figure within and outside the paper. ''El Día'''s financial straits eventually led the heirs of its founding partners to sell part of their stake in the daily, and, in September 1961, Kraiselburd purchased a share of ''El Día''. The main owners of the daily became, thus, the Fascetto family (heirs of one of the founding partners) and Kraiselburd, although none had a controlling share (this partnership ended in 2010, with an agreement that gave the Fascetto family full control of ''[[Diario Popular]]'', founded by Kraiselburd in 1974, while control of ''El Día'' was given fully to the Kraiselburd family, especially his eldest son, Raul, who took up his father's post after his murder).

==Kraiselburd and ''El Día'' in the face of the 1960s military coups and the political turmoil of the early 1970s==

Putting his legal background in action as director and editor-in-chief, Kraiselburd was among the few Argentine publishers to openly oppose the 1966 coup d'état against the moderate, democratically elected President [[Arturo Illia]]. Kraiselburd denounced the imminent coup, and then refused to publish dictator [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s inaugural address. Onganía's La Plata officials retaliated by confiscating that day's circulation and harassing the paper.

''El Día'''s challenges were not mitigated by the March 1973 return to democracy in 1973. A decree signed by interim President [[Raúl Lastiri]] sought to prohibit Argentine periodicals' access to international [[news agencies]] wires, in an attempt to limit them to wires published by [[Telam]], the state news agency founded by Lastiri's benefactor, populist former President [[Juan Perón]]. This measure amounted to a monopoly of news wires by the state agency, controlled by the government. Kraiselburd moved quickly, however, and, on his initiative, ''El Día'' and numerous other Argentine dailies established a national news agency, ''Noticias Argentinas''. He was named president of the agency while remaining at the helm of ''El Día''.&lt;ref name="Cuenta Regresiva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz|first=César L.|title=La cuenta regresiva. la construcción periodística del Golpe de Estado de 1976|year=2002|publisher=Editorial La Crujía Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kraiselburd's murder during the 1974 "unofficial" beginning of the Dirty War==

Staunchly centrist, ''El Día'' marshaled its "Page 4" editorial section, which had openly opposed the Ongania coup in the 60s, and that by early 1974 denounced the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (AAA), a right-wing paramilitary organization that was given free rein (and was supported by) the Ministry of Welfare in chasing down left-wing organizations. Naturally, the stronger left-wing organizations (i.e., the left-Peronist Montoneros) retaliated. Yet, by the same token, "El Dia" warned against the escalation of violence that was ensuing, as well as against the increasingly violent "politics" of both Left and Right. "Violence was the main medium of politics first, and {{em|became}} politics later," as researcher [[Pilar Calveiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calveiro|first=Pilar|author-link=Pilar Calveiro|title=Poder y desaparicion|year=2001|publisher=Colihue|location=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; succinctly said in regard to the process underwent by the left-wing Montoneros. Threatened by both the AAA and Montoneros, and although he was a more "fitting" target for the former, it was the latter organization the one which took action against the paper and its editor. Kraiselburd was kidnapped on June 25, 1974 by a Montoneros cell while the editor was walking toward the newspaper building.

In a spree against dissenters, and prefiguring Kraiselburd's fate, on July 15 a Montoneros unit burst into a small-town restaurant and machine-gunned a frequent ''El Dia'' contributor, former Interior (law enforcement) Minister [[Arturo Mor Roig]], who, under the military regime of Gen. Lanusse, had been instrumental in the transition toward democracy that led to two 1973 elections, which Peron's stand-in (Hector Campora) first, and Peron later, won by a landslide. Mor Roig was a well-known moderate democrat. He had knowingly sacrificed his political career when he accepted the position offered to him by Gen. Lanusse years earlier, for the sake of speeding up the transition toward democracy. Montoneros, however, emphasized that during Mor Roig's tenure, prominent political prisoners had been massacred in the course of (and even ''after'') a partially successful escape attempt in a Patagonian prison. The massacre had been brutal, but it was known that Mor Roig had had no involvement whatsoever. Yet, on Montoneros' view, his past association with a military government, in addition to his 1974 ''El Dia'' critical articles, made him a suitable target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Cecil|title=Guerrillas and Generals: Argentina's Dirty War|year=2002|publisher=Kraeger|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many Montoneros acknowledged—most remarkably, intelligence officer, journalist, and outstanding writer [[Rodolfo_Walsh#cite_note-montondoc-2|Rodolfo Walsh]]—these "acts of individual terror," as Walsh called them, would not only backfire, but make popular support dwindle.&lt;ref name=Baschetti&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Rodolfo|title=Los papeles de Walsh|year=1996|publisher=In Baschetti, R., Rodolfo Walsh, vivo.|location=Buenos Aires. Edic. de la Flor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraiselburd would soon follow Mor Roig's fate. He was being held captive in a house in [[Manuel B. Gonnet|Gonnet]], located between La Plata and Buenos Aires. Twenty odd days after the kidnapping, a neighbor called the police after noticing "suspicious activity" in the house next door. On July 17, 1974, a police unit was sent to investigate, and a shooting between the Montoneros cell and the police ensued. Outnumbered, the Montoneros shot Kraiselburd to death and fled the scene.

In September 1975, Kraiselburd was posthumously awarded the prestigious [[Maria Moors Cabot prize]] by Columbia University's School of Journalism, for his defense of democratic values in the face of forms of authoritarianism of both right-wing and left-wing leanings.

==Kraiselburd's imprint after 1974. Kraiselburd, Jr. and ''El Dia'' during the 1976-1983 dictatorship==

After Kraiselburd's murder, his eldest son, Raul, took up his post. Under his direction, and following the lead of his father, ''El Dia'' continued its explicit plea for the adherence to consensus-building, democratic practices, and its equally explicit rejection of lawless, criminal murders and disappearances, increasingly effected with the support of the State apparatus (1975) and, after the coup (1976) with the ''full'' disposal of the State resources at the tip of the Armed Forces. Threats from right-wing paramilitary groups, bombs in the printing press, random machine-gun attacks on buildings and houses, and other intimidatory tactics were overshadowed by the kidnapping and murder of Raul's two-year-old son, named David, after his grandfather. Chalked up to the action of "run-of-the-mill" kidnappers in search for a ransom, the case of David Kraiselburd's homonymous grandson was never fully explained—nor was the baby's body ever found.

Despite sporadic anti-Semitic aspersions claiming the contrary, ''El Día'' was, as media researcher Cesar Diaz put it in a book-length critical analysis of the printed media under the 1976-83 dictatorship, one of the few "non-partner" (no socios) newspapers, along with the better-known case of ''The Buenos Aires Herald''and a few others; that is, newspapers that didn't partake in the "gentleman's agreement" that the military regime had imposed. The "non-partners," therefore, reported on disappearances and related crimes perpetrated by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz|first=Cesar L.|title=Nos/otros y la violencia política 1974-1982. El Herald, La Prensa, y El Día. La Plata:|year=2009|publisher=Al Margen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, both Robert Cox, from the ''Herald'', and Raul Kraiselburd, from ''El Dia'', were also awarded Columbia University's Moors Cabot Prize. Diaz's analysis of the media under the military regime, unusually virtuous in escaping the widespread polarization of accounts of the 1970s (and therefore advancing a critical stance, rather than an unqualified paean), hints that the example of the late David Kraiselburd strengthened the commitment of the journalists who risked their lives every day at the newsroom during the dark years of the juntas.

'''Emory Entrepreneurship &amp; Venture Management''' (EEVM) is a student-run organization dedicated to encouraging [[entrepreneurship]] and business development in the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] area.  EEVM was founded in 2012 by [[Emory University]] undergraduates. Today, EEVM members include Emory [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], professional students, and faculty, as well as several hundred Emory alumni around the world.

== HackATL ==
HackATL is EEVM's annual three-day hackathon competition.  The event is open to all college students as well as working professionals. The inaugural HackATL event was held at the Goizueta Business School and had over 400 participants from 80 different universities.

== StartupCrunch ==
StartupCrunch is a monthly dinner event open to the Atlanta community focused on fostering the entrepreneurship community. The event has invited speakers from around the United States as well as provided an opportunity for local startups to pitch and receive advice.

== Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator ==
Founded in 2014 by Nihar Parikh, the Emory Entrepreneurial Excellerator is designed to coax talent and results out of Emory’s entrepreneurial community. The program takes Emory-founded startups from conception to the initial pitch phase, and culminates with the companies in the program pitching to Atlanta venture capital firms. The program will help Emory and The Goizueta Business School establish themselves as a force in the South’s vibrant startup community.

The pre-accelerator has three components to it: Work sessions, a speaking series and a mentoring program.

=== Work Sessions ===
A primary component of the program is ensuring the startups maintain a consistent work schedule so they can accomplish their goals in a timely fashion. Work sessions will feature resources including computer lab type rooms work rooms, either in the library or the business school, resource materials compiled by EEVM only available during work sessions, and an EEVM mentor present to mediate the meeting as well as offer basic suggestions. Teams will be required to submit deliverables on specific topics after each work sessions. 

=== Speaker Series ===
EEVM will bring in speakers twice a month, prioritizing startup veterans or members of other incubators like Hypepotamus, ATDC, Tech Village, etc. Topics will focus on early stage startup development, including but not limited to determining market potential, assigning roles, and incorporating and other legal advice. 

=== Mentor Open Hours ===
Goizueta professors and faculty members will be available for limited periods every week for guidance. Startups can use these resources to test ideas on more experienced individuals as well as ask for guidance on specific technical topics, such as market research techniques and financial modeling. To best utilize mentor schedules, startups must ask for an appointment with the mentor and come prepared with a problem statement.

'''Entrepreneurship education''' seeks to provide [[student]]s with the knowledge, skills and motivation to encourage [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] success in a variety of settings.

Variations of entrepreneurship [[education]] are offered at all levels of schooling from [[primary education|primary]] or [[secondary education|secondary]] schools through graduate [[university]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/general_framework/n26111_en.htm] European Union Commission analyses entrepreneurship education in all education levels in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6735325.stm] United Kingdom governmental push towards entrepreneurship education in different education levels&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

Entrepreneurship education focuses on the development of skills or attributes that enable the realization of [[Wikt:opportunity|opportunity]], where [[management education]] is focused on the best way to operate existing hierarchies. Both approaches share an interest in achieving "profit" in some form (which in non-profit organizations or government can take the form of increased services or decreased cost or increased responsiveness to the customer/citizen/client).

Entrepreneurship education can be oriented towards different ways of realizing opportunities:

*The most popular one is regular [[entrepreneurship]]: ''opening a new organization'' (e.g. starting a new business).&lt;ref&gt;Miron-Shatz, T., Shatz, I., Becker, S., Patel, J., &amp; Eysenbach, G. (2014). [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Promoting-Business-and-Entrepreneurial-Awareness-in-Health-Care-Professionals.pdf "Promoting business and entrepreneurial awareness in health care professionals: lessons from venture capital panels at medicine 2.0 conferences"]. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16(8), e184.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of programs on university level teach entrepreneurship in a similar way to other business degrees. However, the UK Higher Education system makes distinction between the creativity and innovation aspects, which it sees as a precursor to new venture development. Here Enterprise is defined as an ability to develop multiple ideas and opportunities that can be made real, and entrepreneurship is defined as the development of business acumen that can realise the full potential. This enables any discipline that is subject to the UK Higher Education's  Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education's guidance, to offer subject-based entrepreneurial curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/enterprise-entrepreneurship-guidance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission set out a series of learning outcomes that address the need for European-wide perspectives on how such learning should be evaluated, and highlight the need for teacher development at all levels. &lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/strategic-framework/archive/documents/entrepreneurship-report-2014_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Best practice guidance for schools and teachers is also available via the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry's Entrepreneurship 2020 Unit. &lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneurship Education: A Guide for Educators (2013) Brussels: European Commission — DG Enterprise and Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2015 the OECD partnered the European Commission to produce guidance for the development of skills and competencies for entrepreneurship. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/skills-for-entrepreneurship.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach is action-based entrepreneurship education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Action-based entrepreneurship education|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497205000994|journal = Technovation|date = 2006-02-01|pages = 185–194|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.technovation.2005.06.012|first = Einar A.|last = Rasmussen|first2 = Roger|last2 = Sørheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes also labelled as venture creation programs (VCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Venture Creation Programs List {{!}} We List Venture Creation Programs|url = http://vcplist.com/|website = vcplist.com|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these programs the students launch a new business as an integral part of the learning process. The most comprehensive VCP programs therefore also run a [[business incubator]] on site and operate over a long time period (e.g. 1–2 years).
*Another approach is to promote innovation or introduce ''new products or services or markets in existing firms''. This approach is called corporate entrepreneurship or [[Intrapreneurship]], and was made popular by author [[Gifford Pinchot]] in his book of the same name. Newer research indicates that clustering is now a driving factor.  Clustering occurs when a group of employees breaks off from the parent company to found a new company but continues to do business with the parent.  [[Business cluster#The Silicon Valley case|Silicon Valley]] is one such cluster, grown very large.
*A recent approach involves ''creating charitable organizations'' (or portions of existing charities) which are designed to be self-supporting in addition to doing their good works. This is usually called [[social entrepreneurship]] or social venturing. Even a version of public sector entrepreneurship has come into being in governments, with an increased focus on innovation and customer service. This approach got its start in the policies of the United Kingdom's [[Thatcherism|Margaret Thatcher]] and the United States' [[Reaganomics|Ronald Reagan]].
* Entrepreneurship is also being developed as a way of developing skills such as risk-taking and problem solving that facilitate achievement of life goals and in education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/can-instilling-a-sense-of-entrepreneurship-in-pupils-have-a-positive-effect-on-their-learning-9826864.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entrepreneurship For Kids:'''

To catch them early is the vision. Based on certain research in India &amp; Israel, Schools are now incorporating new course for young students. Founder of Leader To Creator Pradeep Mishra started this program in schools in India. The kids are taught about business and economics at a very young age. Students are exposed to a controlled economic environment for better learning outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="611">The '''Export Price Index''' (EPI) tracks changes in the price which firms and countries receive for products they [[export]].

Increases in the EPI are typically due to strong foreign [[demand]] or higher internal costs within the exporter’s country.

Generally, only increases caused by strong foreign demand are beneficial. However, the overall effect of such increases is debatable.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

'''''Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work and in Life One Conversation at a Time''''' ({{ISBN|0-425-19337-3}}) is a [[self-help book]] written by Susan Scott, about how to have a difficult conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astd.org/Publications/Blogs/Learning-Executive-Blog/2012/04/Book-Review-Fierce-Conversations |title=Book Review - Fierce Conversations |author=Steve Gladis |date=April 19, 2012 |work=Learning Executive Blog |publisher=[[American Society for Training &amp; Development]] |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction states that ''Fierce Conversations'' is a "guide to tackling your toughest challenges and enriching relationships with everyone important to your success and happiness through principles, tools, and assignments designed to direct you through your first fierce conversations with yourself on to the most challenging and important conversations facing you."&lt;ref name=page1-2&gt;Scott et al., p. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectconnections.com/knowhow/book_reviews_short/brs_fierce-conversations.html |title=Book review of "Fierce Conversations" |author= |date= |work=ProjectConnections |publisher=Emprend, Inc |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author states that the book is based on her experience running think tanks and designing and delivering training.&lt;ref name=page1-2 /&gt; The book was published by Viking in 2002 (hardcover version) and then by the [[Berkley Publishing Group]] in 2004 (paperback version). It has since become a [[Wall Street Journal]] and [[UPI]] bestseller.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Fierce conversations==
The author defines a fierce conversation as "One in which we come out from behind ourselves, into the conversation and make it real."&lt;ref name=page7&gt;Scott et al., p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that interpersonal difficulties are a direct result of our inability to communicate well.&lt;ref name=page7/&gt;

Michael Brisciana has stated that "I worry that some of their most enthusiastic adherents can seem more eager for the 'fierce' (i.e., 'confrontational') part of the concept than the 'conversation'".  Perhaps due to a misunderstanding of the book, they have the wrong kind of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrperspectives.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/constructive-conversations-not-fierce-ones/#more-1171 |title=Constructive Conversations&amp;nbsp;...

'''Giuseppe Ciarrapico''' (born 28 January 1934) is an Italian entrepreneur, publisher and former politician. He has been president  of football club [[AS Roma]] from 1991 and 1993, and a [[Italian Senate|senator of Italy]] for [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[The People of Freedom]] party in 2008-2012. Ciarrapico has been convicted and imprisoned several times due to his involvement in financial scandals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapresse.it/politica/fondi-editoria-ciarrapico-e-altre-11-persone-rinviate-a-giudizio-1.118101 "Fondi editoria, Ciarrapico e altre 11 persone rinviate a giudizio"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ciarrapico was born in [[Rome]], but grew up in [[Ciociaria]]. A supporter of [[Fascism]] in his youth, he was the printer for the manifestoes of the Italian neo-Fascist party, [[Movimento Sociale Italiano|MSI]], in his printing plant at [[Cassino]]. His publishing house also released [[Historical Revisionism|revisionist]] books and pamphlets. Later in his life became nearer to [[Giulio Andreotti]]'s right-wing current within [[Democrazia Cristiana]] (then Italy's major centre party).

Ciarrapico was also the owner of the large [[mineral water]] plants at [[Fiuggi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/maggio/28/Ciarrapico_veniva_Premio_Fiuggi_Nicoletti_co_0_96052810694.shtml "Ciarrapico: veniva al Premio Fiuggi. Nicoletti? Me lo presento' Evangelisti..."]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of a series of private hospitals in Rome, of the [[aerotaxi]] company [[Air Capitol]] and of the Roman restaurant [[Casina Valadier]]. His holding Italfin '80, under which his properties were collected, went bankrupt in the early 1990s: after being prosecuted  for bankruptcy in 1993, Ciarrapico was forced to abandon the presidency of Rome's football club [[AS Roma]], which he had acquired in April 1991. Ciarrapico was trialled and sentenced to 4.5 years of imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/maggio/27/bancarotta_anni_mezzo_Ciarrapico_co_0_93052712470.shtml "bancarotta: 4 anni e mezzo a Ciarrapico"]&lt;/ref&gt; later reduced to 3 years. He was also involved in the Samif-Italsanità healthcare scandal, after which he was imprisoned at [[Regina Coeli]] on 21 March 1993; in the same year he was again accused and imprisoned for illegal financing of political parties. He was also sentenced 5.5 years (later reduced to 4.5)&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/dicembre/28/Sentenza_sull_Ambrosiano_pene_alleggerite_co_0_96122813874.shtml "Sentenza sull' Ambrosiano: " Le pene alleggerite per rieducare i condannati"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the trial for the [[Banco Ambrosiano]] bankrupt.

In 1997 he founded a newspaper, ''[[Oggi Sicilia]]'', which was closed in 2000. His chain of local newspaper also included ''[[Ciociaria Oggi]]'', ''[[Latina Oggi]]'' and ''Nuovo Oggi Molise'', but his publishing company, after undergoing financial problems, was sold in 2012.

In 2010, when he was a senator for Silvio Berlusconi's party, part of his properties were confiscated by the [[Guardia di Finanza]] due to Ciarrapico's illegal acquisition of state contributions for a total of 20 million euros in 2002-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://roma.corriere.it/roma/notizie/cronaca/10_maggio_4/indagato-ciarrapico-truffa-danni-stato-1602954762128.shtml "Truffa ai danni dello Stato, indagato l'editore Ciarrapico"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Aguiar was born on May 31, 1977&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flpd.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=2568&lt;/ref&gt; in Rio de Janeiro.

His family moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] when Aguiar was one year old.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt; He graduated from the [[Westminster Academy (Florida)|Westminster Academy Christian School]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trischitta |first=Linda |url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/guma-aguiar-video-interview-captures-missing-multimillionaire-in-happier-moments |title=Guma Aguiar video: Interview captures missing multimillionaire in happier moments |publisher=Wptv.com |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2013-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131030095704/http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/state/guma-aguiar-video-interview-captures-missing-multimillionaire-in-happier-moments |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aguiar enrolled at [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] but dropped out after one year.&lt;ref name="SunSentinelTurmoil" /&gt;

==Career==
Aguiar was the vice chairman and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Leor Energy]]. Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the floor of the [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] in 1999 where he focused on the energy markets, with particular emphasis on [[natural gas]]. Transitioning from daily trading activity to the long-term physical markets, Aguiar joined with his uncle, [[Thomas Kaplan]], in 2001 to manage a portfolio of family investments ranging from [[venture capital]] to [[private equity]] and debt. During this time, he served as a director of several public and private companies and was given responsibility for creating a U.S.-based energy company focused on aggressive early-stage oil and gas exploration. After assembling a diversified portfolio of energy properties in Louisiana and Texas, ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, Aguiar identified and executed Leor's acquisition of its flagship property in the [[Deep Bossier]] of [[East Texas]] in 2003.

In 2005, under Aguiar's executive management, Leor Energy engineered financings which fully capitalized the projects in Leor Energy LP. Included in these transactions were Leor Energy Lp industrial alliance with Encana, a natural gas producer in North America and the Leor Energy Lp joint-venture partner in the Deep Bossier. 
Under Aguiar, a [[Mezzanine capital|mezzanine financing]] with hedge-fund Amaranth Capital LLC{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} was achieved.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=4288364&amp;privcapId=27143526&amp;previousCapId=27143526&amp;previousTitle=Leor%20Energy%20L.P |title=Guma Aguiar: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Businessweek |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leor Energy has a financial alliance with its first strategic equity partner, [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs &amp; Co]].

Aguiar joined Cadence Resources in July 2002 and served as a Member of the Board of Directors of Corporate Development until June 30, 2003.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"/&gt;

==Philanthropic activities==
Aguiar was the director of the Lillian Jean Kaplan Foundation and was involved in numerous philanthropic activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-01-25/news/0901240172_1_messiah-guma-aguiar-nephew|title=Multimillion-dollar family feud in court|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He donated more than US$8 million to fund the activities of [[Nefesh B'Nefesh]], a [[Zionist]] organization which promotes [[Aliyah]] (Jewish immigration) from North America and the United Kingdom to Israel. He was a supporter of the [[March of the Living]], which organizes educational programming in Poland and Israel to enable students to better understand the [[Holocaust]] and the rebirth of [[Zionism]] and the creation of the modern Jewish state of Israel.

For his philanthropic activities, in April 2009, [[The Jewish Week]] recognized Aguiar as one of the "36 under 36″ (one of 36 of the most influential Jewish leaders under the age of 36).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/36_under_36/36_under_36_2009_guma_aguiar_33|title=36 Under 36 2009: Guma Aguiar, 33 - The Jewish Week|work=The Jewish Week|accessdate=14 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172755/http://www.thejewishweek.com/special_sections/36_under_36/36_under_36_2009_guma_aguiar_33|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Aguiar founded the "Defender of Jerusalem Award" which recognizes public figures who have taken uniquely strong stances in support of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Perry-in-Israel-to-Receive--53135252.html|title=Perry in Israel to Receive Defender of Jerusalem Award|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Aguiar and his wife Jamie served as the co-chairs of the "Facing Tomorrow" Conference in Jerusalem organized by Israel's President [[Shimon Peres]]. During the conference, Aguiar was featured on a panel with the President and offered his vision of Israeli society and culture from the perspective of one of the country's most recognized entrepreneurs.

==Jerusalem sports==
On July 21, 2009, Aguiar announced an investment of over US$4 million to support the [[Beitar Jerusalem]] [[Football team|Football Team]] which, despite a massive fan following, had grown into [[financial distress]] and was on the brink of collapse prior to Aguiar's financial contributions. Aguiar was motivated to purchase the team out of his love for the sport combined with a passion for Jerusalem and Israel.

In September 2009, Aguiar took his commitment to Jerusalem sports to the next level when he invested over $1.5 million in the city's leading basketball franchise, [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem]].

Since these investments, Aguiar became a fixture in Israeli social circles and regularly met with members of Knesset and local political and business leaders.

Aguiar managed the teams and was in contact with the general managers of both Betar ([[Itzik Kornfein]]) and Hapoel (Dani Klein). In November 2009, Aguiar travelled with Kornfein to Brazil with the goal of scouting out players for the Betar team. He made an effort to be at team practices and met with the players and staff of both teams.

Beitar fans attribute Beitar's winning the [[Toto Cup]] on 26 January 2010 to Aguiar's financial backing, although it was won while Aguiar was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility. About a half an hour after winning, Itzik Kornfein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=282&amp;docID=72728&amp;lang=HE |title=קורנפיין נסע עם גביע הטוטו לאגיאר |publisher=Sport5.co.il |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2012-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130108072905/http://www.sport5.co.il/articles.aspx?FolderID=282&amp;docID=72728&amp;lang=HE |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; took the Toto Cup to the psychiatric hospital but was not permitted to enter. He asked the security staff to take in the trophy to the hospitalized Aguiar.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Aguiar married his [[Westminster Academy (Florida)|Westminster Academy]] high school sweetheart, Jamie Elizabeth Black.&lt;ref name=SunSentinelTurmoil /&gt; Jamie graduated from the [[University of Florida]] with a degree in Public Relations.&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-30/news/fl-guma-aguiar-troubled-life-20120630_1_ellen-aguiar-rocky-seas-guma-aguiar |title=Guma Aguiar: Missing Fort Lauderdale millionaire's life was in turmoil - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children,&lt;ref name=SunSentinelTurmoil /&gt; Jacob, Lilly, Jonathan, and Leo&lt;ref name="justia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2011mc00290/383539/3/3.html|title=Document 3 :: Ellen Aguiar v.

On January 14, 2010, Aguiar was [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to a mental hospital in Israel by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/rabbis-facilitate-truce-missing-millionaire-guma-aguiars-mom/story?id=16671744&amp;page=2 |title=Page 2: Rabbis Facilitate Truce Between Missing Millionaire Guma Aguiar's Mom and Wife - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy |first=Marc |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/23723/prodigal-son/ |title=Prodigal Son - by Allison Hoffman - Tablet Magazine – Jewish News and Politics, Jewish Arts and Culture, Jewish Life and Religion |publisher=Tabletmag.com |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2012/06/28/the-tragedy-of-guma-aguiar-and-a-2-billion-texas-gas-fortune/ |title=The Tragedy Of Guma Aguiar And A $2 Billion Texas Gas Fortune |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Betar-sponsor-in-psychiatric-hospital |title=Betar sponsor in psychiatric hospital &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date=2010-01-17 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/46976/2010/01/14/jerusalem-court-orders-guma-aguiar-to-psychiatric-hospital/ |title=Jerusalem - Court Orders Guma Aguiar To Psychiatric Hospital |publisher=VosIzNeias.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, due to his mental illness, his wife Jamie and mother Ellen petitioned a [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] judge for guardianship over Aguiar. The court agreed, and appointed an emergency guardianship over Aguiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/troubled-florida-millionaire-guma-aguiar-missing-empty-yacht/story?id=16619645&amp;page=2 |title=Page 2: Troubled Florida Millionaire Guma Aguiar Missing After Empty Yacht Washes Ashore - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after his disappearance in June 2012, Aguiar's mother filed documents in Broward County, Florida court to become [[Conservatorship|conservator]] of his nearly $100 million fortune. In Ellen Aguiar's petition, she wrote that Guma "disappeared as the result of mental derangement or other mental cause" or disappeared "under circumstances indicating that he may have died, either naturally, or accidentally." It further stated that he suffered from "severe bipolar disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-06-22/news/fl-guma-aguiar-missing-folo-20120621_1_fishing-boat-search-ends-petition |title=Missing millionaire Guma Aguiar - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguiar was sued by his uncle [[Thomas Kaplan]]. As part of that lawsuit, the judge presiding over the case, John O'Sullivan, found that Aguiar's psychosis "manifested itself in both grandiose and paranoid delusions," for example, Aguiar's belief that he (Aguiar) was being followed by snipers.&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; On the day Aguiar disappeared, a federal judge in Florida issued an order appointing an independent medical examiner to see if Aguiar was psychologically sound enough for a deposition in the case.&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt;

==Disappearance==

[[Sea Tow]], the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]] searched up and down the beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] commenced a search at sea.&lt;ref name="wptv.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trischitta/&gt; A search of his house found that his watch and wedding band had been left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2197830/Guma-Aguiar-Missing-millionaire-left-wedding-ring-watch-night-disappeared.html |title=Guma Aguiar: Missing millionaire left his wedding ring and watch behind on night he disappeared... but he bought [sic] along a special Jewish text for 'solace' | first = Beth | last = Stebner | first2 = Meghan | last2 = Keneally |publisher=DailyMail.co.uk |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft.

Dolle had opposed the takeover, preferring a hastily drawn up plan to merge with Russian company Severstal, praising the owner as  a "true European."&lt;ref name="NytimesFullpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E6DB1E3EF934A15756C0A9609C8B63|title=Arcelor, Trying to Fend Off Suitor, Is Buying Russian Steel Company|author=Heather Timmons and James Kanter|date=May 27, 2006|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Mittal's products as low-grade eau de cologne compared with perfumes produced by Arcelor.

In an article entitled "Arcelor's Chief Is Ousted From Mittal Partnership", the NY Times wrote that it was announced that Arcelor Mittal would be replacing him with a new chief executive. Mr. Dollé, who sat silently in the front row, hastily left the news conference refusing to answer questions.&lt;ref name="Nytimes27Steels"/&gt;

== Biography ==
At the age of one year Helder Bataglia arrives in Angola, at the time a [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colony]]. His father was a director of a [[Germany|German]] fish flour production company in the [[Benguela province]]. Hélder is raised in the municipality of Baía Farta and attends a local school. At the age of ten he leaves Baía Farta to study in [[Benguela]] and later at the Institute of Industry of [[Huambo]], [[Bié Plateau|Central Plateau of Angola]]. He studies [[engineering]], interrupted by the military service from 1969 to 1972 with [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. From 1972 to 1974 he starts a profitable fish transformation company using an innovative technique for artificial drying. In 1975 he relocates to [[Lisbon]] with his first wife and daughter.
 
== Career ==
Once in [[Portugal]] he enters business and travels across the [[Middle East]], particularly [[Kuwait]], [[Irak]], [[Iran]] and [[Algeria]]. In 1980, in [[Egypt]], he met his second wife, daughter of an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman in the construction and infrastructure sector. In 1982, he participates in an international cooperation project to develop vocational training in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Project ONEP - 1982 : vocational training centre in the areas of mechanics,  sewing, drawing, photography electromechanics, carpentry, metalwork.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he leaves for the former [[USSR]], where he participates in the construction of tannery factories and shoe factories, then requested by the [[Soviet]] government.

In 1991 Hélder Bataglia returns to Portugal. The following year, the [[Espírito Santo Financial Group|Espírito Santo Group]] (GES) appoints him to create [[Escom Group]], an investment company to support GES transactions in [[Angola]]. These activities were then expanded to the [[Republic of the Congo]], [[South Africa]] (2009) and [[Mozambique]] (2011) where he founded [[Networx]]. Since 2013, Hélder Bataglia has been working with international [[investment fund]]s with the aim of creating projects the infrastructure and transportation sectors in Africa, particularly in Angola, Mozambique and the Republic of the Congo.

=== The case of the submarines ===
In 2004, Escom provides assistance to German Submarine Consortium (GSG) in defining the compensation incentives included in [[:pt:Caso dos submarinos|the sale of two submarines to Portugal]]. The success of the transaction provides Escom with a 2.5% profit on the sale price, €25 million. The Public prosecution in Portugal ordered an inquiry into the process due to suspicions of bribery and corruption, later confirmed by German authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.algarvedailynews.com/cases/submarine-case/9496-germans-prove-6-4-million-submarine-bribe-was-received-by-portuguese-elite|title=Germans prove €6.4 million submarine bribe was received by four Portuguese elite|last=Rees|first=Paul|website=www.algarvedailynews.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escom's board of directors was heard several times, but no proof was noticed apart from the fact that Battaglia was involved in money transfers that were the starting point of investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observador.pt/especiais/quem-recebeu-de-ricardo-salgado-quando-como-e-porque/|title=Quem recebeu de Ricardo Salgado.

'''Henrique de Araújo de Sommer''' ([[Lisbon]], 29 January 1886 &amp;mdash; [[Cascais]], 28 March 1944) was one of Portugal's most important industrialists.

He was a member of a German aristocratic family living in [[Portugal]], since his grandfather Heinrich Baron von Sommer joined the armies of D. [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], married a Portuguese lady and started a company - Casa Sommer &amp; Cia. dedicated to importing iron.

Henrique de Sommer, after commercial studies in England, was called at the age of 26 to manage his family businesses.

He started the production of Portland cement at the Maceira Liz factory in 1923, being still remembered for his social work, and the out of ordinary working conditions for the factory workers.

With the acquisition of the Companhia de Cimentos Tejo in 1935 he became Portugal's main cement producer.

He experimented with the Basset method of iron ingot, but met with little success, having set along with a project of expansion of his cement production to Mozambique the path that would later be followed by his nephew [[António Champalimaud]].

He had no children, and the division of his inheritance among his nephews and niece was sadly known as the Sommer Inheritance Case, the longest lawsuit in Portuguese history.

An '''independent director''' (also sometimes known as an '''outside director''') is a director (member) of a board of directors who does not have a material or pecuniary relationship with company or related persons, except sitting fees. In the US, independent outsiders make up 66% of all boards and 72% of [[S&amp;P 500]] company boards, according to [[The Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamkeenconsult.com/pdf/dna2_v1.pdf Corporate Governance on an International Level, Tamkeen, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal requirements ==
=== United States ===
The [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] and [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange standards for independent directors are similar. Both require that "a majority of the board of directors of a listed company be 'independent,'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.findlaw.com/finance/sec-approves-nyse-and-nasdaq-proposals-relating-to-director.html SEC Approves NYSE and NASDAQ Proposals Relating to Director Independence]| corporate.findlaw.com| 2008-03-26&lt;/ref&gt; Both allow compensation for directors of $120,000/year or less (as of August 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chadbourne.com/clientalerts/2008/defofinddir/ Client Alert. Nasdaq and NYSE Amend Definition of Independent Director]| Chadbourne &amp; Parke| 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;)

The NYSE states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"no director qualifies as 'independent' unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has 'no material relationship' with the listed company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company."&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://tcbblogs.org/governance/2010/09/10/just-what-is-an-independent-director-anyway/ Just What is an Independent Director Anyway? ] Governance Center Blog, The Conference Board&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nasdaq's rules say that an independent director must not be an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

According to the Conference Board, "other than [[Listing (finance)|delisting]] a company ... there really is no penalty" by the stock exchanges or the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for not having enough independent directors.&lt;ref name=whatis/&gt;

=== India ===
In India as of 2017, a majority of the minimum two directors of public companies having share capital in excess of Rs. 100&amp;nbsp;million (Rs 100,000,000) should be independent. Clause 49 of the listing agreements defines independent directors as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;"For the purpose of this clause the expression 'independent directors' means directors who apart from receiving director's remuneration, do not have any other material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company, its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which in judgment of the board may affect independence of judgment of the directors."&lt;ref name=wcfcg&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100619130652/http://www.wcfcg.net/ht130304.htm Are we making a mockery of independent directors?] Dr. Madhav Mehra, President, World Council for Corporate Governance (circa 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Companies Act, 2013]], most sections of which got implemented from 1 April 2014, has mandated all listed public companies to have at least one-third of the total Directors to be independent. Whereas in the case of unlisted public companies, the following class of companies shall have at least two directors as independent directors:

(i)   Public Companies having paid up share capital of Ten Crore rupees or more; or
(ii)  Public Companies having turnover of One Hundred Crore rupees or more; or
(iii) Public Companies which have, in aggregate, outstanding loans, debentures and deposits exceeding 50 Crore rupees or more.

The Companies Act, 2013 is drafted taking into consideration the noteworthy inputs and contribution that an Independent Director can bring in to the business. Section 149(6) of the act stipulates the criteria for a candidate that ensures highest standards of integrity, while also preventing any conflict of interest. The provisions seek to ensure the autonomy of the appointee to facilitate effective discharge of duties such as upholding shareholders' interest, upholding corporate governance standards, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf Companies Act 2013] p.91&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation offered to such Independent Directors in the form of "sitting fee" has also been increased from Rs. 20,000 (prescribed by Companies Act, 1956) to a maximum of Rs. 1,00,000/- per meeting.

The requirements in Kenya are similar to those in India. (These are to be found in the Companies Act, Cap 486 Laws of Kenya).&lt;George Kinyua, LL.B&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Some researchers have complained that firms have appointed "independent directors who are overly sympathetic to
management, while still technically independent according to regulatory definitions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.hbs.edu/lcohen/pdffiles/malcofrazIII.pdf Hiring Cheerleaders: Board Appointments of "Independent" Directors] Lauren Cohen, Andrea Frazzini
Christopher J. Malloy&lt;/ref&gt;

One complaint against the independence regulations is that CEOs may find loopholes to influence directors. While the NYSE has a $1 million limit on business dealing between directors and the firm, this does not include charitable contributions. Two critics of management influence over boards note that "a director who is an officer or employee of a charitable organization can still be considered independent even if the firm on whose board the director sits contributes more than $1 million to that organization."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDDnbxaleNsC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=As+for+charitable+contributions,+the+NYSE+standards+make+it+clear&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QIBVRne2wb&amp;sig=yA4Qie5Rp8OQxrlczVEhXHfYOMo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=84JjUN61MYjFyAGpjYH4Dw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pay Without Performance: The Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation]'' By Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Jesse M. Fried] (p.29)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Innovation Park''' at [[Pennsylvania State University]] is a [[business park|business]] and [[research park]] covering {{convert|118|acre|km2}} in [[State College, Pennsylvania]], adjacent to the Penn State campus near the junction of [[Interstate 99]] and [[U.S. Route 322 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 322]].

'''Jari Komulainen''' is a [[Finns|Finnish]] businessman. He became famous by being married to the [[Finnish President]] [[Mauno Koivisto]]’s daughter, [[Assi Koivisto]].

==Personal life==

Jari Komulainen married Assi Koivisto, the daughter of President Mauno Koivisto in a lavish wedding in the Presidential summer palace, [[Kultaranta]], in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/viihde/uutiset/muut.shtml/754984?koivisto_mauno |title=Mauno Koivisto tänään 85 vuotta - Katso hauskat kuvat vuosien varrelta - MTV3.fi - Viihde - Uutiset |publisher=MTV3.fi |date=1982-06-19 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in the 1990s and did not have any children, which was speculated to be the cause to the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Kuultua/1112/ |title=Turhimot |publisher=City.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Komulainen’s second marriage to [[Minna Brygger]] produced one child but did not last long &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110927154717/http://www.huuto.net/kohteet/anna-lehti-nro-9_2821995/122674218 ]&lt;/ref&gt; as he already married [[Anitra Ahtola]] in 1998. The couple got divorced in 2003. Anitra Ahtola is a Finnish [[model (person)|model]] and the first runner up in 1996 [[Miss Finland]] competition. The couple has two children.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1392969/bio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

Komulainen got into a Russian submarine business with [[Russians|Russian]] partners and purchased a {{sclass2-|Juliett|submarine|0}} {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-77|}} in 1993, which he later chartered to the [[Intermedia]] Film Equities Ltd as a movie set of the [[K-19 Widowmaker]]  movie starring [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Harrison Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saratogamuseum.org/juliett/history/historyofjuliett484.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726121234/http://www.saratogamuseum.org/juliett/history/historyofjuliett484.html |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine was also used as a restaurant and Komulainen even held his own [[beauty pageant]], [[Miss Submarine]], on top of his ''K-77'' in [[Helsinki]]. He later married the winner of the competition, Anitra Ahtola.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1392969/bio&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, after the film wrapped up, the submarine was purchased by the [[USS Saratoga Museum Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saratogamuseum.org/ |title=The Home Page of the USS Saratoga Museum Foundation, Inc |publisher=Saratogamuseum.org |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; towed to [[Collier Point Park]] in Providence, [[Rhode Island]], and opened to the public in August 2002.
Komulainen’s company, [[Solo International ltd]], used [[Sanil Europe ltd]] to import scooters and bicycles to the Finnish market. The company had a turnover of 4 million Euros a year, however Komulainen sold Solo International Ltd to [[Solifer Group]] during the summer 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talouselama.fi/yrityskaupat/article163690.ece |title=Jari Komulainen myi pyöräbisnekset Soliferille - Yrityskaupat - Talouselämä |language=fi |publisher=Talouselama.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Baptiste Pastor''' was an Italian-born [[Monaco|Monegasque]] businessman and property developer.

==Early life==
Jean-Baptiste Pastor was born '''Giovanni Battista Pastor''' in [[Buggio]], Italy, just across the border from France. He was orphaned at an early age, and was already working as a miner by the age of 13,&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Hélène Pastor|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4107061.ece|accessdate=16 January 2015|work= [[The Times]] |date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a stonemason, according to another source.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Hélène Pastor- obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10849904/Helene-Pastor-obituary.html|accessdate=16 January 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He emigrated to [[Monte Carlo]] as a young man in 1880,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; to seek work on the construction of the [[Saint-Charles Church, Monaco|Saint-Charles Church]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexpressvieeco"&gt;Philippe Bidalon, Roger-Louis Bianchini, Aline Cochard, Laetizia Dannery, Lea Delpont, Jennifer Schwarz, Pauline Sommelet, [http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/vie-economique_654033.html Vie économique], ''L'Express'', December 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

His career as a public works contractor was a success. Pastor eventually started his own company, – J.B. Pastor &amp; Fils – in 1920,&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Metcalf|first1=Tom|title=Monaco Murders Reveal Six Hidden Real Estate Billionaires|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-16/monaco-murders-reveal-six-hidden-real-estate-billionaires.html|accessdate=17 January 2015|work=Bloomberg|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the contracts to build Monaco's water supply system.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In 1936, [[Prince Louis II of Monaco]] awarded Pastor and his company J.B. Pastor &amp; Fils, the commission to build the country's first football stadium.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The [[Stade Louis II (1939)|Stade Louis II]] was finished in 1939 and had a capacity of 12,000.

With his newfound wealth, Pastor bought seafront land at low prices after World War II, particularly in the [[Larvotto]] district, when there was still no development east of the casino. With the post-war tourism slump, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier]] resolved to diversify from gambling and turned Monaco into a [[tax haven]]. In subsequent decades, Pastor's son [[Gildo Pastor|Gildo]] was able to build apartment blocks, after getting planning permission to develop in 1966 on this now very valuable land, retaining ownership, and avoiding long leases to maximise rental income.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

When his granddaughter, [[Hélène Pastor]] was shot dead in 2014, it was reported that the Pastors were Monaco's "second dynasty", behind the ruling [[Grimaldi family]], with an estimated holding of 15 percent of Monaco's housing stock, valued at approximately [[EUR|€]]20 billion.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Personal life==
Pastor was married and lived in Monaco. His son was [[Gildo Pastor]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

In [[Mainstream economics|mainstream economic theories]], the '''labour supply''' is the total hours (adjusted for intensity of effort) that workers wish to work at a given real wage rate. It is frequently represented graphically by a labour supply curve, which shows hypothetical wage rates plotted vertically and the amount of labour that an individual or group of individuals is willing to supply at that wage rate plotted horizontally.

== Neoclassical view ==
[[File:Labour supply.svg|thumb|300px|This [[backward bending supply curve of labour]] shows how the change in [[real wage]] rates affects the number of hours worked by employees.]]
{{See also|Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model - Supply|label 1=Neoclassical microeconomic model of labour supply}}
Labour supply curves derive from the 'labour-leisure' trade-off. More hours worked earn higher incomes, but necessitate a cut in the amount of leisure that workers enjoy. Consequently, there are two effects on the amount of labour desired to be supplied due to a change in the real wage rate. As, for example, the real wage rate rises, the [[opportunity cost]] of leisure increases. This tends to make workers supply more labour (the "substitution effect"). However, also as the real wage rate rises, workers earn a higher income for a given number of hours. If leisure is a [[normal good]]—the demand for it increases as income increases—this increase in income tends to make workers supply less labour so they can "spend" the higher income on leisure (the "income effect"). If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect then the labour supply slopes upward. If, beyond a certain wage rate, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, then the labour supply curve [[backward bending supply curve of labour|bends backward]]. Individual labor supply curves can be aggregated to derive the total labour supply of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg and Smith, "Modern Labor Economics", HarperCollins, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxist view ==
{{See also|Reserve army of labour|Proletarization}}
From a [[Marxist]] perspective, a labour supply is a core requirement in a [[capitalist society]]. To avoid [[labour shortage]] and ensure a labour supply, a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-provisioning, which would let them be independent—and they must instead, to survive, be compelled to sell their labour for a [[subsistence|subsistence wage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Dobb]] (1947) ''[[Studies in the Development of Capitalism]]''  New York: International Publishers Co. Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Harvey (social theorist)|David Harvey]] (1989) ''[[The Condition of Postmodernity]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-industrial economies wage labour was generally undertaken only by those with little or no land of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowden]] (1967) chapter ''Agricultural prices, farm profits, and rents'', section "A. The long-term movement of agricultural prices" - "The long-term trend of prices". Published in [[The agrarian history of England and Wales]], vol 4: 1500-1640, edited by [[Joan Thirsk]]. Also published in [https://books.google.com/books?id=CWlnHlJrgNYC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1 Chapters from the Agrarian History of England and Wales, 1500-1750], p.&amp;nbsp;18: "Wage-earning is not a pursuit that is normally engaged for its own sake, and in a peasant economy it is followed only by men with little or no land of their own."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lemonade Tycoon''''', first released as ''Lemonade Inc.'', is a [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]-based game. A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online.
The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell [[lemonade]] for profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Lemonade Tycoon Review | work =GameZone | date = 2003-02-11 | url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r21410.htm | format=asp | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213131723/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r21410.htm | archivedate=2005-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last update (1.1.9) was renamed ''Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe''.  In 2009 Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of ''Lemonade Tycoon''.  ''Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition'' is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.&lt;ref name="MacPlay"&gt;{{cite web | title=MacPlay: Lemonade Tycoon 2 | url=http://www.macplay.com/games/Lemonade_Tycoon_2 | format=asp | accessdate=2009-04-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430021752/http://www.macplay.com/games/Lemonade_Tycoon_2 | archivedate=2009-04-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as  long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.

''Lemonade Tycoon'' has similarities to ''[[Lemonade Stand]]'', a computer game originally created for the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] in 1973 and later ported by [[Apple Computer]] for use with its then-new [[Apple II]] platform in 1979. The game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock.

==Gameplay==

=== Game Modes ===
''Lemonade Tycoon'' includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.

==== Stocks/Supplies ====
In order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.

==== Sales and Advertisement ====
The player has the option to advertise in ''Lemonade Tycoon''. Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.

==== Upgrades ====
Lemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices.  Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc.  Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity.  There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.

==== Locations ====
There are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.

==== Game Factors ====
There are many News Headlines that affect the success of lemonade sales. Some headlines improve the player's business and some hurt it. Headlines change every game day and sometimes only affect a single location. Weather also affects sales - warm and hot days bring more customers than cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to follow predictable patterns.

=== Lemonade Stock Exchange (LSX) ===
The Lemonade Stock Exchange was an online feature that let one see how one's stand compared to others.

==Reception==

=== Awards ===
* Best Pocket PC Strategy Game (2002 Pocket PC Magazine's Best Products Awards) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pocketpcmag.com/awards/winners_2002.asp?cat=38|title= Annual Pocket PC Best Product Awards: Winners and Finalists|accessdate= 2008-04-27|work= pocketpcmag|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121065030/http://www.pocketpcmag.com/awards/winners_2002.asp?cat=38|archivedate= 2007-11-21|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied uses===
[[Learning Planet]], an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource management for its students. The LearningPlanet.com version of Lemonade Tycoon is visually different but functionally identical to the other iterations of the game.&lt;ref name="LearningPlanet"&gt;{{cite web | title =How About a Nice Cup of Lemonade? | work =LearningPlanet.com | publisher =Planet Interactive, Inc. | date =2007 | url =http://www.learningplanet.com/articles/lt/index.asp | format =asp | accessdate =2007-04-18 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070317235940/http://www.learningplanet.com/articles/lt/index.asp | archivedate =2007-03-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[Image:Katherine and Madeleine circa 1908.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Katherine (left) and Madeleine Force.]]

Madeleine Talmage Force  was born on June 19, 1893, in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the younger daughter of William Hurlbut Force (1852–1917) and the former Katherine Arvilla Talmage (1863–1930). Madeleine's elder sister [[Katherine Emmons Force]] was a real estate businesswoman and socialite. Through their father William, she and Katherine had French ancestry and were grandnieces of builder Ephraim S. Force (1822 – March 12, 1914).&lt;ref name=Ephraim&gt;{{cite web|title=E. S. FORCE DIES AT 92|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/03/12/101917768.pdf|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 12, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mother Katherine had Dutch ancestry.

William Hurlbut Force was a member of a well-established business family. He owned the successful shipping firm William H. Force and Co., and his father had been prosperous in the manufacturing industry. In 1889, Force had married Katherine Talmage, who was the granddaughter of former Brooklyn mayor Thomas Talmage. The Forces were part of Brooklyn high society, while William Force was a member of numerous prestigious clubs in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jervis, A. 1893 "The Eagle and Brooklyn: the record of the progress of the Brooklyn daily eagle", p. 1016. Online reference https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092229347#page/n379/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned a notable art collection.  Like the Astor family, the Forces were members of the Episcopal Church.

She was educated at Miss Ely's School and then for four years at [[Spence School|Miss Spence's School]], which was located at West 48th Street in Manhattan. According to one report she was "counted an especially brilliant pupil" at this school. She was also taken abroad with her sister Katherine by her mother and toured Europe several times. When she was introduced to New York social life she was immediately adopted by the "Junior League" which was a clique of debutantes.&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"&gt;''The Washington Times'', August 3, 1911, p. 8. Online reference http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1911-08-03/ed-1/seq-8/&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in several New York society plays and attracted quite a following. She was known to be a very competent horsewoman and enjoyed yachting. One report said that she was bright and good with drawing-room conversation.&lt;ref name="chroniclingamerica.loc.gov"/&gt;

==Courtship and marriage==

==Aboard the ''Titanic''==
[[File:Titanic-New York Herald front page 2.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Newspaper report of the sinking of the Titanic. Most reports featured the Astors in the headlines.]]

Madeleine Astor, then five months pregnant, boarded the ''Titanic'' as a first-class passenger in [[Cherbourg]], France, with her husband; her husband's valet, Victor Robbins; her maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Endres. They also took Kitty, Astor's pet [[Airedale Terrier|Airedale]], and occupied one of the parlor suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an [[iceberg]]. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her lifebelt. While they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their lifebelts. Colonel Astor found another lifebelt which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Madeleine what it was made of. When it was time to board a life boat, Madeleine Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] 4 (which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers). Astor had helped his wife to climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was 'in a delicate condition'. The request was denied by Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/john-jacob-astor.html|title= Colonel John Jacob Astor|work= encyclopedia titanica|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of Madeleine's boarding of the lifeboat was given by [[Archibald Gracie IV]] to the [[American Titanic inquiry|US Senate Titanic inquiry]]. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Madeleine Astor  in the following terms.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only incident I remember in particular at this point is when Mrs Astor was put in the boat. She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, 'No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.' Mr Astor then said, 'Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,' or words to that effect. The answer came back, 'No. 4.".&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate Inquiry into the Titanic. Online reference http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq11Gracie01.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Astor and his valet died in the sinking; the former's body was recovered on April 22. He was found to be carrying approximately two thousand five hundred dollars in cash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-biography/john-jacob-astor.html|work= encyclopedia titanica}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought with him from his cabin. His young widow and the other survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']].

Madeleine Astor gave an account of what she recalled almost immediately after her arrival home through her spokesman Nicholas Biddle who was a trustee of the Astor Estate. The account given by her spokesman is as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On landing from the Carpathia the young bride widowed by the Titanic's sinking told members of her family what she could recall of the circumstances of the disaster. Of how Colonel Astor had met his death she had no definite conception.''
She recalled she thought that in the confusion as she was about to be put into one of the boats Colonel Astor was standing by her side. After that she had no very clear recollection of the happenings until the boats were well clear of the sinking steamer.''
Mrs Astor, it appears, left in one of the last boats which got away from the ship. It was her belief that all the women who wished to go had then been taken off. Her impression was that the boat she left in had room for at least 15 more persons. The men, for some reason (that) she could not and does not now understand, did not seem to be at all anxious to leave the ship. Almost everyone seemed dazed."&lt;ref&gt;The San Francisco Call., April 19, 1912, p. 1. Online reference http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1912-04-19/ed-1/seq-1/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Widowhood==
[[Image:Madeleine Astor at Belmont Park 1915.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Madeleine Astor 1915.]]

After Astor returned home from her ordeal, she was kept in strict retirement. Her first social function was not until the end of May when she held a luncheon at her mansion on Fifth Avenue for [[Arthur Rostron]], the Captain of the ''Carpathia'', and Dr. Frank McGee, the ship’s surgeon. She held this event with [[Marian Thayer]], who was also a survivor of the ''Titanic''. Both women wished to thank these men for their assistance when they were on board the ''Carpathia''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening World'' (New York)., May 31, 1912, p. 1. Online reference http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1912-05-31/ed-1/seq-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his will, John Jacob Astor IV left his wife an outright sum of $100,000. In addition, he bequeathed to her the income from a trust fund of $5 million and the use during her life of the house on Fifth Avenue. Both of these latter provisions, she would lose if she remarried. A fund of $3 million was set aside for his unborn child [[John Jacob Astor VI|John Jacob "Jakey" Astor VI]] which he would control when he became of age.&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening News'' (Providence R I), May 7, 1912, p. 1. Online reference https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QupgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u2MNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2415,1723472&amp;dq=madeleine+force+astor&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 1912, Astor gave birth to Jakey at her Fifth Avenue mansion. For the next four years, she raised him as part of the Astor family. She did not seem to appear very often in society until the end of 1913, when according to the press they were able to publish her first photograph since the ''Titanic'' disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''The Logan Republican'', November 29, 1913, p. 1. Online reference http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85058246/1913-11-29/ed-1/seq-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, she appeared more often in public and her activities were frequently reported in the press. In 1915, she remodelled her house on Fifth Avenue and this was made a feature article in the ''New York Sun''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York), April 25, 1915, p. Supplement 9. Online reference http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1915-04-25/ed-1/seq-41/&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many articles about her eldest son.

==Remarriages==

Four years after Colonel Astor's death, Madeleine Astor married her childhood friend banker William Karl Dick (May 28, 1888 – September 5, 1953) on June 22, 1916, in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]]. He was a vice president of the [[Manufacturers Trust Company]] of New York and a part owner and director of the ''Brooklyn Times''. As stated in Colonel Astor's will, she lost her stipend from his trust fund. They had two sons:
* William Force Dick (April 11, 1917 – December 4, 1961)
* [[John Henry Dick]] II, ornithologist, photographer, naturalist, conservationist, author, painter, and bird illustrator&lt;ref name=DickSons&gt;{{cite web|title=William K. Dick|url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Dick,WilliamK.html|publisher=Accuracy Project|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They divorced on July 21, 1933, in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Four months later, on November 27, 1933, Astor married Italian actor/boxer [[Enzo Fiermonte]] in a civil ceremony in New York City. They honeymooned in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. They eventually moved there. They had no children together and divorced on June 11, 1938, in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].

==Death==
Madeleine Fiermonte died of a heart ailment at her mansion in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], on March 27, 1940, at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Mrs. Fiermonte Dead In Florida |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/3259/ |quote=The household of Mrs. Madeleine Force Astor Fiermonte stated early today that she was dead. Mrs. Madeleine Force Astor Dick Fiermonte was married three times, and divorced twice. Her first marriage to Colonel John Jacob Astor, head of the Astor family in this country, was of short duration, ending when he lost his life in the Titanic disaster. Her second union, that with William K. Dick, member of a family whose fortune was made in the sugar refining business, terminated when she divorced him in Reno.....|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 28, 1940 |accessdate=October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] in [[New York City]], in a [[mausoleum]] with her mother.

'''Rose Marie''' "'''Rosemary'''" '''Kennedy''' (September 13, 1918 – January 7, 2005) was the oldest daughter born to [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy]], and was a sister of [[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]].

Rosemary experienced mental disabilities, and displayed less academic and sporting potential than her siblings; she was slower than all of her siblings when it came to achieving many tasks. However, her disabilities were carefully concealed from the public by her prominent family. In her early young adult years, she also had behavioral problems. Her father arranged one of the first prefrontal [[lobotomies]] for her at the age of 23, but it failed and left her permanently incapacitated. Rosemary spent the rest of her life in an institution in [[Jefferson, Wisconsin]], with limited contact with her family or the outside world. Her condition may have inspired her sister, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], to initiate the [[Special Olympics]] in 1962.

==Family and early life==
[[File:TheKennedyFamily1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Kennedy family at [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], in 1931 with Rosemary on the far right.]]
Rose Marie Kennedy was born at [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site|her parents' home]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. She was the third child and first daughter of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]]. She was named after her mother,&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly called "Rosemary" or "Rosie." During her birth, the doctor was not immediately available and the nurse ordered Rose Kennedy to keep her legs closed, forcing the baby's head to stay in the birth canal for two hours. The action resulted in a harmful [[hypoxia (medical)|loss of oxygen]].&lt;ref name=nyt.gordon&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Meryl|title='Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter,' by Kate Clifford Larson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/books/review/rosemary-the-hidden-kennedy-daughter-by-kate-clifford-larson.html|accessdate=13 October 2015|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rosemary began to grow, her parents noticed she was not reaching the basic development steps an infant or a toddler normally reach at a certain month or year. At two years old, she had a hard time sitting up, crawling, learning to walk and later on feeding herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Washington College - Campus Events|title=Rosemary, The Hidden Kennedy Daughter|date=2016-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1lYAPquScU|accessdate=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Massachusetts state law, the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Binet intelligence test]] was given to her before first grade, as she twice failed to advance from kindergarten.

Rose Kennedy sent Rosemary to the Sacred Heart Convent in [[Elmhurst, Providence, Rhode Island]], at age 15, where she was educated separately from the other students. Two nuns and a special teacher, Miss Newton, worked with her all day in a separate classroom. The Kennedys gave the school a new tennis court for their efforts. Her reading, writing, spelling, and counting skills were reported to be at a fourth-grade level, and she was slower to progress than her siblings. She studied but may have felt she disappointed her parents, whom she wanted to please. During this period, her mother arranged for her older brother [[John F. Kennedy|John]] to accompany her to a tea-dance. Thanks to him, she appeared "not different at all" during the tea-dance.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, pp. 203-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henry H. Goddard]], Rosemary suffered [[intellectual disabilities]]. She was deemed to have an IQ between 60 and 70. A biographer wrote that Rose Kennedy did not confide in her friends and that she pretended her daughter was developing typically, with relatives other than the immediate family knowing nothing of Rosemary's reported low IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Rosemary-Kennedy.aspx|title=Rosemary Kennedy|work=jfklibrary.org|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger sister Eunice surmised from various doctors' visits to their home that Rosemary was both "mentally ill" and [[epilepsy|epileptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, pp. 138, 163&amp;ndash;66, 227, 825&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaries written by her in the late 1930s, and published in the 1980s, reveal a young woman whose life was filled with outings to the opera, tea dances, dress fittings, and other social interests:
* "Went to luncheon in the ballroom in the White House. [[James Roosevelt]] took us in to see his father, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. He said, 'It's about time you came. How can I put my arm around all of you? Which is the oldest? You are all so big.'"
* "Have a fitting at 10:15 [[Elizabeth Arden]]. Appointment dress fitting again. Home for lunch. Royal tournament in the afternoon."

She read few books but could read ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Rosemary managed to obtain a diploma from a Massachusetts two-year community college.

===Appearance at British court===
Kennedy was presented to King [[George VI]] and Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] during her father's service as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Her father presented his daughters instead of, more customarily, choosing about thirty young American [[debutante]]s, a decision which earned him favor in the press. Kennedy's "slowness" was also unconventional and daring for a debut ([[John Bowes-Lyon#Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon|two of the queen's nieces]] remained in a mental hospital because they were mentally ill). Young women would practice the rather complicated royal [[curtsey]], sometimes learning the performance at the Vacani School of Dancing near [[Harrods]]. She practiced for hours. She wore a gown made of white [[Tulle netting|tulle]] with a net train and carried a bouquet of [[Lily of the valley|lilies of the valley]]. Her sister [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]] was described as "stunning, but she was only a shadow of Rosemary's beauty." Just as Rosemary was about to "glide off" by stepping to the right, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, the King and the Queen smiled as if nothing had happened, and it is unknown whether Rosemary was aware of her own stumble.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, pp. 251-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One Kennedy family biographer termed her "absolutely beautiful" with "a gorgeous smile." At twenty, she was "a picturesque young woman, a snow princess with flush cheeks, gleaming smile, plump figure, and a sweetly ingratiating manner to almost everyone she met." She enjoyed dancing, such as at her sister Kathleen's coming-out party.&lt;ref name=Leamer270&gt;Leamer, pp. 254, 270, 680.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's parents told ''[[Woman's Day]]'' that she was "studying to be a kindergarten teacher," and ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' was told that while she had "an interest in social welfare work, she is said to harbor a secret longing to go on the stage." ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote requesting an interview which was refused, but her father's assistant Eddie Moore prepared a response, which Rosemary copied out laboriously, letter by letter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always had serious tastes and understand life is not given us just for enjoyment. For some time past, I have been studying the well known psychological method of Dr. [[Maria Montessori]] and I got my degree in teaching last year.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lobotomy==
Placid and easygoing as a child and teenager, the maturing Rosemary Kennedy became increasingly assertive and rebellious. She was also reportedly subject to violent mood changes. Some observers have since attributed this behavior to her inability to conform to siblings who were expected to perform to high standards, as well as the hormonal surges associated with [[puberty]]. In any case, the family had difficulty dealing with her stormy moods and reckless behavior. Rosemary had begun to sneak out at night from the convent school in [[Washington, D.C.]], where she was cared for and educated.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, Laurence, ''The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family'', referenced in Associated Press article, ''Retarded Kennedy Sister Dies at 86'', (Saturday, January 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her occasional erratic behavior frustrated her parents, who expected all of their children to behave appropriately, be goal-oriented, and act competitively. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was especially worried that his daughter's behavior would shame and embarrass the family and possibly damage his political career, and those of his children.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|title=The Exiled Kennedy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-exiled-kennedy-486688.html|publisher=independent.co.uk|date=January 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1941, when Rosemary Kennedy was 23, doctors told Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. that a neurosurgical procedure, [[lobotomy]], would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq7lwuQVQ4sC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=rosemary+kennedy+violent+outbursts#v=onepage&amp;q=rosemary%20kennedy%20violent%20outbursts&amp;f=false |title=Copious hosting: A theology of access for people with disabilities |author=Jennie Weiss Block |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2002 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/rosemary-kennedy-timothy-shriver-fully-alive|title=Rosemary Kennedy: The Truth About Her Lobotomy : People.com|work=PEOPLE.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He decided that his daughter should have the lobotomy performed; however, he did not inform his wife Rose of this until after the procedure was completed.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Rosemary was strapped to the operating table.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvia Jukes Morris|Morris, Sylvia Jukes]], [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-saddest-story-ever-told-1443819842 "The Saddest Story Ever Told"], ''Wall Street Journal'', October 2, 2015. Retrieved 2015-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Watts]], who carried out the procedure with [[Walter Freeman (surgeon)|Walter Freeman]] of Wingdale Psychological and Correctional Facility, described what happened next (as narrated by [[Ronald Kessler]]):

{{quote|We went through the top of the head, I think she was awake. She had a mild tranquilizer. I made a surgical incision in the brain through the skull. It was near the front. It was on both sides. We just made a small incision, no more than an inch." The instrument Dr. Watts used looked like a butter knife. He swung it up and down to cut brain tissue. "We put an instrument inside", he said. As Dr. Watts cut, Dr. Freeman asked Rosemary some questions. For example, he asked her to recite the [[Lord's Prayer]] or sing "[[God Bless America]]" or count backwards..... "We made an estimate on how far to cut based on how she responded." ..... When she began to become incoherent, they stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, ''The Sins of the Father'', p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the lobotomy, it quickly became apparent that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. She could not walk or speak intelligibly and was [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henley|first=John|title=The Forgotten Kennedy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/13/eunice-kennedy-shriver-rosemary-kennedy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the procedure, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized. She initially lived for several years at Craig House, a private psychiatric hospital an hour north of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, she was relocated to [[Jefferson, Wisconsin]], where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as "St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth").&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 412, and caption to photo of the house facing p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Richard Cushing]] had told her father about St. Coletta's, an institution for more than three hundred people with [[disability|disabilities]], and her father traveled to and built a private house for her about a mile outside St. Coletta's main campus near Alverno House, which was designed for adults who needed lifelong care.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; The nuns called the house "the Kennedy cottage".&lt;ref name=Leamer680&gt;Leamer, pp.  412, 680.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Catholic nuns, Sister Margaret Ann and Sister Leona, provided her care along with a student and a woman who worked on [[ceramic]]s with Rosemary three nights a week. Alan Borsari supervised the team and was able to call in specialists.&lt;ref name=Leamer760/&gt; Rosemary had a car that could be used to take her for rides and a dog whom she could take on walks.&lt;ref name=Leamer680 /&gt;

In response to her condition, Rosemary's parents separated her from her family. Rose Kennedy did not visit her for twenty years.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. did not visit his daughter at the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Collier |authorlink=Peter Collier (political author) |first2=David |last2=Horowitz |author2link=David Horowitz |year=1984 |title=The Kennedys |publisher=Summit Books |isbn=0-671-44793-9 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her older brother John was campaigning for re-election for the Senate in 1958, the Kennedy family explained away her absence by claiming she was reclusive.  The Kennedy family did not publicly explain her absence until 1961, after John had been elected [[President of the United States|President]]. The Kennedys did not reveal that she was institutionalized because of a failed lobotomy but instead said that she was deemed "mentally retarded".&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her father in 1969, Rosemary was occasionally taken to visit relatives in [[Florida]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], and to her childhood home on [[Cape Cod]]. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was [[Erb's palsy|palsied]].&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] to later found the [[Special Olympics]],&lt;ref name=independent/&gt; although Shriver told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1995 that that was not the entire case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Johnson, Kirk|title=Reaching the Retarded: An Old Kennedy Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/nyregion/reaching-the-retarded-an-old-kennedy-mission.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the Kennedy family gave $1 million to renovate Alverno House. The gift added a therapeutic pool and enlarged the chapel.&lt;ref name=Leamer760&gt;Leamer, p. 760.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rosemary Kennedy died from natural causes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1480698/Sister-of-President-John-F-Kennedy-dies.html|title=Sister of President John F Kennedy dies|date=8 January 2005|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 7, 2005, at the Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital in [[Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58134-2005Jan8.html|title=Rosemary Kennedy, 86; President's Disabled Sister (washingtonpost.com)|last=Weil|first=Martin|date=8 January 2005|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=B06|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 86, with her surviving siblings, sisters [[Jean Kennedy Smith|Jean]], Eunice, and Patricia, and brother [[Ted Kennedy|Ted]], by her side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rosemary-kennedy-6155200.html|title=Obituaries: Rosemary Kennedy|last=Cornwell|first=Rupert|date=10 January 2005|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried beside her parents in [[Holyhood Cemetery]] in Brookline, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2011/09/22/friends_family_bid_farewell_to_kara_kennedy_in_washington_brookline/ Boston.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy to die from natural causes.

'''Shlomo Dovrat''' is an Israeli high-tech entrepreneur. He spearheaded the recovery of [[ECI Telecom]] and in January 2005, sold [[Tecnomatix]] to the American software company [[UGS Corp]]. for about $227.7 million, making about $10 million from the deal.&lt;ref name="themarker"&gt;[http://www.themarker.com/eng/archive/arc_article.jhtml?ElementId=ag20050223_01e The 10-Year Test: Shlomo Dovrat]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Ami Ginsburg. 23.2.2005&lt;/ref&gt; He is also co founder of [[Carmel Ventures]].&lt;ref name="democracy"&gt;[http://www.idi.org.il/sites/english/AboutIDI/BoardOfDirectors/Pages/ShlomoDovrat.aspx Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for heading the Israeli national commission for reform in Education, known as the [[Dovrat Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation, Ideology and Education Policy Reforms. by Joseph Zajda. Springer, 2010. {{ISBN|978-90-481-3523-3}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Like many Israeli high tech entrepreneurs, Dovrat served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]'s [[Unit 8200]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/israel-military-unit-ventures-biz-cx_gk_0208israel.html The Unit - Forbes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first publicly traded company that Dovrat managed was Oshap, who went public on [[Wall Street]] in the mid-1980s. Dovrat managed Oshap business in Belgium, then at the age of 26 he became its CEO. In early 1999, [[SunGard]] bought Oshap for $220 million in a stock swap deal. Dovrat netted about $40 million from the sale.&lt;ref name="themarker"/&gt;

Shlomo Dovrat founded Tecnomatix and served as its CEO and President from 1983 to 1995. He served as Chairman until December 2001 and as a Director until the company was eventually sold to UGS in 2005.&lt;ref name="democracy"/&gt;

In 2000, Dovrat co-founded [[Carmel Ventures]]. &lt;ref name="democracy"/&gt;

Dovrat has also served as Chairman of [[ECI Telecom]] from 2002 until the sale of the company in 2007 for $1.25 billion.&lt;ref name="democracy"/&gt;

==Dovrat Commission==
The government-appointed [[Dovrat Commission]], led by Dovrat, concluded in 2004, that the key to improving Israeli education is not more money but better-quality teaching. The recommendations included a reform giving school principals the right to fire bad teachers and reward good ones with higher pay. These moves have been blocked by Israel's teachers' unions, which have paralyzed schools with a series of long strikes, mostly blocking the proposed reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/10909908?story_id=10909908 Miracles and mirages], The Economist.

In October 1993, Kyriakides founded the piano firm SVK PIANOTECH LTD; a private limited company of which he held 90% of the shares with his father, Vladimiros Kyriakides, being in possession of the remaining 10% until 2011 when Stavros V. Kyriakides became the sole shareholder of the company.

Since 2006, the company operates under its new trademark: Kyriakides Piano Gallery.

== Cultural involvement ==

Kyriakides has always been active in the cultural life of the island. He served as member of the Board of Directors to numerous non-profitable foundations. He is the Founder and President of '''Avantgarde Cultural Foundation''' (2001) whose Honorary President is the First Lady of the Republic of Cyprus and Patron the renowned Steinway Artist, [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]].

'''William Averell Harriman''' (November 15, 1891{{spaced ndash}}July 26, 1986), better known as '''Averell Harriman''', was an American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician, businessman, and diplomat. The son of railroad baron [[E.&amp;nbsp;H. Harriman]], he served as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] and later as the [[List of Governors of New York|48th Governor of New York]]. He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952 and 1956, as well as a core member of the group of foreign policy elders known as "[[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]".

While attending [[Groton School]] and [[Yale University]], he made contacts that led to creation of a banking firm that eventually merged into [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.]]. He owned parts of various other companies, including [[Union Pacific Railroad]], Merchant Shipping Corporation, and [[Polaroid Corporation]]. During the presidency of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Harriman served in the [[National Recovery Administration]] and on the [[The Business Council|Business Advisory Council]] before moving into foreign policy roles. After helping to coordinate the [[Lend-Lease]] program, Harriman served as the ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] and attended the major [[List of Allied World War II conferences|World War II conferences]]. After the war, he became a prominent advocate of [[George F. Kennan]]'s policy of [[containment]]. He also served as Secretary of Commerce, and coordinated the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]].

In 1954, Harriman defeated Republican Senator [[Irving Ives]] to become the Governor of New York. He served a single term before his defeat by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 election. Harriman unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]] and the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. Though Harriman had Truman's backing at the 1956 convention, the Democrats nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II]] in both elections. 

After his gubernatorial defeat, Harriman became a widely respected foreign policy elder within the Democratic Party. He helped negotiate the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] during President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration and was deeply involved in the [[Vietnam War]] during the Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administrations. After Johnson left office in 1969, Harriman affiliated with various organizations, including the [[Club of Rome]] and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].

==Early life and education==
Better known as Averell Harriman, he was born in [[New York City]], the son of railroad baron [[E. H. Harriman|Edward Henry Harriman]] and [[Mary Williamson Averell]]. He was the brother of [[E.&amp;nbsp;Roland Harriman]] and [[Mary Harriman Rumsey]]. Harriman was a close friend of [[Hall Roosevelt]], the brother of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].

During the summer of 1899, Harriman's father organized the [[Harriman Alaska Expedition]], a philanthropic-scientific survey of coastal [[Alaska]] and Russia that attracted 25 of the leading scientific, naturalist, and artist luminaries of the day, including [[John Muir]], [[John Burroughs]], [[George Bird Grinnell]], [[C.&amp;nbsp;Hart Merriam]], [[Grove Karl Gilbert]], and [[Edward Curtis]], along with 100 family members and staff, aboard the steamship ''George Elder''. Young Harriman would have his first introduction to Russia, a nation on which he would spend a significant amount of attention in his later life in public service.

He attended [[Groton School]] in Massachusetts before going on to [[Yale University|Yale]] where he joined the [[Skull and Bones]] society.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Alexandra (2002). ''Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power''. Boston: Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-316-72091-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127,150–1}} He graduated in 1913. After graduating, he inherited one of the largest fortunes in America and became Yale's youngest Crew coach.

==Career==
===Business affairs===
Using money from his father he established W.A. Harriman &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co banking business in 1922. In 1927 his brother Roland joined the business and the name was changed to [[Harriman Brothers &amp; Company]]. In 1931, it merged with [[Brown Bros. &amp; Co.]] to create the highly successful Wall Street firm [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.]] Notable employees included [[George Herbert Walker]] and his son-in-law [[Prescott Bush]].

Harriman's main properties included Brown Brothers &amp;&amp;nbsp;Harriman &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co, [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation]], and venture capital investments that included the [[Polaroid Corporation]]. Harriman's associated properties included the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (including the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]), [[Illinois Central Railroad]], [[Wells Fargo &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co.]], the [[Pacific Mail Steamship&amp;nbsp;Co.]], American Ship &amp; Commerce, Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Aktiengesellschaft ([[Hamburg America Line|HAPAG]]), the [[American Hawaiian Steamship&amp;nbsp;Co.]], [[United American Lines]], the [[J.P. Morgan &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co.|Guaranty Trust Company]], and the [[Union Banking Corporation]].

He served as Chairman of [[The Business Council]], then known as the Business Advisory Council for the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in 1937 and 1939.&lt;ref name="business"&gt;[http://www.thebusinesscouncil.org/about/background.aspx The Business Council, Official website, Background] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213615/http://www.thebusinesscouncil.org/about/background.aspx |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Harriman's older sister, [[Mary Harriman Rumsey|Mary Rumsey]], encouraged Averell to leave his finance job and work with her and their friends, the [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelts]], to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA [[National Recovery Administration]],  the first government consumer rights group, marking the beginning of his political career.

===Thoroughbred racing===
Following the death of [[August Belmont,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], in 1924, Harriman, George Walker, and [[Joseph E. Widener]] purchased much of Belmont's thoroughbred breeding stock. Harriman raced under the [[Glossary of North American horse racing #Nom de course|nom de course]] of [[Arden (estate)|Arden Farm]]. Among his horses, [[Chance Play]] won the 1927 [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]]. He also raced in partnership with Walker under the name [[Log Cabin Stable]] before buying him out. [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Louis Feustel]], trainer of [[Man o' War]], trained the Log Cabin horses until 1926.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1926/07/15/archives/feustel-resigns-as-trainer-for-the-log-cabin-stable.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the partnership's successful runners purchased from the August Belmont estate, [[Ladkin]] is best remembered for defeating the European star [[Epinard]] in the [[International Special]].

===War seizures controversy===
Harriman's banking business was the main [[Wall Street]] connection for [[Germany|German]] companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of [[Fritz Thyssen]]; who was a financial backer of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party until 1938. The [[Trading with the Enemy Act 1917|Trading With the Enemy Act]] (enacted on October 6, 1917)&lt;ref&gt;[[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]]&lt;/ref&gt; classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman's operations in New York City.

The Harriman business interests seized under the act in October and November 1942 included:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
* [[Union Banking Corporation]] (UBC) (from Thyssen and [[Brown Brothers Harriman]])
* Holland-American Trading Corporation (from Harriman)
* Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation (from Harriman)
* [[Silesian-American Corporation]] (this company was partially owned by a German entity; during the war the Germans tried to take full control of Silesian-American. In response to that, the American government seized German-owned minority shares in the company, leaving the U.S. partners to carry on the portion of the business in the United States.)

The assets were held by the government for the duration of the war, then returned afterward; UBC was dissolved in 1951.

Compensation for wartime losses in Poland were based on prewar assets. Harriman, who owned vast coal reserves in Poland, was handsomely compensated for them through an agreement between the American and Polish governments. Poles who had owned little but their homes received negligible sums.

===World War II diplomacy===
[[File:WilliamAverallHarrimanWithWinstonChurchill.jpg|thumb|W. Averell Harriman (center) with [[Winston Churchill]] (right) and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] (left)]]
{{Main|Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|United Kingdom-United States relations in World War II}}
Beginning in the spring of 1941, Harriman served President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as a special envoy to Europe and helped coordinate the [[Lend-Lease]] program. He was present at the meeting between FDR and [[Winston Churchill]] at [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Placentia Bay]], in August 1941, which yielded the [[Atlantic Charter]]. It was a common declaration of principles of the United States and the UK; It was eventually endorsed by all of the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore A. Wilson, ''The First Summit: Roosevelt and Churchill at Placentia Bay, 1941'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Harriman was subsequently dispatched to Moscow to negotiate the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement with the Soviet Union. His promise of $1&amp;nbsp;billion in aid technically exceeded his brief. Determined to win over the doubtful American public, he used his own funds to purchase time on CBS radio to explain the program in terms of enlightened self-interest. This skepticism lifted with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cathal J. Nolan, ''Notable U.S. ambassadors since 1775: a biographical dictionary,'' 137-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1941 (twelve days before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]), he noted that "The [[United States Navy]] is shooting the Germans—German submarines and aircraft at sea".&lt;ref&gt;[[John T. Flynn|Flynn, John]]. [http://www.antiwar.com/rep/flynn1.html The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor] (October 1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1942, Harriman accompanied Churchill to the [[Moscow Conference (1942)|Moscow Conference]] to explain to Stalin why the western allies were carrying out operations in North Africa instead of opening the promised second front in France.  Harriman was appointed as [[United States Ambassador to Russia|United States Ambassador]] to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the [[Tehran Conference]] in late 1943 Harriman was tasked with placating a suspicious Churchill while Roosevelt attempted to gain the confidence of Stalin. The conference highlighted the divisions between the United States and Britain about the postwar world. Churchill was intent on maintaining Britain's empire and carving the postwar world into [[spheres of influence]] while the United States upheld the principles of self-determination as laid out in the Atlantic Charter. Harriman mistrusted the Soviet leader's motives and intentions and opposed the spheres approach as it would give Stalin a free hand in eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Harriman also attended the [[Yalta Conference]], where he encouraged taking a stronger line with the Soviet Union—especially on questions of Poland. After Roosevelt's death, he attended [[Potsdam Conference|the final "Big Three" conference at Potsdam]]. Although the new president, Harry Truman, was receptive to Harriman's anti-Soviet hard line advice, the new secretary of state, [[James F. Byrnes|James Byrnes]], managed to sideline him. While in Berlin, he noted the tight security imposed by Soviet military authorities and the beginnings of a program of reparations by which the Soviets were stripping out German industry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1945, while Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman was presented with a [[Trojan Horse]] gift. In 1952, the gift, a carved wood [[Great Seal of the United States]], which had adorned "the ambassador's Moscow residential office" in [[Spaso House]], was found to be [[Covert listening device#Examples of use|bugged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/museum/virtual_tour/museum_tour_text.shtml#great_seal|title=National Cryptologic Museum - NSA/CSS|work=nsa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r101:FLD001:E53490,E53490|title=Congressional Record - 101st Congress (1989-1990) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}} (INTRODUCTION TO 'EMBASSY MOSCOW: ATTITUDES AND ERRORS'{{spaced ndash}}(BY HENRY J.

Harriman served as ambassador to the Soviet Union until January 1946. When he returned to the United States, he worked hard to get [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]'s [[X Article|Long Telegram]] into wide distribution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Kennan's analysis, which generally lined up with Harriman's, became the cornerstone of Truman's Cold War strategy of containment.

From April to October 1946, he was ambassador to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], but he was soon appointed to become [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] under President [[Harry S. Truman]] to replace [[Henry A. Wallace]], a critic of Truman's foreign policies. In 1948, he was put in charge of the [[Marshall Plan]].  In Paris, he became friendly with the [[CIA]] agent [[Irving Brown]], who organised anti-communist unions and organisations.&lt;ref name=Kelber&gt;Harry Kelber, [http://www.laboreducator.org/darkpast3.htm "AFL-CIO's Dark Past"], 22 November 2004, on laboreducator.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charpier&gt;[[Frédéric Charpier]], ''La CIA en France. 60 ans d'ingérence dans les affaires françaises'', Seuil, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;40–43.

In the [[New York state election, 1954|1954 race]] to succeed Republican [[Thomas E. Dewey]] as [[Governor of New York]], Harriman defeated Dewey's protege, [[U.S. Senator from New York|U.S. Senator]] [[Irving M. Ives]], by a tiny margin. He served as governor for one term until [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]] unseated him in [[New York state election, 1958|1958]]. As governor, he increased personal taxes by 11% but his tenure was dominated by his presidential ambitions.  Harriman was a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1952|Democratic Presidential Nomination in 1952]], and again [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1956|in 1956]] when he was endorsed by Truman but lost (both times) to [[Illinois]] governor [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]].

Despite the failure of his presidential ambitions, Harriman became a widely respected elder statesman of the party. In January 1961, he was appointed Ambassador at Large in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration, a position he held until November, when he became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. In 1961, at the suggestion of Ambassador [[Charles W. Yost]] Harriman represented President Kennedy at the funeral of King [[Mohammed V of Morocco]]. During this period he advocated U.S. support of a neutral government in [[Laos]] and helped to negotiate the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. In December 1961, [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] defected from the Soviet Union and accused Harriman of being a Soviet spy, but his claims were dismissed by the CIA and Harriman remained in his position until April 1963, when he became [[Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs]]. He retained that position during the transition to the Johnson administration until March 1965 when he again became Ambassador at Large. He held that position for the remainder of Johnson's presidency. Harriman headed the U.S. delegation to the preliminary peace talks in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam (1968–69).

=== Vietnamese coup d'état ===
President-elect Kennedy appointed Harriman as ambassador-at-large, to operate "with the full confidence of the president and an intimate knowledge of all aspects of United States policy." But by 1963, Kennedy had come to suspect the loyalty of certain members on his national security team. According to Colonel William Corson, USMC, by 1963 Harriman was running "Vietnam without consulting the president or the attorney general.".&lt;ref name="CIA 2001, pp. 334"&gt;"The Secret History of the CIA." Joseph Trento. 2001, Prima Publishing. pp.&amp;nbsp;334–335.&lt;/ref&gt; Corson said Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's appointments secretary, was convinced that the National Security Advisor, [[McGeorge Bundy]], followed the orders of Harriman rather than the president. Corson also claimed that O'Donnell was particularly concerned about [[Michael Forrestal]], a young White House staffer who handled liaison on Vietnam with Harriman.&lt;ref name="CIA 2001, pp. 334"/&gt;

Harriman certainly supported the coup against the South Vietnam president [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] in 1963. However, it is alleged that the orders that ended in the deaths of Diem and his brother actually originated with Harriman and were carried out by [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]'s military assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousetapes.org/clips/1963_1104_jfk_vietnam_memoir.html|title=Presidential Recordings Program|work=whitehousetapes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousetapes.org/clips/1966_0201_lbj_mccarthy_vietnam.html|title=Presidential Recordings Program|work=whitehousetapes.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental question about the murders was the sudden and unusual recall of Saigon Station Chief John "Jocko" Richardson by an unknown authority.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Special Operations Army officer, [[John Michael Dunn]], was sent to Vietnam in his stead. He followed the orders of Harriman and Forrestal rather than the CIA.&lt;ref name="CIA 2001, pp. 334"/&gt;  According to Corson, Dunn's role in the incident has never been made public but he was assigned to Ambassador Lodge for "special operations" with the authority to act without hindrance; and he was known to have access to the coup plotters. Corson speculated that with Richardson recalled the way was clear for Dunn to freely act.&lt;ref name="CIA 2001, pp. 334"/&gt;

=== Later years ===
Harriman received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], with Distinction, in 1969 and West Point's [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] in 1975. Furthermore, in 1983 he received the [[Four Freedoms Award#Freedom Medal|Freedom Medal]].

In 1973 he was interviewed in the now famous TV documentary series, ''[[The World at War]]'', where he gives a recollection of his experiences as Roosevelt's Personal Representative in Britain along with his views on Cold War politics; in particular Poland and the [[Warsaw Pact]]; along with the exchanges he witnessed between [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin Roosevelt]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]. In one such recollection he describes Stalin as ''utterly cruel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Pincers (August 1944 – March 1945) |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series= [[The World at War]] |serieslink= |first= |last= |network= [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |station= |city= |airdate= 20 March 1974 |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= 19 |minutes= 21 |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= Stalin was very suspicious of the underground, but it was utterly cruel that he wouldn't even try to get supplies in.

Averell Harriman U.S. Ambassador to Russia 1943-46 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harriman was appointed senior member of the US Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session on Disarmament in 1978.  He was also a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy Charter, [[Club of Rome]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Knights of Pythias]], [[Skull and Bones]] Society, [[Psi Upsilon]] Fraternity, and the [[Jupiter Island, Florida|Jupiter Island]] Club.

==Personal life==
His first marriage, two years after graduating from Yale, was to Kitty Lanier Lawrence.&lt;ref name="LawrenceWedding"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=MISS LAWRANCE TO WED W. A.

About a year after his divorce from Lawrence, he married [[Marie Norton Harriman|Marie Norton Whitney]] (1903–1970), who had left her husband, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney]], to marry him.

Harriman and Pamela Churchill had had an affair during the War in 1941 which led to the breakdown of her marriage to Randolph Churchill.  In 1993, she became the 58th [[United States Ambassador to France]].&lt;ref name="PamelaNYTObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Marilyn|title=Pamela Harriman Is Dead at 76; An Ardent Political Personality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/06/world/pamela-harriman-is-dead-at-76-an-ardent-political-personality.html|accessdate=15 December 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Harriman Hall at [[Stony Brook University]] was named in his honor.
*The [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]] in Albany, NY also carries his name.
*[[Harriman State Park (Idaho)]]
For the state park in New York named after his parents, see [[Harriman State Park (New York)]].
Harriman State Park is a state park in eastern Idaho, United States. It is located on an 11,000-acre (45 km2) wildlife refuge in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] and is home to an abundance of [[elk]], [[moose]], [[sandhill cranes]], [[trumpeter swans]], and the occasional [[American black bear|black]] or [[grizzly bear]]. Two-thirds of the trumpeter swans that winter in the contiguous United States spend the season in Harriman State Park. The land was deeded to Idaho for free in 1977 by Roland and W. Averell Harriman, whose insistence that the state have a professional park managing service helped prompt the creation of the [[Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation]] in 1965. The park opened to the public in 1982. It is located in [[Fremont County, Idaho|Fremont County]], 3 miles (4.8 km) south of [[Island Park, Idaho]]. Henry's Fork, a fly-fishing stream, winds through the meadows of Harriman State Park. In winter, many of its roads and trails are groomed for [[cross country skiing]].
