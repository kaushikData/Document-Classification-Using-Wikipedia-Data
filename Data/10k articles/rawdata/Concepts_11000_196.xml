'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the course of [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] [[Croatia]] harmonised its media legislation to European standards. This process touched also legislation on access to public information which has been amended to reflect European and international standards.&lt;ref name=KAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kas.de/wf/en/71.13596/ |title=Media Freedom in Croatia (2006-2016) |last= |first= |date=2016 |website= Kas.de |publisher=KAS Media Program South East Europe |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Croatia thus adopted its law on the Right of Access to Public Information in 2013, after a decade of advocacy, campaigns, and public discussions led by civil society organisations.&lt;ref name=FH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/croatia |title=Croatia. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=Freedomhouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECPMF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ecpmf.eu/news/ecpmf/interviews-balkan/barbara-matejcic-freelance-journalist-croatia |title=”I can’t say it raised the level of general transparency” |last= |first= |date=12 January 2017 |website= Ecpmf.eu |publisher=European Centre for Press and Media Freedom |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the improvements of the legal framework regulating access to public information, problems remain in the implementation, especially for journalists willing to request and obtain information from the government.&lt;ref name="KAS" /&gt;
 
==Legal framework==
 
In Croatia, access to public information has become a constitutional right with the 2010 amendments of the Constitution.&lt;ref name=GONG&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nives Miošić and Duje Prkut  |date=July 2012 |title=Access to information in Croatia: Exercise of a Constitutional Right in an Institutional Culture of Secrecy|url= https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_downloads/GONG%20(Zagreb)_Access%20to%20information%20in%20Croatia.pdf  |publisher=GONG Policy Research Center |issue= |access-date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regulated by the '''Law on the Right to Access Information''' adopted by the [[Croatian Parliament]] in 2013. The Law also regulates the [[re-use of information]] held by public authorities. The Law complies with the Directive 2003/98/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] on the re-use of public sector information and with Regulation 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revizija.hr/en/access-to-information/law-on-the-right-to-access-information |title=Law on the Right of Access to Information |last= |first= |date= |website=Revizija.hr |publisher=Republic of Croatia. State Audit Office |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Law, the right of access to information encompasses the right of the beneficiaries, i.e. any local or foreign natural person or legal entity, to seek and acquire information, as well as the obligation of public authorities to guarantee access to requested information, regardless of the request.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
The Croatian law on Access to public information is  in informed by four principles:
 	
* the principle of '''publicity''' and '''free access''', meaning that information are available to any national or foreign natural persons or legal entity as established by the Law;
* the principle of '''timeliness, entirety and accuracy''' of information, meaning that information disclosed under the Law must be timely provided, complete and accurate;
* the principle of '''equality''', meaning that the right of access to information is granted to every beneficiary in an equal manner;	
* the principle of '''disposal of information''', meaning that beneficiaries that obtained the information in accordance with the Law, are entitled to disclose this information in public.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

Public bodies are obliged to publish on the Internet the following relevant information: laws and other regulations in their field of activity, including draft proposals of laws; general acts and decisions affecting the interests of beneficiaries; annual plans, programmes, strategies and financial reports referring to the work of public authority bodies; information on budget, financing sources and subsidies; information on their internal organisation; notes and conclusions from official sessions; information on public procurement and tenders; information on the way of exercising rights of access to and re-use of information, including contact details of the Information Commissioner and the fee required to access and re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
For the purpose of ensuring the right of access to information, the Law establishes that public bodies are obliged to appoint an [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a special official in charge of resolving the issues emerging from the exercise of the right of access to information. Specifically, the Information Commissioner shall conduct the tasks connected to disclosure of public information in accordance with the Law, including providing the necessary assistance to applicants, improving the manner of processing, classification and safe-keeping of the information, and maintaining the Information Commissioner Register.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;

===Restrictions to the right of access to information===
 
Public authority bodies may restrict access to information if:
 		 
* the information has been classified, in accordance with the law regulating classified information;
 
* if the information represents a trade or professional secret;
 
* in the information is a tax-related secret;
 
* is the information is protected by the law regulating the protection of personal information;
 
* the information may seriously undermine an ongoing decision-making process;
 
* the information is restricted in accordance with international treaties.
 
Moreover, restrictions may be operated when there can be reasonable doubts that disclosing the requested information might  prevent the efficiency, independence or impartiality of ongoing proceedings or the execution of court orders and sentence.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test===
 
The public authority body in charge of acting upon the request of access to information is obliged to conduct the Proportionality Interest Test in order to reach the decision about disclosure. [[Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test]] refer to the assessment of proportionality between reasons for granting access to information and reasons for imposing restrictions and granting access to information only when the public interest prevails. If, on the basis of the Test, the public interest prevails over the damage caused to other protected interests, the information shall be disclosed.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
===Procedures===
 
Public authorities are bound to grant access to information by timely publishing the information on their work in an accessible manner, i.e. on the webpage, or in the Official Gazette and the Central catalogue of officials documents of the Republic of Croatia, etc. Information can be provided directly, or in writing, or by giving insight into documents and making copies of the documents containing the requested information, or by delivering copies of the requested information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Applicants can submit the request either orally or in written form. The submitter of the request is not obliged to mention any reason for requesting access to information.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Access to public information does not require paying any administrative and court fees. The beneficiaries might only be called to pay for the actual costs of providing the information requested.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
Authorities are obliged to issue their decisions within 15 days from the day of submitting a request. This deadline can be prolonged  by other 15 days in case of complex requests (e.g. when the information must be sought outside the offices of the public authority concerned, when a single request contains a request for different information, or when the situation requires to conduct the Proportionality Test and Public Interest Test, etc.) &lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 
If the public authority does not hold the information, it is obliged to transfer the request to the body that might have it and notify the submitter thereof.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Right to appeal===
 
Against the Decision taken by the public authority, the applicant may file a Complaint to the Commissioner within 15 days since the Decision has been delivered. 
 
No complaint may be filed against the decision issued by the Commission, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 	
===Re-use of information===
 
The Croatian law on access to public information regulates also the right to re-use information for commercial or non-commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;
 

==Access to public information in practice==
 
The Croatian law on access to public information is quite advanced and in line with international standards and best practices. However, in the country a culture of secrecy persists. &lt;ref name=MySociety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mysociety.org/2016/09/29/journalists-celebrate-freedom-of-information-croatia/  |title=Journalists celebrate Freedom of Information: Croatia |last= |first= |date=29 September 2016 |website=Mysociety.org |publisher=mySociety |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law, by itself, has not changed this and so far it has not raised the level of general transparency in Croatian society and institutions.&lt;ref name=ECPMF/&gt;&lt;ref name=MySociety/&gt;
 	
One of the main problem affecting the realization of the right of access to public information is the lack of adequate resources allocated to the office of the Commissioner. According to the 2015 Report on the implementation of the law presented to the Parliament, an increase in the resources for the functioning of the Commissioner’s Office if compared with previous years, they are still too limited to allow for the full application of the law. Over the course of 2015, the number of cases dealt with by the Commissioner’s Office has increased. However, the report showed that, due to a lack of staff and resources, not all the complaints received during 2015 have been solved by the Commissioner’s Office.&lt;ref name=HALTER&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Croazia/Croazia-al-di-sopra-dell-opinione-pubblica-17749 |title=Croazia: al di sopra dell'opinione pubblica |last=Gabrić |first=Toni |date=14 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa|language=Italian |access-date=14 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem concerns the limited application of proactive disclosure, which - according to the Commissioner [[Anamarija Musa]] - together with re-use of information, a milestone of access to public information in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Also, according to Commissioner Musa, the implementation of the law is particularly problematic at regional and local level and when it comes to requesting information to private entities providing a public service or to enterprises where the state holds the majority of capital shares.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt; Moreover, Commissioner Musa deems particularly concerning the fact that access to public information requests are regularly ignored, so that the two thirds of the overall complaints received by the Commissioner are caused by this reason.&lt;ref name=HALTER/&gt;
 
===''Imamo pravo znati'' (“We have right to know”) platform===
 	
In Croatia, the web platform imamopravoznati.org, developed using the Alavetely software, has been launched to facilitate citizens' exercise of the right of access to public information. It allows to submit requests for public information to Croatian public authorities, and track their answers. Historic requests, any correspondence between the applicant and public authorities, are archived and publicly online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imamopravoznati.org |title= Imamo pravo znati |last= |first= |date= |website=Imamopravoznati.org |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''agent of influence''' is an agent of some stature who uses his or her position to [[Social influence|influence]] public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Reagan, "DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms," DTIC Online, May 2, 2011, "Agent of Influence, GL-4", accessed March 10, 2012, http://www.ncix.gov/publications/ci_references/CI_Glossary.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417211409/http://www.ncix.gov/publications/ci_references/CI_Glossary.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of influence are often the most difficult agents to detect, as there is seldom material evidence that connects them with a foreign power,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; but they can be among the most effective means of influencing foreign opinion and actions as they hold considerable credibility among the target audience.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Robert K. George, An Historical Investigation of Soviet Strategic Deception, report no. 87-0955 (Maxwell AFB: Air Command and Staff College, 1987), pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly they serve the interests of a foreign power in one of three ways: either as a controlled agent directly recruited and controlled by a foreign power; as a "trusted contact" that consciously collaborates to advance foreign interests but are not directly recruited or controlled by a foreign power; or as a "[[useful idiot]]" that is completely unaware of how their actions further the interests of a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "agent of influence" is often used to describe both individuals and organizations engaged in influence operations. Individuals engaged in this type of influence operation may serve in the fields of journalism, government, art, labor, academia, or a number of other professional fields.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural opinion makers, nationalists, and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of influence.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Anatoliy Golitsyn, New Lies for Old: The Communist Strategy of Deception and Disinformation (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1984), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to individual agents of influence, front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this capacity.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Robert K. George, An Historical Investigation of Soviet Strategic Deception, report no. 87-0955 (Maxwell AFB: Air Command and Staff College, 1987), pg. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Cold War examples of front organizations serving as agents of influence, focusing largely on the [[Soviet influence on the peace movement|Soviet side, were many "peace" groups]]: the [[Christian Peace Conference]], the [[International Organization of Journalists]], the [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]], the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], the [[International Institute for Peace]], and the [[World Peace Council]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. CIA Study: Soviet Covert Action and Propaganda. Central Intelligence Agency, Washington D.C., 1980-02-06, p. IV-11.&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Paul A. Smith, On Political War (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1989), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. government definitions==
*  An agent of some stature who uses his or her position to influence public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the agent (Air Force Office of Special Investigations Manual 71-142).&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Mark L. Reagan, "DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms," DTIC Online, May 2, 2011, "Agent of Influence, GL-4", accessed March 10, 2012, http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person who is directed by an intelligence organization to use his or her position to influence public opinion or decision-making in a manner that will advance the objective of the country for which that organization operates (Counterintelligence Glossary—Terms &amp; Definitions of Interest for Department of Defense Counterintelligence Professionals).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* An individual who acts in the interest of an adversary without open declaration of allegiance and attempts to exercise influence covertly, but is not necessarily gathering intelligence or compromising classified material, is known as an agent of influence (Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counterintelligence).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* An agent operating under intelligence instructions who uses his or her officialdom or public position, and other means, to exert influence on policy, public opinion, the course of particular events, the activity of political organizations and state agencies in target countries (KGB Lexicon: The Soviet Intelligence Officer’s Handbook, edited by KGB archivist Vasiliy Mitrokhin).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938, and 22 U.S.Code § 611 et seq provides detailed definitions of what constitutes an agent of influence.&lt;ref&gt;The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Title 22 U.S.Code § 611 et seq (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|125px|alt=text|Leon Trotsky, who popularized the term "fellow traveller" in 1924. Trotsky would state: "As regards a 'fellow-traveller', the question always comes up—how far will he go?"&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Chapter 2: The Literary 'Fellow-Travellers' of the Revolution", Leon Trotsky: Literature and Revolution, June 1, 2007, http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch02.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary characteristic that distinguishes agents of influence from spies is the lack of absolute control exercised by the foreign power on an agent of influence. According to [[Angelo Codevilla]], the work of an agent of influence "can be far more valuable, subtle, and dangerous than that of a mere spy".&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends", in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; As witnessed in the Cold War through "[[fellow travelers]]", the best agents of influence were those whose interests paralleled that of the aggressor's and needed little if any coordination.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; A foreign power can rarely exercise complete control over an agent of influence, as these agents possess their own preferences and motivations; the most proven way to cultivate the desired results is for a foreign power to choose and develop an agent of influence whose interests already align with their own.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Overlooking an agent of influence's different motivations can have negative consequences, as witnessed in [[World War I]], when German political warfare strategists sent [[Vladimir Lenin]] back to St. Petersburg in an effort to foster domestic instability and get Russia out of the war in 1917.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Since Lenin had different motivations and interests than the German government at the time, he acted in a manner not suited to German interests, and grew so powerful that his party was instrumental to bringing down Imperial Germany.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

Excessive efforts to control or exploit agents of influence can also have negative consequences. Such agents are best seen as strategic or tactical allies, and efforts to exercise too much control over them may result in the loss of an influence asset.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Excessive exploitation of these agents can lead to their exposure by forcing them to take questionably one-sided positions, as witnessed in the exposure of Norwegian [[Arne Treholt]].&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Angello M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare," in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Because these agents exercise influence, their positions and opinions are not wholly secret, but the level to which they coordinate activities with a hostile power is likely to be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;Angello M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare," in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents of influence are most effective because they bring with them a sense of credibility among the target audience, and they use this credibility to convey a story or manipulate a situation in favor of the foreign power with which they share common preferences and motivations.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This credibility makes agents of influence so effective that, according to [[Angelo Codevilla]], using these agents is an act of war "in the same sense that armies crashing across border or airplanes dropping bombs are acts of war because their results can be as intrusive or conclusive as the results of armies or bombs."&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known agents of influence==
[[File:Arne Treholt 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=text|Accused agent of influence and convicted spy Arne Treholt]]

Individuals operating as an agent of influence may serve in the fields of journalism, government, art, labor, academia, or a number of other professional fields.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Cultural opinion makers, nationalists, and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of influence.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The following are some notable individuals that have been accused of being foreign agents of influence. The list is not exhaustive but is meant to show the wide range in which such agents can operate. As previously noted, proving someone is an agent of influence is among the most difficult endeavors, even for the most skilled counterintelligence officers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

* [[Alger Hiss]] – an agent of influence and spy.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his exposure he had significant support among US politicians and only went to jail for lying under oath about passing documents to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;
* Arne Herløv Petersen – used as a Soviet agent of influence in Norway for over 10 years, he mainly focused on various means of manipulating Danish public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N.

==Organizational functioning==
{{Main article|Communist front}}
In addition to individual agents of influence, front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this capacity.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that not all front organizations focus exclusively on influence operations, as some have more specific objectives (intelligence collection, etc.). The Cold War is a recent example of increased use of not only front organizations, but of front organizations being used as agents of influence to alter the target nation's belief system and policies on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Shaw, "The Politics of Cold War Culture," Journal of Cold War Studies 3, no. 3 (Fall 2001): pg. #, http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/tshaw.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of organizations as agents of influence during the Cold War is a recent example that serves to illustrate how frequently front organizations were used in an attempt to alter the perceptions and actions of a foreign nation and its public. A Communist front organization is an organization identified to be a [[front organization]] under the effective control of a [[Communist party]], the [[Communist International]] or other Communist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Suess Kennedy, ''Free Expression in America: A Documentary History'' (Greenwood Press, 1999) pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenin]] originated the idea in his manifesto of 1902, "[[What Is to Be Done?]]". Since the party was illegal in [[Russia]], he proposed to reach the masses through "a large number of other organizations intended for wide membership and, which, therefore, can be as loose and as public as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003)  p 172&lt;/ref&gt; Generally called "[[mass organizations]]" by the Communists themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Hindley, ''The Communist Party of Indonesia 1951-1963'' (1966) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; these groups were prevalent from the 1920s through the 1950s, with their use accelerating during the [[Popular Front]] period of the 1930s.

Starting in 1939, Attorney General Biddle began compiling a list of Fascist and Communist front organizations. It was called "[[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]" (AGLOSO), but was not at first made public.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, "Prelude to McCarthyism," ''Prologue,'' Fall 2006, Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 22-33&lt;/ref&gt;  Political pressures from Congress forced President [[Harry S. Truman]] to act.&lt;ref&gt;Francis H. Thompson, ''The Frustration of Politics: Truman, Congress, and the Loyalty Issue, 1945-1953'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Truman's Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] expanded the list, which was officially authorized by presidential [[Executive Order 9835]] in 1947 and was administered by the new Loyalty Review Board. The Board became part of the Civil Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Shattuck, "The Loyalty Review Board Of The U.S. Civil Service Commission, 1947-1953," ''Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings, 1966, Vol. 78, pp 63-80&lt;/ref&gt; The list was used by federal agencies to screen appointments during the Truman Administration.  The program investigated over 3 million government employees, of whom 300 were dismissed as security risks. Adverse decisions could be appealed to the Loyalty Review Board, a government agency set up by President Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Donovan, ''Conflict and crisis: the presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1945-1948'' (1996) p 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim McNeese, ''The Cold War and Postwar America 1946-1963'' (2010) p 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loyalty Review Board publicized the previously secret Attorney General's list in March 1948 as a "List of Communist classified organizations." The list gave the name and date founded, and (for active groups) the headquarters, and chief officers.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register 13,'' 20 March 1948: Attorney General's List of Communist classified organizations.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-24721-0002, Berlin, Finanzministerium, geschmückt.jpg|thumb|275px|alt=text|This is a picture of the Ministry of Finance in East Berlin, adorned for a session of the World Peace Council on May 24, 1954.]]

[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

{{Special characters}}

A '''barbarian''' is a [[human]] who is perceived to be either [[Civilization|uncivilized]] or [[Primitive culture|primitive]]. The designation is usually applied as [[generalization]] based on a popular [[stereotype]]; barbarians can be any member of a [[nation]] judged by some to be less civilized or orderly (such as a [[tribal society]]), but may also be part of a certain "primitive" [[culture|cultural group]] (such as [[nomad]]s) or [[social class]] (such as [[bandit]]s) both within and outside one's own nation. Alternatively, they may instead be admired and romanticised as [[noble savage]]s. In idiomatic or figurative usage, a "barbarian" may also be an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, and insensitive person.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary'', 1972, pg. 149, Simon &amp; Schuster Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originates from the {{lang-el|βάρβαρος}} (''barbaros'' pl. βάρβαροι ''barbaroi''), which in turn originates from the languages of early [[Anatolia]]n nations that were heard by the Greeks as "bar... bar..." In [[Ancient Greece]], the Greeks used the term towards those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America | publisher=Penguin Press HC | author=Amy Chua, Jed Rubenfeld | year=2014 |page=121| isbn=978-1594205460}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Roman Empire|Ancient Rome]], the Romans used the term towards non-Romans such as the [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]], [[Celts]], [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Berbers]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and [[Sarmatians]]. In the [[early modern period]] and sometimes later, the Byzantine Greeks used it for the [[Turkish people|Turks]], in a clearly [[pejorative]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Εκδοτική Αθηνών, ο Ελληνισμός υπό ξένη κυριαρχία: Τουρκοκρατία, Λατινοκρατία, 1980, page 34 (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Marozzi, The Way of Herodotus: Travels with the Man who Invented History, 2010, pages 311–315&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|right|Routes taken by barbarian invaders during the [[Migration Period]], 5th century AD]]
[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|thumb|right|Routes taken by [[Mongol Empire|Mongol invaders]], 13th century AD]]
The [[Ancient Greek]] name [[wikt:βάρβαρος|βάρβαρος]] (''barbaros''), "barbarian", was an [[antonym]] for [[wikt:πολίτης|πολίτης]] (''politēs''), "citizen" (from πόλις – ''[[polis]]'', "city-state"). The earliest attested form of the word is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀞𐀞𐀫}}, ''pa-pa-ro'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=519 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iDYObRmfLikC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22pa-pa-ro%22+Linear+B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCsAT-24IYf5sgb_xPgT&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pa-pa-ro%22%20Linear%20B&amp;f=false ''Die Sprachbezeichnungen 'Latinus' und 'Romanus' im Lateinischen und Romanischen''], Erich Schmidt Verlag, 1998, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks used the term ''barbarian'' for all non-Greek-speaking peoples, including the [[Egyptians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]] and [[Phoenicians]], emphasizing their otherness. According to Greek writers, this was because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like [[gibberish]] represented by the sounds "bar..bar..;"  the alleged root of the word [[wikt:βάρβαρος|βάρβαρος]], which is an echomimetic or [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] word. However, in various occasions, the term was also used by Greeks, especially the [[Athens|Athenians]], to deride other Greek tribes and states (such as Epirotes, Eleans, Macedonians, Boeotians and Aeolic-speakers) but also fellow Athenians, in a pejorative and politically motivated manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319347 |title=The term '''barbaros''', ''"A Greek-English Lexicon"'' (Liddell &amp; Scott), on Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delante Bravo|first=Chrostopher|title=Chirping like the swallows: Aristophanes' portrayals of the barbarian "other"|year=2012|publisher=ProQuest, UMI Dissertation Publishing|isbn=978-1-248-96599-3|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baracchi|first=Claudia|title=The Bloomsbury Companion to Aristotle|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0873-9|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siculus Diodorus, Ludwig August Dindorf, Diodori Bibliotheca historica – Volume 1 – Page 671&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the term also carried a cultural dimension to its dual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's "Life of Pyrrhos" records his apprehensive remark on seeing a Roman army taking the field against him in disciplined order: "These are not barbarians."[http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/greek2.html Foreigners and Barbarians (adapted from ''Daily Life of the Ancient Greeks'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063551/http://www.globaled.org/nyworld/materials/greek2.html |date=June 29, 2011 }}, The American Forum for Global Education, 2000. &lt;blockquote&gt;"The status of being a foreigner, as the Greeks understood the term does not permit any easy definition.

Prejudice toward Greeks on the part of Greeks was not limited to those who lived on the fringes of the Greek world. The Boeotians, inhabitants of central Greece, whose credentials were impeccable, were routinely mocked for their stupidity and gluttony. Ethnicity is a fluid concept even at the best of times. When it suited their purposes, the Greeks also divided themselves into Ionians and Dorians. The distinction was emphasized at the time of the Peloponnesian War, when the Ionian Athenians fought against the Dorian Spartans. The Spartan general Brasidas even taxed the Athenians with cowardice on account of their Ionian lineage. In other periods of history the Ionian-Dorian divide carried much less weight."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. ''Athens: Its Rise and Fall''. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4191-0808-5}}, pp. 9–10. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Whether the Pelasgi were anciently a foreign or Grecian tribe, has been a subject of constant and celebrated discussion. Herodotus, speaking of some settlements held to be Pelaigic, and existing in his time, terms their language 'barbarous;' but Mueller, nor with argument insufficient, considers that the expression of the historian would apply only to a peculiar dialect; and the hypothesis is sustained by another passage in Herodotus, in which he applies to certain Ionian dialects the same term as that with which he stigmatizes the language of the Pelasgic settlements. In corroboration of Mueller's opinion, we may also observe, that the 'barbarous-tongued' is an epithet applied by Homer to the Carians, and is rightly construed by the ancient critics as denoting a dialect mingled and unpolished, certainly not foreign. Nor when the Agamemnon of Sophocles upbraids Teucer with 'his barbarous tongue,' would any scholar suppose that Teucer is upbraided with not speaking Greek; he is upbraided with speaking Greek inelegantly and rudely. It is clear that they who continued with the least adulteration a language in its earliest form, would seem to utter a strange and unfamiliar jargon to ears accustomed to its more modern construction."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The verb {{lang|el|βαρβαρίζω}} (''barbarízō'') in [[ancient Greek]] meant to behave or talk like a barbarian, or to hold with the barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dbarbari%2Fzw βαρβαρίζω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (''Statesman'' 262de) rejected the Greek–barbarian dichotomy as a logical absurdity on just such grounds: dividing the world into Greeks and non-Greeks told one nothing about the second group, yet Plato used the term barbarian frequently in his seventh letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/seventh_letter.html |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; The Seventh Letter by Plato |publisher=Classics.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Homer]]'s works, the term appeared only once (''[[Iliad]]'' 2.867), in the form {{lang|el|βαρβαρόφωνος}} ({{lang|el|barbarophonos}}) ("of incomprehensible speech"), used of the [[Carians]] fighting for [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. In general, the concept of ''barbaros'' did not figure largely in archaic literature before the 5th century [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Jonathan. ''Hellenicity'', p. 111, {{ISBN|0-226-31329-8}}. "There is at the elite level at least no hint during the archaic period of this sharp dichotomy between Greek and Barbarian or the derogatory and the stereotypical representation of the latter that emerged so clearly from the 5th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still it has been suggested that "barbarophonoi" in the ''Iliad'' signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Jonathan. ''Hellenicity'', p. 111, {{ISBN|0-226-31329-8}}. "Given the relative familiarity of the Karians to the Greeks, it has been suggested that barbarophonoi in the Iliad signifies not those who spoke a non-Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly."&lt;/ref&gt;

A change occurred in the connotations of the word after the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the first half of the 5th century BC. Here a hasty coalition of Greeks defeated the vast [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. Indeed, in the Greek of this period 'barbarian' is often used expressly to refer to Persians, who were enemies of the Greeks in this war.&lt;ref&gt;Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. ''Ancient Greeks West and East'', 1999, p. 60, {{ISBN|90-04-10230-2}}. "a barbarian from a distinguished nation which given the political circumstances of the time might well mean a Persian."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans used the term ''barbarus'' for uncivilised people, opposite to Greek or Roman, and in fact, it became a common term to refer to all foreigners among Romans after Augustus age (as, among the Greeks, after the Persian wars, the Persians), including the Germanic peoples, Persians, Gauls, Phoenicians and Carthaginians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dbarbarus barbarus], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''barbaros'' was the etymological source for many words meaning "barbarian", including English ''barbarian'', which was first recorded in 16th century [[Middle English]].

A word ''barbara-'' is also found in the [[Sanskrit]] of ancient India, with the primary meaning of "stammering" implying someone with an unfamiliar language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=barbara&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= Barbara  (entry)] SpokenSanskrit.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S Apte (1920), [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/AEScan/AEScanjpg/ae0167-foible.jpg Apte English–Sanskrit Dictionary], "Fool" entry, 3rd ed., Pune&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUKaou4KcMC A Sanskrit–English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages], Monier Monier-Williams (1898), Ernst Leumann, Carl Cappeller, pub. Asian Educational Services (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''barbaros'' is related to Sanskrit ''barbaras'' (stammering).&lt;ref&gt;Onions, C.T. (1966), edited by, The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, page 74, [[The Clarendon Press]], Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; This Indo-European root is also found in Latin ''balbus'' for "stammering" and Czech blblati "to stammer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=barbarian&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Barbarian], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aramaic, Old Persian and Arabic context, the root refers to "babble confusedly". It appears as ''barbary'' or in Old French ''barbarie'', itself derived from the Arabic ''Barbar'', ''Berber'', which is an ancient Arabic term for the North African inhabitants west of Egypt. The Arabic word might be ultimately from Greek ''barbaria''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barbary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Barbary], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
[[File:Germaniae antiquae libri tres, Plate 17, Clüver.jpg|thumb|"[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors" as depicted in [[Philipp Clüver]]'s ''Germania Antiqua'' (1616)]]

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines five meanings of the noun ''barbarian'', including an obsolete [[Barbary]] usage.
* '''1.''' ''Etymologically'', A foreigner, one whose language and customs differ from the speaker's.
* '''2.''' ''Hist''. '''a.''' One not a Greek. '''b.''' One living outside the pale of the Roman Empire and its civilization, applied especially to the northern nations that overthrew them. '''c.''' One outside the pale of [[Christian civilization]]. '''d.''' With the Italians of the Renaissance: One of a nation outside of Italy.
* '''3.''' A rude, wild, uncivilized person. '''b.''' Sometimes distinguished from ''savage'' (perh. with a glance at 2). '''c.''' Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners.
* '''4.''' An uncultured person, or one who has no sympathy with literary culture.
* †'''5.''' A native of Barbary. [See [[Barbary Coast]].] ''Obs''. †'''b.''' [[Barbary pirates]] &amp; [[Barb horse|A Barbary horse]]. ''Obs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2009, 2nd ed., v. 4.0, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''OED'' ''barbarous'' entry summarizes the semantic history. "The sense-development in ancient times was (with the Greeks) 'foreign, non-Hellenic,' later 'outlandish, rude, brutal'; (with the Romans) 'not Latin nor Greek,' then 'pertaining to those outside the Roman Empire'; hence 'uncivilized, uncultured,' and later 'non-Christian,' whence 'Saracen, heathen'; and generally 'savage, rude, savagely cruel, inhuman.'"

=== Historical developments ===
[[File:Roman collared slaves - Ashmolean Museum.jpg|thumb|Slaves in chains, relief found in Smyrna (present day [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]]), 200 AD]]
Greek attitudes towards "barbarians" developed in parallel with the growth of [[chattel slavery]] - especially in [[Athens]]. Although the enslavement of Greeks for non-payment of [[debt]]s continued in most Greek states, Athens banned this practice under [[Solon]] in the early 6th century BC. Under the [[Athenian democracy]] established ca. 508 BC, [[slavery in antiquity|slavery]] came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks. Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at [[Laurium|Laureion]] in south-eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of silver-bearing ore there in 483 BC, while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common.

Furthermore, slave-ownership no longer became the preserve of the rich: all but the poorest of Athenian households came to have slaves in order to supplement the work of their free members. The slaves of Athens that had "barbarian" origins were coming especially from lands around the [[Black Sea]] such as [[Thrace]] and [[Taurica]] ([[Crimea]]), while [[Lydia]]ns, [[Phrygians]] and [[Carians]] came from [[Asia Minor]]. [[Aristotle]] (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' 1.2–7; 3.14) characterises barbarians as slaves by nature.

From this period, words like ''barbarophonos'', cited above from Homer, came into use not only for the sound of a foreign language but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly. In the Greek language, the word ''[[logos]]'' expressed both the notions of "language" and "reason", so Greek-speakers readily conflated speaking poorly with stupidity.

Further changes occurred in the connotations of ''barbari''/''barbaroi'' in [[Late Antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Ralph W. Mathison, ''Roman Aristocrats in Barbarian Gaul: Strategies for Survival in an Age of Transition'' (Austin) 1993, pp. 1–6, 39–49; Gerhart B. Ladner, "On Roman attitudes towards barbarians in late antiquity" ''Viator'' '''77''' (1976), pp. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[bishop]]s and [[Catholicos|''catholikoi'']] were appointed to sees connected to cities among the "civilized" ''gentes barbaricae'' such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Persia]], whereas bishops were appointed to supervise entire peoples among the less settled.

Eventually the term found a hidden meaning through the [[folk etymology]] of [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 485 – c. 585). He stated that the word ''barbarian'' was "made up of ''barba'' (beard) and ''rus'' (flat land); for barbarians did not live in cities, making their abodes in the fields like wild animals".&lt;ref&gt;Arno Borst. ''Medieval Worlds: Barbarians, Heretics and Artists in the Middle Ages''. London: Polity, 1991, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenic stereotypes===
[[File:Head of a barbarian Athens.jpg|thumb|right|Head of a barbarian, Probably a [[Germanic Kingship|Client King]]. [[Acropolis Museum]].]]

From classical origins the Hellenic stereotype of barbarism evolved: barbarians are like children, unable to speak or reason properly, cowardly, effeminate, luxurious, cruel, unable to control their appetites and desires, politically unable to govern themselves. Writers voiced these stereotypes with much shrillness - [[Isocrates]] in the 4th century B.C., for example,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} called for a war of conquest against [[Persian empire|Persia]] as a [[panacea]] for Greek problems.

However, the disparaging Hellenic stereotype of barbarians did not totally dominate Hellenic attitudes. [[Xenophon]] (died 354 B.C.), for example, wrote the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', a laudatory fictionalised account of [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Persian Empire]], effectively a [[utopia]]n text. In his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', Xenophon's accounts of the Persians and other non-Greeks who he knew or encountered show few traces of the stereotypes.

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Prodicus of Ceos calls "barbarian" the [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolian]] dialect that [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] spoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plato |title=Protagoras |isbn=978-1604506365 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF1VViQLWDQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Pittacus%20barbarian%20dialect%20Protagoras&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} [Cited in [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The renowned [[orator]] [[Demosthenes]] (384–322 B.C.) made derogatory comments in his speeches, using the word "barbarian".

In the [[Bible|Bible's]] [[New Testament]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] (from [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]]) - lived about A.D. 5 to about A.D. 67) uses the word ''barbarian'' in its Hellenic sense to refer to non-Greeks (''[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:14''), and he also uses it to characterise one who merely speaks a different language (''[[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 14:11'').

About a hundred years after Paul's time, [[Lucian]] – a native of [[Samosata]], in the former kingdom of [[Commagene]], which had been absorbed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made part of the province of [[History of Syria|Syria]] – used the term "barbarian" to describe himself. Because he was a noted satirist, this could have indicated self-deprecating irony. It might also have suggested descent from Samosata's original [[Semitic people|Semitic]] population – who were likely called "barbarians by later Hellenistic, [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] settlers", and might have eventually taken up this appellation themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/lucian/lucian_intro.htm Harmon, A. M. "Lucian of Samosata: Introduction and Manuscripts."] in Lucian, ''Works''. Loeb Classical Library (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Sidwell, introduction to Lucian: ''Chattering Courtesans and Other Sardonic Sketches'' (Penguin Classics, 2005) p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

The term retained its standard usage in the [[Greek language]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]]; [[Byzantine Greeks]] used it widely until the fall of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], (later named the [[Byzantine Empire]]) in the 15th century (1453 with the fall of capital city [[Constantinople]]}.

[[Cicero]] (106-43 BC) described the mountain area of inner [[Sardinia]] as "a land of barbarians", with these inhabitants also known by the manifestly pejorative term ''latrones mastrucati'' ("thieves with a rough garment in wool").
The region, still known as "[[Barbagia]]" (in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] ''Barbàgia'' or ''Barbàza''), preserves this old "barbarian" designation in its name – but it no longer consciously retains "barbarian" associations: the inhabitants of the area themselves use the name naturally and unaffectedly.

===The Dying Galatian statue===
{{main article|Dying Galatian}}
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''Dying Galatian'', [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome]]

The statue of the ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' provides some insight into the Hellenistic perception of and attitude towards "Barbarians". [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]] (ruled 241-197 BC) commissioned (220s BC) a statue to celebrate his victory (ca 232 BC) over the Celtic [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]] (the bronze original is lost, but a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[marble]] copy was found in the 17th century).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Helbig, ''Führer durch die öffenlicher Sammlungen Klassischer altertümer in Rom'' (Tubingen 1963–71) vol. II, pp 240–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue depicts with remarkable realism a dying Celt warrior with a typically Celtic hairstyle and moustache. He sits on his fallen shield while a sword and other objects lie beside him. He appears to be fighting against death, refusing to accept his fate.

The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts' defeat, thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them, and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries. As [[H. W. Janson]] comments, the sculpture conveys the message that "they knew how to die, barbarians that they were".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Janson, "History of Art: A survey of the major visual arts from the dawn of history to the present day", p. 141. H. N. Abrams, 1977. {{ISBN|0-13-389296-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utter barbarism, civilisation, and the noble savage ===
The Greeks admired [[Scythia]]ns and [[Galatia]]ns as heroic individuals – and even (as in the case of [[Anacharsis]]) as philosophers – but they regarded their culture as barbaric. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] indiscriminately characterised the various [[Germanic tribes]], the settled [[Gauls]], and the raiding [[Hun]]s as barbarians,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and subsequent classically oriented historical narratives depicted the migrations associated with the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] as the "[[barbarian invasions]]".

The Romans adapted the term in order to refer to anything that was non-Roman. The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta points out that the meaning of the word "barbarous" has undergone a semantic change in modern times, after [[Michel de Montaigne]] used it to characterize the activities of the Spaniards in the New World – supposedly representatives of the "higher" European culture – as "barbarous," in a satirical essay published in the year 1580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= On Cannibals|author= Montaigne}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not the supposedly "uncivilized" Indian tribes who were "barbarous", but the conquering Spaniards. Montaigne argued that Europeans noted the barbarism of other cultures but not the crueler and more brutal actions of their own societies, particularly (in his time) during the so-called [[European wars of religion|religious wars]]. In Montaigne's view, his own people – the Europeans – were the real "barbarians". In this way, the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] argument was turned around and applied to the European invaders. With this shift in meaning, a whole literature arose in Europe that characterized the indigenous Indian peoples as innocent, and the militarily superior Europeans as "barbarous" intruders invading a paradisical world.&lt;ref&gt;

=="Barbarian" in international historical contexts==
Historically, the term ''barbarian'' has seen widespread use, in English. Many peoples have dismissed alien cultures and even rival civilizations, because they were unrecognizably strange. For instance, the nomadic [[Eurasian nomads|steppe peoples]] north of the [[Black Sea]], including the [[Pechenegs]] and the [[Kipchaks]], were called barbarians by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |title=The Pechenegs |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027115640/http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}, Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East and North Africa===
[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|Ransom of Christian slaves held in Barbary, 17th century]]

The ''[[Berber people|Berbers]]'' of [[North Africa]] were among the many peoples called "Barbarian" by the Romans; in their case, the name remained in use, having been adopted by the [[Arab]]s (see [[Berber (Etymology)|Berber etymology]]) and is still in use as the name for the non-Arabs in North Africa (though not by themselves). The geographical term [[Barbary]] or [[Barbary Coast]], and the name of the [[Barbary pirates]] based on that coast (and who were not necessarily Berbers) were also derived from it.

The term has also been used to refer to people from [[Barbary]], a region encompassing most of [[North Africa]]. The name of the region, ''Barbary,'' comes from the Arabic word ''Barbar,'' possibly from the Latin word ''barbaricum,'' meaning "land of the barbarians."

Many languages define the "Other" as those who do not speak one's language; Greek ''barbaroi'' was paralleled by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[ajam]]'' "non-Arabic speakers; non-Arabs; (especially) [[Persian people|Persians]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alam, M. Shahid (2003), "Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms," ''Science &amp; Society'' 67.2, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
====China====
{{Main article|Ethnic groups in Chinese history}}
{{split section|date=November 2016}}
The term "Barbarian" in traditional Chinese culture had several aspects. For one thing, Chinese has more than one historical "barbarian" [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]]. Several historical [[Chinese characters]] for non-Chinese peoples were [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|graphic pejoratives]], the character for the [[Yao people]], for instance, was changed from ''yao'' 猺 "jackal" to ''yao'' 瑤 "precious jade" in the modern period.&lt;ref&gt;More information on this Chinese system, and on how it was abolished in the 20th century, can be found in the article "The animal other: Re-naming the barbarians in 20th-century China," by Magnus Fiskesjö, Social Text 29.4 (2011) (No. 109, Special Issue, "China and the Human"), 57–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Hua–Yi distinction]] between "Chinese" and "barbarian" was based on culture and power but not on race.

Historically, the Chinese used various words for foreign ethnic groups. They include terms like 夷 ''Yi'', which is often translated as "barbarians." Despite this conventional translation, there are also other ways of translating ''Yi'' into English. Some of the examples include "foreigners,"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Morrison, ''The Dictionary of the Chinese Language'', 3 vols. (Macao: East India Company Press, 1815), 1:61 and 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt; "ordinary others,"&lt;ref&gt;Liu Xiaoyuan, ''Frontier Passages: Ethnopolitics and the Rise of Chinese Communism, 1921–1945'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 10–11. Liu believes the Chinese in early China did not originally think of ''Yi'' as a derogatory term.&lt;/ref&gt; "wild tribes,"&lt;ref&gt;James Legge, ''Shangshu'', "Tribute of Yu" from http://ctext.org/shang-shu/tribute-of-yu&lt;/ref&gt; "uncivilized tribes,"&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, ''Wandering on the way : early Taoist tales and parables of Chuang Tzu'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1998),315.&lt;/ref&gt; and so forth.

=====History and terminology=====
Chinese historical records mention what may now perhaps be termed "barbarian" peoples for over four millennia, although this considerably predates the [[Greek language]] origin of the term "barbarian", at least as is known from the thirty-four centuries of written records in the Greek language. The sinologist [[Herrlee Glessner Creel]] said, "Throughout Chinese history "the barbarians" have been a constant motif, sometimes minor, sometimes very major indeed. They figure prominently in the Shang oracle inscriptions, and the dynasty that came to an end only in 1912 was, from the Chinese point of view, barbarian."&lt;ref&gt;Creel, Herrlee G. (1970). ''The Origins of Statecraft in China''. The University of Chicago Press. p. 194. {{ISBN|0-226-12043-0}}. See "The Barbarians" chapter, pp. 194–241. Creel refers to the Shang [[Oracle bone]] inscriptions and the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC) [[Oracle bone script|oracles]] and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]] first recorded specific Chinese [[exonyms]] for foreigners, often in contexts of warfare or tribute. King [[Wu Ding]] (r. 1250–1192 BC), for instance, fought with the  [[Guifang]] 鬼方, [[Di (Wu Hu)|Di]] 氐, and [[Qiang people|Qiang]] 羌 "barbarians."

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771–476 BC), the meanings of four exonyms were expanded. "These included Rong, Yi, Man, and Di—all general designations referring to the barbarian tribes."&lt;ref&gt;Pu Muzhou (2005). ''Enemies of Civilization: Attitudes toward Foreigners in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China''. SUNY Press. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; These ''[[Four Barbarians|Siyi]]'' 四夷 "Four Barbarians", most "probably the names of ethnic groups originally,"&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, 197"&gt;Creel (1970), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; were the Yi or [[Dongyi]] 東夷 "eastern barbarians," Man or [[Nanman]] 南蠻 "southern barbarians," Rong or [[Xirong]] 西戎 "western barbarians," and Di or [[Beidi]] 北狄 "northern barbarians." The Russian anthropologist [[Mikhail Kryukov]] concluded.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Evidently, the barbarian tribes at first had individual names, but during about the middle of the first millennium B.C., they were classified schematically according to the four cardinal points of the compass. This would, in the final analysis, mean that once again territory had become the primary criterion of the we-group, whereas the consciousness of common origin remained secondary. What continued to be important were the factors of language, the acceptance of certain forms of material culture, the adherence to certain rituals, and, above all, the economy and the way of life. Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the [[Huaxia|Hua-Hsia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jettmar, Karl (1983). "The Origins of Chinese Civilization: Soviet Views." In Keightley, David N., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization]. p. 229. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Raising an army.jpg|thumb|A scene of the Chinese campaign against the [[Miao people|Miao]] in Hunan, 1795]]
The [[Chinese classics]] use compounds of these four generic names in localized "barbarian tribes" exonyms such as "west and north" ''Rongdi'', "south and east" ''Manyi'', ''Nanyibeidi'' "barbarian tribes in the south and the north," and ''Manyirongdi'' "all kinds of barbarians." Creel says the Chinese evidently came to use ''Rongdi'' and ''Manyi'' "as generalized terms denoting 'non-Chinese,' 'foreigners,' 'barbarians'," and a statement such as "the Rong and Di are wolves" (''Zuozhuan'', Min 1) is "very much like the assertion that many people in many lands will make today, that 'no foreigner can be trusted'."
&lt;blockquote&gt; The Chinese had at least two reasons for vilifying and depreciating the non-Chinese groups. On the one hand, many of them harassed and pillaged the Chinese, which gave them a genuine grievance. On the other, it is quite clear that the Chinese were increasingly encroaching upon the territory of these peoples, getting the better of them by trickery, and putting many of them under subjection. By vilifying them and depicting them as somewhat less than human, the Chinese could justify their conduct and still any qualms of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This word ''Yi'' has both specific references, such as to ''Huaiyi'' 淮夷 peoples in the [[Huai River]] region, and generalized references to "barbarian; foreigner; non-Chinese." ''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' translates ''Yi'' as "Anc[ient] barbarian tribe on east border, any border or foreign tribe."&lt;ref&gt;Lin Yutang (1972), [http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/ Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage], Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The sinologist [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]] says the name ''Yi'' "furnished the primary Chinese term for 'barbarian',"  but "Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non-Chinese peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank, E. G., (1983). "The Chinese and Their Neighbors in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times." In Keightley, David N., ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization]. p. 440. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Idealization=====
Some Chinese classics romanticize or idealize barbarians, comparable to the western [[noble savage]] construct. For instance, the Confucian ''[[Analects]]'' records:
* The Master said, The [夷狄] barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes. They are not in such a state of decay as we in China.
* The Master said, The Way makes no progress. I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea.
* The Master wanted to settle among the [九夷] Nine Wild Tribes of the East. Someone said, I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement. The Master said, Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement.&lt;ref&gt;3/5, 5/6, 9/14, tr. by Arthur Waley (1938), ''The Analects of Confucius'', Vintage, pp. 94–5, 108, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
The translator [[Arthur Waley]] noted that, "A certain idealization of the 'noble savage' is to be found fairly often in early Chinese literature", citing the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' maxim, "When the Emperor no longer functions, learning must be sought among the 'Four Barbarians,' north, west, east, and south."&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 17, Waley (1938), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Creel said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;From ancient to modern times the Chinese attitude toward people not Chinese in culture—"barbarians"—has commonly been one of contempt, sometimes tinged with fear&amp;nbsp;... It must be noted that, while the Chinese have disparaged barbarians, they have been singularly hospitable both to individuals and to groups that have adopted Chinese culture. And at times they seem to have had a certain admiration, perhaps unwilling, for the rude force of these peoples or simpler customs.&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a somewhat related example, [[Mencius]] believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless, and thus followed by both Hua and Yi, "[[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] was an Eastern barbarian; he was born in Chu Feng, moved to Fu Hsia, and died in Ming T'iao. [[King Wen]] was a Western barbarian; he was born in Ch'i Chou and died in Pi Ying. Their native places were over a thousand ''li'' apart, and there were a thousand years between them.  Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms, their actions matched like the two halves of a tally.  The standards of the two sages, one earlier and one later, were identical."&lt;ref&gt;''Mencius,''D.C Lau tran. (Middlesex:Penguin Books, 1970),128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' character dictionary, defines ''yi'' 夷 as "men of the east” 東方之人也. The dictionary also informs that ''Yi'' is not dissimilar from the ''Xia'' 夏, which means Chinese. Elsewhere in the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', under the entry of ''qiang'' 羌, the term ''yi'' is associated with benevolence and human longevity. ''Yi'' countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives. This is why Confucius wanted to go to ''yi'' countries when the ''dao'' could not be realized in the central states.&lt;ref&gt;Xu Shen 許慎, ''Shuowen Jieji'' 說文解字 (Beijing: Zhonghua Shuju, 1963), 213, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pejorative Chinese characters=====
{{main article|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}

Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. Take for instance, the [[Written Chinese]] transcription of ''Yao'' "the [[Yao people]]", who primarily live in the mountains of southwest China and Vietnam. When 11th-century [[Song Dynasty]] authors first transcribed the [[exonym]] ''Yao'', they insultingly chose ''yao'' 猺 "jackal" from a lexical selection of over 100 characters pronounced ''yao'' (e.g., 腰 "waist", 遙 "distant", 搖 "shake"). During a series of 20th-century Chinese [[language reform]]s, this graphic pejorative [[wikt:猺|猺]] (written with the 犭"[[Radical 94|dog/beast radical]]") "jackal; the Yao" was replaced twice; first with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (亻"[[Radical 9|human radical]]") "the Yao", then with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (玉 "[[Radical 96|jade radical]]") "precious jade; the Yao." Chinese [[orthography]] (symbols used to write a language) can provide unique opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically that do not exist alphabetically. For the Yao ethnic group, there is a difference between the transcriptions ''Yao'' 猺 "jackal" and ''Yao'' 瑤 "jade" but none between the [[Chinese romanization|romanizations]] ''Yao'' and ''Yau''.&lt;ref&gt;See Fiskesjö, "The animal other: Re-naming the barbarians in 20th-century China."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cultural and racial barbarianism=====
[[File:Great wall of china-mutianyu 3.JPG|thumb|right|The purpose of the [[Great Wall of China]] was to stop the "barbarians" from crossing the northern border of China.]]
According to the archeologist William Meacham, it was only by the time of the late [[Shang dynasty]] that one can speak of "[[Chinese people|Chinese]]," "[[Chinese culture]]," or "Chinese civilization." "There is a sense in which the traditional view of ancient Chinese history is correct (and perhaps it originated ultimately in the first appearance of dynastic civilization): those on the fringes and outside this esoteric event were "barbarians" in that they did not enjoy (or suffer from) the fruit of civilization until they were brought into close contact with it by an imperial expansion of the civilization itself."&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, William (1983). "Origins and Development of the Yueh Coastal Neolithic: A Microcosm of Culture Change on the Mainland of East Asia." In Keightley, David N., ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC The Origins of Chinese civilization], p. 149. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a similar vein, Creel explained the significance of Confucian ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' "ritual; rites; propriety".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental criterion of "Chinese-ness," anciently and throughout history, has been cultural. The Chinese have had a particular way of life, a particular complex of usages, sometimes characterized as ''li''. Groups that conformed to this way of life were, generally speaking, considered Chinese. Those that turned away from it were considered to cease to be Chinese.&amp;nbsp;... It was the process of acculturation, transforming barbarians into Chinese, that created the great bulk of the Chinese people. The barbarians of Western Chou times were, for the most part, future Chinese, or the ancestors of future Chinese. This is a fact of great importance.&amp;nbsp;... It is significant, however, that we almost never find any references in the early literature to physical differences between Chinese and barbarians. Insofar as we can tell, the distinction was purely cultural.&lt;ref name="Creel 1970, 197"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dikötter says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thought in ancient China was oriented towards the world, or ''[[tianxia]]'', "all under heaven." The world was perceived as one homogenous unity named "great community" (''[[Great Unity|datong]]'') The Middle Kingdom [China], dominated by the assumption of its cultural superiority, measured outgroups according to a yardstick by which those who did not follow the "Chinese ways" were considered "barbarians." A Theory of "using the Chinese ways to transform the barbarian" as strongly advocated. It was believed that the barbarian could be culturally assimilated. In the Age of Great Peace, the barbarians would flow in and be transformed: the world would be one.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1990), "Group Definition and the Idea of 'Race' in Modern China (1793–1949)," ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' 13:3, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Pakistani academic [[M. Shahid Alam]], "The centrality of culture, rather than race, in the Chinese world view had an important corollary. Nearly always, this translated into a civilizing mission rooted in the premise that 'the barbarians could be culturally assimilated'"; namely ''laihua'' 來化 "come and be transformed" or ''Hanhua'' 漢化 "become Chinese; be sinicized."&lt;ref&gt;Alam, M. Shahid (2003), "Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms," ''Science &amp; Society'' 67.2, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two millennia before the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] wrote ''[[The Raw and the Cooked]]'', the Chinese differentiated "raw" and "cooked" categories of barbarian peoples who lived in China. The ''shufan'' 熟番 "cooked [food eating] barbarians" are sometimes interpreted as Sinicized, and the ''shengfan'' 生番 "raw [food eating] barbarians" as not Sinicized.&lt;ref&gt;An alternative interpretation emphasizing power and state control as the main distinction at play, rather than the degree of cultural assimilation, is offered in Fiskesjö, Magnus. "On the 'Raw' and the 'Cooked' barbarians of imperial China." Inner Asia 1.2 (1999), 139–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Liji]]'' gives this description.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The people of those five regions – the Middle states, and the [Rong], [Yi] (and other wild tribes around them) – had all their several natures, which they could not be made to alter. The tribes on the east were called [Yi]. They had their hair unbound, and tattooed their bodies. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the south were called Man. They tattooed their foreheads, and had their feet turned toward each other. Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire. Those on the west were called [Rong]. They had their hair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food. Those on the north were called [Di]. They wore skins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them did not eat grain-food.&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James (1885) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hNYIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA229 The Li ki], Clarendon Press, part 1, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dikötter explains the close association between [[nature and nurture]]. "The ''shengfan'', literally 'raw barbarians', were considered savage and resisting. The ''shufan'', or 'cooked barbarians', were tame and submissive. The consumption of raw food was regarded as an infallible sign of savagery that affected the physiological state of the barbarian."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (1992), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Warring States period]] texts record a belief that the respective natures of the Chinese and the barbarian were incompatible. Mencius, for instance, once stated: "I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways, but not of their being converted to barbarian ways."&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Lau (1970), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Dikötter says, "The nature of the Chinese was regarded as impermeable to the evil influences of the barbarian; no retrogression was possible. Only the barbarian might eventually change by adopting Chinese ways."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter (1992), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, different thinkers and texts convey different opinions on this issue. The prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu, for example, wrote in his essay ''Yuan Dao'' the following: "When Confucius wrote the ''Chunqiu'', he said that if the feudal lords use Yi ritual, then they should be called Yi; If they use Chinese rituals, then they should be called Chinese." Han Yu went on to lament in the same essay that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confucianism.com.cn/detail.asp?id=25097 |title="孔子之作春秋也，诸侯用夷礼，则夷之；进于中国，则中国之." |publisher=Confucianism.com.cn |date=2006-10-04 |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Han Yu's essay shows the possibility that the Chinese can lose their culture and become the uncivilized outsiders, and that the uncivilized outsiders have the potential to become Chinese.

After the Song Dynasty, many of China's rulers in the north were of Inner Asia ethnicities, such as Qidan, Ruzhen, and Mongols of the Liao, Jin and Yuan Dynasties, the latter ended up ruling over the entire China. Hence, the historian [[John King Fairbank]] wrote, "the influence on China of the great fact of alien conquest under the Liao-Jin-Yuan dynasties is just beginning to be explored."&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Qing Dynasty, the rulers of China adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven to rule China. At the same time, they also tried to retain their own indigenous culture.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Manchus' adoption of Han Chinese culture, most Han Chinese (though not all) did accept the Manchus as the legitimate rulers of China. Similarly, according to Fudan University historian Yao Dali, even the supposedly "patriotic" hero Wen Tianxiang of the late Song and early Yuan period did not believe the Mongol rule to be illegitimate. In fact, Wen was willing to live under Mongol rule as long as he was not forced to be a Yuan dynasty official, out of his loyalty to the Song dynasty. Yao explains that Wen chose to die in the end because he was forced to become a Yuan official. So, Wen chose death due to his loyalty to his dynasty, not because he viewed the Yuan court as a non-Chinese, illegitimate regime and therefore refused to live under their rule. Yao also says that many Chinese who were living in the Yuan-Ming transition period also shared Wen's beliefs of identifying with and putting loyalty towards one's dynasty above racial/ethnic differences. Many Han Chinese writers did not celebrate the collapse of the Mongols and the return of the Han Chinese rule in the form of the Ming dynasty government at that time. Many Han Chinese actually chose not to serve in the new Ming court at all due to their loyalty to the Yuan. Some Han Chinese also committed suicide on behalf of the Mongols as a proof of their loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.news.163.com/special/00013PNN/vol13.html |title=百家博谈第十三期：从文天祥与元代遗民看中国的"民族主义"_网易博客 网易历史 |publisher=History.news.163.com |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; We should note that the founder of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, also indicated that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China.  On a side note, one of his key advisors, Liu Ji, generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non-Chinese are different, they are actually equal. Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to the "Yi."&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Songfang, "Lun Liu Ji de Yimin Xintai" (On Liu Ji's Mentality as a Dweller of Subjugated Empire) in ''Xueshu Yanjiu'' no.4 (2005), 112–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

These things show that many times, pre-modern Chinese did view culture (and sometimes politics) rather than race and ethnicity as the dividing line between the Chinese and the non-Chinese. In many cases, the non-Chinese could and did become the Chinese and vice versa, especially when there was a change in culture.

=====Modern reinterpretations=====
According to the historian [[Frank Dikötter]], "The delusive myth of a Chinese antiquity that abandoned racial standards in favour of a concept of cultural universalism in which all barbarians could ultimately participate has understandably attracted some modern scholars. Living in an unequal and often hostile world, it is tempting to project the utopian image of a racially harmonious world into a distant and obscure past."&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). ''The Discourse of Race in Modern China''. Stanford University Press, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The politician, historian, and diplomat [[K. C. Wu]] analyzes the origin of the characters for the ''Yi'', ''Man'', ''Rong'', ''Di'', and ''Xia'' peoples and concludes that the "ancients formed these characters with only one purpose in mind—to describe the different ways of living each of these people pursued."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, K. C. 1982. ''The Chinese Heritage''. New York: Crown Publishers. {{ISBN|0-517-54475-X}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;106–108&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the well-known examples of pejorative exonymic characters (such as the "dog radical" in Di), he claims there is no hidden racial bias in the meanings of the characters used to describe these different peoples, but rather the differences were "in occupation or in custom, not in race or origin."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 109&lt;/ref&gt; K. C. Wu says the modern character [[wikt:夷|夷]] designating the historical "Yi peoples," composed of the characters for 大 "big (person)" and 弓 "bow", implies a big person carrying a bow, someone to perhaps be feared or respected, but not to be despised.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; However, differing from K. C. Wu, the scholar Wu Qichang believes that the earliest [[oracle bone script]] for ''yi'' 夷 was [[Shi (personator)#Characters|used interchangeably]] with ''shi'' [[wikt:尸|尸]] "corpse".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' (1993), vol. 3, p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian John Hill explains that ''Yi'' "was used rather loosely for non-Chinese populations of the east. It carried the connotation of people ignorant of Chinese culture and, therefore, 'barbarians'."&lt;ref&gt;Hill, John (2009), ''Through the Jade Gate to Rome: A Study of the Silk Routes during the Later Han Dynasty, First to Second Centuries CE'', BookSurge, {{ISBN|978-1-4392-2134-1}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher I. Beckwith makes the extraordinary claim that the name "barbarian" should only be used for Greek historical contexts, and is inapplicable for all other "peoples to whom it has been applied either historically or in modern times."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I. (2009). ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present''.  Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13589-2}}. p. 356. Furthermore, "The entire construct is, appropriately enough, best summed up by popular European and American fiction and film treatments such as ''Conan the Barbarian''." Also see "The Barbarians" epilogue, pp. 320–362.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith notes that most specialists in East Asian history, including him, have translated Chinese exonyms as English "''barbarian''." He believes that after academics read his published explanation of the problems, except for direct quotations of "earlier scholars who use the word, it should no longer be used as a term by any writer."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;361–2. The author describes his belief in religious terms; following his "enlightenment on this issue", he says no scholar who used the word ''barbarian'' "needs to be blamed for such sins of the past".&lt;/ref&gt;

The first problem is that, "it is impossible to translate the word ''barbarian'' into Chinese because the concept does not exist in Chinese," meaning a single "completely generic" [[loanword]] from Greek ''barbar-''.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; "Until the Chinese borrow the word ''barbarian'' or one of its relatives, or make up a new word that explicitly includes the same basic ideas, they cannot express the idea of the 'barbarian' in Chinese.".&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"&gt;Beckwith, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual [[Standard Chinese]] translation of English ''barbarian'' is ''yemanren'' ({{CJKV|t=野蠻人|s=野蛮人|p=yěmánrén}}), which Beckwith claims, "actually means 'wild man, savage'. That is very definitely not the same thing as 'barbarian'."&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"/&gt; Despite this semantic hypothesis, Chinese-English dictionaries regularly translate ''yemanren'' as "barbarian" or "barbarians."&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''Far East Chinese-English Dictionary'' "barbarians; savages" (1992) p. 1410; "savage; Shanghai Jiaotong ''Chinese-English Dictionary'' "barbarian", (1993) p. 2973; ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'' "barbarians" (2003), p. 1131.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith concedes that the early Chinese "apparently disliked foreigners in general and looked down on them as having an inferior culture," and pejoratively wrote some exonyms. However, he purports, "The fact that the Chinese did not ''like'' foreigner Y and occasionally picked a transcriptional character with negative meaning (in Chinese) to write the sound of his ethnonym, is irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;356–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckwith's second problem is with linguists and lexicographers of Chinese. "If one looks up in a Chinese-English dictionary the two dozen or so partly generic words used for various foreign peoples throughout Chinese history, one will find most of them defined in English as, in effect, 'a kind of barbarian'. Even the works of well-known lexicographers such as Karlgren do this."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 358.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Beckwith does not cite any examples, the Swedish sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] edited two dictionaries: ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'' (1923) and ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' (1957). Compare Karlgrlen's translations of the ''siyi'' "four barbarians":
* ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian, foreigner; destroy, raze to the ground," "barbarian (esp. tribes to the East of ancient China)"&lt;ref&gt;AD186, GSR 551a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''man'' 蛮 "barbarians of the South; barbarian, savage," "Southern barbarian"&lt;ref&gt;AD 590, GSR 178p.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''rong'' 戎 "weapons, armour; war, warrior; N. pr. of western tribes,"  "weapon; attack; war chariot; loan for tribes of the West"&lt;ref&gt;AD 949, GSR 1013a.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''di'' 狄 "Northern Barbarians – "fire-dogs"," "name of a Northern tribe; low servant"&lt;ref&gt;AD 117, GSR 856a.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus'' Project includes Karlgren's ''GSR'' definitions. Searching the [http://stedt.berkeley.edu/~stedt-cgi/rootcanal.pl STEDT Database] finds various "a kind of" definitions for plant and animal names (e.g., ''you'' 狖 "a kind of monkey,"&lt;ref&gt;GSR 1246c. Beckwith criticizes "a kind of X" definitions as "the dictionary maker either could not find out what it was or was too lazy to define it accurately" (2009), 359; compare listing "rakhbīn (a kind of cheese)" as an export from [[Khwarezm]] (2009), 327.&lt;/ref&gt; but not one "a kind of barbarian" definition.  Besides faulting Chinese for lacking a general "barbarian" term, Beckwith also faults English, which "has no words for the many foreign peoples referred to by one or another Classical Chinese word, such as 胡 ''hú'', 夷 ''yí'', 蠻 ''mán'', and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem involves [[Tang Dynasty]] usages of ''fan'' "foreigner" and ''lu'' "prisoner", neither of which meant "barbarian." Beckwith says Tang texts used ''fan'' 番 or 蕃 "foreigner" (see ''shengfan'' and ''shufan'' above) as "perhaps the only true generic at any time in Chinese literature, was practically the opposite of the word ''barbarian''. It meant simply 'foreign, foreigner' without any pejorative meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 360.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, ''fan'' 番 means "foreigner; barbarian; aborigine". The linguist Robert Ramsey illustrates the pejorative connotations of ''fan''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The word "''Fān''" was formerly used by the Chinese almost innocently in the sense of 'aborigines' to refer to ethnic groups in South China, and Mao Zedong himself once used it in 1938 in a speech advocating equal rights for the various minority peoples. But that term has now been so systematically purged from the language that it is not to be found (at least in that meaning) even in large dictionaries, and all references to Mao's 1938 speech have excised the offending word and replaced it with a more elaborate locution, "Yao, Yi, and Yu."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Robert S. (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2E_5nR0SoXoC&amp;pg=PA160 The Languages of China]'', p. 160. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Tang Dynasty Chinese also had a derogatory term for foreigners, ''lu'' ({{CJKV|t=虜|s=虏|p=lǔ}}) "prisoner, slave, captive". Beckwith says it means something like "those miscreants who should be locked up," therefore, "The word does not even mean 'foreigner' at all, let alone 'barbarian'."&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (2009), 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher I. Beckwith's 2009 "The Barbarians" epilogue provides many references, but overlooks H. G. Creel's 1970 "The Barbarians" chapter. Creel descriptively wrote, "Who, in fact, were the barbarians? The Chinese have no single term for them. But they were all the non-Chinese, just as for the Greeks the barbarians were all the non-Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;Creel (1970), 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwith prescriptively wrote, "The Chinese, however, have still not yet borrowed Greek ''barbar''-. There is also no single native Chinese word for 'foreigner', no matter how pejorative," which meets his strict definition of "barbarian.".&lt;ref name="Beckwith, 358"/&gt;

=====Barbarian puppet drinking game=====
In the [[Tang Dynasty]] houses of pleasure, where drinking games were common, small puppets in the aspect of Westerners, in a ridiculous state of drunkenness, were used in one popular permutation of the drinking game; so, in the form of blue-eyed, pointy nosed, and peak-capped barbarians, these puppets were manipulated in such a way as to occasionally fall down: then, whichever guest to whom the puppet pointed after falling was then obliged by honor to empty his cup of [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|Chinese wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
When Europeans came to [[Japan]], they were called {{nihongo|''nanban''|南蛮}}, literally ''Barbarians from the South'', because the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships appeared to sail from the South. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who arrived later, were also called either ''nanban'' or {{nihongo|''kōmō''|紅毛}}, literally meaning "Red Hair."

In the ancient Indian epic [[Mahabharata]], the Sanskrit word ''barbara-'' meant "stammering, wretch, foreigner, sinful people, low and barbarous".&lt;ref&gt;Suryakanta (1975), Sanskrit Hindi English Dictionary, reprinted 1986, page 417, [[Orient Longman]] ({{ISBN|0-86125-248-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Romila Thapar, the Indo-Aryan semi-nomadic people viewed the indigenous people as barbarians when they arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Romila Thapar|title=Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fK3VTUrWsD0C&amp;pg=PA137|year=1978|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0808-8|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indo-Aryan used the term ''[[mleccha]]'' in referring to people "outside the caste system and ritual ambience." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISFBJarYX7YC&amp;pg=PA8 ''Students' Britannica India''], Vols. 1–5, p. 8.

===Pre-Colombian Americas===
In Mesoamerica the [[Aztec]] civilization used the word "[[Chichimeca]]" to denominate a group of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes that lived on the outskirts of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]'s Empire, in the north of Modern Mexico, and whom the Aztec people saw as primitive and uncivilized. One of the meanings attributed to the word "Chichimeca" is "dog people".

The [[Incas]] of South America used the term "puruma auca" for all peoples living outside the rule of their empire (see [[Promaucaes]]).

The British, and later the white colonial settlers of the [[United States]], referred to Native Americans as "savages."

===Barbarian mercenaries===
The entry of "barbarians" into [[mercenary]] service in a metropole repeatedly occurs in history as a standard way in which peripheral peoples from and beyond [[frontier]] regions relate to "civilised" imperial powers as part of a (semi-)foreign militarised proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:IMG 7039 - Milano - Casa degli omenoni - Sarmata - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 8-Mar-2007 crop.jpg|thumb|A defeated [[Sarmatian]] barbarian serves as an [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] on a 16th-century [[villa]] in [[Milan]]. Sculpted by [[Antonio Abbondio]] for [[Leone Leoni]]]]

Italians in the [[Renaissance]] often called anyone who lived outside of their country a barbarian. As an example, there is the last chapter of [[The Prince]] by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], "Exhortatio ad Capesendam Italiam in Libertatemque a Barbaris Vinsicandam" (in English: Exhortation to take Italy and free her from the barbarians) in which he appeals to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]] to unite Italy and stop the "barbarian invasions" led by other European rulers, such as [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], both of France, and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].

Spanish sea captain [[Francisco de Cuellar]], who sailed with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, used the term 'savage' ('salvaje') to describe the [[Irish people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/research/celt/published/T108200.html |title=Captain Cuellar's Adventures in Connacht and Ulster |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist use of "Barbarism"==
In her 1916 anti-war pamphlet ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ The Crisis of German Social Democracy]'', [[Marxism|Marxist]] theorist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads, either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg, "The Junius Pamphlet" |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luxemburg attributed it to [[Friedrich Engels]], though – as shown by [[Michael Löwy]] – Engels had not used the term "Barbarism" but a less resounding formulation: ''If the whole of modern society is not to perish, a revolution in the mode of production and distribution must take place.'' &lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, "Anti-Dühring" (1878), quoted in Michael Löwy, "Philosophy of Praxis &amp; Rosa Luxemburg" in "Viewpoint", Online Issue No. 125, November 2, 2012 {{cite web|url=http://www.viewpointonline.net/philosophy-of-praxis-a-rosa-luxemburg-michael-loewy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511013653/http://www.viewpointonline.net/philosophy-of-praxis-a-rosa-luxemburg-michael-loewy.html |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been made that Luxemburg had remembered a passage from ''[[Erfurt Program|The Erfurt Program]]'', written in 1892 by [[Karl Kautsky]], and mistakenly attributed it to Engels:&lt;blockquote&gt;As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mronline.org/2014/10/22/angus221014-html-2/|title=MR Online {{!}} The Origin of Rosa Luxemburg’s Slogan “Socialism or Barbarism”|date=2014-10-22|work=MR Online|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luxemburg went on to explain what she meant by "Regression into Barbarism": "A look around us at this moment [i.e., 1916 Europe] shows what the regression of bourgeois society into Barbarism means. This World War is a regression into Barbarism. The triumph of Imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization. At first, this happens sporadically for the duration of a modern war, but then when the period of unlimited wars begins it progresses toward its inevitable consequences. Today, we face the choice exactly as Friedrich Engels foresaw it a generation ago: either the triumph of Imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degeneration – a great cemetery. Or the victory of Socialism, that means the conscious active struggle of the International Proletariat against Imperialism and its method of war."

"Socialism or Barbarism" became, and remains, an often quoted and influential concept in [[Marxist]] literature. "Barbarism" is variously interpreted as meaning either a technologically advanced but extremely exploitative and oppressive society (e.g. a victory and world domination by [[Nazi Germany]] and its [[Fascism|Fascist]] allies); a collapse of technological civilization due to Capitalism causing a [[Nuclear War]] or [[ecological disaster]]; or the one form of barbarism bringing on the other.

The [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]] considers "Socialism or Barbarism" to be a variant of the earlier "[[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Liberty or Death]]", used by revolutionaries of different stripes since the late 18th century &lt;ref&gt;"The October Revolution – Ninety Years On", 2007 statement of the Internationalist Communist Tendency
[http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2007-11-01/october-revolution-ninety-years-on]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular culture==
Modern popular culture contains such fantasy barbarians as [[Conan the Barbarian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=May 25, 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|authors=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|work=Conan Saga |issue= 50–54, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such fantasy, the negative connotations traditionally associated with "Barbarian" are often inverted. For example, "[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]" (1932), the first of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s "Conan" series, is set soon after the "Barbarian" protagonist had forcibly seized the turbulent kingdom of [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonia]] from King Numedides, whom he strangled upon his throne. The story is clearly slanted to imply that the kingdom greatly benefited by power passing from a decadent and tyrannical hereditary monarch to a strong and vigorous Barbarian usurper.

== Origin ==
After former [[General Secretary]] [[Hu Yaobang]]'s death on April 15, students mobilized spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; both to mourn Hu's passing and to demand democratic reform in China.&lt;ref&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, at [[Peking University]] (Beida), a meeting was anonymously organized to discuss the ongoing protests in the Square, as well as the prospect of forming an autonomous student organization.&lt;ref name=Wright150&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting, in essence, was a "democracy salon"—an unofficial student discussion group that students at Beida had founded by the former Beida physics [[graduate student]] [[Liu Gang]] months before Hu Yaobang's death.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The salon decided that an autonomous organization was necessary to coordinate student protesters on multiple Beijing campuses.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; However, for fear of punishment by the government, few at the meeting were willing to speak out.&lt;ref name="Wright150"/&gt; Those who did, including history student [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], became the leaders of the newly formed Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref name=Li159&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aim of the new Federation was the rejection of the official student organizations.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; According to one student announcement, "the leadership of the original union is inept, has sold out the students' interests…and is completely unable to represent the students' wishes."&lt;ref name="Calhoun41"/&gt; In this way, the student protesters saw the Federation as representing the wishes of the entire student body.&lt;ref name=Francis904 /&gt; The Federation planned to seek legitimacy by strict observance of democratic policies such as elections and group decision-making.&lt;ref name=Calhoun53&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The students hoped these methods would ensure the organization's unity of leadership,&lt;ref name=Francis908&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 908.&lt;/ref&gt; and would effectively contrast with the lack of transparency they perceived in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Calhoun53"/&gt; On May 23, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation established officially at [[Liu Gang]]'s residence near [[Yuanmingyuan]], during the first meeting, the students had elected  [[Zhou Yongjun]] as the first chairman of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Cheng, ''Standoff at Tiananmen'' (Sensys Corporation, 2009), 88-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, ''[[People's Daily]]'' published the editorial [[April 26 Editorial|"It is Necessary to Take a Clear-Cut Stand Against Turmoil"]],&lt;ref name=Wright154&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 154.&lt;/ref&gt; attributing the protests to "a small minority" attempting to "poison people's minds" and "create national turmoil."&lt;ref name=Francis909&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation was officially established.&lt;ref name="Saich190"/&gt; At their meeting, around 2,000 students elected a seven-person committee to lead the Federation.&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; Concerned by the April 26 editorial, the Federation decided that, as an illegal organization, it needed to reinforce its legitimacy by showing its popular support.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt; To achieve this goal, the Federation organized a demonstration to take place on April 27.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt;

== Dialogue and Recognition ==
Between April 16 and 26, the government had dismissed the autonomous students' demands for recognition and dialogue.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis907"/&gt; The government, unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the independent student unions,&lt;ref name="Francis908"/&gt; had attempted instead to arrange talks with individual student leaders.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; Although the student protesters believed they were acting patriotically&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; and morally,&lt;ref&gt;Saich, "The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement," 191.&lt;/ref&gt; the Communist leadership saw the students' demands as a threat to political and social order.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 915.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the students had difficulty obtaining their goal of direct dialogue with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[April 27 Demonstration|April 27 student demonstrations]],&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; the government held its first dialogue with the Federation leaders on April 29.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt; However, the government avoided direct contact with the Federation, instead inviting student leaders to meet on an individual basis.&lt;ref name=Calhoun56&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While some students saw the government's offer as a victory,&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; others felt that they should only attend the dialogue as recognized representatives of the Federation.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; [[Wuer Kaixi]], a Federation leader, attended the dialogue as a "private individual",&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; but decided to leave midway through to protest the government's lack of recognition of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 910.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the dialogue, Wuer Kaixi later described it as a "trick of the government to destroy the student solidarity."&lt;ref name=King122&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman Yuan Mu insisted that the Communist Party and the student protesters shared the same goals.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt;

On May 1, the Federation rejected the legitimacy of the April 29 dialogue in a news conference.&lt;ref name="Francis911"/&gt; The following day, the Federation presented a twelve-point petition, including a demand that future government efforts at dialogue be sincere.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; Although the government rejected this petition,&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; the petition represented a compromise on the students' part, as [[Amnesty International]] researcher Corinna-Barbara Francis suggests.&lt;ref name=Francis912&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 912.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, instead of demanding explicit government recognition, the students only asked for dialogue "on the basis of full equality between the two parties."&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt; By May 29, the students' demands were reduced to two: denunciation of the April 26 editorial by the government and acknowledgement of the federation's democratic nature.&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt;

== Division and Decline ==
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen]], taken on 10 May 1989.]]
On May 4, the Federation successfully organized a demonstration of over 100,000 protesters in Tiananmen Square, marking the 70-year anniversary of the [[May 4 Movement|1919 May 4 Movement]].&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Also on May 4, the Federation decided to end the boycott on class attendance it had begun on April 24.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 905.&lt;/ref&gt; This sudden and unexpected end to the boycott, and loss of momentum in student-government negotiations, resulted in a loss of student enthusiasm for the protests.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; As student leader [[Chai Ling]] noted "the movement dwindled to a low point as more and more students returned to classes."&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, Chai Ling and other students started a [[hunger strike]] on the Square.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Although the Federation initially opposed the hunger strikers during its May 12 meeting, it eventually decided to support individual strikers, but avoided official endorsement of the Hunger Strike Group.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; As the protests continued throughout May and into June, the Hunger Strike Group would take control of events in the Square, and would largely displace the authority previously held by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dingxin Zhao, ''The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement'' (University of Chicago Press, 2008), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Response ==
Speaking with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Zhao Ziyang]] on May 4, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] voiced his concern over the ongoing protests in the Square.&lt;ref name=Zhang117&gt;Liang Zhang, Andrew J Nathan, and E. Perry Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'' (New York: PublicAffairs, 2002), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zhao Ziyang contended that the April 26 editorial had encouraged student protesters, Li Peng contended that this was too simple an explanation for the growth of the protest movement, suggesting that the April 26 editorial "did not accuse the vast majority of students of creating turmoil."&lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li Peng also opposed to the student protester's demands for negotiation.&lt;ref name=Zhang118&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing concern over the rising prominence of the "illegal student organizations," &lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li objected to the Federation's desire "to negotiate with the Party and government as equals" and saw the students' twelve-point petition as a "threat."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt; In his conversation with Zhao, Li also asserted that the Federation's primary goal was to "negate the leadership of the CCP and negate the entire socialist system."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt;

On May 13, after the hunger striker's announced their plan, [[Yan Mingfu]], Director of the Party's [[United Front Work Department]], met with a number of intellectuals and student protesters, including Wang Dan, Chai Ling, and Wuer Kaixi.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Yan Mingfu suggested that if the student protesters stopped their hunger strike and instead submitted their "demands and suggestions through proper channels," he could assure them that "the door to dialogue" would remain open.&lt;ref name=Zhang159&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he later briefed Zhao Ziyang on the meeting, Yan Mingfu shared his unease at the divisions he observed among the student protesters: "the AFS [the Federation], the Dialogue Delegation, and representatives of the hunger strikers…are in disagreement among themselves…I'm not sure any of them truly represents the hunger strikers or can exert any influence on them."&lt;ref name="Zhang159"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19177">'''Binaural fusion''' or '''binaural integration''' is a [[cognitive]] process that involves the "fusion" of different [[auditory system|auditory]] information presented [[Sound localization|binaurally]], or to each [[ear]]. In humans, this process is essential in understanding [[speech]] as one ear may pick up more information about the speech [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] than the other.

The process of binaural fusion is important for computing the location of sound sources in the [[horizontal plane]] ([[sound localization]]), and it is important for sound segregation.&lt;ref name="Grothe2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Koch |first2=Ursula |title=Dynamics of binaural processing in the mammalian sound localization pathway--the role of GABA(B) receptors |journal=Hearing Research |volume=279 |pages=43–50 |year=2011 |pmid=21447375 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.013 |issue=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound segregation refers the ability to identify acoustic components from one or more sound sources.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Andrew |last2=McDermott |first2=Josh |title=Spatial cues alone produce inaccurate sound segregation: The effect of inter aural time differences |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=132 |pages=357–368 |year=2012 |doi=10.1121/1.4718637|pmc=3407160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binaural auditory system is highly dynamic and capable of rapidly adjusting tuning properties depending on the context in which sounds are heard. Each [[eardrum]] moves one-dimensionally; the auditory [[brain]] analyzes and compares movements of both eardrums to extract physical cues and synthesize auditory objects.&lt;ref name="Grothe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stimulation from a [[sound]] reaches the ear, the eardrum deflects in a mechanical fashion, and the three middle ear bones ([[ossicles]]) transmit the mechanical signal to the [[cochlea]], where [[hair cell]]s transform the mechanical signal into an electrical signal. The auditory nerve, also called the [[cochlear nerve]], then transmits [[action potential]]s to the central auditory [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

In binaural fusion, inputs from both ears integrate and fuse to create a complete auditory picture at the [[brainstem]]. Therefore, the signals sent to the central auditory nervous system are representative of this complete picture, integrated information from both ears instead of a single ear.

The binaural squelch effect is a result of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] of the brainstem processing timing, [[amplitude]], and spectral differences between the two ears. Sounds are integrated and then separated into auditory objects. For this effect to take place, neural integration from both sides is required.&lt;ref name="Tyler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tyler |first1=R.S. |last2=Dunn |first2=C.C. |last3=Witt |first3=S.A. |last4=Preece |first4=J.P. |title=Update on bilateral cochlear implantation |journal=Current Opinion in Otolaryngology &amp; Head and Neck Surgery |volume=11 |pages=388–393 |year=2003 |pmid=14502072 |issue=5 |doi=10.1097/00020840-200310000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lateral lemniscus.PNG|thumb|Transmissions from the [[superior olivary complex|SOC]], in the [[pons]] of the [[brainstem]], travel along the [[lateral lemniscus]] to the [[inferior colliculus|IC]], located in the [[midbrain]]. Signals are then relayed to the [[thalamus]] and further ascending auditory pathway.]]
As sound travels into the inner eardrum of [[vertebrate]] [[mammal]]s, it encounters the hair cells that line the [[basilar membrane]] of the cochlea in the [[inner ear]].&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lim |first1=DJ |title=Cochlear anatomy related to cochlear micromechanics.

Am.]]|volume=67 |pages=1686–1695 |year=1980 |pmid=6768784 |issue=5 |doi=10.1121/1.384295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cochlea receives auditory information to be binaurally integrated. At the cochlea, this information is converted into electrical impulses that travel by means of the cochlear nerve, which spans from the cochlea to the [[ventral cochlear nucleus]], which is located in the [[pons]] of the brainstem.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=JK |title=Organization of the human superior olivary complex |journal=Microsc Res Tech |volume=51 |pages=403–412 |year=2000 |pmid=11071722 |doi=10.1002/1097-0029(20001115)51:4&lt;403::AID-JEMT8&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lateral lemniscus]] projects from the [[cochlear nucleus]] to the [[superior olivary complex|superior olivary complex (SOC)]], a set of brainstem nuclei that consists primarily of two nuclei, the [[superior olivary complex#Medial superior olive (MSO)|medial superior olive (MSO)]] and the [[superior olivary complex#Lateral superior olive (LSO)|lateral superior olive (LSO)]], and is the major site of binaural fusion. The subdivision of the ventral cochlear nucleus that concerns binaural fusion is the [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Anterior Ventral Cochlear Nucleus(AVCN)|anterior ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN)]].&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; The AVCN consists of [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Spherical|spherical bushy cells]] and [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Globular|globular bushy cells]] and can also transmit signals to the [[superior olivary complex#Medial Nucleus of Trapezoid Body (MNTB)|medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB)]], whose neuron projects to the MSO. Transmissions from the SOC travel to the [[inferior colliculus|inferior colliculus (IC)]] via the lateral lemniscus. At the level of the IC, binaural fusion is complete. The signal ascends to the thalamocortical system, and sensory inputs to the [[thalamus]] are then relayed to the [[primary auditory cortex]].&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cant"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cant |first1=Nell B |last2=Benson |first2=Christina G |title=Parallel auditory pathways: projection patterns of the different neuronal populations in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei |journal=Brain Research Bulletin |volume=60 |pages=457–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/s0361-9230(03)00050-9 |pmid=12787867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Herrero"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herrero |first1=Maria-Trinidad |last2=Barcia |first2=Carlos |last3=Navarro |first3=Juana Mari |title=Functional anatomy of thalamus and basal ganglia |journal=Child’s Nerv Syst |volume=18 |pages=386–404 |year=2002 |doi=10.1007/s00381-002-0604-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Twefik|first=Ted L|title=Auditory System Anatomy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948643-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The ear functions to analyze and encode a sound’s [[dimension]]s.&lt;ref name="Masterton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Masterton |first1=R.B. |title=Role of the central auditory system in hearing: the new direction |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=15 |pages=280–285 |year=1992 |pmid=1384196 |issue=8 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(92)90077-l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binaural fusion is responsible for avoiding the creation of multiple sound images from a sound source and its reflections. The advantages of this [[phenomenon]] are more noticeable in small rooms, decreasing as the reflective surfaces are placed farther from the listener.&lt;ref name="Litovsky"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Litovsky |first1=R. |last2=Colburn |first2=H. |last3=Yost |first3=W. |title=The Precedence Effect |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=106 |pages=1633–1654 |year=1999 |pmid=10530009 |issue=4 Pt 1 |doi=10.1121/1.427914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central auditory system===
The central auditory system converges inputs from both ears (inputs contain no explicit spatial information) onto single neurons within the brainstem. This system contains many subcortical sites that have integrative functions. The auditory nuclei collect, integrate, and analyze afferent supply,&lt;ref name="Masterton"/&gt; the outcome is a representation of auditory space.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; The subcortical auditory nuclei are responsible for extraction and analysis of dimensions of sounds.&lt;ref name="Masterton"/&gt;

The integration of a sound stimulus is a result of analyzing [[frequency]] (pitch), intensity, and spatial localization of the sound source.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=E. |last2=Perrot |first2=E. |last3=Mertens |first3=P. |title=Functional anatomy of the cochlear nerve and the central auditory system |journal=Neurochirurgie |volume=55 |pages=120–126 |year=2009 |pmid=19304300 |doi=10.1016/j.neuchi.2009.01.017 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a sound source has been identified, the cells of lower [[auditory system|auditory pathways]] are specialized to analyze physical sound parameters.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; [[Summation]] is observed when the loudness of a sound from one stimulus is perceived as having been doubled when heard by both ears instead of only one. This process of summation is called binaural summation and is the result of different acoustics at each ear, depending on where sound is coming from.&lt;ref name="Tyler"/&gt;

The cochlear nerve spans from the cochlea of the inner ear to the ventral cochlear nuclei located in the pons of the brainstem, relaying auditory signals to the superior olivary complex where it is to be binaurally integrated.

===Medial superior olive and lateral superior olive===
The MSO contains cells that function in comparing inputs from the left and right cochlear nuclei.&lt;ref name="Eldredge"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eldredge |first1=D.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.D. |title=Physiology of hearing |journal=Annu. Rev. Physiol. |volume=33 |pages=281–310 |year=1971 |pmid=4951051 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.33.030171.001433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tuning of neurons in the MSO favors low frequencies, whereas those in the LSO favor high frequencies.&lt;ref name="Guinan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guinan |first1=JJ |last2=Norris |first2=BE |last3=Guinan |first3=SS |title=Single auditory units in the superior olivary complex II: Locations of unit categories and tonotopic organization |journal=Internat J Neurosci |volume=4 |pages=147‐166 |year=1972 |doi=10.3109/00207457209164756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GABA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] in the LSO and MSO are involved in balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are coupled to [[G protein]]s and provide a way of regulating synaptic efficacy. Specifically, GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors modulate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the LSO.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; Whether the GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor functions as excitatory or inhibitory for the postsynaptic neuron, depends on the exact location and action of the receptor.&lt;ref name="Grothe2"/&gt;

===Sound localization===
Sound localization is the ability to correctly identify the directional location of sounds. A sound stimulus localized in the [[horizontal plane]] is called [[azimuth]]; in the [[vertical plane]] it is referred to as elevation. The time, intensity, and spectral differences in the sound arriving at the two ears are used in localization. Localization of low frequency sounds is accomplished by analyzing [[interaural time difference|interaural time difference (ITD)]]. Localization of high frequency sounds is accomplished by analyzing [[interaural level difference|interaural level difference (ILD)]].&lt;ref name="Tyler"/&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Binaural hearing===
Action potentials originate in the [[hair cells]] of the [[cochlea]] and propagate to the [[brainstem]]; both the timing of these [[action potentials]] and the signal they transmit provide information to the [[superior olivary complex|SOC]] about the orientation of sound in space. The processing and propagation of action potentials is rapid, and therefore, information about the timing of the sounds that were heard, which is crucial to binaural processing, is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forsythe|first=Ian D.|title=Excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the superior olivary complex|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/symposia/abstracts-2001/Forsythe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each eardrum moves in one dimension, and the auditory brain analyzes and compares the movements of both eardrums in order to synthesize auditory objects.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; This integration of information from both ears is the essence of binaural fusion. The binaural system of hearing involves sound localization in the horizontal plane, contrasting with the monaural system of hearing, which involves sound localization in the vertical plane.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

===Superior olivary complex===
The primary stage of binaural fusion, the processing of binaural signals, occurs at the SOC, where [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent fibers]] of the left and right auditory pathways first converge. This processing occurs because of the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the [[superior olivary complex#Lateral superior olive (LSO)|LSO]] and [[superior olivary complex#Medial superior olive (MSO)|MSO]].&lt;ref name="Grothe2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eldredge"/&gt; The SOC processes and integrates binaural information, in the form of [[interaural time difference|ITD]] and [[interaural level difference|ILD]], entering the brainstem from the cochleae. This initial processing of ILD and ITD is regulated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;ref name="Grothe2"/&gt;

====ITD and ILD====
The auditory space of binaural hearing is constructed based on the analysis of differences in two different binaural cues in the horizontal plane: sound level, or ILD, and arrival time at the two ears, or ITD, which allow for the comparison of the sound heard at each [[eardrum]].&lt;ref name="Grothe2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; ITD is processed in the MSO and results from sounds arriving earlier at one ear than the other; this occurs when the sound does not arise from directly in front or directly behind the hearer. ILD is processed in the LSO and results from the shadowing effect that is produced at the ear that is farther from the sound source. Outputs from the SOC are targeted to the [[lateral lemniscus#DNLL|dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus]] as well as the [[inferior colliculus|IC]].&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

====Lateral superior olive====
LSO neurons are excited by inputs from one ear and inhibited by inputs from the other, and are therefore referred to as IE neurons. Excitatory inputs are received at the LSO from [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Spherical|spherical bushy cells]] of the [[anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|ipsilateral]] cochlear nucleus, which combine inputs coming from several auditory nerve fibers. Inhibitory inputs are received at the LSO from [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Globular|globular bushy cells]] of the [[anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|contralateral]] cochlear nucleus.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

====Medial superior olive====
MSO neurons are excited bilaterally, meaning that they are excited by inputs from both ears, and they are therefore referred to as EE neurons.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; Fibers from the left cochlear nucleus terminate on the left of MSO neurons, and fibers from the right cochlear nucleus terminate on the right of MSO neurons.&lt;ref name="Eldredge"/&gt; Excitatory inputs to the MSO from spherical bushy cells are mediated by [[glutamate]], and inhibitory inputs to the MSO from globular bushy cells are mediated by [[glycine]]. MSO neurons extract ITD information from binaural inputs and resolve small differences in the time of arrival of sounds at each ear.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt; Outputs from the MSO and LSO are sent via the [[lateral lemniscus]] to the IC, which integrates the spatial localization of sound. In the IC, acoustic cues have been processed and filtered into separate streams, forming the basis of auditory object recognition.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

==Binaural fusion abnormalities in autism==
Current research is being performed on the dysfunction of binaural fusion in individuals with [[autism]]. The [[neurological disorder]] autism is associated with many symptoms of impaired brain function, including the degradation of hearing, both unilateral and bilateral.&lt;ref name="Rosenhall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenhall |first1=U |last2=Nordin |first2=V |last3=Sandstrom |first3=M |title=Autism and hearing loss |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=29 |pages=349–357 |year=1999 |pmid=10587881 |issue=5|doi=10.1023/A:1023022709710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with autism who experience hearing loss maintain symptoms such as difficulty listening to background noise and impairments in sound localization. Both the ability to distinguish particular speakers from background noise and the process of sound localization are key products of binaural fusion. They are particularly related to the proper function of the SOC, and there is increasing evidence that [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] abnormalities within the brainstem, namely in the SOC, of autistic individuals are a cause of the hearing difficulties.&lt;ref name="Kulesza"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulesza Jr. |first1=Randy J. |last2=Lukose |first2=Richard |last3=Stevens |first3=Lisa Veith |title=Malformation of the human superior olive in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Brain Research |volume=1367 |pages=360–371 |year=2011 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.015 |pmid=20946889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neurons of the MSO of individuals with autism display atypical anatomical features, including atypical cell shape and orientation of the cell body as well as [[stellate cell|stellate]] and [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] formations.&lt;ref name="Kulesza 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulesza |first1=RJ |last2=Mangunay |first2=K |title=Morphological features of the medial superior olive in autism |journal=Brain Res |volume=1200 |pages=132–137 |year=2008 |pmid=18291353 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data also suggests that neurons of the LSO and [[superior olivary complex#Medial Nucleus of Trapezoid Body|MNTB]] contain distinct [[dysmorphology]] in autistic individuals, such as irregular stellate and fusiform shapes and a smaller than normal size. Moreover, a significant depletion of SOC neurons is seen in the brainstem of autistic individuals. All of these structures play a crucial role in the proper functioning of binaural fusion, so their dysmorphology may be at least partially responsible for the incidence of these auditory symptoms in autistic patients.&lt;ref name="Kulesza"/&gt;

[[File:De mulieribus claris - Camiola paga il riscatto di Orlando.jpg|thumb|Miniature from ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', representing Camiola]]
'''Camiola Turinga''' was from [[Messina]] and was known as a virtuous woman. She was the daughter of Lawrence of [[Thuringia]]. She lived in the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the time of the reign of [[Frederick III of Sicily]]. When her husband and parents died she inherited much wealth and was known for handling this large fortune in a moral fashion.

[[Boccaccio]], as a medieval historian and early Renaissance [[archaeology|archaeologist]], describes the events that happened that lead up to her becoming a widow when she was still a young lady. He says in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' in the next to the last biography that when king [[Frederick III of Sicily]] died, his eldest son Peter took over. Right after that time Godfrey of [[Squillace]], commander for king [[Robert of Sicily]], attacked the town of [[Lipari]]. The townspeople were overwhelmed and practically wiped out. Peter then gathered together an army of [[mercenaries]] and volunteer auxiliary troops. He put them into the command of a Count John of Chiaamonte. John's mission was to bring much needed supplies for the starving people of Lipari.

When Godfrey learned that John's army outnumbered his own, he abandoned his camp and left all his supplies there. John then came upon these supplies and took back to the people of Lipari. Then with overconfidence John challenged Godfrey to battle. Godfrey accepted the challenge. He prepared and reinforced his troops overnight and was fully prepared in the morning. John, being overconfident, did not expect Godfrey to attack, assuming instead that he Godfrey would retreat.

Godfrey's men attacked the Sicilians with much vigor. The Sicilians under John's command were stunned with the onslaught. Hand-to-hand combat took place on the Sicilian ships. The Sicilians ultimately lost confidence, since they were not fully prepared for such an attack. They then took whatever ships were still seaworthy and hightailed it. Many of the Sicilian ships were sunk and victory was within grasp for Godfrey. Even though some of John's ships were able to get away, John himself along with some princes and missionaries, were captured. The town of Lipari surrendered and sued for peace.

The prisoners were then taken to [[Naples]] and jailed. Among the prisoners was [[Roland of Sicily]], an illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily]].  Ransom was paid for all the prisoners, and they were all released, except for one - Roland. King Peter hated his brother and all the others under John's command because of their incompetence and how they handled the attack of Godfrey.

Now enters Camiola. She remembers him when they both were children. Rolan was in prison with no hope of getting out. She saw that Peter and his other brothers were willing to let him rot in jail and wished to do something about this. It turned out that there was no legal way of getting him out - except marrying him! She sent secretly to Roland a proposition on this matter. Roland jumped at the opportunity: anything to be able to get out of jail. In fact, that is all he really wanted and would say and promise anything just to get out. Camiola then legally drew up all the necessary documents and arranged for his release. She had to pay two thousand ounces of silver for his release, which was half her wealth. She handed over the agreed amount to gain his release.

Roland was returned to Messina a free man. Immediately he acted like there was no arrangement of a marriage and had no appreciation for his release. Camiola was totally taken off guard because of his attitude and confronted him. She first diplomatically tried an arrangement for the marriage to take place, however Roland would have nothing to do with it.  Ultimately he was brought up in front of an ecclesiastical judge. She proved to the judge that she had a 
legal and binding signed contract for marriage in return for Roland's release out of prison. She showed to the judge that Roland agreed to this and in return was to marry her for his release out of an otherwise hopeless situation of being imprisoned for the rest of his life.

Upon the judge making the decision that Rolan was wrong in not fulfilling his obligation, he admitted to his mistake however still did not want to marry her. His brothers and friends then got involved and convinced Roland that it was the right thing to do. Roland then decided he would marry her and
came to her with this proposal with his friends. She however at this point gave a lengthy speech. From that time forward, she could not be swayed by either the plebs or reprimands from her high moral standards which she had already shown. Roland, however, was scorned by everyone from then on, including his immediate family.

{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who eventually founded [[pragmatism]], presented a paper entitled "[[s:On a New List of Categories|On a New List of Categories]]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Among other things, this paper outlined a theory of predication involving three universal '''categories''' that Peirce continued to apply in philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. See §9 "Triadism and the Universal Categories".&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed}} In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]"  (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other three-way distinctions in his work.

==The Categories==

In Aristotle's logic, [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] are adjuncts to reasoning that are designed to resolve equivocations, ambiguities that make expressions or signs recalcitrant to being ruled by logic. Categories help the reasoner to render signs ready for the application of logical laws. An equivocation is a variation in meaning — a manifold of sign senses — such that, as Aristotle put it about names in the opening of ''[[Wikisource:Categories|Categories]]'' (1.1&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1–12), "Things are said to be named ‘equivocally’ when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each". So Peirce's claim that three categories are sufficient amounts to an assertion that all manifolds of meaning can be unified in just three steps.

The following passage is critical to the understanding of Peirce's Categories:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will now say a few words about what you have called Categories, but for which I prefer the designation Predicaments, and which you have explained as predicates of predicates.

That wonderful operation of [[hypostatic abstraction]] by which we seem to create ''entia rationis'' that are, nevertheless, sometimes real, furnishes us the means of turning predicates from being signs that we think or think ''through'', into being subjects thought of. We thus think of the thought-sign itself, making it the object of another thought-sign.

Thereupon, we can repeat the operation of hypostatic abstraction, and from these second intentions derive third intentions. Does this series proceed endlessly? I think not. What then are the characters of its different members?

My thoughts on this subject are not yet harvested. I will only say that the subject concerns Logic, but that the divisions so obtained must not be confounded with the different Modes of Being: Actuality, Possibility, Destiny (or Freedom from Destiny).

On the contrary, the succession of Predicates of Predicates is different in the different Modes of Being. Meantime, it will be proper that in our system of diagrammatization we should provide for the division, whenever needed, of each of our three Universes of modes of reality into Realms for the different Predicaments. (Peirce 1906&lt;ref&gt;p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA522,M1 522], "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA473,M1 vol. XVI, no. 4], Oct. 1906, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA523&amp;#PRA3-PA492,M1 492]–546, reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'' vol 4, paragraphs 530–572, see [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm#Paragraph549 paragraph 549]&lt;/ref&gt;).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first thing to extract from this passage is the fact that Peirce's Categories, or "Predicaments", are predicates of predicates. Meaningful predicates have both ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' and ''[[intension]]'', so predicates of predicates get their meanings from at least two sources of information, namely, the classes of relations and the qualities of qualities to which they refer. Considerations like these tend to generate hierarchies of subject matters, extending through what is traditionally called the ''logic of second intentions'',&lt;ref&gt;Such "intentions" are more like [[intension]]s than like aims or purposings.&lt;/ref&gt; or what is handled very roughly by ''[[second order logic]]'' in contemporary parlance, and continuing onward through higher intensions, or ''[[higher order logic]]'' and ''[[type theory]]''.

Peirce arrived at his own system of three categories after a thoroughgoing study of his predecessors, with special reference to the categories of Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel. The names that he used for his own categories varied with context and occasion, but ranged from reasonably intuitive terms like ''quality'', ''reaction'', and ''representation'' to maximally abstract terms like ''firstness'', ''secondness'', and ''thirdness'', respectively. Taken in full generality, ''nth''-ness can be understood as referring to those properties that all ''n''-adic relations have in common. Peirce's distinctive claim is that a type hierarchy of three levels is generative of all that we need in logic.

Part of the justification for Peirce's claim that three categories are both necessary and sufficient appears to arise from mathematical ideas about the [[Relation reduction|reducibility]] of ''n''-adic relations. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA161,M1 161]-217, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA183,M1 p. 183] (via Google Books with registration apparently not required). Reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'', vol. 3, paragraphs 456-552, see paragraph 483.&lt;/ref&gt; (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-[[arity]] ''n''-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations. Others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;* Burch, Robert (1991), ''A Peircean Reduction Thesis: The Foundations of Topological Logic'', Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock, TX

There have been proposals by Donald Mertz, Herbert Schneider, Carl Hausman, and Carl Vaught to augment Peirce's threefolds to fourfolds; and one by Douglas Greenlee to reduce them to twofolds.&lt;ref&gt;For references and discussion, see Burgess, Paul (circa 1988) "Why Triadic?: Challenges to the Structure of Peirce's Semiotic"; posted by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] at ''[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/pr-main.htm#Burgess Arisbe]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce introduces his Categories and their theory in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm "On a New List of Categories" (1867)], a work which is cast as a Kantian deduction and is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.

(The context for interpretants is not psychology or sociology, but instead philosophical logic. In a sense, an interpretant is whatever can be understood as a conclusion of an inference. The context for the categories as categories is phenomenology, which Peirce also called phaneroscopy and categorics.)

{{Neuropsychology|expanded=topics}}
'''Cognitive psychology''' is the study of [[mental process]]es such as "[[attention]], language use, [[memory]], [[perception]], problem solving, [[creativity]], and [[thinking]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx |title=American Psychological Association (2013). Glossary of psychological terms |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines such as Cognitive Science and of psychological study, including [[educational psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[abnormal psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[economics]].

==History==
Philosophically, ruminations of the human mind and its processes have been around since the times of the ancient Greeks. In 387 BCE, [[Plato]] is known to have suggested that the brain was the seat of the mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=Mangels, J. History of neuroscience |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1637, [[René Descartes]] posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;Malone, J.C. (2009). ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 143, b pp. 293, c pp. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; From that time, major debates ensued through the 19th century regarding whether human thought was solely experiential ([[empiricism]]), or included innate knowledge ([[Psychological nativism|nativism]]). Some of those involved in this debate included [[George Berkeley]] and [[John Locke]] on the side of empiricism, and [[Immanuel Kant]] on the side of nativism.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, J.R. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the philosophical debate continuing, the mid to late 19th century was a critical time in the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,&lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt; and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M.W. (1990). ''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (pp. 111)&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas were subsequently formally named for their founders and disruptions of an individual's language production or comprehension due to trauma or malformation in these areas have come to commonly be known as [[Expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]] and [[Receptive aphasia|Wernicke's aphasia]].

From the 1920s to the 1950s, the main approach to psychology was [[behaviorism]]. Initially, its adherents viewed mental events such as thoughts, ideas, attention, and consciousness as unobservables, hence outside the realm of a science of psychology. One pioneer of cognitive psychology, who worked outside the boundaries (both intellectual and geographical) of behaviorism was [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1926 to the 1950s and into the 1980s, he studied the thoughts, language, and intelligence of children and adults.&lt;ref name="AboutPiaget"&gt;Smith, L. (2000). About Piaget. Retrieved from http://piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:
* With the development of new warfare technology during [[World War II|WWII]], the need for a greater understanding of human performance came to prominence. Problems such as how to best train soldiers to use new technology and how to deal with matters of attention while under duress became areas of need for military personnel. [[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon spent years developing the concept of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) and later worked with cognitive psychologists regarding the implications of AI. This encouraged a conceptualization of mental functions patterned on the way that computers handled such things as memory storage and retrieval,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; and it opened an important doorway for [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].
* [[Noam Chomsky]]'s 1959 critique&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1959"&gt;Chomsky, N. A. (1959), ''A Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; of behaviorism, and empiricism more generally, initiated what would come to be known as the "[[cognitive revolution]]". Inside psychology, in criticism of behaviorism, J. S. Bruner, J. J. Goodnow &amp; G. A. Austin wrote "a study of thinking" in 1956. In 1960, G. A. Miller, E. Galanter and K. Pribram wrote their famous "Plans and the Structure of Behavior". The same year, Bruner and Miller founded the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, which institutionalized the revolution and launched the field of cognitive science.
* Formal recognition of the field involved the establishment of research institutions such as [[George Mandler]]'s Center for Human Information Processing in 1964. Mandler described the origins of cognitive psychology in a 2002 article in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences&lt;ref name=Mandler&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Neisser}}[[Ulric Neisser]] put the term "cognitive psychology" into common use through his book ''Cognitive Psychology'', published in 1967.&lt;ref name=Neisser&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). ''Cognitive Psychology''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. Neisser's definition on page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used. It is concerned with these processes even when they operate in the absence of relevant stimulation, as in images and [[hallucinations]]. ... Given such a sweeping definition, it is apparent that cognition is involved in everything a human being might possibly do; that every psychological phenomenon is a cognitive phenomenon. But although cognitive psychology is concerned with all human activity rather than some fraction of it, the concern is from a particular point of view. Other viewpoints are equally legitimate and necessary. [[Psychodynamics|Dynamic psychology]], which begins with motives rather than with sensory input, is a case in point. Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.&lt;ref name=Neisser/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mental processes==
{{see also|Cognitive control}}
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior. Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Attention===
{{main|Attention}}
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"? |url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key function of [[attention]] is to identify irrelevant data and filter it out, enabling significant data to be distributed to the other [[mental processes]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; For example, the human brain may simultaneously receive [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]], [[taste]], and [[Touch|tactile]] information. The brain is able to handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027|pmid=23000534|title=Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=237|pages=107–123|year=2013|last1=Chica|first1=Ana B.|last2=Bartolomeo|first2=Paolo|last3=Lupiáñez|first3=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous control works from bottom-up and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt; Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.&lt;ref name="Chicaetal2013" /&gt;

One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]. A number of early studies dealt with the ability of a person wearing headphones to discern meaningful conversation when presented with different messages into each ear; this is known as the dichotic listening task.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; Key findings involved an increased understanding of the mind's ability to both focus on one message, while still being somewhat aware of information being taken in from the ear not being consciously attended to. E.g., participants (wearing earphones) may be told that they will be hearing separate messages in each ear and that they are expected to attend only to information related to basketball. When the experiment starts, the message about basketball will be presented to the left ear and non-relevant information will be presented to the right ear. At some point the message related to basketball will switch to the right ear and the non-relevant information to the left ear. When this happens, the listener is usually able to repeat the entire message at the end, having attended to the left or right ear only when it was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The ability to attend to one conversation in the face of many is known as the [[cocktail party effect]].

Other major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1907229|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|year=1953|last1=Cherry|first1=E. Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while deep processing doesn't occur, early sensory processing does. Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

===Memory===
The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory. Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]].

====[[Working memory]]====
Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to remember information in the face of distraction. The famously known capacity of memory of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|7 plus or minus 2]] is a combination of both memory in working memory and long term memory.

One of the classic experiments is by Ebbinghaus, who found the [[serial position effect]] where information from the beginning and end of list of random words were better recalled than those in the center.&lt;ref name="Eb"&gt;Ebbinghaus, Hermann (1913). On memory: A contribution to experimental psychology. New York: Teachers College.&lt;/ref&gt; This primacy and recency effect varies in intensity based on list length.&lt;ref name="Eb" /&gt; Its typical U-shaped curve can be disrupted by an attention-grabbing word; this is known as the [[Von Restorff effect]].
[[File:Working-memory-en.svg|thumbnail|The Baddeley &amp; Hitch Model of Working Memory]]
Many models of working memory have been made. One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.

A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]].

====[[Long-term memory]]====
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in nature, in terms of the level of [[conscious]] thought related to their use.&lt;ref name="Balota"&gt;Balota, D.A. &amp; Marsh, E.J. (2004). ''Cognitive Psychology: Key Readings''. New York, NY: Psychology Press. (pp. 364–365)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action. It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc. A person is using [[procedural knowledge]] when they seemingly "automatically" respond in a particular manner to a particular situation or process.&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt; An example is driving a car.
* [[Semantic memory]] is the encyclopedic knowledge that a person possesses. Knowledge like what the [[Eiffel Tower]] looks like, or the name of a friend from sixth grade, represent [[semantic memory]]. Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;
* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated. It contains all memories that are temporal in nature, such as when one last brushed one's teeth or where one was when one heard about a major news event. [[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].&lt;ref name=Balota /&gt;

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses. Essentially, it is how people come to understand the world around them through interpretation of stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/ss/perceptproc.htm Cherry, K. (2013). [[Perception] and the perceptual process]&lt;/ref&gt; Early psychologists like [[Edward Titchener|Edward B. Titchener]] began to work with perception in their [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] approach to psychology. [[Structuralism (psychology)|Structuralism]] dealt heavily with trying to reduce human thought (or "consciousness," as Titchener would have called it) into its most basic elements by gaining understanding of how an individual perceives particular stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/titchener.shtml |title=Plucker, J. (2012). Edward Bradford Titchener |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717212235/http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eintell/titchener.shtml# |archive-date=2014-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current perspectives on [[perception]] within cognitive psychology tend to focus on particular ways in which the human mind interprets stimuli from the senses and how these interpretations affect behavior. An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA). One study at CESPA concerns ways in which individuals perceive their physical environment and how that influences their navigation through that environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970412101520/http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-04-12 |title=University of Connecticut (N.D.). Center for the ecological study of perception |publisher=Ione.psy.uconn.edu |date=2012-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Psychologists have had an interest in the cognitive processes involved with [[language]] that dates back to the 1870s, when [[Carl Wernicke]] proposed a model for the mental processing of language.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Christine M. (1990). "Developments and applications of cognitive neuropsychology." In M. W. Eysenck (Ed.)''Cognitive Psychology: An International Review''. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Current work on [[language]] within the field of cognitive psychology varies widely. Cognitive psychologists may study [[language acquisition]],&lt;ref name="Ramsden"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-012-9208-z|pmid=22707315|title=Language Development and Assessment in the Preschool Period|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=384–401|year=2012|last1=Conti-Ramsden|first1=Gina|last2=Durkin|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual components of [[language]] formation (like [[phoneme]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.4000/cognitextes.211|title=The phoneme in cognitive phonology: Episodic memories of both meaningful and meaningless units?|journal=Cognitextes|issue=2|year=2009|last1=Välimaa-Blum|first1=Riitta}}&lt;/ref&gt; how language use is involved in [[Mood (psychology)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpi.nl/departments/other-research/research-projects/language-in-action/subprojects/Mood-and-language-comprehension |title=Berkum, J.

Significant work has been done recently with regard to understanding the timing of [[language acquisition]] and how it can be used to determine if a child has, or is at risk of, developing a [[learning disability]]. A study from 2012, showed that while this can be an effective strategy, it is important that those making evaluations include all relevant information when making their assessments. Factors such as individual variability, [[socioeconomic status]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]] capacity, and others must be included in order to make valid assessments.&lt;ref name="Ramsden" /&gt;

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts. More specifically, metacognition includes things like:
* How effective a person is at monitoring their own performance on a given task (self-regulation).
* A person's understanding of their capabilities on particular mental tasks.
* The ability to apply [[Cognitive style|cognitive strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Martinez |first=M. E. |year=2006 |title=What is metacognition |journal=The Phi Delta Kappan |volume=87 |issue=9 |pages=696–699 |jstor=20442131}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the current study regarding metacognition within the field of cognitive psychology deals with its application within the area of education. Being able to increase a student's metacognitive abilities has been shown to have a significant impact on their learning and study habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.brainscape.com/2010/04/learning-study-less/ |title=Cohen, A. (2010). The secret to learning more while studying |publisher=Blog.brainscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/metacognition/teaching_metacognition.html |title=Lovett, M. (2008). Teaching metacognition |publisher=Serc.carleton.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common phenomena related to metacognition include:
*'''[[Déjà Vu]]:''' feeling of a repeated experience
*'''Cryptomnesia:''' generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience, aka unconscious plagiarism.
*'''False Fame Effect:''' non-famous names can be made to be famous
*'''[[illusory truth effect|Validity effect]]:''' statements seem more valid upon repeated exposure
*'''[[Imagination inflation]]:''' imagining an event that did not occur and having increased confidence that it did occur

==Modern==
Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a [[dual process theory]], expounded upon by [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=Kahneman&gt;Kahneman D. (2003) "A perspective on judgement and choice." ''American Psychologist''. ''58'', 697–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.&lt;ref name=Kahneman /&gt;

==Applications==

===Abnormal psychology===
Following the cognitive revolution, and as a result of many of the principle discoveries to come out of the field of cognitive psychology, the discipline of cognitive therapy evolved. [[Aaron T. Beck]] is generally regarded as the father of cognitive therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |title=University of Pennsylvania (N.D). Aaron T. Beck, M.D |publisher=Med.upenn.edu |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2014-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094322/http://www.med.upenn.edu/suicide/beck/index.html |archive-date=2017-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in the areas of recognition and treatment of depression has gained worldwide recognition. In his 1987 book titled ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression'', Beck puts forth three salient points with regard to his reasoning for the treatment of depression by means of therapy or therapy and antidepressants versus using a pharmacological-only approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Despite the prevalent use of antidepressants, the fact remains that not all patients respond to them. Beck cites (in 1987) that only 60 to 65% of patients respond to antidepressants, and recent [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] (a statistical breakdown of multiple studies) show very similar numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John M. |url=http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2009/02/03/efficacy-of-antidepressants/ |title=Grohol, J. (2009). Efficacy of Antidepressants |publisher=Psychcentral.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Many of those who do respond to antidepressants end up not taking their medications, for various reasons. They may develop side-effects or have some form of personal objection to taking the drugs.&lt;br&gt;3. Beck posits that the use of [[Psychotropic|psychotropic drugs]] may lead to an eventual breakdown in the individual's [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanisms]]. His theory is that the person essentially becomes reliant on the medication as a means of improving mood and fails to practice those coping techniques typically practiced by healthy individuals to alleviate the effects of depressive symptoms. By failing to do so, once the patient is weaned off of the antidepressants, they often are unable to cope with normal levels of depressed mood and feel driven to reinstate use of the antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T. (1987). ''Cognitive Therapy of Depression''. New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social psychology===
Many facets of modern social psychology have roots in research done within the field of cognitive psychology.{{Citation needed|reason=The reverse is also true, and the page linked in the next sentence also has a citation needed tag related to the link between social cognition and cognitive psychology.|date=November 2017}} [[Social cognition]] is a specific sub-set of social psychology that concentrates on processes that have been of particular focus within cognitive psychology, specifically applied to human interactions. [[Gordon Moskowitz|Gordon B. Moskowitz]] defines social cognition as "... the study of the mental processes involved in perceiving, attending to, remembering, thinking about, and making sense of the people in our social world".&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G.B. (2004). ''Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others''. New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (pp. 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of multiple [[social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (SIP) models  has been influential in studies involving aggressive and anti-social behavior. Kenneth Dodge's SIP model is one of, if not the most, empirically supported models relating to aggression. Among his research, Dodge posits that children who possess a greater ability to process social information more often display higher levels of socially acceptable behavior. His model asserts that there are five steps that an individual proceeds through when evaluating interactions with other individuals and that how the person interprets cues is key to their reactionary process.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, R.G. (2012). ''The Mind of the Criminal: The Role of Developmental Social Cognition in Criminal Defense Law''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. (p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental psychology===
Many of the prominent names in the field of developmental psychology base their understanding of development on cognitive models. One of the major paradigms of developmental psychology, the [[Theory of Mind]] (ToM), deals specifically with the ability of an individual to effectively understand and attribute cognition to those around them. This concept typically becomes fully apparent in children between the ages of 4 and 6. Essentially, before the child develops ToM, they are unable to understand that those around them can have different thoughts, ideas, or feelings than themselves. The development of ToM is a matter of [[metacognition]], or thinking about one's thoughts. The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W. &amp; Edward, M.J. (2010). The development of theory of mind in early childhood. Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development, 2010:1–6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One of the foremost minds with regard to developmental psychology, Jean Piaget, focused much of his attention on cognitive development from birth through adulthood. Though there have been considerable challenges to parts of his [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of cognitive development]], they remain a staple in the realm of education. Piaget's concepts and ideas predated the cognitive revolution but inspired a wealth of research in the field of cognitive psychology and many of his principles have been blended with modern theory to synthesize the predominant views of today.&lt;ref&gt;Brainerd, C.J. (1996). "Piaget: A centennial celebration." ''Psychological Science'', 7(4), 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational psychology===
Modern theories of education have applied many concepts that are focal points of cognitive psychology. Some of the most prominent concepts include:
* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking. A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.&lt;ref name="Reif"&gt;Reif, F. (2008). ''Applying Cognitive Science to Education: Thinking and Learning in Scientific and Other Complex Domains''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press. (a pp. 283–84, b pp. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks. The application of these cognitive paradigms to education attempts to augment a student's ability to integrate declarative knowledge into newly learned procedures in an effort to facilitate accelerated learning.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;
* [[Knowledge organization]]: Applications of cognitive psychology's understanding of how knowledge is organized in the brain has been a major focus within the field of education in recent years. The hierarchical method of organizing information and how that maps well onto the brain's memory are concepts that have proven extremely beneficial in classrooms.&lt;ref name="Reif" /&gt;

===Personality psychology===
Cognitive therapeutic approaches have received considerable attention in the treatment of personality disorders in recent years. The approach focuses on the formation of what it believes to be faulty schemata, centralized on judgmental biases and general cognitive errors.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, A.T., Freeman, A., &amp; Davis, D.D. (2004). ''Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford Press. (pp. 300).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive psychology vs. cognitive science==
The line between cognitive psychology and [[cognitive science]] can be blurry. The differentiation between the two is best understood in terms of cognitive psychology's relationship to [[applied psychology]], and the understanding of psychological phenomena. Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley, A. &amp; Bernses, O.A. (1989). ''Cognitive Psychology: Research Directions In Cognitive Science: European Perspectives'', Vol 1 (pp. 7). East Sussex, UK: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Ltd. (pg. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The information gained in this area is then often used in the applied field of clinical psychology.

Cognitive science is better understood as predominantly concerned with gathering data through research. Cognitive science envelopes a much broader scope, which has links to philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and particularly with artificial intelligence. It could be said that cognitive science provides the database of information that fuels the theory from which cognitive psychologists operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ |title=Thagard, P. (2010). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientists' research sometimes involves non-human subjects, allowing them to delve into areas which would come under ethical scrutiny if performed on human participants. I.e., they may do research implanting devices in the brains of rats to track the firing of neurons while the rat performs a particular task. Cognitive science is highly involved in the area of artificial intelligence and its application to the understanding of mental processes.

==Criticisms==
In the early years of cognitive psychology, [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. [[Cognitive neuroscience]], however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Howard |title=Changing Minds |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard Business School Publishing |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-1-4221-0329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers have suggested that as cognitive psychology became a movement during the 1970s, the intricacies of the phenomena and processes it examined meant it also began to lose cohesion as a field of study. In ''Psychology: Pythagoras to Present'', for example, John Malone writes: "Examinations of late twentieth-century textbooks dealing with "cognitive psychology", "human cognition", "cognitive science" and the like quickly reveal that there are many, many varieties of cognitive psychology and very little agreement about exactly what may be its domain."&amp;#8201;&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;  This misfortune produced competing models that questioned information-processing approaches to cognitive functioning such as [[Naturalistic decision-making|Decision Making]] and [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences|Behavioral Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2781">In [[electronics]], ''' The common mode rejection ratio''' ('''CMRR''') of a [[differential amplifier]] (or other device) is a [[wiktionary:metric#Noun|metric]] used to quantify the ability of the device to reject common-mode signals, i.e., those that appear simultaneously and in-phase on both inputs. An ideal differential amplifier would have infinite CMRR, however this is not achievable in practice. A high CMRR is required when a differential signal must be amplified in the presence of a possibly large common-mode input, such as strong [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). An example is audio transmission over [[balanced line]] in [[sound reinforcement]] or [[sound recording|recording]].

== Theory ==

Ideally, a differential amplifier takes the voltages, &lt;math&gt;V_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; on its two inputs and produces an output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{o}=A_\mathrm{d}(V_+ - V_-)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential gain. However, the output of a real differential amplifier is better described as
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{o}} = A_\mathrm{d} (V_+ - V_-) + \tfrac{1}{2} A_\mathrm{cm} (V_+ + V_-)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the common-"mode gain", which is typically much smaller than the [[differential gain]].

The CMRR is defined as the ratio of the [[Power (physics)|powers]] of the differential gain over the common-mode gain, measured in positive [[decibel]]s (thus using the [[20 log rule]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CMRR} = \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) = 10\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{A_\mathrm{cm}} \right)^2 \text{dB} = 20\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) \text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;

As differential gain should exceed common-mode gain, this will be a positive number, and the higher the better.

The CMRR is a very important specification, as it indicates how much of the [[common-mode signal]] will appear in your measurement. The value of the CMRR often depends on signal [[frequency]] as well, and must be specified as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] thereof.

It is often important in reducing noise on transmission lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, when measuring the resistance of a [[thermocouple]] in a noisy environment, the [[signal noise|noise]] from the environment appears as an offset on both input leads, making it a common-mode [[voltage]] signal. The CMRR of the measurement instrument determines the [[attenuation]] applied to the offset or noise.

'''Comparison diagram''' or '''comparative diagram''' is a general type of [[diagram]], in which a comparison is made between two or more objects, phenomena or groups of data.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Commission Resources, Inc (2002). ''Tools for Performance Measurement in Health Care: A Quick Reference Guide.'' p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison diagram or can offer qualitative and/or quantitative information. This type of diagram can also be called '''comparison chart''' or '''comparison chart.''' The diagram itself is sometimes referred to as a [[cluster diagram]].

== Overview ==
A comparison diagram is a general type of diagram, meaning a class of specific diagrams and charts, in which a comparison is made between two or more objects, phenomena or groups of data. They are a tool for [[visual comparison]].

When it comes to comparing data, five basic types of comparison can be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Fill, Hans-Georg. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=tXHA1J-ankYC&amp;pg=PA62 Survey of Existing Visualisation Approaches]." in ''Visualisation for Semantic Information Systems.'' Gabler, 2009. 39-159.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comparison of components, for example the pieces of [[pie chart]]
* Item comparison, for example the bars in a [[bar chart]]  
* Time-series comparison, for example the bars in a [[histogram]] or the curve of a [[line chart]]
* Frequency distribution comparison, for example the distribution in a histogram or line chart
* Correlation comparison, for example in a specific [[dot diagram]]

Comparison diagrams can be used in [[research]] projects, to give an overview of existing possibilities and to [[Data validation|validate]] models.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Karl E. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JD900719/pdf Summarizing multiple aspects of model performance in a single diagram]." ''Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres'' (1984–2012) 106.D7 (2001): 7183-7192.  &lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in [[decision making]] in presenting alternatives for further selection. And it can be used in [[education]] to show the variety in a specific population.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Groessen Karte von Europa, 1785.jpg|thumb|Map with the sizes of European countries by [[August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome|August Crome]], 1785.]]
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgemälde der Tropenländer - 000012142.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Ideas for a geography of plants, together with a nature paintings of the tropics,''  1805.]] 
Comparison charts originate from the late 18th century and early 19th century. One of its roots are the 18th century [[nautical chart]], which could offer a comparison of shore or coastal profiles. These were made popular by the English cartographer and a publisher of maps [[William Faden]] (1749–1836).&lt;ref name="JAW 2009"&gt; Wolter, J. A., “[http://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2009/9/5/heights-of-mountains-lengths-of-rivers The Heights of Mountains and the Lengths of Rivers]”. at davidrumsey.com/blog, 2009/9/5&lt;/ref&gt;

Another root of comparison diagrams are the earliest [[thematic map]]s. Late 18th century [[August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome]] published one of the first economic thematic map.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friendly, Michael]], and Daniel J. Denis. "[http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization]." ''Seeing Science: Today American Association for the Advancement of Science'' (2008). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Anson, [[:nl:Ferdinand Jan Ormeling sr.|F. J. Ormeling]], International Cartographic Association (1993). ''Basic cartography for students and technicians.'' Vol. 1. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His "Groessen Karte von Europa" from 1785 compared the sizes of all then existing European countries. This work inspired later scientist, such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone,Charles W. J. Withers. ''Geography and Enlightenment.'' 2010. p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke (2000), ''Medical History: Supplement.'' Nr. 20, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Dupin]] in France.&lt;ref name="GP 2007"&gt;[[Palsky, Gilles]]. "[http://belgeo.revues.org/11893?lang=en Connections and Exchanges in European Thematic Cartography. The case of XIXth century choropleth maps]." ''Formatting Europe. Mapping a continent.'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in their works. In France in 1872 [[Charles Louis de Fourcroy]] presented a similar diagram, which he named "Table Poléométrique" (Poleometric Table).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Palsky]] (1996): ''Des Chiffres et des Cartes,'' p.51-52; Translated by Daniel J. Denis. "[http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/fourcroy.html Des Cartes Generates Aux Cartes Spectates]" at ''euclid.psych.yorku.ca,'' April 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] was one of the first to picture various cross sections of mountains, including for example the "limit of perpetual snows at different latitudes," or the different kinds of vegetation on different heights.&lt;ref&gt;Debarbieux, Bernard. "[http://cybergeo.revues.org/25488?lang=en The various figures of Mountains in Humboldt’s Science and Rhetoric]." Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this work was published in the 1914 "Atlas géographique et physique des régions équinoxiales du nouveau continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b20000745 Illustrations de Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, première partie]. in ''Relation historique. Atlas géographique et physique du nouveau continent.'' at gallica.bnf.fr. Accessed 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1805 Von Humboldt had published a map (see image), entitled "Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgemälde der Tropenländer" (Ideas for a geography of plants, together with a nature paintings of the tropics) in which he made a comparison of the different types of plans in the tropics, and the heights on which they grew.

=== First comparative charts ===
[[File:1817 Thomson Map of the Comparative Heights of the World's Great Mountains - Geographicus - ComparativeMountains-thomson-1817.jpg|thumb|Thomson's Map of the Comparative Heights of the World's Great Mountains, 1817]]
In the 1810s the first formal comparative mountains charts emerged. Early examples are:
* Charles Smith's ''Comparative View of the Heights of the Principal Mountains &amp;c. In The World,'' published in London in 1816&lt;ref name="JAW 2009"/&gt;
* [[John Thomson (cartographer)|John Thomson]]'s ''A Comparative View of the Heights of the Principal Mountains and other Elevations in the World.'' published in the 1817 edition of Thomson's ''New General Atlas.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographicus.com/blog/rare-and-antique-maps/the-evolution-of-the-comparative-mountains-and-rivers-chart-in-the-19th-century/ The Evolution of the Comparative Mountains and Rivers Chart in the 19th Century] at ''geographicus.com''. Accessed Nov. 4, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1826 Finley Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World - Geographicus - Rivers-finley-1827.jpg|thumb|Finley's ''Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World,'' 1826.]]
Another popular subject became the comparative views of the lengths of the principal rivers in one country or from all over the world. In 1822 [[William Home Lizars]] presented a map, entitled "Comparative View of the Lengths of the Principal Rivers of Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1822_-_William_Home_Lizars_-_Comparative_View_of_the_Lengths_of_the_Principal_Rivers_of_Scotland.jpg "Comparative View of the Lengths of the Principal Rivers of Scotland."] by William Home Lizars, 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1826 
Anthony Finley (1790–1840) published a "Comparative Map of the Principle Rivers of the World." 

Other types of comparison charts would soon appear. For example, the "Comprehensive atlas: geographical, historical &amp; commercial," published by [[William D. Ticknor]] in 1835 contained a series of different comparison diagrams and charts on:&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Thomas Gamaliel.'' [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24189772M/Comprehensive_atlas Comprehensive A Comprehensive Atlas: Geographical, Historical, &amp; Commercial]. JH Wilkins &amp; RB Carter., 1835.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Size of Continents, Oceans, Islands
* Heights of Mountains 
* Lengths of Rivers 
* Size of animal 
* Size of planets 
* Heights of monuments 
* Height of edifices
* Different countries
Other popular themes in 19th century comparison diagrams were the sizes of lakes, the lengths of waterfalls, and the sizes of Islands.

One of the first maps to compare the lengths of rivers was the "Map of the Principal Rivers Throughout the World. Comparative Lengths of the Principal Rivers throughout the World." by the political economist [[Henry Charles Carey]] and [[Isaac Lea]] published their 1822 "A Complete Historical, Chronological, and Geographical American Atlas."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~774~70048:Principal-Rivers-Throughout-The-Wor here]&lt;/ref&gt; In this maps the lengths of the rivers, were presented in a [[bar chart]] with horizontal bars. In 1826 the same data was presented in a bar chart with vertical bars, entitled "Table of the comparative lengths of the principal Rivers throughout the World" (see image).  

=== 20th century ===
In his ''Graphic methods for presenting facts.'' [[Willard C. Brinton]] was one of the first to theorize about the existence and role or comparison in [[statistical graphics]]. He stipulated that "the graphic method lends itself admirably to use in making comparisons. It is surprising how much clearer even simple comparisons of only two or three items will appear when their numerical value is put in graphic form rather than in figures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Brinton, Willard Cope]]. ''Graphic methods for presenting facts.'' Engineering magazine company, 1917. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Brinton showed over a dozen different types of diagrams, which could make simple comparison, and devoted another chapter on comparisons over time.

== Types of comparison diagrams ==
There are different types of comparison diagrams called comparison diagram/chart in theory and practice, such as
* [[Table (information)|Table]], data visualized in a tabular form
* Matrix based models, for example the [[balanced scorecard]]
* Quantitative charts such as [[line chart]], [[bar chart]], [[pie chart]], [[radar chart]], [[bubble chart]], [[scatter diagram]] etc. 
* Scale comparison diagram
* Comparison map or comparative map.

'''Conch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|,_|k|ɒ|n|tʃ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/64/C007/051.html § 51. conch.no 7. Pronunciation Challenges. The American Heritage Book of English Usage. 1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wells, John C. (2016) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bxviDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=conchology Sounds Fascinating: Further Observations on English Phonetics and Phonology]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[common name]] that is applied to a number of different medium to large-sized [[gastropod shell|shells]]. The term generally applies to large snails whose shell has a high [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] and a noticeable [[siphonal canal]] (in other words, the shell comes to a noticeable point at both ends).

In [[North America]], a conch is often identified as a [[Lobatus gigas|queen conch]], found off the coast of [[Florida]]. Queen conchs are valued for fish bait, and are also known as seafood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Animals|last=Walters|first=Martin|last2=Johnson|first2=Jinny|publisher=Marks and Spencer|year=2003|isbn=978-1-84273-964-8|location=|pages=61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of conchs that are sometimes referred to as "true conchs" are [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Strombidae]], specifically in the genus '''''[[Strombus]]''''' and other closely related genera. For example, see ''[[Lobatus gigas]]'', the queen conch, and ''[[Laevistrombus canarium]]'', the dog conch.

Many other species are also often called "conch", but are not at all closely related to the family Strombidae, including ''[[Melongena]]'' species (family [[Melongenidae]]), and the horse conch ''[[Triplofusus papillosus]]'' (family [[Fasciolariidae]]). Species commonly referred to as conchs also include the sacred chank or more correctly [[shankha]] shell (''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'') and other ''Turbinella'' species in the family [[Turbinellidae]]. 

==Etymology==
The English word ''conch'' is attested in [[Middle English]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conch|title=Definition of CONCH|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming from [[Latin]] ''concha'' (shellfish, [[mussel]]),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=conch|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from Greek ''konchē'' (same meaning)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European root|PIE root]] ''*konkho-'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; cognate with Sanskrit ''śaṅkha.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Food==

[[File:Large eastern conch.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A group of large eastern conchs or [[whelk]]s of the species ''[[Busycotypus canaliculatus]]'' for sale at a California seafood market]]
The meat of conchs is eaten raw in [[salad]]s, or cooked, as in burgers, [[chowder]]s, [[fritter]]s, and [[gumbo]]s. All parts of the conch meat are edible.&lt;ref name="conchasfood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/artconch.html|title= Conch}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conch is most indigenous to [[the Bahamas]], and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. In addition to the Bahamas, conch is also eaten in the [[West Indies]] ([[Jamaica]] in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews and curries. Restaurants all over the islands serve this particular meat. In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], and [[Haiti]], conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as ''lambi''. In [[the Turks and Caicos Islands]], the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queens Bar/Restaurant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for the best and most original conch dishes, that are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling of the dishes follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conchfestival.com Turks &amp; Caicos Conch Festival].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Puerto Rico]], conch is served as a [[ceviche]], often called ''ensalada de carrucho'' (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions. It is also used to fill [[empanada]]s.

In [[Panama]], conch is known as ''cambombia'' and is often served as a [[ceviche]] known as ''ceviche de cambombia'' consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, chopped onions, finely chopped [[habanero]]s, and often vinegar.

Conch is very popular in [[Italy]] and among [[Italian Americans]]. Called ''scungille'' (pl. ''scungilli'') is eaten in a variety of ways, but most often in salads or cooked in a sauce for pasta. It is often included as one of the dishes prepared for the [[Feast of the Seven Fishes]].  

In East Asian cuisines, this [[seafood]] is often cut into thin slices and then [[Steaming|steamed]] or [[stir-frying|stir-fried]].

==Musical instruments==
{{main article|Conch (instrument)}}
Conch shells can be used as [[wind instrument]]s. They are prepared by cutting a hole in the [[spire (mollusc)|spire]] of the shell near the [[apex (mollusc)|apex]], and then blowing into the shell as if it were a trumpet, as in [[blowing horn]]. Sometimes a mouthpiece is used, but some shell trumpets are blown without one. Pitch is adjusted by moving one's hand in and out of the aperture; the deeper the hand, the lower the note.

Various species of large marine [[gastropod shell]]s can be turned into "blowing shells", but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or [[shankha]] ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'', the Triton's trumpet ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'', and the queen conch ''[[Strombus gigas]]''.

==Pearls==
Many different kinds of mollusks can produce [[pearl]]s. Pearls from the queen conch, ''L. gigas'', are rare and have been collectors' items since Victorian times.&lt;ref name="skira.net"&gt;{{cite book|year=2007|first=Hubert|last=Bari|isbn=978-8861300132|publisher=Skira|title=Pink Pearl: A Natural Treasure of the Caribbean|id= {{ASIN|8861300138|country=ca}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conch pearls occur in a range of hues, including white, brown and orange, with many intermediate shades, but pink is the colour most associated with the conch pearl, such that these pearls are sometimes referred to simply as "pink pearls".&lt;ref name="skira.net"/&gt; In some gemological texts, non-nacreous gastropod pearls used to be referred to as "calcareous concretions" because they were "porcellaneous" (shiny and ceramic-like in appearance), rather than "nacreous" (with a pearly lustre), sometimes known as "orient". The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term "pearl"—or, where appropriate, the more descriptive term "non-nacreous pearl"—when referring to such items,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giathai.net/pdf/05-15-07%20CIBJO%20Pearl%20Blue%20Book%20-%202007.pdf CIBJO 'Pearl Book']. ''Giathai.net''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gia.edu/gemsandgemology/620/30177/this_weeks_news_details.cfm GIA ''Gems &amp; Gemology'' magazine news archive]. ''Gia.edu''.&lt;/ref&gt; and under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusc pearls may be referred to as "pearls" without qualification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/guides/jewel-gd.shtm Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals, and Pewter Industries]. ''FTC.gov''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-nacreous, the surface of fine conch pearls has a unique and attractive appearance of its own. The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of microcrystalline fibres that create a shimmering, slightly [[iridescence|iridescent]] effect known as "flame structure". The effect is a form of [[chatoyancy]], caused by the interaction of light rays with the microcrystals in the pearl's surface, and it somewhat resembles [[Moire (fabric)|moiré]] silk.

[[File:Hindu priest blowing conch during punja.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A Hindu priest blowing a ''shankha'' (a shell of ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'') during a [[Puja (Hinduism)|''puja'']]]]
[[File:MET 244331.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[india]], Carved Conch with Lakshmi-Narayana,11th-12th century]]

A ''shankha'' shell (the shell of a ''[[Turbinella pyrum]]'', a species in the gastropod family ''[[Turbinellidae]]'') is often referred to in the West as a conch shell, or a chank shell. This shell is used as an important ritual object in [[Hinduism]]. The shell is used as a ceremonial trumpet, as part of religious practices, for example [[Puja (Hinduism)|''puja'']]. The chank trumpet is sounded during worship at specific points, accompanied by ceremonial bells and singing. As it is an auspicious instrument, it is often played in a ''[[Lakshmi]] puja'' in temple or at home.

In the story of [[Dhruva]], the divine conch plays a special part. The warriors of ancient [[India]] blew conch shells to announce battle, as is described in the beginning of the war of Kurukshetra, in the [[Mahabharata]], the famous Hindu epic.

The god of preservation, [[Vishnu]], is said to hold a special conch, Panchajanya, that represents life, as it has come out of life-giving waters.There is an interesting story behind the origin of a "the shankha" or conch shell.According to Hindu mythology, [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s (Gods) and [[Asuras]] (Demons) once decided to churn the ocean in order to get a special divine nectar. This divine nectar also known as "Amrit" was known to give immortality to whoever drank it. All the Gods were on one side of it and the Demons were on the other end. The Samudra Manthan produced a number of things from the Ocean. One of the first things to come out of it was lethal poison called [[Halahala]].Everyone was terrified as the poison was potent enough to destroy entire creation. So they went to Lord Shiva for protection and he consumed the poison to safeguard the universe. Lord Shiva took the poison in his mouth but did not swallow it. Later some additional objects came out of the ocean like Lakshmi (goddess of prosperity and beauty), Goddess of wine, Moon, divine Nymphs like Rambha- and Menakha, Uchhaishravas the divine seven headed White horse, Kaustubha a jewel, Parijata the celestial tree, Surabhi the cow of plenty, Airavata a white elephant, Dhanus a mighty bow and many more such things were produced. "Shankha" or conch shell also was one of divine objects that was obtained from [[Samudra manthan]].

Also, the sound of the conch is believed to drive away the evil spirits.
The blowing of the conch or "the ''shankha''" needs a tremendous power and respiratory capacity. Hence, blowing it daily helps keep the lungs healthy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A newly wed Bengali bride wears bangles called Shakha Paula, made from coral and conch shell powder. They have been a part of Bengali custom and tradition. It is believed that in ancient era, the Bengali farming community resided near the river. They collected conch shells and powdered to create bangles. They also used red coral for the bangles. They gifted these beautiful bangles to their wives as they could not afford ivory bangles.They were also known as poor man's ivory as they were cheap substitute for ivory bangles.&lt;ref name="storify.com"/&gt;

==Literature and the oral tradition==
* The famous Old English [[riddle]] ''Ic wæs be Sonde'' describes a conch: "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt alone in my first resting place... Little did I know that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." Another meaning given to this riddle "Ic wæs be Sonde" is that the sound of the conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with [[music of the spheres]].
* [[William Golding]]'s novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954) features frequent references to "the conch". In the book, the conch is used as a trumpet to call everyone together and held by whoever is speaking at meetings, symbolically representing democracy and order. The conch is seen as a delicate and beautiful object to represent this concept, although its fragility is shown when it "exploded into a thousand white fragments and ceased to exist".
* In [[Prakrit]] poetry, the conch (शंख; ''shankha'') has an erotic connotation:

::Look,
::::a still, quiet crane
::::shines on a lotus leaf
::::like a conch shell lying 
::::on a flawless emerald plate.

:::: —[[Hāla]]'s ''gāhā sattasaī'' 1.4; tr. M. Selby

* [[Ostional]], a [[pueblo]] in the municipality of [[San Juan del Sur]] in the [[Rivas Department]] of the southwest region of [[Nicaragua]], by accounts of multiple [[testimonial]]s in the local region, was founded by their ancestors because of an abundant conch population at the sea shore. Subsequently, the [[tribe]] used conch shells in many rituals and customs. In 2008, witnesses at local archaeological digs reported conch shells were found in the graves of some indigenous people in their recently rediscovered [[cemetery]] grounds. Some still maintained jade stones, implying the significance of conch shells within their tribal society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

A '''diplomatic gift''' is a [[gift]] given by a [[diplomat]], politician or leader when visiting a foreign country. Usually the gift is reciprocated by the host. The use of diplomatic gifts dates back to the ancient world and givers have competed to outdo each other in the lavishness of their gifts. Examples include silks given to the West by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in the [[early Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name=Muth&gt;"Silken diplomacy" by Anna Muthesius in Shepard J. &amp; Franklin, Simon.

Aldershot: Variorum, pp. 249-260.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[panda diplomacy]] by the Chinese in the twentieth century.

==The Middle Ages==

==Nineteenth century==
After the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814–15), [[Rundell and Bridge|Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell]], goldsmiths to the British royal family and government, prepared 22 [[Snuff box|snuff-boxes]] to a value of 1000 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] each to be given as diplomatic gifts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcia Pointon]], "Surrounded with brilliants: Miniature portraits in eighteenth century England", ''[[The Art Bulletin]]'', Vol. 83, No. 1, (March 2001), pp. 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missteps==
Diplomatic gifts have the potential to seal international friendships, but also to be rebuffed, to seem mismatched, or to accidentally send the wrong message. Taiwan rejected the People's Republic of China's offer of a Panda&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/taiwan/1513878/Were-not-wild-about-your-pandas-China-told.html We're not wild about your pandas, China told] by Richard Spencer, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 24 March 2006. Retrieved 17 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the gifts given by British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] to President Obama in 2009 were widely seen as more thoughtful than those given by Obama to Brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1159627/To-special-friend-Gordon-25-DVDs-Obama-gives-Brown-set-classic-movies-Lets-hope-likes-Wizard-Oz.html To my special friend Gordon, 25 DVDs: Obama gives Brown a set of classic movies. Let's hope he likes the Wizard of Oz] by Ian Drury, ''[[The Daily Mail|Mail Online]]'', 6 March 2009. Retrieved 17 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 gift of a "British" table tennis table to President Obama seemed ideal until it was revealed that it was designed in Britain but made in China, evoking worries about the decline of British manufacturing industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9151444/David-Camerons-table-tennis-table-gift-to-Barack-Obama-made-in-China.html David Cameron's table tennis table gift to Barack Obama made in China] by James Orr, ''The Telegraph'', 18 March 2012.

In [[general relativity]], the  '''gravitoelectric tensor''' or '''[[tidal tensor]]''' is one of the pieces in the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].   It is physically interpreted as giving the tidal stresses on small bits of a material object (which may also be acted upon by other physical forces), or the tidal accelerations of a small cloud of [[test particle]]s in a [[vacuum solution]] or [[electrovacuum solution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9419">The '''exhausted combination doctrine''', also referred to as the '''doctrine of the''' '''''Lincoln Engineering''''' '''case''', is the doctrine of [[U.S. patent law]] that when an inventor invents a [[novelty (patent)|new]], [[non-obviousness|unobvious]] device and seeks to patent not merely the new device but also the combination of the new device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated, the combination is unpatentable as an "exhausted combination" or "old combination".&lt;ref&gt;For example, consider the invention of a new microprocessor, which is patentable in its own right. Suppose that the inventor seeks to patent computers containing the new microprocessor, where the microprocessor cooperates with the other elements of the computers in the same conventional way that microprocessors have previously cooperated with the other elements of computers. The computer with the new microprocessor would be an exhausted combination. This hypothetical case is based on the facts of the recent [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the ''Lincoln Engineering'' case because the [[United States Supreme Court]] explained the doctrine in its decision in ''Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/303/545/case.html Justia] and [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=303&amp;invol=545 FindLaw], 303 U.S. 545 (1938)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Lincoln Engineering'' decision==
In ''Lincoln Engineering'', the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling.  The Supreme Court stated that "the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination".&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 549-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It then concluded that the inventor's "effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void."&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 552.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This way of claiming an invention was termed “overclaiming,” because it inflated the royalty base for licensing and potentially effectuated a [[tie-in]] by means of which the patentee required users, for example, to purchase not only the couplings but the whole grease gun as well in order to use the invention.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFIMX6L-nMUC&amp;pg=PT238&amp;lpg=PT238&amp;dq=overclaiming+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3lPZqoxw1&amp;sig=qpu4MeL18AMLeLdW9mNz9JmZrz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPT238,M1 ''Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting''] § 8:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is the ''Lincoln Engineering'' doctrine obsolete?==
The Federal Circuit held in 1984 that this doctrine is outdated and no longer reflects the law.&lt;ref&gt;See Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  The Federal Circuit’s predecessor court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had made similar suggestions. See, e.g., In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the Federal Circuit overruled the Supreme Court on this point—or claimed that the passage of the 1952 patent recodification law had done so. 

In its decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as ''Lincoln Engineering'' (uncited in the ''Quanta'' opinion) are still in force, as least with regard to the [[exhaustion doctrine]]. In ''Quanta'', the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to "exhaust" not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same inventive concept (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.

After 1984 it appeared that it was possible to obtain patents on old combinations, for example not only a new motor but also an otherwise conventional disc drive containing the new motor. It has also been held that the sale of the motor, in such a case, does not exhaust the patent on the disc drive containing the new motor. Hence, a purchaser of the motor who incorporated it into a disk drive would infringe the disk drive patent.&lt;ref&gt;See Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; It is now uncertain whether such patents are valid. In any event, the [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.|''Quanta'']] decision appears to hold that the [[exhaustion doctrine]] shields from infringement liability the foregoing motor purchaser that incorporates the motor into a disk drive.&lt;ref&gt; This result would be contrary to that reached in Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhausted combinations and nonstatutory subject matter==
Claiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination may provide a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as [[nonstatutory subject matter]] under section 101 of the US patent law. Placing a process that fails the [[machine-or-transformation test]] in a machine environment may overcome the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by [[In re Bilski]] and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based.&lt;ref&gt;This expedient was suggested initially in Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/AlgWar.pdf ''Tales From the Algorithm War''], 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; (The successfulness of this expedient depends on acceptance of the Federal Circuit's abolition of the exhausted combination doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.'', 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984); ''In re Bernhardt'', 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;)

For example, the form of the processes claimed in ''[[Diamond v. Diehr]]'',&lt;ref&gt;450 U.S. 175 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'',&lt;ref&gt;437 U.S. 584 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]''&lt;ref&gt;409 U.S. 63 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; may appropriately be compared. In ''Diehr'', the claim is to “a method of operating a rubber-molding press” and the claim contains at least minimal references to the press and other apparatus. In ''Flook'', the claim is to a "method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit," where an “’alarm limit’ is a number.” The claim does not say anything about a reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. In ''Benson'', the claim is to “a  data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.” One claim mentions a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentions no apparatus at all. In ''Flook'', the claim could have instead been to “a method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is placed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.” The claim, although to an exhausted combination,&lt;ref&gt;The Court’s opinion states that it was conceded that the process was known and conventional except for its use of the algorithm.&lt;/ref&gt; would have required apparatus as did that in the ''Diehr'' case. Similarly, the claim in ''Benson'' could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary-coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a mechanical environment, even though it was an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter. It is possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine-or-transformation test.

The preceding analysis may have been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]''. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'' and ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is that the presence of a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an "inventive concept." The inventive concept must provide "something extra" that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.&lt;ref&gt;See generally the cases discussed in the Wikipedia article [[Software patents under United States patent law]], particularly the last several footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''experimental analysis of behavior''' ('''EAB''') is school of thought in [[psychology]] founded on [[B. F. Skinner]]'s philosophy of [[radical behaviorism]] and defines the basic principles used in [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA). A central principle was the [[inductive reasoning|inductive]], data-driven&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca: Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; examination of functional relations, as opposed to the kinds of [[hypothetico-deductive model|hypothetico-deductive]] [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F.: Are Theories of Learning Necessary? (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; that had grown up in the [[comparative psychology]] of the 1920–1950 period. Skinner's approach was characterized by [[empiricism|empirical]] observation of measurable behavior which could be predicted and controlled. It owed its early success to the effectiveness of Skinner's procedures of [[operant conditioning]], both in the laboratory and in [[behavior therapy]].

==Basic learning processes in behavior analysis==

===Classical (or respondent) conditioning===
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
In [[Classical conditioning|classical or respondent conditioning]], a relatively neutral stimulus (''conditioned stimulus'') comes to signal the occurrence of a biologically significant stimulus (''unconditioned stimulus'') such as food or pain. This typically done by repeatedly pairing the two stimuli, as in Pavlov's experiments with dogs, where a bell was followed by food.  As a result, the conditioned stimulus yields a ''conditioned response'' that is usually similar to the ''unconditioned response'' elicited by unconditioned stimulus (e.g., salivation in Pavlov's dogs).&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F.: The Evolution of Behavior (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operant (or instrumental) conditioning===
{{Main|Operant conditioning}}
[[Operant conditioning]] (also, "instrumental conditioning")  is a learning process in which behavior is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. For example, behavior that is followed by reward (reinforcement) becomes more probable, whereas behavior that is followed by punishment becomes less probable.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A.C. "Learning" Prentice-Hall 1992&lt;/ref&gt;   Many variations and details of this process may be found in the main article.

==Experimental tools in behavioral research==

===Operant conditioning chamber===
{{main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
The most commonly used tool in animal behavioral research is the [[operant conditioning chamber]]—also known as a Skinner Box. The chamber is an enclosure designed to hold a test animal (often a [[rodent]], [[pigeon]], or [[primate]]). The interior of the chamber contains some type of device that serves the role of ''discriminative stimuli'', at least one mechanism to measure the subject's ''behavior'' as a rate of response—such as a lever or key-peck switch—and a mechanism for the delivery of ''consequences''—such as a food pellet dispenser or a token reinforcer such as an LED light.

===Cumulative recorder===
Of historical interest is the cumulative recorder, an instrument used to record the responses of subjects graphically. Traditionally, its graphing mechanism has consisted of a rotating drum of paper equipped with a marking needle. The needle would start at the bottom of the page and the drum would turn the roll of paper horizontally. Each subject response would result in the marking needle moving vertically along the paper one tick. This makes it possible for the rate of response to be calculated by finding the [[slope]] of the graph at a given point. For example, a regular rate of response would cause the needle to move vertically at a regular rate, resulting in a straight diagonal line rising towards the right. An accelerating or decelerating rate of response would lead to a [[quadratic function|quadratic]] (or similar) curve. For the most part, cumulative records are no longer graphed using rotating drums, but are recorded electronically instead.

==Key concepts==
Laboratory methods employed in the experimental analysis of behavior are based upon B.F. Skinner's philosophy of [[radical behaviorism]], which is premised upon:
# Everything that organisms do is behavior (including thinking), and
# All behavior is lawful and open to experimental analysis.
# Central to operant conditoning is the use of a Four-Term Contingency (Motivating Operation, Discriminative Stimulus, Response, Reinforcing Stimulus) to describe functional relationships in the control of behavior.
* ''Motivating operations'' (MO) control whether or not an organism's behavior will be affected by a consequence. These include ''establishing operations'', which increase the effectiveness of their corresponding consequences, and ''abolishing operations'', which decrease their effectiveness. For example, food deprivation increases the effectiveness of food reinforcement, whereas eating to satiety decreases the subsequent effectiveness of food reinforcement.  Besides changing the effectiveness of consequences, these motivating operations can also acquire discriminative control over an organism's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laraway, S. |author2=Snycerski, S. |author3=Michael, J. |author4=Poling, A. |title=Motivating operations and terms to describe them: some further refinements |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=407–14 |year=2003 |pmid=14596584 |pmc=1284457 |doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-407}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a hungry animal is more likely to engage in behavior that has previously resulted in being fed, whereas a satiated animal is less likely to engage in such behavior.
* ''Discriminative stimulus'' (S{{sup|D}}) is a cue or stimulus context that sets the occasion for a response. For example, food on a plate sets the occasion for eating.
* ''Behavior'' is a response (R), typically controlled by past consequences and also typically controlled by the presence of a discriminative stimulus. It operates on the environment, that is, it changes the environment in some way.
* ''Consequences'' can consist of [[reinforcing stimuli]] (S{{sup|R}})  or [[punishment (psychology)|punishing stimuli]] (S{{sup|P}}) which follow and modify an operant response. Reinforcing stimuli are often classified as positively (S{{sup|r+}}) or negatively reinforcing (S{{sup|r−}}). Reinforcement may be governed by a ''schedule of reinforcement'', that is, a rule that specifies when or how often a response is reinforced. (See [[operant conditioning]]).
#[[Respondent conditioning]] is dependent on stimulus-response (SR) methodologies (unconditioned stimulus (US), conditioned stimulus (CS), neutral stimulus (NS), unconditioned response (UR), and conditioned response, or CR)
*[[Habituation]]
#[[Counterconditioning]] includes covert and overt conditioning.
#[[Task analysis]], also called [[Chaining|chaining]]
#[[Functional analysis (psychology)]]
#[[Data collection]]

==Anti-theoretical analysis==
The idea that Skinner's position is anti-theoretical is probably inspired by the arguments he put forth in his article ''Are Theories of Learning Necessary?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Skinner, B.F. |title=Are theories of learning necessary? |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=193–216 |date=July 1950 |pmid=15440996 |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Theories/ |doi=10.1037/h0054367}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that article did not argue against the use of theory as such, only against certain theories in certain contexts. Skinner argued that many theories did not explain behavior, but simply offered another layer of structure that itself had to be explained in turn. If an organism is said to have a drive, which causes its behavior, what then causes the drive? Skinner argued that many theories had the effect of halting research or generating useless research.

Skinner's work did have a basis in theory, though his theories were different from those that he criticized. Mecca Chiesa notes that Skinner's theories are inductively derived, while those that he attacked were deductively derived.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2005) Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science&lt;/ref&gt; The theories that Skinner opposed often relied on mediating mechanisms and structures—such as a mechanism for memory as a part of the mind—which were not measurable or observable. Skinner's theories form the basis for two of his books: ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', and ''Science and Human Behavior''. These two texts represent considerable theoretical extensions of his basic laboratory work into the realms of [[political science]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]] and others.

{{cleanup|reason=too much unnecessary and occasionally opinionated verbosity|date=April 2015}}

In mathematics, a '''finitary relation''' has a finite number of "places". In [[set theory]] and [[logic]], a ''relation'' is a property that assigns [[truth values]] to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuple]]s of individuals. Typically, the property describes a possible connection between the components of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuple. For a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuples, a truth value is assigned to each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuple according to whether the property does or does not hold.

An example of a ''[[ternary relation]]'' (i.e., between three individuals) is: "&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; was introduced to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;", where &lt;math&gt;\left(X, Y, Z\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-tuple of persons; for example, "[[Beatrice Wood]] was introduced to [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] by [[Marcel Duchamp]]" is true, while "[[Karl Marx]] was introduced to [[Friedrich Engels]] by [[Queen Victoria]]" is false.

==Informal introduction==

''Relation'' is formally defined in the next section. In this section we introduce the concept of a relation with a familiar everyday example. Consider the relation involving three roles that people might play, expressed in a statement of the form "''X'' thinks that ''Y'' likes ''Z''&amp;nbsp;". The facts of a concrete situation could be organized in a table like the following:

{| class="wikitable" style="width:25em; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto"
|+  Relation S : X thinks that Y likes Z
|-
! Person X !! Person Y !! Person Z
|-
| Alice || Bob ||Denise
|-
| Charles || Alice || Bob
|-
| Charles || Charles || Alice
|-
| Denise || Denise || Denise
|}

Each row of the table records a fact or makes an assertion of the form "''X'' thinks that ''Y'' likes ''Z''&amp;nbsp;". For instance, the first row says, in effect, "Alice thinks that Bob likes Denise". The table represents a relation ''S'' over the set ''P'' of people under discussion:

: ''P'' = {Alice, Bob, Charles, Denise}.

The data of the table are equivalent to the following set of ordered triples:

: ''S'' = {(Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob,&amp;nbsp;Denise), (Charles,&amp;nbsp;Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob), (Charles,&amp;nbsp;Charles,&amp;nbsp;Alice), (Denise,&amp;nbsp;Denise,&amp;nbsp;Denise)}.

It is usual to write ''S''(Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob,&amp;nbsp;Denise) to say the same thing as the first row of the table. The relation ''S'' is a ''ternary'' relation, since there are ''three'' items involved in each row. The relation itself is a [[mathematical object]] defined in terms of concepts from [[set theory]] (i.e., the relation is a subset of the [[Cartesian product]] on {Person X, Person Y, Person Z}), that carries all of the information from the table in one neat package. Mathematically, then, a relation is simply an "ordered set".

The table for relation ''S'' is an extremely simple example of a [[relational database]]. The theoretical aspects of databases are the specialty of one branch of [[computer science]], while their practical impacts have become all too familiar in our everyday lives. Computer scientists, logicians, and mathematicians, however, tend to see different things when they look at these concrete examples and samples of the more general concept of a relation.

For one thing, databases are designed to deal with empirical data, and experience is always finite, whereas mathematics at the very least concerns itself with potential infinity. This difference in perspective brings up a number of ideas that may be usefully introduced at this point, if by no means covered in depth.

== Relations with a small number of "places" ==

The variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; giving the number of "''places''" in the relation, 3 for the above example, is a [[non-negative]] [[integer]], called the relation's ''[[arity]]'', ''adicity'', or ''[[dimension]]''. A relation with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; places is variously called a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-ary'', a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-adic'', or a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-dimensional'' relation. Relations with a finite number of places are called ''finite-place'' or ''[[finitary]]'' relations. It is possible to generalize the concept to include ''infinitary'' relations between infinitudes of individuals, for example [[infinite sequence]]s; however, in this article only finitary relations are discussed, which will from now on simply be called relations.

Since there is only one 0-tuple, the so-called empty tuple (&amp;nbsp;), there are only two zero-place relations: the one that always holds, and the one that never holds. They are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument. One-place relations are called '''unary relations'''. For instance, any set (such as the collection of [[Nobel laureates]]) can be viewed as a collection of individuals having some property (such as that of having been awarded the [[Nobel prize]]). Two-place relations are called [[binary relation]]s or, in the past, ''dyadic relations''.  [[Binary relation]]s are very common, given the ubiquity of relations such as:
* [[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]], denoted by signs such as '&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;' and '&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;5 &lt; 12&lt;/math&gt;';
* Being a [[divisor]] of, denoted by the sign '&lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;13 \mid 143&lt;/math&gt;';
* [[Element (mathematics)|Set membership]], denoted by the sign '&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;1 \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;'.

A &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-ary'' relation is a straightforward generalization of a binary relation.

==Formal definitions==
{{quote|When two objects, qualities, classes, or attributes, viewed together by the mind, are seen under some connexion, that connexion is called a relation.|[[Augustus De Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan, A. (1858) "On the syllogism, part 3" in Heath, P., ed. (1966) ''On the syllogism and other logical writings''. Routledge. P. 119,&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The simpler of the two definitions of ''k''-place relations encountered in mathematics is:

'''Definition 1.''' A '''relation''' ''L'' over the sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[subset]] of their [[Cartesian product]], written ''L'' ⊆ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Relations are classified according to the number of sets in the defining Cartesian product, in other words, according to the number of terms following ''L''. Hence:
:* ''Lu'' denotes a unary relation or [[property (philosophy)|property]];
:* ''Luv'' or ''uLv'' denote a [[homogeneous relation]] when ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[heterogeneous relation]] when ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:* ''Luvw'' denotes a [[ternary relation]];
:* ''Luvwx'' denotes a ''quaternary'' relation.
Relations with more than four terms are usually referred to as ''k''-ary or ''n''-ary, for example, "a 5-ary relation". A ''k''-ary relation is simply a set of ''k''-[[tuple]]s.

The second definition makes use of an idiom that is common in mathematics, stipulating that "such and such is an ''n''-tuple" in order to ensure that such and such a mathematical object is determined by the specification of ''n'' component mathematical objects. In the case of a relation ''L'' over ''k'' sets, there are ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 things to specify, namely, the ''k'' sets plus a subset of their Cartesian product. In the idiom, this is expressed by saying that ''L'' is a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple.

'''Definition 2.''' A relation ''L'' over the sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''G''(''L'')), where ''G''(''L'') is a subset of the Cartesian product ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. ''G''(''L'') is called the ''graph'' of ''L''.

Elements of a relation are more briefly denoted by using boldface characters, for example, the constant element '''''a''''' = (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) or the variable element '''''x''''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).

A statement of the form "'''''a''''' is in the relation ''L''&amp;nbsp;" or "'''''a''''' satisfies ''L''&amp;nbsp;" is taken to mean that '''''a''''' is in ''L'' under the first definition and that '''''a''''' is in ''G''(''L'') under the second definition.

The following considerations apply under either definition:
* The sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''j'' = 1 to ''k'' are called the [[domain of a relation|domain]]s of the relation. Under the first definition, the relation does not uniquely determine a given sequence of domains.
* If all of the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the same set ''X'', then it is simpler to refer to ''L'' as a ''k''-ary relation over ''X''.
* If any of the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is empty, then the defining Cartesian product is empty, and the only relation over such a sequence of domains is the empty relation ''L'' = &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;. Hence it is commonly stipulated that all of the domains be nonempty.

As a rule, whatever definition best fits the application at hand will be chosen for that purpose, and anything that falls under it will be called a relation for the duration of that discussion. If it becomes necessary to distinguish the two definitions, an entity satisfying the second definition may be called an ''embedded'' or ''included'' relation.

If ''L'' is a relation over the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, it is conventional to consider a sequence of terms called ''variables'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, that are said to ''range over'' the respective domains.

Let a [[Boolean domain]] '''B''' be a two-element set, say, '''B''' = {0,&amp;nbsp;1}, whose elements can be interpreted as logical values, typically 0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;false and 1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true. The [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the relation ''L'', written ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; or χ(''L''), is the [[Boolean-valued function]] ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''B''', defined in such a way that ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;) = 1 just in case the ''k''-tuple &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is in the relation ''L''. Such a function can also be called an indicator function, particularly in probability and statistics, to avoid confusion with the notion of a [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] in probability theory.

It is conventional in applied mathematics, [[computer science]], and statistics to refer to a Boolean-valued function like ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; as a ''k''-place [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]. From the more abstract viewpoint of [[formal logic]] and [[model theory]], the relation ''L'' constitutes a ''logical model'' or a ''relational structure'' that serves as one of many possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of some ''k''-place predicate symbol.

Because relations arise in many scientific disciplines as well as in many branches of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], there is considerable variation in terminology. This article treats a relation as the [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a relational concept or term. A variant usage reserves the term "relation" to the corresponding logical entity, either the [[comprehension (logic)|logical comprehension]], which is the totality of [[intension]]s or abstract properties that all of the elements of the relation in extension have in common, or else the symbols that are taken to denote these elements and intensions. Further, some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete connotations, like "relational structure", for the set-theoretic extension of a given relational concept.

== History ==
{{expand section|what about model theory or Codd?|date=April 2015}}
The logician [[Augustus De Morgan]], in work published around 1860, was the first to articulate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense. He also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations (on De Morgan and relations, see Merrill 1990). [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] restated and extended De Morgan's results.

In the 19th century Peirce, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and others advanced the theory of relations. Many of their ideas, especially on relations called [[order theory|orders]], were summarized in [[Principles of Mathematics]] (1903) by [[Bertrand Russell]].  Russell and [[A. N. Whitehead]] made free use of these results in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15836">In mathematics, the notion of a '''germ''' of an object in/on a [[topological space]] is an [[equivalence class]] of that object and others of the same kind which captures their shared local properties. In particular, the objects in question are mostly functions (or [[Map (mathematics)|maps]]) and subsets. In specific implementations of this idea, the sets or maps in question will have some property, such as being analytic or smooth, but in general this is not needed (the maps or functions in question need not even be continuous); it is however necessary that the space on/in which the object is defined is a topological space, in order that the word ''local'' have some sense.

The name is derived from ''[[cereal germ]]'' in a continuation of the [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] metaphor, as a germ is (locally) the "heart" of a function, as it is for a grain.

==Formal definition==

===Basic definition===

Given a point ''x'' of a topological space X, and two maps &lt;math&gt;f, g : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; (where ''Y'' is any set), then  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; define the same germ at ''x'' if there is a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that restricted to ''U'', ''f'' and ''g'' are equal; meaning that &lt;math&gt;f(u)=g(u)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''u'' in ''U''.

Similarly, if ''S'' and ''T'' are any two subsets of X, then they define the same germ at ''x'' if there is again a neighbourhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;S \cap U = T \cap U \neq \emptyset.&lt;/math&gt;

It is straightforward to see that ''defining the same germ'' at ''x'' is an [[equivalence relation]] (be it on maps or sets), and the equivalence classes are called germs (map-germs, or set-germs accordingly). The equivalence relation is usually written

:&lt;math&gt;f \sim_x g \quad \text{or} \quad S \sim_x T.&lt;/math&gt;

Given a map ''f'' on ''X'', then its germ at ''x'' is usually denoted [''f''&amp;thinsp;]&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, the germ at ''x'' of a set ''S'' is written [''S'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;[f]_x = \{g:X\to Y \mid g \sim_x f\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A map germ at ''x'' in ''X'' which maps the point ''x'' in ''X'' to the point ''y'' in ''Y'' is denoted as

:&lt;math&gt;f:(X,x) \to (Y,y).&lt;/math&gt; 

When using this notation, ''f'' is then intended as an entire equivalence class of maps, using the same letter ''f'' for any representative map.

Notice that two sets are germ-equivalent at ''x'' if and only if their [[indicator function|characteristic function]]s are germ-equivalent at ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;S\sim_x T \Longleftrightarrow \mathbf{1}_S \sim_x \mathbf{1}_T.&lt;/math&gt;

===More generally===
Maps need not be defined on all of ''X'', and in particular they don't need to have the same domain. However, if ''f'' has domain ''S'' and ''g'' has domain ''T'', both subsets of ''X'', then ''f'' and ''g'' are germ equivalent at ''x'' in ''X'' if first ''S'' and ''T'' are germ equivalent at ''x'', say &lt;math&gt;S \cap U = T\cap U \neq \emptyset,&lt;/math&gt; and then moreover &lt;math&gt;f|_{S\cap V} = g|_{T\cap V}&lt;/math&gt;, for some smaller neighbourhood ''V'' with &lt;math&gt;x\in V \subset U&lt;/math&gt;. This is particularly relevant in two settings: 
# ''f'' is defined on a subvariety ''V'' of ''X'', and 
# ''f'' has a pole of some sort at ''x'', so is not even defined at ''x'', as for example a rational function, which would be defined ''off'' a subvariety.

===Basic properties===
If ''f'' and ''g'' are germ equivalent at ''x'', then they share all local properties, such as continuity, differentiability etc., so it makes sense to talk about a ''differentiable or analytic germ'', etc. Similarly for subsets: if one representative of a germ is an analytic set then so are all representatives, at least on some neighbourhood of ''x''.

Algebraic structures on the target ''Y'' are inherited by the set of germs with values in ''Y''.  For instance, if the target ''Y'' is a [[group (mathematics)]], then it makes sense to multiply germs: to define [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;[''g'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, first take representatives ''f'' and ''g'', defined on neighbourhoods ''U'' and ''V'' respectively, and define [''f'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;[''g'']&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the germ at ''x'' of the map ''fg'' (which is defined on &lt;math&gt;U\cap V&lt;/math&gt;).  In the same way, if ''Y'' is an abelian group, vector space, or ring, then so is the set of germs.

The set of germs at ''x'' of maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' does not have a useful topology, except for the discrete one. It therefore makes little or no sense to talk of a convergent sequence of germs. However, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are manifolds, then the spaces of [[Jet (mathematics)|jets]] &lt;math&gt;J_x^k(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; (finite order Taylor series at ''x'' of map(-germs)) do have topologies as they can be identified with finite-dimensional vector spaces.

==Relation with sheaves==
The idea of germ is behind the definition of sheaves and presheaves. A [[Sheaf (mathematics)|presheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of [[abelian group]]s on a topological space ''X'' assigns an abelian group &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; to each open set ''U'' in ''X''. Typical examples of abelian groups here are: real valued functions on ''U'', differential forms on ''U'', vector fields on ''U'', holomorphic functions on ''U'' (when ''X'' is a complex space), constant functions on ''U'' and differential operators on ''U''.

If &lt;math&gt;V \subset U&lt;/math&gt; then there is a restriction map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{res}_{VU}:\mathcal{F}(U)\to \mathcal{F}(V),&lt;/math&gt; satisfying certain [[Sheaf (mathematics)#Presheaves|compatibility conditions]]. For a fixed ''x'', one says that elements &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{F}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathcal{F}(V)&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent at ''x'' if there is a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;W\subset U\cap V&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' with res&lt;sub&gt;''WU''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f'') = res&lt;sub&gt;''WV''&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') (both elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(W)&lt;/math&gt;). The equivalence classes form the [[Stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_x&lt;/math&gt; at ''x'' of the presheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. This equivalence relation is an abstraction of the germ equivalence described above.

Interpreting germs through sheaves also gives a general explanation for the presence of algebraic structures on sets of germs. The reason is because formation of stalks preserves finite limits.  This implies that if ''T'' is a [[Lawvere theory]] and a sheaf ''F'' is a ''T''-algebra, then any stalk ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a ''T''-algebra.

== Examples ==
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have additional structure, it is possible to define subsets of the set of all maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' or more generally sub-[[presheaf|presheaves]] of a given [[presheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; and corresponding germs: ''some notable examples follow''.

*If &lt;math&gt;X, Y&lt;/math&gt; are both [[topological spaces]], the subset 
::&lt;math&gt;C^0(X,Y) \subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[continuous function]]s defines '''germs of continuous functions'''.

*If both &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; admit a [[differentiable structure]], the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^k(X,Y) \subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times continuously [[differentiable function]]s, the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^\infty(X,Y)=\bigcap\nolimits_k C^k(X,Y)\subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[smooth function]]s and the [[subset]] 
::&lt;math&gt;C^\omega(X,Y)\subset \mbox{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; 
:of [[analytic function]]s can be defined (&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; here is the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] for infinity; this is an [[abuse of notation]], by analogy with &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;), and then spaces of '''germs of (finitely) differentiable''', '''smooth''', '''analytic functions''' can be constructed.

*If &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; have a complex structure (for instance, are [[subsets]] of [[vector space|complex vector spaces]]), [[holomorphic function]]s between them can be defined, and therefore spaces of '''germs of holomorphic functions''' can be constructed.

*If &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; have an [[algebraic structure]], then [[Regular function|regular]] (and [[rational function|rational]]) functions between them can be defined, and '''germs of regular functions''' (and likewise '''rational''') can be defined.

*The germ of ''f'':ℝ→''Y'' at positive infinity (or simply the germ of ''f'') is &lt;math&gt;\{g: \exists x \forall y &gt; x \, f(y) = g(y)\}&lt;/math&gt;.  These germs are used in [[asymptotic analysis]] and [[Hardy field]]s.

=== Notation ===
The [[Stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] of a sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; on a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is commonly denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_x.&lt;/math&gt; As a consequence germs, being stalks of sheaves of various kind of functions, borrow this scheme of notation:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of continuous functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^k&lt;/math&gt; for each [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times-differentiable functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of infinitely differentiable ("smooth") functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of analytic functions'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of holomorphic functions'' (in complex geometry), or ''space of germs of regular functions'' (in algebraic geometry) at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

For germs of sets and varieties, the notation is not so well established: some notations found in literature include:

*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{V}_x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''space of germs of analytic varieties'' at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. When the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and known (e.g. when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological vector space]] and &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;), it can be dropped in each of the above symbols: also, when &lt;math&gt;\dim X=n&lt;/math&gt;, a subscript before the symbol can be added. As example
*&lt;math&gt;{_n\mathcal{C}^0}, {_n\mathcal{C}^k}, {_n\mathcal{C}^\infty}, {_n\mathcal{C}^\omega}, {_n\mathcal{O}}, {_n\mathfrak{V}}&lt;/math&gt; are the spaces of germs shown above when &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[vector space]] and &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
The key word in the applications of germs is '''locality''': ''all [[Local property|local properties]] of a function at a point can be studied by analyzing its germ''. They are a generalization of [[Taylor series]], and indeed the Taylor series of a germ (of a differentiable function) is defined: you only need local information to compute derivatives.

Germs are useful in determining the properties of [[Dynamical system (definition)|dynamical systems]] near chosen points of their [[phase space]]: they are one of the main tools in [[singularity theory]] and [[catastrophe theory]].

When the topological spaces considered are [[Riemann surface]]s or more generally [[analytic variety|analytic varieties]], germs of [[holomorphic functions]] on them can be viewed as [[power series]], and thus the set of germs can be considered to be the [[analytic continuation]] of an [[analytic function]].

== Algebraic properties ==
As noted earlier, sets of germs may have algebraic structures such as being rings. In many situations, rings of germs are not arbitrary rings but instead have quite specific properties.

Suppose that ''X'' is a space of some sort. It is often the case that, at each ''x'' ∈ ''X'', the ring of germs of functions at ''x'' is a [[local ring]]. This is the case, for example, for continuous functions on a topological space; for ''k'' times differentiable, smooth, or analytic functions on a real manifold (when such functions are defined); for holomorphic functions on complex manifold; and for regular functions on an algebraic variety.  The property that rings of germs are local rings is axiomatized by the theory of [[locally ringed space]]s.

The types of local rings that arise, however, depend closely on the theory under consideration.  The [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]] implies that rings of germs of holomorphic functions are [[Noetherian ring]]s.  It can also be shown that these are [[regular ring]]s.  On the other hand, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0^\infty(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of germs at the origin of smooth functions on '''R'''.  This ring is local but not Noetherian.  To see why, observe that the maximal ideal ''m'' of this ring consists of all germs which vanish at the origin, and the power ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; consists of those germs whose first ''k'' &amp;minus; 1 derivatives vanish.  If this ring were Noetherian, then the [[Krull intersection theorem]] would imply that a smooth function whose Taylor series vanished would be the zero function.  But this is false, as can be seen by considering
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
e^{-1/x^2}, &amp;x \neq 0, \\
0, &amp;x = 0.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
This ring is also not a [[unique factorization domain]].  This is because all UFDs satisfy the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]], but there is an infinite ascending chain of principal ideals
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \subsetneq (x^{-j+1} f(x)) \subsetneq (x^{-j} f(x)) \subsetneq (x^{-j-1} f(x)) \subsetneq \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
The inclusions are strict because ''x'' is in the maximal ideal ''m''.

The ring &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_0^0(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; of germs at the origin of continuous functions on '''R''' even has the property that its maximal ideal ''m'' satisfies ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m''.  Any germ ''f'' ∈ ''m'' can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;f = |f|^{1/2} \cdot \big(\operatorname{sgn}(f)|f|^{1/2}\big),&lt;/math&gt;
where sgn is the sign function.  Since |''f''| vanishes at the origin, this expresses ''f'' as the product of two functions in ''m'', whence the conclusion.  This is related to the setup of [[almost ring|almost ring theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''Grossman model of health demand''' is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care outlined by [[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]] in a monograph in 1972 entitled: ''The demand for health: A theoretical and empirical investigation''. The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the "founding father of demand for health models".&lt;ref name="JRC2012"&gt;Jones, Andrew M. Rice, Nigel, and Contoyannis, Paul. ''The Dynamics of Health'' in Jones, Andrew M., ed. The Elgar companion to health economics. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012. p15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

==Theoretical expansions==
The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Charles E. "Demand for reimbursement insurance." In The role of health insurance in the health services sector, pp. 115-162. NBER, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, Maureen L. "Health, investment in health, and occupational choice." Journal of Political Economy 85, no. 6 (1977): 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Isaac. On the interaction between education and health and the concept of human capital. Mimeo., Jan, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, Jan Paul. "Nonmonetary factors in the demand for medical services: some empirical evidence." Journal of Political Economy 83, no. 3 (1975): 595-614.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"&gt;Grossman 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical estimation==
Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by [[Joseph Newhouse]] in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

==Criticisms==
In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dicotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Muurinen, Jaana-Marja. "Demand for health: a generalised Grossman model." Journal of Health economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 5-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ground segment.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A simplified spacecraft system. Orange arrows denote radio links; black arrows denote ground network links.]]
A '''ground segment''' consists of all the ground-based elements of a [[spacecraft]] [[system]] used by operators and support personnel, as opposed to the [[Satellite space segment|space segment]] and user segment.&lt;ref name=jsat_intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=elbert/&gt;{{rp|1}} The ground segment enables management of a spacecraft, and distribution of [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] and [[telemetry]] among interested parties on the ground. The primary elements of a ground segment include:
* [[Ground station|Ground (or Earth) station]]s, which provide radio interfaces with spacecraft&lt;ref name=elbert/&gt;{{rp|142}}
* [[Mission control center|Mission (or flight) control (or operations) center]]s, from which spacecraft are managed&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|20}}
* Ground [[Telecommunications network|network]]s, which connect the other ground elements to one another&lt;ref name=elbert/&gt;{{rp|142}}&lt;ref name=esa_ers/&gt;
* Remote [[terminal (telecommunication)|terminal]]s, used by support personnel&lt;ref name=elbert/&gt;{{rp|142}}
* Spacecraft [[System integration testing|integration and test]] facilities
* [[Spaceport|Launch facilities]]&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|21}}
These elements are present in nearly all space missions, whether commercial, military, or scientific. They may be located together or separated geographically, and they may be operated by different parties.&lt;ref name=esa_copernicus/&gt;&lt;ref name=reiniger/&gt;{{rp|25}} Some elements may support multiple spacecraft simultaneously.

==Elements==
===Ground stations===
{{see also|Ground station}}
[[File:Rio antennas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Radio dishes at an [[Embratel]] earth station in [[Tanguá]], Brazil]]
Ground stations provide radio [[telecommunications link|interfaces]] between the space and ground segments for telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;C), as well as payload data transmission and reception.&lt;ref name=reiniger/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name=jsat_RF/&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat_teleport/&gt; Tracking networks, such as [[NASA]]'s [[Near Earth Network]] and [[Space Network]], may handle communications with multiple spacecraft through [[time-sharing]].&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|22}} 

Ground station equipment may be [[remote monitoring and control|monitored and controlled remotely]], often via [[Serial communication|serial]] and/or [[Internet Protocol|IP]] interfaces. There are typically backup stations from which radio contact can be maintained if there is a problem at the primary ground station which renders it unable to operate, such as a natural disaster. Such contingencies are considered in a [[Continuity of Operations]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} plan.

====Transmission and reception====
Signals to be [[Transmission (telecommunications)|uplink]]ed to a spacecraft must first be extracted from ground [[network packet]]s, [[Line code|encoded]] to [[baseband]], and [[modulation|modulated]],&lt;ref name=JPL_10/&gt; typically onto an [[intermediate frequency]] (IF) carrier, before being [[Frequency mixer|up-converted]] to the assigned [[radio frequency]] (RF) band. The RF signal is then [[RF power amplifier|amplified]] to high power and carried via [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] to an [[Parabolic antenna|antenna]] for transmission. In colder climates, electric heaters or hot air blowers may be necessary to prevent ice or snow buildup on the parabolic dish.

Received ("downlinked") signals are passed through a [[low-noise amplifier]] (often located in the antenna hub to minimize the distance the signal must travel) before being down-converted to IF; these two functions may be combined in a [[low-noise block downconverter]]. The IF signal is then [[demodulation|demodulated]], and the data stream extracted via [[Self-clocking signal|bit]] and [[frame synchronization]] and decoding.&lt;ref name=JPL_10/&gt; Data errors, such as those caused by signal [[Degradation (telecommunications)|degradation]], are [[forward error correction|identified and corrected]] where possible.&lt;ref name=JPL_10/&gt; The decoded data stream is then [[network packet|packet]]ized or saved to files for transmission on the ground network. Ground stations may temporarily [[computer data storage|store]] received telemetry for later playback to control centers.

A single spacecraft may make use of multiple RF bands for different telemetry, command, and payload data [[stream (computing)|streams]], depending on bandwidth and other requirements.

====Passes====
The timing of [[pass (spaceflight)|pass]]es, when a line of sight exists to the spacecraft, is determined by the location of ground stations, and by the characteristics of the spacecraft [[orbit]] or [[trajectory]].&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; The Space Network uses [[geostationary]] [[TDRSS|relay satellites]] to extend pass opportunities over the horizon.

====Tracking and ranging====
Ground stations must [[radio direction finder|track]] spacecraft in order to [[main lobe|point their antennas]] properly, and must account for [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifting]] of RF frequencies due to the motion of the spacecraft. Ground stations may also perform automated [[ranging]]; ranging tones may be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with command and telemetry signals. Ground station tracking and ranging data are passed to the control center along with spacecraft telemetry.

===Mission control centers===
{{see also|List of mission control centers}}
[[File:JPLControlRoom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Control center at NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]]]
Mission control centers issue [[telecommand|command]]s, data [[upload]]s, and [[Software maintenance|software updates]] to spacecraft, and process, analyze, and distribute [[telemetry]]. For manned spacecraft, mission control manages voice and video communications with the crew. Control centers may also be responsible for [[configuration management]] and data [[backup|archival]]. As with ground stations, there are typically backup control facilities available to support continuity of operations. 

====Telemetry processing====
Control centers use telemetry to determine the status of a spacecraft and its systems.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|485}} Housekeeping, diagnostic, science, and other types of telemetry may be carried on separate [[virtual circuit|virtual channel]]s. Flight control software performs the initial processing of received telemetry, including:
# Separation and distribution of [[virtual circuit|virtual channel]]s&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|393}}
# [[Connection-oriented communication|Time-ordering and gap-checking]] of received [[Frame (networking)|frame]]s (gaps may be filled by commanding a re-transmission)
# [[Commutation (telemetry)|Decommutation]] of parameter values,&lt;ref name=JPL_10/&gt; and association of these values with [[mnemonic]]s
# Conversion of raw data to [[calibration|calibrated]] (engineering) values, and calculation of derived parameters
# Limit and constraint checking (which may generate alert notifications)&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|479}}

A spacecraft [[database]] is called on to provide information on telemetry frame formatting, the positions and frequencies of parameters within frames, and their associated mnemonics, calibrations, and soft and hard limits. The contents of this database—especially calibrations and limits—may be updated periodically to maintain consistency with flight software and operating procedures; these can change during the life of a mission in response to [[upgrade]]s, hardware degradation in the [[space environment]], and changes to mission parameters.

====Commanding====
Commands sent to spacecraft are formatted according to the spacecraft database, and are [[data validation|validated]] against the database before being transmitted via a [[#Ground stations|ground station]]. Commands may be issued manually in real time, or they may be part of automated or semi-automated procedures. Typically, commands successfully received by the spacecraft are acknowledged in telemetry, and a command counter is maintained on the spacecraft and at the ground to ensure synchronization. In certain cases, [[closed-loop control]] may be performed. Commanded activities may pertain directly to mission objectives, or they may be part of [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|housekeeping]]. Commands (and telemetry) may be [[encryption|encrypted]] to prevent unauthorized access to the spacecraft or its data.

Spacecraft procedures are often developed and tested against a spacecraft [[simulator]] prior to use with the actual spacecraft.

====Staffing====
Control centers may be [[shift work|continuously]] or [[Business hours|regularly]] staffed by [[flight controller]]s. Staffing is typically greatest during the [[Launch and Early Orbit phase|early phases]] of a mission,&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|21}} and during [[mission-critical|critical]] procedures and periods.&lt;ref name=aiaa/&gt; Increasingly commonly, control centers for unmanned spacecraft may be set up for "lights-out" (or [[automation|automated]]) operation, as a means of controlling costs.&lt;ref name=aiaa/&gt; Flight [[remote monitoring and control|control]] software will typically generate [[notification system|alerts]] regarding significant events – both planned and unplanned – in the ground or space segment that may require operator action.&lt;ref name=aiaa/&gt;

====Analysis and support====
Mission control centers may rely on "offline" (i.e., non-[[real-time computing|real-time]]) [[data processing]] subsystems to handle analytical tasks&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|21}} such as:
* [[Orbit determination]] and [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] planning&lt;ref name=JPL_13/&gt;
* [[Conjunction (astronomy)|Conjunction]] assessment and [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|collision avoidance]] planning
* On-board [[memory management]]&lt;ref name=uhlig/&gt;{{rp|247–249}}
* Mission planning and scheduling
* [[Motion planning|Path planning]], in the case of [[Rover (space exploration)|planetary rover]]s
* Short- and long-term [[trend analysis]]&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Dedicated physical spaces may be provided in the control center for certain mission support roles, such as [[flight dynamics]] and [[Telecommunications network|network]] control,&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|475}} or these roles may be handled via [[Ground_segment#Remote_terminals|remote terminals]] outside the control center. As on-board [[computing power]] and [[flight software]] complexity have increased, there is a trend toward performing more automated data processing [[on-board data handling|on board the spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=aiaa/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

===Ground networks===
Ground [[computer network|network]]s handle data transfer and voice communication between different elements of the ground segment. These networks often combine [[local area network|LAN]] and [[wide area network|WAN]] elements, for which different parties may be responsible. Geographically separated elements may be connected via [[leased line]]s or [[virtual private network]]s. The design of ground networks is driven by requirements on [[reliability engineering|reliability]], [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], and [[computer security|security]].

Reliability is a particularly important consideration for [[critical system]]s, with [[uptime]] and [[mean time to recovery]] being of paramount concern. As with other aspects of the spacecraft system, [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] of network components is the primary means of achieving the required system reliability.

Security considerations are vital to protect space resources and sensitive data. WAN links often incorporate [[encryption]] protocols and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] to provide [[information security|information]] and [[network security]]. [[Antivirus software]] and [[intrusion detection system]]s provide additional security at network endpoints.

===Remote terminals===
Remote terminals are interfaces on ground networks, separate from the mission control center, which may be accessed by [[payload]] controllers, telemetry analysts, [[scientific instrument|instrument]] and [[outline of space science|science]] teams, and [[technical support|support]] personnel, such as [[system administrator]]s and [[software development]] teams. They may be receive-only, or they may transmit data to the ground network.

Satellite terminals used by [[telecommunications service|service]] customers, including [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] and [[Direct-broadcast satellite|end users]], are collectively called the "user segment", and are typically distinguished from the ground segment.

===Integration and test facilities===
Space vehicles and their interfaces are assembled and tested at [[system integration testing|integration and test]] (I&amp;T) facilities. I&amp;T provides an opportunity to fully test communications with, and behavior of, the spacecraft prior to launch.

===Launch facilities===
Vehicles are delivered to space via [[Spaceport|launch facilities]], which handle the logistics of rocket launches. Launch facilities are typically connected to the ground network to relay telemetry prior to and during launch. The [[launch vehicle]] itself is sometimes said to constitute a "transfer segment", which may be considered distinct from both the space and ground segments.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;{{rp|21}}

==Costs==
Costs associated with the establishment and operation of a ground segment are highly variable,&lt;ref name=tirro/&gt; and depend on accounting methods. According to a study by [[Delft University of Technology]],{{r|Wertz_Larson|group=Note}} the ground segment contributes approximately 5% to the total cost of a space system.&lt;ref name=zandbergenROM/&gt; According to a report by the [[RAND Corporation]] on NASA small spacecraft missions, operation costs alone contribute 8% to the lifetime cost of a typical mission, with integration and testing making up a further 3.2%, ground facilities 2.6%, and ground systems engineering 1.1%.&lt;ref name=deWeck/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Ground segment [[cost driver]]s include requirements placed on facilities, hardware, software, network connectivity, security, and staffing.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; Ground station costs in particular depend largely on the required transmission power, RF band(s), and the suitability of preexisting facilities.&lt;ref name=tirro/&gt;{{rp|703}} Control centers may be highly automated as a means of controlling staffing costs.&lt;ref name=aiaa/&gt;

{{Thermodynamics}}
[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Sun]] and [[Earth]] form an ongoing example of a heating process.  Some of the Sun's [[thermal radiation]] strikes and heats the Earth.  Compared to the Sun, Earth has a much lower temperature and so sends far less thermal radiation back to the Sun.  The heat of this process can be quantified by the net amount, and direction (Sun to Earth), of energy it transferred in a given period of time.]]

In [[thermodynamics]], '''heat''' is [[energy]] transferred from one system to another as a result of thermal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Reif (1965):
"[in the special case of purely thermal interaction between two system:] The mean energy transferred from one system to the other as a result of purely thermal interaction is called 'heat'" (p. 67).
the quantity Q [...] is simply a measure of the mean energy change ''not'' due to the change of external parameters. [...] splits the total mean energy change into a part W due to mechanical interaction and a part Q due to thermal interaction  [...] by virtue of [the definition ΔE=W+Q], both heat and work have the dimensions of energy"
(p. 73).
C.f.: "heat is thermal energy in transfer" Stephen J. Blundell, Katherine M. Blundell, ''Concepts in Thermal Physics'' (2009),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=YE9uBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13  p. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of heat transferred in any process can be defined as the total amount of transferred energy excluding any macroscopic [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] that was done and any transfer of part of the object itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A.B.]] (1957/1966), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Landau|Landau, L.]], [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz, E.M.]] (1958/1969), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; When two systems with different [[temperature|temperatures]] are put in contact, heat flows spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system. Transfer of energy as heat can occur through direct contact, through a barrier that is impermeable to matter (as in [[thermal conduction|conduction]]), by [[thermal radiation|radiation]] between separated bodies, by way of an intermediate fluid (as in [[Convective heat transfer|convective circulation]]), or by a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967)|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck. M. (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1961"/&gt;  By contrast to [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], heat involves the [[stochastic]] (random) motion of particles (such as atoms or molecules) that is [[Equipartition theorem|equally distributed among all degrees of freedom]], while work is  confined to one or more specific [[degrees of freedom]] such as those of the [[center of mass]]. 

Like thermodynamic  [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], heat is a property of a process, not a property of a system. Energy exchanged as heat (a [[process function]]) changes the [[internal energy]] (a [[state function]]) of each system by equal and opposite amounts.   This is to be distinguished from the common conception of heat as a property of high-temperature systems.   

Although heat flows from a hotter body to a cooler one, it is possible to construct a [[heat pump]] or refrigeration system that does work to increase the difference in temperature between two systems.  In contrast, a [[heat engine]] reduces an existing temperature difference to do work on another system.

As a form of energy,  the [[SI unit]] of heat is the [[joule]] (J). The conventional symbol used to represent the amount of heat exchanged in a thermodynamic process is {{mvar|Q}}. 
Heat is measured by its effect on the states of interacting bodies, for example, by the amount of ice melted or a change in [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), Chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;  The quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called [[calorimetry]].

==Notation and units==
As a form of energy, heat has the unit [[joule]] (J) in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). However, in many applied fields in engineering the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) and the [[calorie]] are often used. The standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the [[watt]] (W), defined as one joule per second.

Use of the symbol {{mvar|Q}} for the total amount of energy transferred as heat is due to [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850:
:"Let the amount of heat which must be imparted during the transition of the gas in a definite manner from any given state to another, in which its volume is ''v'' and its temperature ''t'', be called Q"&lt;ref name=Clausius1850&gt;'' Die Wärmemenge, welche dem Gase mitgetheilt werden muss, während es aus irgend einem früheren Zustande auf einem bestimmten Wege in den Zustand übergeführt wird, in welchem sein Volumen = ''v'' und seine Temperatur = ''t'' ist, möge ''Q'' heissen''
R. Clausius, [https://archive.org/stream/ueberdiebewegen00claugoog#page/n17/mode/2up ''Ueber die bewegende Kraft der Wärme und die Gesetze, welche sich daraus für die Wärmelehre selbst ableiten lassen''], communication to the Academy of Berlin, February 1850, published in Pogendorff's Annalen vol. 79, March/April 1850, first translated in Philosophical Magazine vol. 2, July 1851, as "First Memoir" in: ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat, with its Applications to the Steam-Engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies'', trans. John Tyndall, London, 1867, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity ({{mvar|Q}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0); when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings, it is positive ({{mvar|Q}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0). Heat transfer rate, or heat flow per unit time, is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. This should not be confused with a time derivative of a [[Functions of state|function of state]] (which can also be written with the dot notation) since heat is not a function of state.&lt;ref name="Baierlein1999"&gt;Baierlein, R. (1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Heat flux]] is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area (units watts per square metre).

==Classical thermodynamics==

===Heat and entropy===
{{main|Entropy}}
[[File:Clausius-1.jpg|thumb|120px|Rudolf Clausius]]
In 1856,  [[Rudolf Clausius]], referring to closed systems, in which transfers of matter do not occur, defined the ''second fundamental theorem'' (the [[second law of thermodynamics]]) in the mechanical [[theory of heat]] ([[thermodynamics]]): "if two transformations which, without necessitating any other permanent change, can mutually replace one another, be called equivalent, then the generations of the quantity of heat ''Q'' from [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] at the temperature ''T'', has the ''equivalence-value'':"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1854).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1865), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {} \frac {Q}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1865, he came to define the [[entropy]] symbolized by ''S'', such that, due to the supply of the amount of heat ''Q'' at temperature ''T'' the entropy of the system is increased by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S = \frac {Q}{T}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)&lt;/math&gt;

In a transfer of energy as heat without work being done, there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it. The increase, {{math|Δ''S''}}, of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts, an increment, {{math|Δ''S''′}} that matches, or 'compensates', the change, {{math|−Δ''S''′}}, of entropy in the surroundings, and a further increment, {{math|Δ''S''′′}} that may be considered to be 'generated' or 'produced' in the system, and is said therefore to be 'uncompensated'. Thus

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S = \Delta S^\prime+\Delta S^{\prime\prime} .&lt;/math&gt;

This may also be written

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{system}} = \Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}}\,\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\,\,\Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}=-\Delta S_{\mathrm{surroundings}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total change of entropy in the system and surroundings is thus

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}} = \Delta S^\prime+\Delta S^{\prime\prime}-\Delta S^\prime=\Delta S^{\prime\prime} .&lt;/math&gt;

This may also be written

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}} = \Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{surroundings}}=\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}} .&lt;/math&gt;

It is then said that an amount of entropy {{math|Δ''S''′}} has been transferred from the surroundings to the system. Because entropy is not a conserved quantity, this is an exception to the general way of speaking, in which an amount transferred is of a conserved quantity.

From the second law of thermodynamics follows that in a spontaneous transfer of heat, in which the temperature of the system is different from that of the surroundings:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}}&gt;0 .&lt;/math&gt;

For purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers, one thinks of fictive processes that are called ''reversible'', with the temperature {{math|''T''}} of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings, and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow rate.

Following the definition above in formula (1), for such a fictive reversible process, a quantity of transferred heat {{math|δ''Q''}} (an [[inexact differential]]) is analyzed as a quantity {{math|''T'' d''S''}}, with {{math|d''S''}} (an [[exact differential]]):

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S=\delta Q .&lt;/math&gt;

This equality is only valid for a fictive transfer in which there is no production of entropy, that is to say, in which there is no uncompensated entropy.

If, in contrast, the process is natural, and can really occur, with irreversibility, then there is [[entropy production]], with {{math|d''S''&lt;sub&gt;uncompensated&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}. The quantity {{math|''T'' d''S''&lt;sub&gt;uncompensated&lt;/sub&gt;}} was termed by Clausius the "uncompensated heat", though that does not accord with present-day terminology. Then one has

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S=\delta Q+T\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}} &gt; \delta Q .&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the statement

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S \geq \delta Q \quad{\rm{(second\,\,law)}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems.

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics that approximates by assuming the hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a special notation for this. The transfer of energy as heat is assumed to take place across an infinitesimal temperature difference, so that the system element and its surroundings have near enough the same temperature {{math|''T''}}. Then one writes

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}S =\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm e}+\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where by definition

:&lt;math&gt; \delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm e}\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm i}\equiv\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm {uncompensated}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second law for a natural process asserts that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm d S_{\mathrm i}&gt;0 .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, S.R., [[Peter Mazur|Mazur, P.]] (1962), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D, [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1998), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebon, g., Jou, D., Casas-Vásquez, J. (2008), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat and enthalpy===
{{see|Internal energy|Enthalpy}}

For a [[closed system]] (a system from which no matter can enter or exit), one version of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that the change in [[internal energy]] {{math|Δ''U''}} of the system is equal to the amount of heat {{math|''Q''}} supplied to the system minus the amount of [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] {{math|''W''}} done by system on its surroundings. The foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article, but an alternate sign convention, followed by IUPAC, for work, is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry, such as those by [[Peter Atkins]] and Ira Levine, but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q - W \, . &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be re-written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, based purely on the concept of adiabatic work, if it is supposed that {{math|Δ''U''}} is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work:

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \Delta U + W.&lt;/math&gt;

The work done by the system includes boundary work (when the system increases its volume against an external force, such as that exerted by a piston) and other work (e.g. shaft work performed by a compressor fan), which is called isochoric work:

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \Delta U + W_\text{boundary} + W_\text{isochoric}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this Section we will neglect the "other-" or isochoric work contribution.

The internal energy, {{math|''U''}}, is a [[state function]]. In cyclical processes, such as the operation of a heat engine, state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle.

The differential, or infinitesimal increment, for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an [[exact differential]] {{math|d''U''}}. The symbol for [[exact differential]]s is the lowercase letter {{math|d}}.

In contrast, neither of the infinitesimal increments {{math|δ''Q''}} nor {{math|δ''W''}} in an infinitesimal process represents the state of the system. Thus, infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials. The lowercase Greek letter delta, {{math|δ}}, is the symbol for [[inexact differential]]s. The integral of any inexact differential over the time it takes for a system to leave and return to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero.

As recounted below, in the section headed [[#Entropy|Entropy]], the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in which no irreversible processes take place and which has a well-defined temperature {{math|''T''}}, the increment of heat {{math|δ''Q''}} and the temperature {{math|''T''}} form the [[exact differential]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}S =\frac{\delta Q}{T},&lt;/math&gt;

and that {{math|''S''}}, the entropy of the working body, is a function of state. Likewise, with a well-defined pressure, {{math|''P''}}, behind the moving boundary, the work differential, {{math|δ''W''}}, and the pressure, {{math|''P''}}, combine to form the exact differential

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}V =\frac{\delta W}{P},&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''V''}} the volume of the system, which is a state variable. In general, for homogeneous systems,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Associated with this differential equation is that the internal energy may be considered to be a function {{math|''U'' (''S'',''V'')}} of its [[Thermodynamic potential|natural variables]] {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}. The internal energy representation of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] is written
:&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,V).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]], (1985), Section 2-3, pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins 1983 101"&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1983), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{math|''V''}} is constant

:&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S=\mathrm{d}U\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(V\,\, \text{constant)}&lt;/math&gt;

and if {{math|''P''}} is constant

:&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S=\mathrm{d}H\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(P\,\, \text{constant)}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''H''}} the enthalpy defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H=U+PV.&lt;/math&gt;

The enthalpy may be considered to be a function {{math|''H'' (''S'',''P'')}} of its natural variables {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''P''}}. The enthalpy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written
:&lt;math&gt;H=H(S,P).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins 1983 101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 147"&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1985), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal energy representation and the enthalpy representation are [[Legendre transformation|partial Legendre transforms]] of one another. They contain the same physical information, written in different ways. Like the internal energy, the enthalpy stated as a function of its natural variables is a thermodynamic potential and contains all thermodynamic information about a body.&lt;ref name="Callen 147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1983), pp. 100–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a quantity {{math|''Q''}} of heat is added to a body while it does expansion work {{math|''W''}} on its surroundings, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\Delta U + \Delta(PV)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If this is constrained to happen at constant pressure with {{math|Δ''P'' {{=}} 0}}, the expansion work {{math|''W''}} done by the body is given by {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''P'' Δ''V''}}; recalling the first law of thermodynamics, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=Q - W=Q - P\, \Delta V \text{   and   }\Delta (PV) = P\, \Delta V \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, by substitution one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=Q - P\, \Delta V + P\, \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=Q\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

In this scenario, the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system. Since many processes do take place at constant pressure, or approximately at atmospheric pressure, the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of 'heat content'.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also called the heat function.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the natural variables {{math|''S'' and ''P''}} of the state function {{math|''H''}}, this process of change of state from state 1 to state 2 can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \mathrm dS +\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_S \mathrm dP&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \mathrm dS\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is known that the temperature {{math|''T''(''S'', ''P'')}} is identically stated by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \equiv T(S,P)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} T(S,P) \mathrm dS\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the integral specifies a quantity of heat transferred at constant pressure.

==History==
{{main|History of thermodynamics}}

As a common noun, English ''heat'' or ''warmth'' (just as French ''chaleur'', German ''Wärme'', Latin ''calor'', Greek θάλπος, etc.) refers to (the human [[thermoception|perception of]]) either [[thermal energy]] or [[temperature]]. Speculation on thermal energy or "heat" as a separate form of matter has a long history, see [[caloric theory]], [[phlogiston]] and [[fire (classical element)]].

The modern understanding of thermal energy originates with   [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]]'s 1798 [[mechanical theory of heat]] (''[[An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction]]''), postulating a [[mechanical equivalent of heat]].
A collaboration between [[Nicolas Clément]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'')  in the 1820s had some related thinking near the same lines.&lt;ref&gt;Lervig, P. Sadi Carnot and the steam engine:Nicolas Clément's lectures on industrial chemistry, 1823-28. Br. J Hist. Sci. 18::147, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled ''The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat'', in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to "produce a unit of heat".
The theory of classical thermodynamics matured in the 1850s to 1860s. [[John Tyndall]]'s ''Heat Considered as Mode of Motion'' (1863) was instrumental in popularising the idea of heat as motion to the English-speaking public.
The theory was developed in academic publications in French, English and German. From an early time, the French technical term ''chaleur'' used by Carnot was taken as equivalent to the English ''heat'' and German ''Wärme'' (lit. "warmth", the equivalent of ''heat'' would be German ''Hitze'').

The process function {{mvar|Q}}  was  introduced by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850. 
Clausius described it with the German compound ''Wärmemenge'', translated as "amount of heat".&lt;ref name=Clausius1850/&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] in his 1871  ''Theory of Heat'' outlines four stipulations for the definition of heat:
* It is ''something which may be transferred from one body to another'', according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]].
* It is a ''measurable quantity'', and so can be treated mathematically.
* It ''cannot be treated as a material substance'', because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance, e.g., [[mechanical work]].
* Heat is ''one of the forms of energy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[process function]] {{mvar|Q}} is referred to as ''Wärmemenge'' by Clausius, or as "amount of heat" in translation.
Use of "heat" as an abbreviated of the specific concept of "amount of heat being transferred"  led to some terminological confusion by the early 20th century. The generic meaning of "heat", even in classical thermodynamics, is just "thermal energy".&lt;ref&gt;"in a gas, heat is nothing else than the kinetic or mechanical energy of motion of the gas molecules". B.L. Loeb, ''The Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1920s, it has been recommended practice to use [[enthalpy]] to refer to the "heat content at constant volume", and to [[thermal energy]] when "heat" in the general sense is intended, while "heat" is reserved for the very specific context of the transfer of thermal energy between two systems.
[[Leonard Benedict Loeb]] in his ''Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927) makes a point of using "quanitity of heat" 
or "heat&amp;ndash;quantity" when referring to {{mvar|Q}}:&lt;ref&gt;From this terminological choice may derive a tradition to the effect that the letter ''Q'' represents "quantity", but there is no indication that Clausius had this in mind when he selected the letter in what seemed to be an ''ad hoc'' calculation in 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;
:After the perfection of thermometry [...] the next great advance made in the field of heat was the definition of a term which is called the quantity of heat.  [... after the abandonment of [[caloric theory]],] It still remains to interpret this very definite concept, the quantity of heat, in terms of a theory ascribing all heat to the kinetics of gas molecules. 
&lt;ref&gt;B.L. Loeb, ''The Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=KNh0PFk7CnwC&amp;pg=PA426 p. 426].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carathéodory (1909)===
A frequent definition of heat is based on the work of [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] (1909), referring to processes in a closed system.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pippard, A.B. (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R., Guggenheim, E.A. (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H.A. (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internal energy]] {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of a body in an arbitrary state {{math|''X''}} can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surroundings when it starts from a reference state {{math|''O''}}. Such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body. It is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately, without error due to friction in the surroundings; friction in the body is not excluded by this definition. The adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls, which allow transfer of energy as work, but no other transfer, of energy or matter. In particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat. According to this definition, work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body. On the other hand, according to Carathéodory (1909), there also exist non-adiabatic, ''diathermal'' walls, which are postulated to be permeable only to heat.

For the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest {{math|''Y''}} is reached from state {{math|''O''}} by a process with two components, one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic. For convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic, and of isochoric adiabatic work. Then the non-adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat, newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer, from the surroundings to the body. The change in internal energy to reach the state {{math|''Y''}} from the state {{math|''O''}} is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred.

Although Carathéodory himself did not state such a definition, following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define heat, {{math|''Q''}}, to the body from its surroundings, in the combined process of change to state {{math|''Y''}} from the state {{math|''O''}}, as the change in internal energy, {{math|Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, minus the amount of work, {{math|''W''}}, done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process, so that {{math|''Q'' {{=}} Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''W''}}.

In this definition, for the sake of conceptual rigour, the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process. It is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables, the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done, for the combined process of change from the reference state {{math|''O''}} to the arbitrary state {{math|''Y''}}. It is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process. It is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state {{math|''O''}} to state {{math|''Y''}}, the change of internal energy, is known, independently of the combined process, by a determination through a purely adiabatic process, like that for the determination of the internal energy of state {{math|''X''}} above. The rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental: energy transferred as work. Energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity. The uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception. The conceptual purity of this definition, based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion, relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality. The second law of thermodynamics, on the other hand, assures us that such processes are not found in nature.

Before the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on Carathéodory's 1909 paper, 
historically, heat, temperature, and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly [[primitive notion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Carathéodory introduced his 1909 paper thus: "The proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century." Referring to the "point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years", Carathéodory wrote: "There exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities (mass, force, pressure, etc.) and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements." [[James Serrin]] introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus: "In the following section, we shall use the classical notions of ''heat'', ''work'', and ''hotness'' as primitive elements, ... That heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by Carnot. Its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept, as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories."&lt;ref&gt;Serrin, J. (1986), p. 5 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, D.R. (1984), pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature, and is by conduction and radiation, from hotter to colder bodies. It is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on "circular reasoning"; against this proposal, there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by Truesdell and Bharatha (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]], Bharatha, S. (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of Carathéodory, recounted just above.

This alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat. It relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts, and used in calorimetry.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; It is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies. Such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work. They include calorimetry, which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins, P.]], de Paula, J. (1978/2010), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic.

In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A.B.]] (1957/1966), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat transfer==
{{main|Heat transfer}}
===Heat transfer between two bodies===
Referring to conduction, [[J.R. Partington|Partington]] writes: "If a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body, the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises, and it is said that a ''quantity of heat'' has passed from the hot body to the cold body."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to radiation, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] writes: "In Radiation, the hotter body loses heat, and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell writes that convection as such "is not a purely thermal phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics, convection in general is regarded as transport of [[internal energy]]. If, however, the convection is enclosed and circulatory, then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies, because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1961"&gt;[[Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the internal energies of each. Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies. Though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts, a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible.

Cyclically operating engines, that use only heat and work transfers, have two thermal reservoirs, a hot and a cold one. They may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body, relative to those reservoirs. In a heat engine, the  working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses heat transfer to produce work. In a heat pump, the working body, at stages of the cycle, goes both hotter than the hot reservoir, and colder than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses work to produce heat transfer.

===Heat engine===
In classical thermodynamics, a commonly considered model is the [[heat engine]]. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.

===Heat pump or refrigerator===
Another commonly considered model is the [[heat pump]] or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.

The device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir, but this is not regarded as by an inanimate agency; rather, it is regarded as by the harnessing of work . This is because work is supplied from the work reservoir, not just by a simple thermodynamic process, but by a cycle of [[thermodynamic operation]]s and processes, which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency. Accordingly, the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of a heat pump is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least.

Functionally, such engines are used in two ways, distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir. A heat pump transfers heat, to the hot reservoir as the target, from the resource or surrounding reservoir. A refrigerator transfers heat, from the cold reservoir as the target, to the resource or surrounding reservoir. The target reservoir may be regarded as leaking: when the target leaks hotness to the surroundings, heat pumping is used; when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings, refrigeration is used. The engines harness work to overcome the leaks.

===Macroscopic view===
{{rewrite section|date=May 2016}}
According to [[Planck]], there are three main conceptual approaches to heat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example in the work of Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka, J.]] (1988), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy. This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry.

Bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 65, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century. It regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature, measured primarily by calorimetry. A calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system, with its own temperature and internal energy; when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer, changes in it measure heat transfer. The mechanical view was pioneered by Helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century, largely through the influence of [[Max Born]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]](1949), Lecture {{math|''V''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept, defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer, the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics, defined by macroscopic mechanics. According to Born, the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter "cannot be reduced to mechanics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter.

Nevertheless, for the thermodynamical description of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to say, when they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.

In this circumstance, it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter, and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

If cross-effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K.G. (1951), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quotations&gt;Denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Professor E.A. Guggenheim]] and with Professor N.K. Adam. From this, Denbigh concludes "It seems, however, that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment, it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter, without already assuming the existence of the 'heat of transport'." Denbigh K.G. (1951), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, D.D. (1962), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.

In many writings in this context, the term "heat flux" is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy; such usage of the term "heat flux" is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a "heat content".&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscopic view===
In the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.&lt;ref name="Kittel &amp; Kroemer"&gt;Kittel, C. Kroemer, H. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. 
In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early and vague expression of this was made by [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, F. (1620).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949), page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949), pages 132–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistical mechanics]], for a closed system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in the values of the energy levels themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Reif (1965), pp.67-68&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)#Microscopic definitions of thermodynamic concepts|mathematical definition]] can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.

===Calorimetry===
{{main|Calorimetry}}
Quantity of heat transferred can be measured by calorimetry, or determined through calculations based on other quantities.

Calorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process. The transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties, for example, temperature rise, change in volume or length, or phase change, such as melting of ice.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell J.C. (1872), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck (1927), Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] work and on the [[first law of thermodynamics]]. Such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory, C.]] (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryan 47"&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1985), Section 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A red-hot iron rod from which [[heat transfer]] to the surrounding environment will be primarily through [[Thermal radiation|radiation]].]]
The discipline of [[heat transfer]], typically considered an aspect of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]], deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated, or converted, or transferred to another system. Although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy, the term ''heat transfer'' encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language.

''Heat transfer'' is generally described as including the mechanisms of [[heat conduction]], [[heat convection]], [[thermal radiation]], but may include [[mass transfer]] and heat in processes of [[phase changes]].

Convection may be described as the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow. From the thermodynamic point of view, heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy, the fluid then transfers ([[advection|advects]]) this increased internal energy (not heat) from one location to another, and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system, again by diffusion. This entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer, although technically, "heat transfer" and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow, but not as a result of flow. Thus, conduction can be said to "transfer" heat only as a net result of the process, but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process.

==Latent and sensible heat==
[[File:Black Joseph.jpg|thumb|120px|Joseph Black]]
In an 1847 lecture entitled ''On Matter, Living Force, and Heat'', [[James Prescott Joule]] characterized the terms [[latent heat]] and [[sensible heat]] as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Prescott Joule|Joule J.P.]] (1884).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quotations&gt;"Heat must therefore consist of either living force or of attraction through space. In the former case we can conceive the constituent particles of heated bodies to be, either in whole or in part, in a state of motion. In the latter we may suppose the particles to be removed by the process of heating, so as to exert attraction through greater space. I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,—that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space." [[James Prescott Joule|Joule, J.P.]] (1884).&lt;/ref&gt; 
He described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles, i.e. [[kinetic energy]].

Latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a [[chemical substance]] or a [[thermodynamic system]] during a change of [[state of matter|state]] that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a [[phase transition]], such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water.&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;Perrot, P. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J.O.E. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heat capacity==
''Heat capacity'' is a [[measurement|measurable]] [[physical quantity]] equal to the ratio of the heat added to an object to the resulting [[temperature]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''molar heat capacity'' is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: [[Mole (unit)|mole]]) of a pure substance, and the ''specific heat capacity'', often called simply ''specific heat'', is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material. Heat capacity is a physical property of a substance, which means that it depends on the state and properties of the substance under consideration.

The specific heats of monatomic gases, such as helium, are nearly constant with temperature. Diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence, and triatomic gases (e.g., carbon dioxide) still more.

Before the development of the laws of thermodynamics, heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies.

Some general rules, with important exceptions, can be stated as follows.

In general, most bodies expand on heating. In this circumstance, heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls, while heating at a constant pressure increases its volume.

Beyond this, most substances have three ordinarily recognized [[states of matter]], solid, liquid, and gas. Some can also exist in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as for example, [[glass]], and [[liquid crystal]]. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s within the 'body'. Definite [[Phase rule|rules]] are known, telling how distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.

All of these, the commonest cases, fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body. Such cases supply what are called [[Thermometer|''thermometric bodies'']], that allow the definition of empirical temperatures. Before 1848, all temperatures were defined in this way. There was thus a tight link, apparently logically determined, between heat and temperature, though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct, especially by [[Joseph Black]] in the later eighteenth century.

There are important exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. They make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, [[Properties of water#Physics and chemistry|water contracts]] on being heated near 277&amp;nbsp;K. It cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.

In the early days of measurement of high temperatures, another factor was important, and used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in his [[Pyrometer#History|pyrometer]]. The temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay. The higher the temperature, the more the shrinkage. This was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. But such shrinkage is irreversible. The clay does not expand again on cooling. That is why it could be used for the measurement. But only once. It is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word.

Nevertheless, the [[Temperature#Thermodynamic approach to temperature|thermodynamic definition]] of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat, with proper circumspection.

=="Hotness"==
According to Denbigh (1981), the property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1981), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others.&lt;ref&gt;Baierlein, R. (1999), p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pippard, A.B. (1957/1966), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing, for example by turbulence, it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature, but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system. If a system has a physical state that is regular enough, and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer, then it has a temperature according to that thermometer. An empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system. Such a temperature is called empirical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mach|Mach, E.]] (1900), section 5, pp. 48–49, section 22, pages 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]] (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Serrin|Serrin, J.]] (1986), especially p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics: "At each time, the body is assigned a real number called the ''temperature''. This number is a measure of how hot the body is."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]] (1969), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness. A physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature. Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold. This is part of the reason why heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.

This is also the reason that the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, ''A'' can heat ''B'' and ''B'' can heat ''C'' and ''C'' can heat ''A''. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.

Just as temperature may be undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system, so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, 'the temperature of the solar system' is not a defined quantity. Likewise, 'the entropy of the solar system' is not defined in classical thermodynamics. It has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy, as a simple number for a whole system, in a clearly satisfactory way.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (2003), page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17077">'''Hot cognition''' is a hypothesis on [[motivated reasoning]] in which a person's thinking is influenced by their emotional state. Put simply, hot cognition is cognition coloured by emotion.&lt;ref name="Brand1985/1986"&gt;{{Citation | title = Hot cognition: Emotions and writing behavior | year = 1985–1986 | author = Brand, A. G. | journal = JAC | pages = 5–15 | volume = 6 | jstor=20865583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot cognition contrasts with '''cold cognition''', which implies [[cognitive processing]] of information that is independent of emotional involvement.&lt;ref name=Roiser2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roiser JP, Sahakian BJ |title=Hot and cold cognition in depression |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=139–49 |year=2013 |pmid=23481353 |doi=10.1017/S1092852913000072 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Roiser/publication/236037717_Hot_and_cold_cognition_in_depression/links/55ad05de08ae98e661a2b04b.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&amp;msrp=eKJt8qSZ7siklAvA1aEmeepeuB1AK-8o62RCvDbqRigLzP_SlwHa91mRHpFkOduwLedldNFM4bZiqJO-V3ubXScUVf_1K1DpCjoVNtbJohg.A7M6iOMLwYghXkDTj2lTZGuACtL7jhZrIspmVbqvEBN5RpmruseKNI3sGILMR_q4wdv9pJWZ2cvlnLJVxCTnMw.M8tyzlLPYV4qxm9hIdlVYAKc7PUs8VBZ2WWljrcejwfNaX6MI-Vr0DfAWeFERcweYlC7Tv5z1Ow5r0JheYxt8Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hot cognition is proposed to be associated with cognitive and physiological arousal, in which a person is more responsive to environmental factors. As it is automatic, rapid and led by emotion,&lt;ref name="LodgeTaber2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=Milton|last2=Taber|first2=Charles S.|title=The Automaticity of Affect for Political Leaders, Groups, and Issues: An Experimental Test of the Hot Cognition Hypothesis|journal=Political Psychology|volume=26|issue=3|year=2005|pages=455–482|issn=0162-895X|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; hot cognition may consequently cause biased and low-quality decision making.&lt;ref name="HuijbregtsWarren2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huijbregts|first1=Stephan C.

Abelson. This idea became popular in the 1960s and the 1970s. An example of a biased decision caused by hot cognition would be a juror disregarding evidence because of an attraction to the defendant.&lt;ref name="Brand1985/1986"/&gt;

Decision making with cold cognition is more likely to involve logic and critical analysis.&lt;ref name="Kunda1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunda|first1=Ziva|title= The case for motivated reasoning.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=108|issue=3|year=1990|pages=480–498|issn=0033-2909|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480|pmid=2270237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when an individual engages in a task when displaying cold cognition, the stimuli is likely to be emotionally neutral and the "outcome of the test is not motivationally relevant" to the individual.&lt;ref name="Roiser"/&gt; An example of a critical decision using cold cognition would be concentrating on the evidence before drawing a conclusion.

Hot and cold cognition form a dichotomy within [[Executive functions|executive functioning]]. Executive functioning has long been considered as a domain general cognitive function, but there has been support for separation into "hot" affective aspects and "cold" cognitive aspects.&lt;ref name="ZelazoMller2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|title=Blackwell Handbook of Childhood Cognitive Development|last2=Mller|first2=Ulrich|year=2002|pages=445–469|doi=10.1002/9780470996652.ch20|chapter=Executive Function in Typical and Atypical Development|isbn=9780470996652}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized that executive functioning spans across a number of cognitive tasks including [[working memory]], [[cognitive flexibility]] and [[reasoning]] in active goal pursuit. The distinction between hot and cool cognition implies that executive function may operate differently in different contexts.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hongwanishkul|first1=Donaya|last2=Happaney|first2=Keith R.|last3=Lee|first3=Wendy S. C.|last4=Zelazo|first4=Philip David|title=Assessment of Hot and Cool Executive Function in Young Children: Age-Related Changes and Individual Differences|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|volume=28|issue=2|year=2005|pages=617–644|issn=8756-5641|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2802_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction has been applied to research in [[cognitive psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], and other areas of study in psychology.

==Development and neuroanatomy==
Performance on hot and cold tasks improves most rapidly during the preschool years,&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt; but continues into adolescence. This co-occurs with both structural and functional development associated with the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Diamond2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Adele|title=Principles of Frontal Lobe Function|year=2002|pages=466–503|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195134971.003.0029|chapter=Normal Development of Prefrontal Cortex from Birth to Young Adulthood: Cognitive Functions, Anatomy, and Biochemistry|isbn=9780195134971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific areas within the PFC are thought to be associated with both hot and cold cognition. Hot cognition is likely to be utilized during tasks that require the regulation of emotion or motivation, as well as reevaluating the motivational significance of a stimulus. The ventral and medial areas of the prefrontal cortex (VM-PFC) are implicated during these tasks. Cold cognition is thought to be associated with executive functions elicited by abstract, deconceptualized tasks, such as card sorting. The area of the brain that is utilized for these tasks is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC). It is between the ages of 3 years and 5 years that the most significant change in task completion is seen.&lt;ref name="ZelazoMller2002"/&gt; Age-related trends have been observed in tasks used to measure hot cognition, as well as cold cognition.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt; However, the age at which children reach adult-like functioning varies. It appears as though children take longer to fully develop hot executive functioning than cold.&lt;ref name="PrencipeKesek2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prencipe|first1=Angela|last2=Kesek|first2=Amanda|last3=Cohen|first3=Julia|last4=Lamm|first4=Connie|last5=Lewis|first5=Marc D.|last6=Zelazo|first6=Philip David|title=Development of hot and cool executive function during the transition to adolescence|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=108|issue=3|year=2011|pages=621–637|issn=0022-0965|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lends support to the idea that hot cognition may follow a separate, and perhaps delayed, developmental trajectory as opposed to cold cognition.&lt;ref name="ZelazoCarlson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zelazo|first1=Philip David|last2=Carlson|first2=Stephanie M.|title=Hot and Cool Executive Function in Childhood and Adolescence: Development and Plasticity|journal=Child Development Perspectives|year=2012|pages=n/a–n/a|issn=1750-8592|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research done on these neurological areas suggests there may be some plasticity during the development of both hot and cold cognition. While the preschool years are ones of extreme sensitivity to the development of prefrontal cortex, a similar period is found in the transition into adolescence.&lt;ref name="ZelazoCarlson2012"/&gt; This gives rise to the idea that there may be a possible time window for intervention training, which would improve cognitive abilities and executive functioning in children and adolescents.

==Assessment==
This section explains the most common tasks that are used to measure hot and cold cognitive functioning. The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"/&gt;

===Hot function tasks===
====Iowa gambling task====
In the [[Iowa gambling task]] participants are initially given $2,000 facsimile dollars and asked to win as much money as possible. They are presented with four decks of cards that represent either a gain or loss in money. One card from each deck is drawn at a time. Consistently choosing a card from the advantageous decks results in a net gain, whereas choosing from a disadvantageous deck results in a net loss. Each card from the disadvantageous deck offers a higher reward than the advantageous deck, but also a higher and more variable loss.

====Delay of gratification====
Studies have been conducted on the concept of delay of gratification to test whether or not people are capable of waiting to receive a reward in order to increase the value of the reward. In these experiments, participants can choose to either take the reward they are immediately presented with or can choose to wait a period of time to then receive a higher valued reward. Hot cognition would motivate people to immediately satisfy their craving for the present reward rather than waiting for a better reward.&lt;ref name="Roiser"&gt;{{Citation | title = Hot and cold cognition in depression | author = Roiser, J.P. | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Education Institute | pages = 1092–8529 | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | issn = 1092-8529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutral versus negative syllogisms tasks====
The influence that beliefs can have on logical reasoning may vary as a result of emotions during cognitive processes. When presented with neutral content,  this will typically lead to the exhibition of the belief-bias effect. In contrast, content that is emotionally charged will result in a diminished likelihood of beliefs having an influence. The impact of negative emotions demonstrates the capability they have for altering the process underlying logical reasoning. There is an interaction that occurs between emotions and beliefs that interferes with the ability that an individual has to reason.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goel | first1 = V. | last2 = Vartanian | first2 = O. | year = 2011 | title = Negative emotions can attenuate the influence of beliefs on logical reasoning | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 121–131 | doi=10.1080/02699931003593942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold function tasks===
The cool tasks are neutrally affective and measure executive function abilities such as cognitive flexibility and working memory. In other words, there is nothing to be gained or lost by performing these tasks. The hot tasks also measure executive function, but these tasks result in emotionally significant consequences.&lt;ref name="HongwanishkulHappaney2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hongwanishkul|first1=Donaya|last2=Happaney|first2=Keith R.|last3=Lee|first3=Wendy S. C.|last4=Zelazo|first4=Philip David|title=Assessment of Hot and Cool Executive Function in Young Children: Age-Related Changes and Individual Differences|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|volume=28|issue=2|year=2005|pages=617–644|issn=8756-5641|doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2802_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self Ordered Pointing====
In this task an array of items is presented to participants. The position of these items then randomly changes from trial to trial. Participants are instructed to point to one of these items, but then asked to not point to that same item again. In order to perform well on this task, participants must remember what item they pointed to and use this information to decide on subsequent responses.

====Wisconsin Card Sort Task (WCST)====
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Task|Wisconsin Card Sort Task]] requires participants to sort stimulus cards that differ in dimensions (shape, colour, or number). However, they are not told how to sort them. The only feedback they receive is whether or not a match is correct. Participants must discover the rule according to dimension. Once the participant matches a certain number of correct cards, the dimension changes and they must rediscover the new rule. This requires participants to remember the rule they were using and cognitively change the rule by which they use to sort.

====Dimensional Change Card Sort Task (DCCS)====
Participants are required to sort stimulus cards based on either shape or colour. They are first instructed to sort based on one dimension (colour) in a trial, and then it switches to the other (shape) in the following trial. "Switch" trials are also used where the participant must change back and forth between rules within a single trial. Unlike the WCST, the rule is explicitly stated and does not have to be inferred. The task measures how flexible participants are to changing rules. This requires participants to shift between dimensions of sorting.

==Recent evidence==
Research has demonstrated emotional manipulations on decision making processes. Participants who are induced with enthusiasm, anger or distress (different specific emotions) responded in different ways to the risky-choice problems, demonstrating that hot cognition, as an automatic process, affects decision making differently. Another example of hot cognition is a better predictor of negative emotional arousal as compared to cold cognition when they have a personal investment, such as wanting your team to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madrigal|first1=R|title=Hot vs. cold cognitions and consumers' reactions to sporting event outcomes|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=18|issue=4|year=2008|pages=304–319|issn=1057-7408|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2008.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, hot cognition changes the way people use decision-making strategies, depending on the type of mood they are in, positive or negative. When people are in a positive mood, they tend to use compensatory, holistic strategies. This leads to a shallow and broad processing of information. In a negative mood people employ non-compensatory, narrow strategies which leads to a more detail-oriented and thorough processing of information. In the study participants were shown movie clips in order to induce a mood of happiness, anger or sadness and asked to complete a decision-making task. Researchers found that participants in the negative mood condition used more non-compensatory, specific decision-making techniques by focusing on the details of the situation. Participants in the positive mood condition used more compensatory, broad decision making techniques by focusing on the bigger picture of the situation. Also, hot cognition has been implicated in automatic processing and [[autobiographical memory]]. Furthermore, hot cognition extends outside the laboratory as exhibited in political process and criminal judgments. When police officers were induced with sadness they were more likely to think the suspect was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ask|first1=Karl|last2=Granhag|first2=Pär Anders|title=Hot cognition in investigative judgments: The differential influence of anger and sadness.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=31|issue=6|year=2007|pages=537–551|issn=1573-661X|doi=10.1007/s10979-006-9075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if police officers were induced with anger there was no difference in judgments. There are also clinical implications for understanding certain disorders. Patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa went through intervention training, which included hot cognition as a part of emotional processing development, did not show any improvement after this training.&lt;ref name="Goel"/&gt; In another clinical population, those diagnosed with bipolar disorder exaggerated their perception of negative feedback and were less likely to adjust their decision making process in the face of risky-choices (gambling tasks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roiser|first1=Jonathan P|last2=Cannon|first2=Dara M|last3=Gandhi|first3=Shilpa K|last4=Tavares|first4=Joana Taylor|last5=Erickson|first5=Kristine|last6=Wood|first6=Suzanne|last7=Klaver|first7=Jacqueline M|last8=Clark|first8=Luke|last9=Zarate Jr|first9=Carlos A|last10=Sahakian|first10=Barbara J|last11=Drevets|first11=Wayne C|title=Hot and cold cognition in unmedicated depressed subjects with bipolar disorder|journal=Bipolar Disorders|volume=11|issue=2|year=2009|pages=178–189|issn=1398-5647|doi=10.1111/j.1399-5618.2009.00669.x|pmc=2670985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Underground hydrogen storage]] is useful to provide [[grid energy storage]] for [[intermittent energy source]]s, like [[wind power]], as well as providing fuel for transportation, particularly for ships and airplanes.

Most research into hydrogen storage is focused on storing hydrogen as a lightweight, compact [[energy carrier]] for [[Hydrogen vehicle|mobile applications]].

[[Liquid hydrogen]] or [[slush hydrogen]] may be used, as in the [[Space Shuttle]]. However liquid hydrogen requires [[cryogenic]] storage and boils around 20.268 [[Kelvin|K]] (−252.882&amp;nbsp;°C or −423.188&amp;nbsp;°F). Hence, its [[liquefaction]] imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent [[Boiling point|boil off]] but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less [[energy density]] ''by volume'' than [[hydrocarbon]] fuels such as [[gasoline]] by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71&amp;nbsp;grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.

[[Compressed hydrogen]], by comparison, is stored quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good [[Energies per unit mass|energy density by weight]], but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it requires a larger tank to store. A large [[hydrogen tank]] will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store the same amount of energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see [[hydrogen tank]]). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307082839/http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2005/hydrogen2005.pdf Energy technology analysis]. International Energy Agency (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; to power the compressor. Higher compression without [[energy recovery]] will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low [[permeation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |title=Modeling of dispersion following hydrogen permeation for safety engineering and risk assessment |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142016/http://h2storage.net/docs/pdf/29/s4/makarov.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-23 |conference=II International Conference "Hydrogen Storage Technologies" Moscow, Russia, 28–29 October 2009 |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Established technologies==

=== Compressed hydrogen ===

Compressed hydrogen is a storage form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures to increase the storage density. Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=8780 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484 |last1=Eberle |first1=Ulrich |first2=Bernd |last2=Mueller |first3=Rittmar |last3=von Helmolt |accessdate=2014-12-19 |doi=10.1039/C2EE22596D |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/FCXClarity/package/index.html |website=Honda Worldwide |title=FCX Clarity |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nissan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |title=X-TRAIL FCV '03 model |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917105718/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/TECHNOLOGY/INTRODUCTION/DETAILS/XTRAIL-FCV/index.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |website=Nissan-global.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid hydrogen ===

BMW has been working on [[liquid hydrogen]] tanks for cars, producing for example the [[BMW Hydrogen 7]]. Japan have liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage at a tanker port in Kobe, and are anticipated to receive the first shipment of liquid hydrogen via LH2 carrier in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savvides|first1=Nick|title=Japan plans to use imported liquefied hydrogen to fuel Tokyo 2020 Olympics|url=https://fairplay.ihs.com/ship-construction/article/4280251/japan-plans-to-use-imported-liquefied-hydrogen-to-fuel-tokyo-2020-olympics |website=Fairplay|publisher=IHS Markit Maritime Portal|accessdate=22 April 2018|date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is liquified by reducing its temperature to -253°C, similar to liquified natural gas (LNG) which is stored at -162°C. A potential efficiency loss of 12.79% can be achieved, or 4.26kWh/kg out of 33.3kWh/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadaghiani |first1=Mirhadi S. |title=Introducing and energy analysis of a novel cryogenic hydrogen liquefaction process configuration|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=2 March 2017 |volume=42 |issue=9 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.01.136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals and research==
Hydrogen storage technologies can be divided into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules are stored (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides are stored.

===Chemical storage===
Chemical storage could offer high storage performance due to the strong binding of hydrogen and the high storage densities. However, the regeneration of storage material is still an issue. A large number of chemical storage systems are under investigation, which involve [[hydrolysis]] reactions, [[hydrogenation]]/dehydrogenation reactions, [[ammonia borane]] and other [[boron hydride]]s, ammonia, and [[Aluminium hydride|alane]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The U.S. Department of Energy's National Hydrogen Storage Project: Progress towards meeting hydrogen-powered vehicle requirements|last = Sunita|first = Satyapal|date = 2007|journal = Catalysis Today|doi = 10.1016/j.cattod.2006.09.022|pmid = |access-date =|volume=120|issue = 3–4|pages=246–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storage in hydrocarbons may also be successful in overcoming the issue with low density.  For example, supercritical hydrogen at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 500 bar only has a density of 15.0&amp;nbsp;mol/L while [[methanol]] has a density of 49.5&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L methanol and saturated [[dimethyl ether]] at 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 7 bar has a density of 42.1&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L dimethyl ether.  These liquids would use much smaller, cheaper, safer storage tanks.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The most promising chemical approach is electrochemical hydrogen storage, as the release of hydrogen can be controlled by the applied electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319917333529|title = Electrochemical hydrogen storage: Opportunities for fuel storage, batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors|last1 = Eftekhari|first1 = Ali|last2 = Baizeng| first2=Fang|date = 2017|journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.08.103|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|issue = 40|pages=25143–25165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the materials listed below can be directly used for electrochemical hydrogen storage.

==== Metal hydrides ====
[[Image:Metal hydride hydrogen.storage.graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.25|Metal hydride hydrogen storage]]
[[Metal hydrides]], such as [[Magnesium hydride|MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium aluminium hydride|NaAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium hydride|LiH]], [[LaNi5H6|LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[TiFeH2|TiFeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[palladium hydride]], with varying degrees of efficiency, can be used as a storage medium for hydrogen, often reversibly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/storage/metal_hydrides.html DOE Metal hydrides]. eere.energy.gov (2008-12-19). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are easy-to-fuel liquids at ambient temperature and pressure, others are solids which could be turned into pellets. These materials have good [[energy density]], although their [[specific energy]] is often worse than the leading [[hydrocarbon]] fuels.

Most metal hydrides bind with hydrogen very strongly. As a result, high temperatures around 120&amp;nbsp;°C (248&amp;nbsp;°F) – 200&amp;nbsp;°C (392&amp;nbsp;°F) are required to release their hydrogen content. This energy cost can be reduced by using alloys which consists of a strong hydride former and a weak one such as in [[Lithium amide|LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lithium borohydride|LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[sodium borohydride|NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Christian|first1= Meganne|last2= Aguey-Zinsou|first2= Kondo François|year= 2012|title= Core–Shell Strategy Leading to High Reversible Hydrogen Storage Capacity for NaBH4|journal= [[ACS Nano]]|volume= 6|issue= 9|pages= 7739–7751|doi=10.1021/nn3030018 |pmid= 22873406}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are able to form weaker bonds, thereby requiring less input to release stored hydrogen. However, if the interaction is too weak, the pressure needed for rehydriding is high, thereby eliminating any energy savings. The target for onboard hydrogen fuel systems is roughly &lt;100&amp;nbsp;°C for release and &lt;700 bar for recharge (20–60 kJ/mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/pdf/efchp_hydrogen3.pdf EU Hydrogen Storage]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative method for reducing dissociation temperatures is doping with activators. This has been successfully used for [[aluminium hydride]] but its complex synthesis makes it undesirable for most applications as it is not easily recharged with hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Reilly | first2 = J. | last3 = Sandrock | first3 = G. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = J. | last5 = Zhou | first5 = W.

Currently the only hydrides which are capable of achieving the 9 wt% gravimetric goal for 2015 (see chart above) are limited to lithium, boron and aluminium based compounds; at least one of the second-row elements or Al must be added. Research is being done to determine new compounds which can be used to meet these requirements.

Proposed hydrides for use in a hydrogen economy include simple hydrides of [[magnesium hydride|magnesium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://neel.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article1281 CNRS Institut Neel H2 Storage]. Neel.cnrs.fr. Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[transition metal]]s and [[complex metal hydride]]s, typically containing [[sodium]], [[lithium]], or [[calcium]] and [[aluminium]] or [[boron]]. Hydrides chosen for storage applications provide low reactivity (high safety) and high hydrogen storage densities. Leading candidates are [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium borohydride]], [[lithium aluminium hydride]] and [[ammonia borane]]. A French company McPhy Energy is developing the first industrial product, based on magnesium hydride, already sold to some major clients such as Iwatani and ENEL.

''[[New Scientist]]'' reported that [[Arizona State University]] is investigating using a [[borohydride]] solution to store hydrogen, which is released when the solution flows over a catalyst made of ruthenium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn10066-new-type-of-hydrogen-fuel-cell-powers-up.html | title=New type of hydrogen fuel cell powers up | publisher= newscientist | accessdate=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Georgia Tech]] performed extensive benchmarking simulations on mixtures of several light metal hydrides to predict possible reaction thermodynamics for hydrogen storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Examining the robustness of first-principles calculations for metal hydride reaction thermodynamics by detection of metastable reaction pathways|author1=Ki Chul Kim |author2=Anant D.

==== Non-metal hydrides ====
The Italian [[catalyst]] manufacturer [[Acta (chemical company)|Acta]] has proposed using [[Hydrazine#Fuel cells|hydrazine as an alternative to hydrogen]] in [[fuel cell]]s. As the hydrazine fuel is liquid at room temperature, it can be handled and stored more easily than hydrogen. By storing it in a tank full of a double-bonded [[carbon]]-[[oxygen]] [[carbonyl]], it reacts and forms a safe solid called [[hydrazone]]. By then flushing the tank with warm water, the liquid hydrazine hydrate is released. Hydrazine breaks down in the cell to form [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] which bonds with oxygen, releasing water.&lt;ref name="The Engineer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/303939/Liquid+asset.htm |title=Liquid asset |work=The Engineer |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-09 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon hydrides and germanium hydrides are also candidates of hydrogen storage materials, as they can subject to energetically favored reaction to form covalently bonded dimers with loss of a hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Zong, J., J.

==== Carbohydrates ====
[[Carbohydrates]] (polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a bioreformer mediated by the enzyme cocktail—cell-free synthetic pathway biotransformation. Carbohydrate provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a solid powder. Carbohydrate is the most abundant renewable bioresource in the world.

In May 2007 biochemical engineers from the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced a method of producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway|year=2007|editor1-last=Melis|editor1-first=Anastasios|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.-H.

==== Synthesized hydrocarbons ====
An alternative to hydrides is to use regular [[hydrocarbon]] fuels as the hydrogen carrier. Then a small [[hydrogen reformer]] would extract the hydrogen as needed by the [[fuel cell]]. However, these reformers are slow to react to changes in demand and add a large incremental cost to the vehicle powertrain.

[[Direct methanol fuel cell]]s do not require a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] over hydrogen. [[Alcohol fuel]] is a [[renewable resource]].

[[Solid-oxide fuel cells]] can operate on light hydrocarbons such as [[propane]] and [[methane]] without a reformer, or can run on higher hydrocarbons with only partial reforming, but the high temperature and slow startup time of these fuel cells are problematic for automotive applications.

===== Aluminum =====
{{Main|Aluminum}}

[[Aluminum]] has been proposed as an [[energy storage]] method by a number of researchers. [[hydrogen]] can be extracted from aluminum by reacting it with water.&lt;ref name="Alchemy white paper"&gt;[http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf White Paper: A Novel Method For Grid Energy Storage Using Aluminum Fuel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531060548/http://www.alcres.com/docs/alydro-energy-storage.pdf |date=2013-05-31 }}, Alchemy Research, April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; To react with water, however, aluminum must be stripped of its natural [[oxide]] layer, a process which requires pulverization,&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web |title=Army discovery may offer new energy source {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory |url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3036 |website=www.arl.army.mil |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; chemical reactions with caustic substances, or alloys.&lt;ref name="Woodall"&gt;{{cite web |title=New process generates hydrogen from aluminum alloy to run engines, fuel cells |url=https://phys.org/news/2007-05-hydrogen-aluminum-alloy-fuel-cells.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the reaction to create hydrogen is [[aluminum oxide]], which can be recycled back into aluminum with the [[Hall–Héroult process]], making the reaction theoretically renewable.

==== Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) ====
[[File:Perhydro-N-Carbazol.PNG|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Reversible hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole]]
Unsaturated organic compounds can store huge amounts of hydrogen. These ''Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers'' (LOHC) are hydrogenated for storage and dehydrogenated again when the energy/hydrogen is needed.

Using LOHCs relatively high gravimetric storage densities can be reached (about 6 wt-%) and the overall energy efficiency is higher than for other chemical storage options such as [[Hydrogen storage#Synthesized hydrocarbons|producing methane from the hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/cite.201100113 | volume=83 | issue=11 | title=Energiespeicherung mittels Methan und energietragenden Stoffen - ein thermodynamischer Vergleich |trans-title=Energy Storage by CO2 [[Methane|Methanization]] and Energy Carrying Compounds: A Thermodynamic Comparison|language=de| year=2011 | journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik | pages=2002–2013 | last1 = Müller | first1 = Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycloalkanes reported as LOHC include cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexane and decalin.

* Formic acid
In 2006 researchers of EPFL, Switzerland, reported the use of [[formic acid]] as a hydrogen storage material.&lt;ref&gt;G. Laurenczy, C. Fellay, P. J.

Pure formic acid is a liquid with a flash point 69&amp;nbsp;°C (cf. gasoline −40&amp;nbsp;°C, ethanol 13&amp;nbsp;°C). 85% formic acid is not flammable.

==== Ammonia ====
{{Further|Ammonia production}}
[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) releases H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an appropriate catalytic reformer. Ammonia provides high hydrogen storage densities as a liquid with mild pressurization and cryogenic constraints: It can also be stored as a liquid at room temperature and pressure when mixed with water. Ammonia is the second most commonly produced chemical in the world and a large infrastructure for making, transporting, and distributing ammonia exists. Ammonia can be reformed to produce hydrogen with no harmful waste, or can mix with existing fuels and under the right conditions burn efficiently. Since there is no carbon in ammonia, no carbon by-products are produced; thereby making this possibility a "carbon neutral" option for the future. Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves. Under compression in an automobile engine it is a suitable fuel for slightly modified gasoline engines. Ammonia is the suitable alternative fuel because it has 18.6 MJ/kg energy density at NTP and carbon-free combustion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AVERY|first=W|date=1988|title=A role for ammonia in the hydrogen economy|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0360319988900377|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=13|issue=12|pages=761–773|doi=10.1016/0360-3199(88)90037-7|issn=0360-3199}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ammonia is a toxic gas at normal temperature and pressure and has a potent odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html The ammonia economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030624/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/webex710.html |date=2008-05-13 }}.

In September 2005 chemists from the [[Technical University of Denmark]] announced a method of storing hydrogen in the form of [[ammonia]] saturated into a salt tablet. They claim it will be an inexpensive and safe storage method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/6567/html/chapter12.htm Focus Denmark]. Netpublikationer.dk (2006-06-13).

==== Amine borane complexes ====
{{Main article|Amine borane complex}}
Prior to 1980, several compounds were investigated for hydrogen storage including complex borohydrides, or aluminohydrides, and ammonium salts. These hydrides have an upper theoretical hydrogen yield limited to about 8.5% by weight. Amongst the compounds that contain only B, N, and H (both positive and negative ions), representative examples include: amine boranes, boron hydride ammoniates, hydrazine-borane complexes, and ammonium octahydrotriborates or tetrahydroborates. Of these, amine boranes (and especially [[ammonia borane]]) have been extensively investigated as hydrogen carriers. During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. Army and Navy funded efforts aimed at developing hydrogen/deuterium gas-generating compounds for use in the HF/DF and HCl chemical [[laser]]s, and gas dynamic lasers. Earlier hydrogen gas-generating formulations used amine boranes and their derivatives. Ignition of the amine borane(s) forms [[boron nitride]] (BN) and hydrogen gas. In addition to ammonia borane
(H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), other gas-generators include diborane diammoniate, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Imidazolium ionic liquids====
In 2007 [[Jairton Dupont|Dupont]] and others reported hydrogen-storage materials based on imidazolium ionic liquids. Simple alkyl(aryl)-3-methylimidazolium N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate salts that possess very low vapour pressure, high density, and thermal stability and are not inflammable can add reversibly 6–12 hydrogen atoms in the presence of classical Pd/C or Ir0 nanoparticle catalysts and can be used as alternative materials for on-board hydrogen-storage devices. These salts can hold up to 30 g L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen at atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ef060481t|title=Hydrogen-Storage Materials Based on Imidazolium Ionic Liquids|year=2007|last1=Stracke|first1=Marcelo P.|last2=Ebeling|first2=Günter|last3=Cataluña|first3=Renato|last4=Dupont|first4=Jairton|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1695–1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphonium borate====
In 2006 researchers of [[University of Windsor]] reported on reversible hydrogen storage in a non-metal phosphonium borate [[frustrated Lewis pair]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reversible, Metal-Free Hydrogen Activation|doi=10.1126/science.1134230|year=2006|last1=Welch|first1=G.

[[Image:Phosphinoboranehydrogenstorage 2.png|center|600px|Phosphino borane hydrogenstorage]]
The phosphino-borane on the left accepts one equivalent of hydrogen at one atmosphere and 25&amp;nbsp;°C and expels it again by heating to 100&amp;nbsp;°C. The storage capacity is 0.25 wt% still rather below the 6 to 9 wt% required for practical use.

==== Carbonite substances ====
Research has proven that [[graphene]] can store hydrogen efficiently. After taking up hydrogen, the substance becomes [[graphane]]. After tests, conducted by dr André Geim at the [[University of Manchester]], it was shown that not only can graphene store hydrogen easily, it can also release the hydrogen again, after heating to 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22689 Graphene as suitable hydrogen storage substance].

Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metal-organic frameworks====
[[Metal-organic framework]]s represent another class of synthetic porous materials that store hydrogen and energy at the molecular level. MOFs are highly crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid structures that contain metal clusters or ions (secondary building units) as nodes and organic ligands as linkers. When guest molecules (solvent) occupying the pores are removed during solvent exchange and heating under vacuum, porous structure of MOFs can be achieved without destabilizing the frame and hydrogen molecules will be adsorbed onto the surface of the pores by physisorption. Compared to traditional zeolites and porous carbon materials, MOFs have very high number of pores and surface area which allow higher hydrogen uptake in a given volume. Thus, research interests on hydrogen storage in MOFs have been growing since 2003 when the first MOF-based hydrogen storage was introduced. Since there are infinite geometric and chemical variations of MOFs based on different combinations of SBUs and linkers, many researches explore what combination will provide the maximum hydrogen uptake by varying materials of metal ions and linkers.

In 2006, chemists at [[UCLA]] and the [[University of Michigan]] have achieved hydrogen storage concentrations of up to 7.5 wt% in MOF-74 at a low temperature of 77 [[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/techbeat/tb2008_0401.htm#hydrogen MOF-74 – A Potential Hydrogen-Storage Compound].

Green Car Congress (2006-03-06). Retrieved on 2012-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers at [[University of Nottingham]] reached 10 wt% at 77 bar (1,117 psi) and 77 K with MOF NOTT-112.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/new-mof-materia.html New MOF Material With hydrogen Uptake Of Up To 10 wt%]. 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most articles about hydrogen storage in MOFs report hydrogen uptake capacity at a temperature of 77K and a pressure of 1 bar because these conditions are commonly available and the binding energy between hydrogen and the MOF at this temperature is large compared to the thermal vibration energy. Varying several factors such as surface area, pore size, catenation, ligand structure, and sample purity can result in different amounts of hydrogen uptake in MOFs.

====Encapsulation====
[[Cella Energy]] technology is based around the encapsulation of hydrogen gas and nano-structuring of chemical hydrides in small plastic balls, at room temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellaenergy.com Cella Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical storage===

In this case hydrogen remains in physical forms, i.e., as gas, supercritical fluid, adsorbate, or molecular inclusions. Theoretical limitations and experimental results are considered &lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Hydrogen Energy.Volume 2:hydrogen Storage, Transportation and Infrastructure. A volume in Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy 2016,Chapter 8 – Other methods for the physical storage of hydrogen {{DOI|10.1016/B978-1-78242-362-1.00008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
concerning the volumetric and gravimetric capacity of glass microvessels, microporous, and nanoporous media, as well as safety and refilling-time demands.

==== Activated carbons ====
Activated carbons are highly porous amorphous carbon materials with high apparent surface area. Hydrogen [[physisorption]] can be increased in these materials by increasing the apparent surface area and optimizing pore diameter to around 7 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sevilla|first=Marta|last2=Mokaya|first2=Robert|date=2014-03-21|title=Energy storage applications of activated carbons: supercapacitors and hydrogen storage|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C3EE43525C|journal=Energy Environ.

====Cryo-compressed====

Cryo-compressed storage of hydrogen is the only technology that meets 2015 DOE targets for volumetric and gravimetric efficiency (see "CcH2" on slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"/&gt;).

Furthermore, another study has shown that cryo-compressed exhibits interesting cost advantages: ownership cost (price per mile) and storage system cost (price per vehicle) are actually the lowest when compared to any other technology (see third row in slide 13 of &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lasher [http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review10/st002_lasher_2010_o_web.pdf Analyses of Hydrogen Storage Materials and On-Board Systems]. DOE Annual Merit Review June 7–11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, a cryo-compressed hydrogen system would cost $0.12 per mile (including cost of fuel and every associated other cost), while conventional gasoline vehicles cost between $0.05 and $0.07 per mile.

Like liquid storage, cryo-compressed uses cold hydrogen (20.3 K and slightly above) in order to reach a high energy density. However, the main difference is that, when the hydrogen would warm-up due to heat transfer with the environment ("boil off"), the tank is allowed to go to pressures much higher (up to 350 bars versus a couple of bars for liquid storage). As a consequence, it takes more time before the hydrogen has to vent, and in most driving situations, enough hydrogen is used by the car to keep the pressure well below the venting limit.

Consequently, it has been demonstrated that a high driving range could be achieved with a cryo-compressed tank : more than {{convert|650|mi|km}} were driven with a full tank mounted on an hydrogen-fueled engine of [[Toyota Prius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/June07/Aceves.html S&amp;TR | Setting a World Driving Record with Hydrogen].

====Carbon nanotubes====
[[Image:Carbon nanotubes.jpg|thumb|upright|Carbon nanotubes]]

Hydrogen carriers based on nanostructured carbon (such as carbon [[fullerene|buckyballs]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]]) have been proposed. However, since Hydrogen usually amounts up to ~3.0-7.0 wt% at 77K which is far from the value set by US department of Energy (6 wt% at nearly ambient conditions), it makes carbon materials poor candidates for hydrogen storage.

====Clathrate hydrates====
[[hydrogen clathrate|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caged]] in a [[clathrate hydrate]] was first reported in 2002, but requires very high pressures to be stable. In 2004, researchers from [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Colorado School of Mines]] showed solid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing hydrates could be formed at ambient temperature and 10s of [[Bar (unit)|bar]] by adding small amounts of promoting substances such as [[THF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1102076|title=Stable Low-Pressure Hydrogen Clusters Stored in a Binary Clathrate Hydrate|year=2004|last1=Florusse|first1=L.

Unlike mobile applications, hydrogen density is not a huge problem for stationary applications. As for mobile applications, stationary applications can use established technology:

===Power to gas===
[[Power to gas]] is a technology which converts [[electricity|electrical]] power to a gas [[fuel]]. There are two methods: the first is to use the electricity for [[water splitting]] and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid; the second, less efficient method is used to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and hydrogen to [[methane]], (see [[natural gas]]) using [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction]]. A third option is to combine the hydrogen via electrolysis with a source of carbon (either carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide from [[biogas]], from industrial processes or via [[Carbon_dioxide_removal#Direct_air_capture_(DAC)|direct air-captured carbon dioxide]]) via [[biomethanation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rathi|first1=Akshat|title=Batteries can't solve the world's biggest energy-storage problem.

This process is highly efficient, as the archaea are self-replicating and only require low-grade (60°C) heat to perform the reaction.

Another process has also been achieved by [[SoCalGas]] to convert the carbon dioxide in raw biogas to methane in a single electrochemical step, representing a simpler method of converting excess renewable electricity into storable natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SoCalGas and Opus 12 Successfully Demonstrate Technology That Simplifies Conversion of Carbon Dioxide into Storable Renewable Energy|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/socalgas-and-opus-12-successfully-demonstrate-technology-that-simplifies-conversion-of-carbon-dioxide-into-storable-renewable-energy-300633313.html|website=prnewswire.com|publisher=prnewswire|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK has completed surveys and is preparing to start injecting hydrogen into the gas grid as the grid previously carried 'town gas' which is a 50% hydrogen-methane gas formed from coal. Auditors KPMG found that converting the UK to hydrogen gas could be £150bn to £200bn cheaper than rewiring British homes to use electric heating powered by lower-carbon sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Energy networks prepare to blend hydrogen into the gas grid for the first time |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/01/06/hydrogen/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2018 |date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays can then be used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen, Fuel cell maker [[Hydrogenics]] and natural gas distributor [[Enbridge]] have teamed up to develop such a [[power to gas]] system in Canada.&lt;ref name="anscombe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anscombe|first=Nadya|title=Energy storage: Could hydrogen be the answer?|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/energy-storage-could-hydrogen-be-the-answer_N5028.html|accessdate=3 November 2012|newspaper=Solar Novus Today|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen. Before switching to [[natural gas]], the German gas networks were operated using [[towngas]], which for the most part (60-65%) consisted of hydrogen. The storage capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GW·h which is enough for several months of energy requirement. By comparison, the capacity of all German pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 GW·h. The transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt;0.1%) than in a power network (8%). The use of the existing [[List of natural gas pipelines|natural gas pipelines]] for hydrogen was studied by NaturalHy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf Naturalhy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118102741/http://www.naturalhy.net/docs/Naturalhy_Brochure.pdf |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets were set by the [[FreedomCAR]] Partnership in January 2002 between the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) and [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. DOE]] (Targets assume a 5-kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system). The 2005 targets were not reached in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscar.org/commands/files_download.php?files_id=82 Hydrogen Storage Technologies Roadmap]. uscar.org. November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The targets were revised in 2009 to reflect new data on system efficiencies obtained from fleets of test cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jun|author2=Sudik, A |author3=Wolverton, C |author4= Siegel, DJ |title=High capacity hydrogen storage materials: attributes for automotive applications and techniques for materials discovery|journal=Chem.

It is important to note that these targets are for the hydrogen storage system, not the hydrogen storage material. System densities are often around half those of the working material, thus while a material may store 6 [[Mass fraction (chemistry)#Mass percentage|wt%]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a working system using that material may only achieve 3 wt% when the weight of tanks, temperature and pressure control equipment, etc., is considered.

In 2010, only two storage technologies were identified as having the potential to meet DOE targets: MOF-177 exceeds 2010 target for volumetric capacity, while cryo-compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds more restrictive 2015 targets for both gravimetric and volumetric capacity (see slide 6 in &lt;ref name="hydrogen.energy.gov"&gt;R.

In [[combinatorics]] (combinatorial mathematics), the '''inclusion–exclusion principle''' is a counting technique which generalizes the familiar method of obtaining the number of elements in the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite [[set (mathematics)|set]]s; symbolically expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''B'' are two finite sets and |''S''| indicates the [[cardinality]] of a set ''S'' (which may be considered as the number of elements of the set, if the set is [[Finite set|finite]]). The formula expresses the fact that the sum of the sizes of the two sets may be too large since some elements may be counted twice. The double-counted elements are those in the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the two sets and the count is corrected by subtracting the size of the intersection.

The principle is more clearly seen in the case of three sets, which for the sets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|.&lt;/math&gt;
This formula can be verified by counting how many times each region in the [[Venn diagram]] figure is included in the right-hand side of the formula. In this case, when removing the contributions of over-counted elements, the number of elements in the mutual intersection of the three sets has been subtracted too often, so must be added back in to get the correct total.

[[Image:Inclusion-exclusion.svg|thumb|Inclusion–exclusion illustrated by a Venn diagram for three sets]]

Generalizing the results of these examples gives the principle of inclusion–exclusion.  To find the cardinality of the union of {{mvar|n}} sets:

# Include the cardinalities of the sets.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the pairwise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the triple-wise intersections.
# Exclude the cardinalities of the quadruple-wise intersections.
# Include the cardinalities of the quintuple-wise intersections.
# Continue, until the cardinality of the {{mvar|n}}-tuple-wise intersection is included (if {{mvar|n}} is odd) or excluded ({{mvar|n}} even).

The name comes from the idea that the principle is based on over-generous ''inclusion'', followed by compensating ''exclusion''.
This concept is attributed to [[Abraham de Moivre]] (1718);&lt;ref name="Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405"&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pg. 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it first appears in a paper of [[Daniel da Silva (mathematician)|Daniel da Silva]] (1854),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pg. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a paper by [[J. J. Sylvester]] (1883).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the principle is referred to as the formula of Da Silva, or Sylvester due to these publications. The principle is an example of the [[Sieve theory|sieve method]] extensively used in [[number theory]] and is sometimes referred to as the ''sieve formula'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc = pg. 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Legendre already used a similar device in a sieve context in 1808.

As finite probabilities are computed as counts relative to the cardinality of the probability space, the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion remain valid when the cardinalities of the sets are replaced by finite probabilities. More generally, both versions of the principle can be put under the common umbrella of [[measure theory]].

In a very abstract setting, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be expressed as the calculation of the inverse of a certain matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1986|loc=pg. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inverse has a special structure, making the principle an extremely valuable technique in combinatorics and related areas of mathematics. As [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Rota|first=Gian-Carlo|title=On the foundations of combinatoial theory I. Theory of Möbius functions|journal=Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie|volume=2|year=1964|pages=340–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the most useful principles of enumeration in discrete probability and combinatorial theory is the celebrated principle of inclusion–exclusion. When skillfully applied, this principle has yielded the solution to many a combinatorial problem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Statement==
In its general form, the principle of inclusion–exclusion states that for finite sets {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, one has the identity
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = {} &amp; \sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| - \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n} |A_i\cap A_j| + \cdots {} \\
&amp; {} \cdots + \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j &lt; k \le n} |A_i \cap A_j\cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \left|A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n\right|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

[[Image:inclusion-exclusion-3sets.png|thumb|Each term of the inclusion–exclusion formula gradually corrects the count until finally each portion of the [[Venn diagram]] is counted exactly once.]]

This can be compactly written as
:::&lt;math&gt;
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{k = 1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \left( \sum_{1 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq n} | A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k} | \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
or
:::&lt;math&gt;
\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{\emptyset\neq J\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,n\}}(-1)^{|J|-1} \Biggl|\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j\Biggr|.
&lt;/math&gt;

In words, to count the number of elements in a finite union of finite sets, first sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least two sets, then add back the number of elements that appear in at least three sets, then subtract the number of elements that appear in at least four sets, and so on. This process always ends since there can be no elements that appear in more than the number of sets in the union. (For example, if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, there can be no elements that appear in more than &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; sets; equivalently, there can be no elements that appear in at least &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; sets.)

In applications it is common to see the principle expressed in its complementary form. That is, letting {{mvar|S}} be a finite [[universal set]] containing all of the {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and letting &lt;math&gt;\bar{A_i}&lt;/math&gt; denote the complement of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|S}}, by [[De Morgan's laws]] we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \bar{A_i}\right| = \left|S - \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| \\
= {} &amp; |S| - \sum_{i=1}^n |A_i| + \sum_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n} |A_i\cap A_j| 
- \cdots + (-1)^n |A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n|.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

As another variant of the statement, let {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be a list of properties that elements of a set {{mvar|S}} may or may not have, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion provides a way to calculate the number of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have none of the properties. Just let {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the subset of elements of {{mvar|S}} which have the property {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and use the principle in its complementary form. This variant is due to [[J. J. Sylvester]].&lt;ref name="Roberts 2009 loc=pg. 405"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Counting integers===
As a simple example of the use of the principle of inclusion–exclusion, consider the question:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2010|loc=pp. 83–4, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::How many integers in {1,...,100} are not divisible by 2, 3 or 5?
Let ''S'' = {1,...,100} and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 2, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 3 and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the property that an integer is divisible by 5. Letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the subset of ''S'' whose elements have property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; we have by elementary counting: |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| = 50, |''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| = 33, and |''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| = 20. There are 16 of these integers divisible by 6, 10 divisible by 10 and 6 divisible by 15. Finally, there are just 3 integers divisible by 30, so the number of integers not divisible by any of 2, 3 or 5 is given by:
:::  100 − (50 + 33 + 20) + (16 + 10 + 6) − 3 = 26.

===Counting derangements===
A more complex example is the following.
 
Suppose there is a deck of ''n'' cards numbered from 1&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Suppose a card numbered ''m'' is in the correct position if it is the ''m''th card in the deck. How many ways, ''W'', can the cards be shuffled with at least 1 card being in the correct position?

Begin by defining set ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is all of the orderings of cards with the ''m''th card correct.  Then the number of orders, ''W'', with ''at least'' one card being in the correct position, ''m'', is

: &lt;math&gt;W = \left|\bigcup_{m=1}^n A_m\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

Apply the principle of inclusion–exclusion,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; \sum_{m_1=1}^n |A_{m_1}| - \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; m_2 \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap A_{m_2}| +\cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; m_2 &lt; m_3 \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap A_{m_2} \cap A_{m_3}| - \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} \sum_{1 \le m_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; m_p \le n} |A_{m_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{m_p}| \cdots. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each value &lt;math&gt;A_{m_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{m_p}&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of shuffles having at least ''p'' values ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; in the correct position.  Note that the number of shuffles with at least ''p'' values correct only depends on ''p'', not on the particular values of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, the number of shuffles having the 1st, 3rd, and 17th cards in the correct position is the same as the number of shuffles having the 2nd, 5th, and 13th cards in the correct positions.  It only matters that of the ''n'' cards, 3 were chosen to be in the correct position.  Thus there are &lt;math&gt;{n \choose p}&lt;/math&gt; equal terms in the ''p''th summation (see [[combination]]).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; {n \choose 1} |A_1| - {n \choose 2} |A_1 \cap A_2| + {n \choose 3} |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| - \cdots \\[4pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} |A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_p| \pm \cdots.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;|A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_p|&lt;/math&gt; is the number of orderings having ''p'' elements in the correct position, which is equal to the number of ways of ordering the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' elements, or (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'')&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Thus we finally get:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
W = {} &amp; {n \choose 1} (n-1)!  - {n \choose 2} (n-2)!  + {n \choose 3} (n-3)!  - \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; \cdots + (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} (n-p)! \pm \cdots. \\[8pt]
W  &amp; = \sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1} {n \choose p} (n-p)!. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;{n \choose p} = \frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!}&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

: &lt;math&gt;
W  = \sum_{p=1}^n (-1)^{p-1}\, \frac{n!}{p!}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A permutation where ''no'' card is in the correct position is called a [[derangement]]. Taking ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; to be the total number of permutations, the probability ''Q'' that a random shuffle produces a derangement is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Q = 1 - \frac{W}{n!} = \sum_{p=0}^n \frac{(-1)^p}{p!}, &lt;/math&gt;

a truncation to ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 terms of the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the probability of guessing an order for a shuffled deck of cards and being incorrect about every card is approximately 1/''e'' or 37%.

==A special case==

The situation that appears in the derangement example above occurs often enough to merit special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 167–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namely, when the size of the intersection sets appearing in the formulas for the principle of inclusion–exclusion depend only on the number of sets in the intersections and not on which sets appear. More formally, if the intersection

:&lt;math&gt;A_J:=\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j&lt;/math&gt;

has the same cardinality, say ''α&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''A&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;''|, for every ''k''-element subset ''J'' of {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr|  =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\binom nk \alpha_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the complementary form, where the universal set ''S'' has cardinality α&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl|S \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr|  =\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k}\binom nk \alpha_k.&lt;/math&gt;

==A generalization==

Given a [[family of sets|family (repeats allowed) of subsets]] ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of a universal set ''S'', the principle of inclusion–exclusion calculates the number of elements of ''S'' in none of these subsets. A generalization of this concept would calculate the number of elements of ''S'' which appear in exactly some fixed ''m'' of these sets.

Let ''N'' = &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {1,2,...,''n''}. If we define &lt;math&gt;A_{\emptyset} = S&lt;/math&gt;, then the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be written as, using the notation of the previous section; the number of elements of ''S'' contained in none of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is:
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{J \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|J|} |A_J|.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I'' is a fixed subset of the index set ''N'', then the number of elements which belong to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'' in ''I'' and for no other values is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{I \subseteq J} (-1)^{|J| - |I|} |A_J|.&lt;/math&gt;
Define the sets

:&lt;math&gt;B_k = A_{I \cup \{ k \}} \text{ for } k \in N \setminus I.&lt;/math&gt;

We seek the number of elements in none of the ''B''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; which, by the principle of inclusion–exclusion (with &lt;math&gt;B_\emptyset = A_I&lt;/math&gt;), is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{K \subseteq N \setminus I} (-1)^{|K|}|B_K|.&lt;/math&gt;

The correspondence ''K'' ↔ ''J'' = ''I'' ∪ ''K'' between subsets of ''N''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''I'' and subsets of ''N'' containing ''I'' is a bijection and if ''J'' and ''K'' correspond under this map then ''B''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, showing that the result is valid.

==In probability==

In [[probability]], for events ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in a [[probability space]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt;, the inclusion–exclusion principle becomes for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A_1\cup A_2)=\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\mathbb{P}(A_2)-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2),&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{P}(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3)=\mathbb{P}(A_1)+\mathbb{P}(A_2)+\mathbb{P}(A_3)
\qquad{}-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2)-\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_3)-\mathbb{P}(A_2\cap A_3)
\qquad{}+\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)
&lt;/math&gt;

and in general

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr) {} =\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(A_i)
-\sum_{i&lt;j}\mathbb{P}(A_i\cap A_j) 
\qquad+\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}\mathbb{P}(A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k)-\ \cdots\ +(-1)^{n-1}\, \mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr),
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written in closed form as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\biggl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\biggr)  =\sum_{k=1}^n \left((-1)^{k-1}\sum_{\scriptstyle I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\}\atop\scriptstyle|I|=k} \mathbb{P}(A_I)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the last sum runs over all subsets ''I'' of the indices 1, ..., ''n'' which contain exactly ''k'' elements, and

:&lt;math&gt;A_I:=\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the intersection of all those ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with index in ''I''.

According to the [[Boole's inequality#Bonferroni inequalities|Bonferroni inequalities]], the sum of the first terms in the formula is alternately an upper bound and a lower bound for the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]]. This can be used in cases where the full formula is too cumbersome.

For a general [[measure space]] (''S'',Σ,''μ'') and [[measurable]] subsets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of finite measure, the above identities also hold when the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the measure ''μ''.

===Special case===

If, in the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle, the probability of the intersection ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; only depends on the cardinality of ''I'', meaning that for every ''k'' in {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} there is an ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\mathbb{P}(A_I) \text{ for every } I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\} \text{ with } |I|=k,&lt;/math&gt;

then the above formula simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}\binom n k a_k &lt;/math&gt;

due to the combinatorial interpretation of the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\binom nk&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if the events &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent and identically distributed]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A_i) = p&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', and we have &lt;math&gt;a_k = p^k&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the expression above simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = 1 - (1-p)^n. &lt;/math&gt;

(This result can also be derived more simply by considering the intersection of the complements of the events &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;.)

An analogous simplification is possible in the case of a general measure space (''S'',Σ,''μ'') and measurable subsets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of finite measure.

==Other forms==

The principle is sometimes stated in the form&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham| Grötschel|Lovász|1995|loc=pg. 1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; that says that if

:&lt;math&gt;g(A)=\sum_{S\;:\;S\;\subseteq\;A}f(S)&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\sum_{S\;:\;S\;\subseteq\;A}(-1)^{|A|-|S|}g(S) \qquad (**)&lt;/math&gt;

The combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle are instances of (**).
{{collapse top|title=Proof}}
Take &lt;math&gt;\underline{m} = \{1,2,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(\underline{m}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;f(S)=\left|\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus S} A_i \setminus \bigcup_{i \in S} A_i\right| \text{ and } f(S) = \mathbb{P} \left(\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus S} A_i \setminus \bigcup_{i \in S} A_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;

respectively for all [[set (mathematics)|sets]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S \subsetneq \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;g(A)=\left|\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i\right|, \quad g(\underline{m}) = \left|\bigcup_{i \in \underline{m}} A_i \right| \text{ and } g(A) = \mathbb{P} \left( \bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i \right),~~ g(\underline{m}) = \mathbb{P} \left(\bigcup_{i \in \underline{m}} A_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;

respectively for all sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is  because [[element (mathematics)|elements]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i \in \underline{m} \setminus A} A_i&lt;/math&gt; can be [[element (mathematics)#notation|contained]] in other &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s (&lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s with &lt;math&gt;i \in A&lt;/math&gt;) as well, and the &lt;math&gt;\cap \setminus \cup\!\text{-}&lt;/math&gt;formula runs exactly through all possible extensions of the sets &lt;math&gt;\{A_i \mid i \in \underline{m} \setminus A\}&lt;/math&gt; with other &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;'s, counting &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; only for the set that matches the membership behavior of  &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; runs through all [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (as in the definition of &lt;math&gt;g(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Since &lt;math&gt;f(\underline{m}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain from (**) with &lt;math&gt;A = \underline{m}&lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\underline{m} \supseteq T \supsetneq \varnothing}(-1)^{|T|-1} g(\underline{m} \setminus T) = \sum_{\varnothing \subseteq S \subsetneq \underline{m}}(-1)^{m-|S|-1} g(S) = g(\underline{m})&lt;/math&gt;

and by interchanging sides, the combinatorial and the probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle follow.

If one sees a number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as a set of its prime factors, then (**) is a generalization of [[Möbius inversion formula]] for [[square-free integer|square-free]] [[natural number]]s. Therefore, (**) is seen as the Möbius inversion formula for the [[incidence algebra]] of the [[partially ordered set]] of all subsets of ''A''.

For a generalization of the full version of Möbius inversion formula, (**) must be generalized to [[multiset]]s. For multisets instead of sets, (**) becomes

:&lt;math&gt;f(A)=\sum_{S\subseteq A}\mu(A - S)g(S)\qquad(***)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is the multiset for which &lt;math&gt;(A - S) \uplus S = A&lt;/math&gt;, and

* ''μ''(''S'') =  1 if ''S'' is a set (i.e. a multiset without double elements) of [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[cardinality]].
* ''μ''(''S'') =  &amp;minus;1 if ''S'' is a set (i.e. a multiset without double elements) of odd cardinality.
* ''μ''(''S'') =  0 if ''S'' is a proper multiset (i.e. ''S'' has double elements).

Notice that ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(A - S)&lt;/math&gt; is just the &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\left|A\right|-\left|S\right|}&lt;/math&gt; of (**) in case &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set.

{{collapse top|title=Proof of (***)}}
Substitute

:&lt;math&gt;g(S)=\sum_{T\subseteq S}f(T)&lt;/math&gt;

on the right hand side of (***). Notice that &lt;math&gt;f(A)&lt;/math&gt; appears once on both sides of (***). So we must show that for all &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;T\subsetneq A&lt;/math&gt;, the terms &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; cancel out on the right hand side of (***). For that purpose, take a fixed &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T\subsetneq A&lt;/math&gt; and take an arbitrary fixed &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \not\in T&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; must be a set for each [[Positive number|positive]] or [[negative number|negative]] appearance of &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of (***) that is obtained by way of the multiset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Now each appearance of &lt;math&gt;f(T)&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of (***) that is obtained by way of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set that contains &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; cancels out with the one that is obtained by way of the corresponding &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A - S&lt;/math&gt; is a set that does not contain &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the desired result.

==Applications==

The inclusion–exclusion principle is widely used and only a few of its applications can be mentioned here.

===Counting derangements===

{{main|Derangement}}

A well-known application of the inclusion–exclusion principle is to the combinatorial problem of counting all [[derangement]]s of a finite set.  A ''derangement'' of a set ''A'' is a [[bijection]] from ''A'' into itself that has no fixed points. Via the inclusion–exclusion principle one can show that if the cardinality of ''A'' is ''n'', then the number of derangements is [''n''!&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''e''] where [''x''] denotes the [[nearest integer function|nearest integer]] to ''x''; a detailed proof is available [[Random permutation statistics#Number of permutations that are derangements|here]] and also see [[#Examples|the examples section]] above.

The first occurrence of the problem of counting the number of derangements is in an early book on games of chance: ''Essai d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard'' by P. R. de Montmort (1678 &amp;ndash; 1719) and was known as either "Montmort's problem" or by the name he gave it, "''problème des rencontres''."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pp. 77-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is also known as the ''hatcheck problem.''

The number of derangements is also known as the [[subfactorial]] of ''n'', written !''n''. It follows that if all bijections are assigned the same probability then the probability that a random bijection is a derangement quickly approaches 1/''e'' as ''n'' grows.

===Counting intersections===
The principle of inclusion–exclusion, combined with [[De Morgan's law]], can be used to count the cardinality of the intersection of sets as well. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\overline{A}_k&lt;/math&gt; represent the complement of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to some universal set ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A_k\, \subseteq\, A&lt;/math&gt; for each ''k''. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i = \overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

thereby turning the problem of finding an intersection into the problem of finding a union.

===Graph coloring===
The inclusion exclusion principle forms the basis of algorithms for a number of NP-hard graph partitioning problems, such as graph coloring.&lt;ref name="bhk"&gt;{{harvnb|Björklund|Husfeldt|Koivisto|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known application of the principle is the construction of the [[chromatic polynomial]] of a graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 211–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipartite graph perfect matchings===
The number of [[perfect matching]]s of a [[bipartite graph]] can be calculated using the principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gross|2008|loc=pp. 208–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of onto functions===
Given finite sets ''A'' and ''B'', how many [[surjective function]]s (onto functions) are there from ''A'' to ''B''? [[Without any loss of generality]] we may take ''A'' = {1,2,...,''k''} and ''B'' = {1,2,...,''n''}, since only the cardinalities of the sets matter. By using ''S'' as the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''A'' to ''B'', and defining, for each ''i'' in ''B'', the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as "the function misses the element ''i'' in ''B''" (''i'' is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function), the principle of inclusion&amp;ndash;exclusion gives the number of onto functions between ''A'' and ''B'' as:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2008|loc=pp.84-5, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j} (-1)^j (n-j)^k.&lt;/math&gt;

===Permutations with forbidden positions===
A [[permutation]] of the set ''S'' = {1,2,...,''n''} where each element of ''S'' is restricted to not being in certain positions (here the permutation is considered as an ordering of the elements of ''S'') is called a ''permutation with forbidden positions''. For example, with ''S'' = {1,2,3,4}, the permutations with the restriction that the element 1 can not be in positions 1 or 3, and the element 2 can not be in position 4 are: 2134, 2143, 3124, 4123, 2341, 2431, 3241, 3421, 4231 and 4321. By letting ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of positions that the element ''i'' is not allowed to be in, and the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the property that a permutation puts element ''i'' into a position in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the principle of inclusion–exclusion can be used to count the number of permutations which satisfy all the restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 177&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the given example, there are 12 = 2(3!) permutations with property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6 = 3! permutations with property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and no permutations have properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as there are no restrictions for these two elements. The number of permutations satisfying the restrictions is thus:
::4! − (12 + 6 + 0 + 0) + (4) = 24 − 18 + 4 = 10.
The final 4 in this computation is the number of permutations having both properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There are no other non-zero contributions to the formula.

===Stirling numbers of the second kind===
{{main|Stirling numbers of the second kind}}

The [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]], ''S''(''n'',''k'') count the number of [[Partition of a set|partitions]] of a set of ''n'' elements into ''k'' non-empty subsets (indistinguishable ''boxes''). An explicit formula for them can be obtained by applying the principle of inclusion–exclusion to a very closely related problem, namely, counting the number of partitions of an ''n''-set into ''k'' non-empty but distinguishable boxes ([[Ordered set|ordered]] non-empty subsets). Using the universal set consisting of all partitions of the ''n''-set into ''k'' (possibly empty) distinguishable boxes, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; meaning that the partition has box ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; empty, the principle of inclusion–exclusion gives an answer for the related result. Dividing by ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remove the artificial ordering gives the Stirling number of the second kind:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=pp. 282&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;S(n,k) = \frac 1 {k!}\sum_{t=0}^k (-1)^t \binom k t (k-t)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Rook polynomials===
{{main|Rook polynomial}}

A rook polynomial is the [[generating polynomial|generating function]] of the number of ways to place non-attacking [[rook (chess)|rooks]] on a ''board B'' that looks like a subset of the squares of a [[checkerboard]]; that is, no two rooks may be in the same row or column.  The board ''B'' is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with ''n'' rows and ''m'' columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The [[coefficient]], ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'') of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in the rook polynomial ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the number of ways ''k'' rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of ''B''. For any board ''B'', there is a complementary board ''B' '' consisting of the squares of the rectangular board that are not in ''B''. This complementary board also has a rook polynomial  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''B' ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') with coefficients ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B''').

It is sometimes convenient to be able to calculate the highest coefficient of a rook polynomial in terms of the coefficients of the rook polynomial of the complementary board. Without loss of generality we can assume that ''n'' ≤ ''m'', so this coefficient is ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B''). The number of ways to place ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete ''n'' × ''m'' "checkerboard" (without regard as to whether the rooks are placed in the squares of the board ''B'') is given by the [[falling factorial]]:
::&lt;math&gt;(m)_n = m(m-1)(m-2) \cdots (m-n+1).&lt;/math&gt;
Letting ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the property that an assignment of ''n'' non-attacking rooks on the complete board has a rook in column ''i'' which is not in a square of the board ''B'', then by the principle of inclusion–exclusion we have:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Tesman|2009|loc=pp.419&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; r_n(B) = \sum_{t=0}^n (-1)^t (m-t)_{n-t}\; r_t(B'). &lt;/math&gt;

===Euler's phi function===
{{main|Euler's totient function}}

Euler's totient or phi function, ''φ''(''n'') is an [[arithmetic function]] that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to ''n'' that are [[relatively prime]] to ''n''. That is, if ''n'' is a [[positive integer]], then φ(''n'') is the number of integers ''k'' in the range 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'' which have no common factor with ''n'' other than 1. The principle of inclusion–exclusion is used to obtain a formula for φ(''n''). Let ''S'' be the set {1,2,...,''n''} and define the property ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be that a number in ''S'' is divisible by the prime number ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''r'', where the [[prime factorization]] of

:&lt;math&gt;n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_r^{a_r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Lint|Wilson|1992|loc=pg. 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) = n - \sum_{i=1}^r \frac{n}{p_i} + \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq r} \frac{n}{p_i p_j} - \cdots = n \prod_{i=1}^r \left (1 - \frac{1}{p_i} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

==Diluted inclusion–exclusion principle==
{{See also|Bonferroni inequalities}}

In many cases where the principle could give an exact formula (in particular, counting [[prime number]]s using the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]]), the formula arising doesn't offer useful content because the number of terms in it is excessive. If each term individually can be estimated accurately, the accumulation of errors may imply that the inclusion–exclusion formula isn't directly applicable. In [[number theory]], this difficulty was addressed by [[Viggo Brun]]. After a slow start, his ideas were taken up by others, and a large variety of [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] developed. These for example may try to find upper bounds for the "sieved" sets, rather than an exact formula.

Let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be arbitrary sets and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; real numbers in the closed unit interval &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Then, for every even number ''k'' in {0, ..., ''n''}, the [[indicator function]]s satisfy the inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Fernández|Fröhlich|Alan D.|1992|loc=Proposition&amp;nbsp;12.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;1_{A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n} \ge \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1}\sum_{1\le i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_j\le n} p_{i_1} \dots p_{i_j} \, 1_{A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_j}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of main statement==

Choose an element contained in the union of all sets and let &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \dots, A_t&lt;/math&gt; be the individual sets containing it. (Note that ''t'' &amp;gt; 0.) Since the element is counted precisely once by the left-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), we need to show that it is counted precisely once by the right-hand side. On the right-hand side, the only non-zero contributions occur when all the subsets in a particular term contain the chosen element, that is, all the subsets are selected from &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \dots, A_t&lt;/math&gt;. The contribution is one for each of these sets (plus or minus depending on the term) and  therefore is just the (signed) number of these subsets used in the term. We then have: 
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; |\{A_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq t\}| - |\{A_i \cap A_j \mid 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq t\}| + \cdots \\[4pt]
&amp; \qquad \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}|\{A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots  \cap A_t\}| \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \binom{t}{1} - \binom{t}{2} + \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\binom{t}{t}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[binomial theorem]],

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = (1-1)^t= \binom{t}{0} - \binom{t}{1} + \binom{t}{2} - \cdots + (-1)^t\binom{t}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\binom{t}{0} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and rearranging terms, we have
: &lt;math&gt;
1 = \binom{t}{1} - \binom{t}{2} + \cdots + (-1)^{t+1}\binom{t}{t},&lt;/math&gt;

and so, the chosen element is  counted only once by the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

===Algebraic proof===
An algebraic proof can be obtained using [[indicator function]]s (characteristic functions of subsets of a set). The indicator function of a subset ''S'' of a set ''X'' is a function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_S \colon X \to \{ 0,1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_S(x) :=
\begin{cases} 
1 &amp;\text{if } x \in S, \\
0 &amp;\text{if } x \notin S.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_A \cdot\mathbf{1}_B = \mathbf{1}_{A\cap B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''A'' denote the union &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i&lt;/math&gt; of the sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle in general, we first verify the identity

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;1_A  =\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \sum_{I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\} \atop|I| = k} 1_{A_I}&lt;/math&gt;|∗}}

for indicator functions, where
:&lt;math&gt;A_I = \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The following function is identically zero

:&lt;math&gt;(1_A-1_{A_1})(1_A-1_{A_2})\cdots(1_A-1_{A_n})\,=\,0,&lt;/math&gt;

because: if ''x'' is not in ''A'', then all factors are 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;0 = 0; and otherwise, if ''x'' does belong to some  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, then the corresponding ''m''th factor is&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. By expanding the product on the left-hand side, equation (∗) follows.

To prove the inclusion–exclusion principle for the cardinality of sets, sum the equation (∗) over all ''x'' in the union of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. To derive the version used in probability, take the [[expected value|expectation]] in (∗). In general, [[Lebesgue integral|integrate]] the equation (∗) with respect to&amp;nbsp;''μ''. Always use linearity in these derivations.

'''Ishvaratva''' in [[Sanskrit]] language is an [[Noun|abstract noun]] meaning '[[Divinity|godhood]]',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Grammar of the Hindi Language|author=Samuel Henry Kellogg|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it also means [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blade: Life &amp; work of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay|author=Brahmachari Rewachand Animananda|publisher=Roy &amp; Son|page=ix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywkaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Purushottama]] (the Lord) conceals and also manifests the qualities at His will, He conceals his qualities like ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|Ananda]]'' ('bliss') and ''Ishvaratva'' ('Lordship') in the ''[[Jiva]]s'' ('Individual Souls') and also conceals His quality of Consciousness in this material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schools of Indian Philosophical Thought|author=Prajanananda|publisher=Firma K. l. Mukhopadhyay 1973|page=253|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hsgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chidabhasa]]'' which constitutes ''Ishvaratva'' is almost an exact likeness of true consciousness on account of its being associated with ''[[Prakrti]]'' in equilibrium and consequently unperturbed by the ''[[gunas]]'' in action. He is ''[[Saguna Brahman]]'' whilst true consciousness is ''[[Nirguna Brahman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isha Upanishat|author=Kaulacharya Satyananda|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrxDAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Ishvaratva&amp;dq=Ishvaratva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1-2UoHlH6ikyAOl7YD4Ag&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvaratva'' is only from the standpoint of ''Jivatva''. Both, ''Ishvaratva'' and ''[[Jivatva]]'', are the apparent modifications of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or [[Brahman]]. Though of mutually opposed qualities they are denoted by word ''tvam'', the ''Atman'' as qualified by the mental states such as 'waking', 'dream' and 'dreamless sleep''. The Mahavakya, [[Tat Tvam Asi]] affirms the identity between [[Brahman]], [[Jiva]] and [[Ishvara]]  ([[Vivekachudamani]] 243-244).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrasekhar Bharti of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=256–257|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sri-Samkaras-VIVEKACUDAMANI-Chandrasekharendra-Bharati/dp/8172764200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-luminosity means being directly cognizable without dependence on anything else; and being different from that is ''hetu'' ('proximal or concomitant cause'). The assumed difference between Brahman that is cognized and the Brahman that cognizes is imaginary (''kalpanika'') because in reality there is no difference. The assumed difference between Brahman on the one hand and ''Jiva'' and ''Ishvara'' on the other is not based on luminosity but on other ''dharmas'' (''jivatva'' and ''ishvaratva'') (Advaita-siddhi 22-23).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita-siddhi|author=Madhusudana Saraswati|url=http://sanskritdocuments.org/sites/snsastri/Advaitasiddhi-dRishyatvam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ishvaratva'' is due to the ''[[Upadhi]]'' of ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]''. By the ''Upadhis'' that are ''avidyatmaka'', ''attatvika'' and ''kalpanika'' by creating divisions in the divisionless and partless Brahman when in reality no divisions whatsoever exist. [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his [[Bhashya]] on [[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]] 2.1.14 explains that name and form constitute the seeds of the entire expanse of phenomenal existence, and which are conjured up by nescience. The omniscient God i.e. Brahman, who diversifies the seed ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI.12), who manifests names and forms ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.iii.2) and creates all forms, gives them names (and entering into them) (Taittirya Aranyaka III.xii.7), is different from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=326–335|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] partitioning the symbol [[Om|Aum]] in three different morae adds a fourth mora-less part corresponding to which there are three different states of consciousness, corresponding to which, again, are different kinds of soul and posits  "the four states of consciousness – wakefulness, the dream, sleep and a fourth name-less state of consciousness (turiya) while teaching that there is an aspect of the Godhead corresponding to these states of consciousness, the last alone being ultimately real. The Absolute of philosophy surpasses even such a theological conception as that of God." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=23|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only to those who regard the Universal Being as immanent in their own Selves, to them belongs eternal happiness, to no one else ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI.12).

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">The '''''Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations''''' (Russian: «Закон О свободе совести и о религиозных объединениях»), also known as the 1997 Law  (Russian: «Закон 1997 года») is a [[Russia]]n law passed and signed by President [[Boris Yeltsin]] on September 26, 1997.&lt;ref name="Law of Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association"&gt;[http://www2.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/freedomofconscienceeng.html], the translation of the law from Stretson University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law redefined the state's relationship with religion, as Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] had defined in on the Law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on Freedom of Worship passed on October 25, 1990, commonly known as the 1990 Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/cedir/cedir/Lex-doc/Ru_l_1990.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[fall of Communism]], Gorbachev had given much-needed breathing room to the practice of religion in Russia, whose culture's heart is Eastern Orthodoxy, but had also opened the door indescriminately and generally to the practice of religion. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] believed that a new law was needed to preserve Russia against what they considered to be the corruption of Orthodoxy.

The law was formulated and pushed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], secular nationalists, and communists alike, with such determination that though Yeltsin vetoed the bill once, he could not legitimately do so a second time.

Written in the law was the upholding of separation of church and state, as well as an interdiction against a state religion.  With that in mind, the following definitions and regulations are given:

==Definitions==
* ''religious organizations:'' at the level of individual church congregations
* ''religious associations:'' whole denominations
* ''religious groups:'' groups without legal status, such as a bible study group

==Regulations==
* Organizations may only be founded by Russian citizens
: ''this ostensibly provided for national security.''

* All associations must have a religious purpose, including:
** a [[creed]],
** regular worship services,
** the conducting of religious education.
: ''aimed at [[Evangelicalism#Evangelical para-church organizations|para-church]] organizations such as [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] and the [[Salvation Army]].''

* No organization may function until they have been registered with the government for 15 years, unless it affiliates with an existing association.  During the wait, the following is forbidden:
** public worship services,
** distribution of literature and materials,
** the hiring of foreign clergy.
: ''this discouraged independent-style and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches such as [[Baptists]].''

* A religious group may be liquidated by the government for any of the following reasons:
** creating an armed [[militia]] unit,
** threatening the integrity of the [[Russian Federation]],
** infringing on the health of its citizens,
** restricting its members from leaving the religion,
** encouraging its members to disobey civic duties.

==Effects==
Religion under the new law became nearly as regulated as it had been in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, though without the official communist hostility.  It did accomplish some expulsion of [[Western culture|Western]] religious work, though it left room for some foreign churches to legitimately register.  There had been on the order of 16,000 registered organizations before the passage of the law, and by 2004 there were 22,000.  By regulating on grounds common among new, foreign organizations, it made it difficult for them to take root, and it succeeded in promoting and securing a privileged place for the Russian Orthodox Church.

On June 22, 2005, debate of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) concluded, that the 1997 Law "creates a complex form of categorization of religions which has led to various forms of discrimination and to the stigmatization of 'non-traditional' religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dimarzio.info/it/docum/finish/7-acm-europe/251-a-case-study-fecris.html|title=A Case Study: FECRIS|last=Besier|first=Gerhard|last2=Seiwert|first2=Hubert|publisher=Lit verlag|year=2012|isbn=978-3-643-99894-1|location=Berlin|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[law]], the '''legislative intent''' of the [[legislature]] in enacting [[legislation]] may sometimes be considered by the [[judiciary]] when interpreting the law (see [[judicial interpretation]]). The judiciary may attempt to assess legislative intent where legislation is ambiguous, or does not appear to directly or adequately address a particular issue, or when there appears to have been a [[legislative drafting error]].

The courts have repeatedly held that when a statute is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry into legislative intent ends at that point. It is only when a statute could be interpreted in more than one fashion that legislative intent must be inferred from sources other than the actual text of the statute.

==Sources==
Courts frequently look to the following sources in attempting to determine the goals and purposes that the legislative body had in mind when it passed the law:

* the text of the bill as proposed to the legislative body
* amendments to the bill that were proposed and accepted or rejected,
* the record of hearings on the topic
* legislative records or journals
* speeches and floor debate made prior to the vote on the bill
* legislative subcommittee minutes, factual findings and reports
* other relevant statutes that can be used to understand the definitions in the statute on question
* other relevant statutes which indicate the limits of the statute in question
* legislative files of the executive branch, such as the governor or president
* [[case law]] prior to the statute or following it which demonstrates the problems the legislature was attempting to address with the bill
* constitutional determinations (Would Congress still have passed certain sections of a statute had it known about the constitutional invalidity of the other portions of the statute?)
*legislative intent, which is the reason for passing the law

==Application==
Courts in the [[United States]] and elsewhere have developed a number of principles for handling such evidence of legislative intent; as an example, many courts have suggested that the comments of those opposing a bill under consideration should be treated with skepticism, on the principle that opponents of a bill may often exaggerate its practical consequences. 

One early example of an important Supreme Court case which relied on legislative intent was ''[[Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.]]'' (1904) 196 U.S. 1, where the court decided that a man may sue the railroad for failing to have an automatic coupler since the legislature was attempting to remedy the problem of multiple injuries by railroad coupling.

Others, most notably [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], have objected generally to the use of such evidence, rather than reliance on the literal language of the statute, arguing that such evidence of "legislative intent" is often created by proponents of a bill to persuade a court to interpret the statute in a way that they were not able to persuade the legislative body to adopt when passing the bill.

These principles of legislative intent often overlap with those principles of [[statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] that courts have developed to interpret ambiguous or incomplete legislation. As an example, the principle that courts should not interpret a statute to produce absurd or unintended results will often be informed by evidence of what the proponents of a bill stated about the objectives to be achieved by the statute.

'''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''' (June 11, 1871 – December 15, 1957) was an American politician, reformer, [[civil rights activist]], and military officer who served 11 terms in the U.S. Congress as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Missouri]] from 1911 to 1933.  In 1898, enrolling in the U.S. Army as a private, Dyer served notably in the [[Spanish–American War]]; and was promoted to Colonel at the war's end.

Working as an attorney in St. Louis, Dyer started an anti-[[usury]] campaign and was elected to Congress as a Republican in 1910. As a progressive reformer, Dyer authored an anti-usury law in 1914 that limited excessive loan rates by bank lenders in the nation's capital, then still governed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Morrow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=James B. |title=Usury The Bugbear of the Poor |newspaper=Boston Daily Globe |date=June 21, 1914 |page=SM 10 |location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horrified by the race riots in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] and [[East Saint Louis]] in 1917 and the high rate of reported [[lynchings]] in the South, in 1918 Dyer was notable for proposing the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]]. In 1920, the Republican Party supported such legislation in its platform from the National Convention. In January 1922, Dyer's bill was passed by the House, which approved it by a wide margin due to "insistent countrywide demand".&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;  The bill was defeated by the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] voting bloc of [[Southern United States|the South]] in [[filibusters]] in the Senate in December 1922, in 1923 and 1924.

In 1919, Dyer authored the motor-vehicle theft law, which made transporting stolen automobiles across state lines a federal crime. By 1956, the [[FBI]] reported that the law had enabled the recovery of cars worth more than $212 million.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; In terms of [[Prohibition]], Rep. Dyer voted against various anti-liquor laws, including the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]].

Dyer served in Congress from the [[62nd Congress]] to the [[72nd Congress]]. He was defeated for re-election during the 1930s of the [[Great Depression]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s programs to put people to work and extend social welfare during the Depression helped attract voters to Democratic candidates.

==Early life and education==
Dyer was born near Warrenton in [[Warren County, Missouri]], the son of James Coleman Dyer and Martha E. (Camp) Dyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/dyer.html "Index to Politicians: Dyer"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 21 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His father's family had roots in [[Virginia]], where his uncle [[David Patterson Dyer]] was born; he was elected as a Republican Congressman from Missouri (1869–71).&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalgraveyard.com/families/10445.html "Dyer Family of Virginia"], The Political Graveyard, accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonidas attended common schools and [[Central Wesleyan College]]. He studied law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and was admitted to the bar in 1893.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=D000591  Dyer, Leonidas Carstarphen, (1871–1957)], ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' accessed 22 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Served in Spanish–American War==
{{main |Spanish–American War}}
When the [[Spanish–American War]] began, Dyer joined the United States Army and served in combat during the Santiago campaign as a private in 1898.  He was promoted to colonel during the war, and served as a member of the staff of [[Herbert S. Hadley]], future Governor of Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==St. Louis attorney and reformer==
{{further |Usury}}
After the war, the young Dyer served as assistant circuit attorney in [[St. Louis]], where he championed an [[usury|anti-usury]] reform campaign that eventually gained national attention.  Dyer successfully represented a railroad clerk who was being charged 34% monthly (''408% annual'') interest on a $100 loan after having paid $480 interest in 14 months.  None of the interest payment to the money lender was used to pay off the [[amortization (business)|principal]]. The money lender, in front of Att. Dyer, tore up the railroad workers loan.  Dyer organized a group of wealthy merchants in St. Louis who through investigations were able to keep interest rates low in Missouri.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

==Congressional career==
[[image:Leonidas C. Dyer Standing.jpg|thumb |250px |Rep. Leonidas C. Dyer from Missouri was elected to Congress in 1910.  Rep. Dyer in 1918 authored the Dyer anti-lynching bill.  Although passed in the House in 1922, the bill was defeated in the Senate by a Southern Democratic [[filibuster]]. Rep. Dyer's motto: "We have just begun to fight."]]
In 1910, Dyer successfully ran and was elected Congressman to the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt; His long career in Congress having begun in 1911, Rep. Dyer was repeatedly re-elected. His time in Congress was briefly interrupted between 1914 and 1915 due to a dispute over 1912 election results, but he was reelected in 1914.

Dyer was defeated for re-election from his district in 1932, 1934 and 1936, and decided to retire from politics. Dyer represented the 12th District of Missouri, which had a majority African-American population. They were disappointed by the Republican failure to pass an anti-lynching bill during the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and attracted to Democratic candidates during the [[Great Depression]], after [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had started some of his work and welfare programs.  Dyer followed [[Harry Coudrey]], also a Republican.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694 Leonidas Dryer Elected Positions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-usury law===
Rep. Dyer continued his anti-usury campaign in 1914 by authoring a law that prevented banks from charging excessive interest rates on loans in Washington D.C., which was then governed by Congress.  Rep. Dyer believed that money lenders went after financially vulnerable people, authorizing loan contracts for unnecessary purposes.  Dyer stated that usury was "an ancient moral crime against the poor and helpless."&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;  He advocated for each state to pass similar anti-usury laws.&lt;ref name="Morrow"/&gt;

===Advocated postal pneumatic tube system===
{{further |Pneumatic tubes}}
On March 29, 1916, Rep. Dyer spoke before a Senate Committee advocating H.R. 10484, to fund a U.S. Postal [[pneumatic tube]] service in St. Louis.  Under the existing service, U.S. mail was transported by compressed air [[vacuum]] tubes in the St. Louis area.  Dyer asked the committee to extend the pneumatic tube service from 2 to 5 miles; at a cost of $50,000.  According to Dyer, the tube extension would promote business and private citizens in East St. Louis by reducing delivery time 11 hours and 50 minutes. By comparison, the city of Boston had 8 miles of U.S. Postal pneumatic tube service.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Post Offices and Postal Roads United States Senate (March 29, 1916), ''Pneumatic Tube Service'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-lynching bill===

====St. Louis riots 1917====

{{further |Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill |Lynching in the United States|Lynching }}
In May 1917, a riot broke out in [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]], where mobs of ethnic white men attacked black workers, [[strikebreakers]] who had been brought in to replace [[American Federation of Labor]] strikers. In July 1917, mob violence broke out in [[East St. Louis]] against blacks, also against a background of competition over jobs. Two white police officers were killed early in the confrontation. In retaliation, ethnic white mobs killed 35 blacks, mutilated the bodies and threw them into the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howard |first1=Marilyn K. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=183|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; White rioters openly targeted and lynched several blacks.  Those who attempted to stop the lynchings were threatened by the white mob with physical violence.  As blacks fled into St. Louis, white rioters threatened to kill them upon their return. The white Illinois National guard brought into quell the riot, participated in the violence against blacks or did nothing to stop the violence.  One black child was shot and thrown into a burning building, while white prostitutes openly attacked black women. After the riots, of the 134 persons indicted, only 9 whites who were put on trial went to prison while 12 indicted blacks who went to trial were imprisoned. Nearly 1/3 of the total 134 persons indicted were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lupton |first1=John A. |last2=Rucker |first2=Walter C. |last3=Upton |first3=James N. |title=Encyclopedia of American race riots |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |pages=188–190|isbn=0-313-33301-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction rate, mathematically, was more than doubled for blacks then for whites.

Dyer was distressed by such mob violence, with its disregard for the courts and the "rule of law". His district in St. Louis had mostly African-American residents and he wanted to protect his constituents and other citizens. Many people from his district had migrated to St. Louis from [[Southern United States|the South]], in the exodus known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. They settled in St. Louis where industrialization had led to a strong economy and an increase in jobs. The economy had also attracted numerous immigrants from Europe and competition for work was high.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;  Dyer also knew of the continuing high rate of lynchings, mostly of blacks by whites in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Working with [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], who had been working on a national anti-lynching campaign, Dyer helped develop and agreed to sponsor anti-lynching legislation.&lt;ref name="neh"/&gt;  
[[image:Lynching2.jpg|thumb|175px |left |Mob violence and lynching were common against African Americans in the South from the 1890s through the 1920s.]]

====Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill introduced 1918====
Calling for an end to mob violence, on April 1, 1918, Dyer introduced the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], which would have made lynching a federal crime.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In his speech, he anticipated some members likely objections about the federal government sponsoring "social" legislation, and noted that lynching violated individuals' rights under the 14th Amendment. In addition, he noted that Congress had passed child labor laws and the Prohibition amendment. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Congress has felt its duty to do these things, why should it not also assume jurisdiction and enact laws to protect the lives of citizens of the United States against lynch law and mob violence? Are the rights of property, or what a citizen shall drink, or the ages and conditions under which children shall work, any more important to the Nation than life itself?&lt;ref name="BAIC"&gt;[http://baic.house.gov/historical-essays/essay.html?intID=5&amp;intSectionID=29 "Anti-Lynching Legislation Renewed"], Historical Essay: ''The Negroes' Temporary Farewell: Jim Crow and the Exclusion of African Americans from Congress, 1887–1929'', ''Black Americans in Congress, US Congress, accessed 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Black leaders in the North had insisted that the Republican Party National platform for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation. After the election, the black community complained when months passed without Harding's getting a bill introduced and passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Harvier"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/07/09/107065716.pdf Ernest Harvier, "Political Effect of the Dyer Bill: Delay in Enacting Anti-Lynching Law Diverted Thousands of Negro Votes"], ''New York Times'', 9 July 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer introduced a revised version of the bill in the House of Representatives in 1921.  Due to "insistent country-wide demand," it passed on January 22, 1922.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; The first such federal legislation to gain House passage in the twentieth century, it would have enabled the federal government to prosecute the crime. Southern authorities seldom did so. In the South, most blacks had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] from 1890–1911 by constitutional changes and discriminatory legislation after southern Democrats regained power in the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol.17, 2000], accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to vote, blacks were disqualified from serving on juries or holding any political office; they had virtually no political power within the official system. In the few cases that came to trial, [[all-white jury|all-white juries]] generally never convicted a white man of lynching a black.

The Republican President [[Warren G. Harding]] spoke in favor of Dyer's anti-lynching bill at an appearance in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama. With high interest in the bill across the country, it passed the House on January 26, 1922, with the help of Liberal Republicans and eight Democratic Representatives, and went on to the Senate. President Harding stated he would sign the bill if it was passed by the Senate&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

Proponents of Dyer's anti-lynching bill believed that lynching and mob violence took away African-American citizens' rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. These rights included a speedy and fair trial by an impartial jury. Other citizen rights included the right to be informed of the nature of the crime accused, the ability to have witnesses in the defense's favor, and to be represented by council in court.&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; Many blacks felt betrayed by the Republicans due to the bill's slow process to the Senate. A silent protest march by many blacks took place in front of the Capital grounds and White House in 1922 while the bill's constitutionality was being contemplated. A protest sign read, "Congress discusses constitutionality while the smoke of burning bodies darkens the heavens."&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt;

====Senate filibuster 1922====
[[image:U.S. Senator Lee Slater Overman.jpg|thumb|175px |right |U.S. Sen. [[Lee Slater Overman]] from North Carolina, Harris &amp; Ewing, 1914.&lt;br&gt; Southern Democratic senators filibustered the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill in December 1922 and twice more to prevent its passage.]]
After Dyer's bill reached the Senate and received a favorable report from the [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary Committee]], some Republican senators, including most prominently [[William Borah]], an otherwise progressive Senator from [[Idaho]], spoke against it. Borah was concerned about issues of [[state sovereignty]] and believed that the bill was not constitutional.&lt;ref name="neh"&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/naacp%E2%80%99s-anti-lynching-campaign-1920s#sect-background "Lesson 1: NAACP’s Anti-Lynching Campaign in the 1920s"], ''NAACP's Anti-Lynching Campaigns'', 22 December 2009, Edsitement, National Endowment for the Humanities, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially concerned about the clause that provided for federal authorities to punish state officials "remiss in the suppression of lynchings."&lt;ref name="NYTCalder"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/05/30/107058655.pdf "Calder Is Friend of Negro, He Insists"], ''New York Times'', 22 May 1922, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;[http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm  "Proceedings of the U.S. Senate on June 13, 2005 regarding the "Senate Apology" as Reported in the 'Congressional Record'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322090032/http://www.electricprint.com/academic/department/AandL/AAS/ANNOUNCE/vra/lynch/congress/congress1.htm |date=March 22, 2012 }}, "Part 3, Mr. Craig", at African American Studies, University of Buffalo, accessed 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolonged [[filibuster]] by Southern white Democrats prevented consideration of the bill and defeated it. After the Democrats had held up voting on all the national business in the Senate for a week in December 1922 by their filibuster, the Republicans realized they could not overcome the tactic and finally conceded defeat on Dyer's bill.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Senator [[Lee S. Overman]] of North Carolina told the ''New York Times'' that the "good negroes of the South did not want the legislation for 'they do not need it'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/03/109338699.pdf "Filibuster Kills Anti-Lynching Bil"], ''New York Times'', 3 December 1922, accessed 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath and legacy====
Following the defeat of his first bill in the Senate in 1922, Dyer tried unsuccessfully two more times to get it passed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; Some of the bill's opponents claimed that the threat of lynching protected white women from sexual advances from black men.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; The studies by the journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] in the late 1890s had shown that black lynch victims were accused or rape or attempted rape only one third of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ida B. Wells, ''Southern Horrors'' (1892)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the murders of blacks were an extreme form of white extrajudicial punishment and community control, often targeting blacks who were economic competitors with whites, who were trying to advance in society, who were in debt to landowners (settlement season for [[sharecroppers]] was a time of high rates of lynchings in rural areas), or those who failed to "stay in their place".&lt;ref name="whowaslynched"&gt;[http://www.nellpainter.com/cv/articles/32_WhoWasLynched.html Nell Painter, "Who Was Lynched?"], reprinted from ''The Nation'', 11 November 1991, Vol. 253, Issue 16, p. 16, Nell Painter Website, accessed 1 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, according to the Pittsburgh ''Gazette Times'', many Southerners viewed the practice of lynching as a [[sport|sporting event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mississippi's 'Orderly' Lynching |newspaper=The Gazette Times |location=Pittsburgh |date=June 28, 1919 |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yLZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m2gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2143%2C4208920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, to gain national support for his anti-lynching bill, which was to be heard again that year in the Senate, Dyer toured the western United States to generate public support. His motto for his anti-lynching campaign was "We have just begun to fight." (This was the statement made famous by [[John Paul Jones]].)  Dyer attracted mixed black and white audiences in [[Denver]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Los Angeles, [[Omaha]], and Chicago.  He thanked the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) for supporting his bill and praised their continuing to publicize the terrible human toll of lynching in the United States. In Chicago, 4000 people attended his anti-lynching rally. Dyer's campaign received positive coverage by the white mainstream press, which helped strengthen an anti-lynching movement in the West.&lt;ref&gt;"Lynching", ''The Crisis'' (July, 1923), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The national attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign may have helped reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers by the tens of thousands were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, and a chance to escape [[Jim Crow]] laws and violence. By 1934, when the [[Edward Costigan|Costigan]]-[[Robert F. Wagner|Wagner]] anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt; In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; he added that he believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.
 
The political power of the white Democrats in the South came from their having disfranchised most blacks from 1890–1910. The South was essentially a one-party, Democratic region in which only whites voted and held office, well into the 1960s, but Congressional representation was based on the total population. The situation of disfranchisement did not change markedly until passage in the 1960s of federal [[civil rights]] legislation that protected and enforced the constitutional rights of voting and citizenship for African Americans and other minorities.

From 1882–1968, "... nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; None was approved by the Senate because of the powerful opposition of the Southern Democratic voting bloc. In June 2005, through passing a bipartisan resolution sponsored by senators [[Mary Landrieu]] of Louisiana and [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] of Virginia, the US Senate officially apologized for not having passed an anti-lynching law "when it was most needed."&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159348,00.html Associated Press, "Senate Apologizes for Not Passing Anti-Lynching Laws"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-automobile theft law===
In 1919, Rep. Dyer authored an anti-crime law that made transporting stolen cars across state borders a federal crime, to be prosecuted by federal law enforcement.  In 1956, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] said that the law had led to the recovery of 227,752 stolen automobiles worth $212,679,296.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;

===Advocated Philippine independence===
In December 1922, Rep. Dyer had traveled to the [[Philippines]], then a U.S. territory,  according to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]].  On December 22, Rep. Dyer spoke before the Philippine Senate in [[Manila]], stating that he believed the Philippines would be independent by the next Congress.  Rep. Dyer stated he favored Philippine independence. He said that the US would always "be proud of the Philippines and what we have accomplished here for the [[Filipinos]] and for the American people."&lt;ref&gt;"Sees Philippines Free", ''New York Times'' (December 23, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines were granted commonwealth status in 1935 and finally given independence in 1946.

===Contraband liquor stock===
The [[New York Curb Exchange]] (NYCE) on April 10, 1929, had received a letter written by Rep. Dyer that demanded he be returned money after he had bought and sold at a loss Canadian whiskey company [[Hiram Walker]] stock.  Rep. Dyer contended he did not know that company made liquor, a contraband product in the U.S. during Prohibition and was forced to sell at a loss.  Rep. Dyer believed Hiram Walker and other company liquor stocks had been sold on the NYCE without acknowledgement that these were whiskey companies.&lt;ref name="Congressman"&gt;The Atlanta Constitution (Apr 11, 1929), Congressman Asks Return of Losses On Whisky Stock&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer had voted against the Prohibition [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]], the [[Volstead Act]], the Volstead Act over-riding Presidential veto, and the Jones law. These laws authorized federal enforcement and essentially prohibited the sale of liquor in the United States.&lt;ref name="Congressman"/&gt; Saint Louis had a large beer-brewing industry, and before Prohibition, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state in the country.&lt;ref name="missouriwinecountry.com"&gt;[http://www.missouriwinecountry.com/articles/history/ Brett Dufur, "History of Missouri Wine Industry"], Missouri Wine Country, accessed 19 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Both industries had been started and developed by German immigrants to the state. Prohibition would seriously damage the economies of Dyer's major city and state.

===Terms and voting record===
Rep. Dyer served 11 terms in office for Missouri's 12th District. During his second term in office, on June 19, 1914 Dyer was suspended from taking his seat in the House of Representatives due to contested voting election returns in 1912 in Missouri's 12th District. According to the ''New York Times'', Dyer had nothing to do with the voting fraud.  The House voted to unseat Dyer, who was active in legislative work, by a 147 to 98 vote.  During the vote to oust Dyer, 22 Representatives voted "present", rather than give a vote for or against. By a 126 to 108 vote to replace Dyer, the House seated a Democrat, [[Michael Joseph Gill|Michael J. Gill]], who took the oath of office.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (June 20, 1914), "Ballot Frauds Cost Seat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill served in the House from June 19, 1914, until March 3, 1915.  He was defeated by Dyer in the 1914 elections.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,'' [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000190 Gill, Michael Joseph, (1864–1918)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. Dyer's voted 1556 times out of 2,035 Congressional roll calls.  He missed voting 482 times, or 28%, in the Congressional time frame starting on April 5, 1911, and ending on March 1, 1933.&lt;ref name="Leonidas Dyer Elected Positions"/&gt; The two time periods when Rep. Dyer missed voting 80% of the time were April–June 1912, and October–December 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Govtrac.us, [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=403694&amp;tab=votes "Leonidas Dyer Missing Votes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement from public office==
Dyer ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"/&gt; Black voters had been disappointed that the Republicans had failed to deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, part of the national platform in 1920,&lt;ref name="Harvier"/&gt; and by President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]]'s approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the [[Works Progress Administration]] and providing social aid programs.

After three successive defeats, Dyer retired from politics and returned to private law practice as an attorney.&lt;ref name="howard"/&gt;

==Death==
Dyer died in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]] on December 15, 1957, at the age of 86.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;"Ex-Rep. Dyer Dies at 86 in St. Louis", ''The Los Angeles Times'' (Dec 17, 1957), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Dyer was buried in the Oak Grove Cemetery in Saint Louis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12141068 Find a Grave] (2005), ''Leonidas Carstarphen Dyer''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be "crippling" psychologically.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful  pregnancies and children.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  A woman can grieve the "loss of a future child" and question her own role as a mother.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/grief-after-miscarriage#1|title=Grief After Miscarriage|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2011dil/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}
&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1600">In [[biogeography]], particularly [[phytogeography]], the '''nunatak hypothesis''' about the origin of a biota in formerly glaciated areas is the idea that some or many species have survived the inhospitable period on icefree land such as [[nunatak]]s. Its antithesis is the ''[[tabula rasa#Biogeography|tabula rasa hypothesis]]'', which posits that all species have immigrated into completely denuded land after the retreat of glaciers.

By the mid-20th Century, the nunatak hypothesis was widely accepted among biologists working on the floras of [[Greenland]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/pdf/aegisdottir2004.pdf Ægisdóttir, Hafdís Hanna &amp; Þórhallsdóttir, Þóra Ellen (2004) Theories on migration and history of the North-Atlantic flora: a review. JÖKULL No. 54: 1-15]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while modern geology has established the presence of icefree areas during the last glacial maximum in both [[Greenland]] and [[Scandinavia]], molecular techniques have revealed limited between-region genetic differentiation in many [[Arctic]] [[taxon|taxa]], strongly suggesting a general capacity for long-distance dispersal among polar organisms. This does not directly disprove glacial survival. But it makes it less necessary as an explanation. Moreover, populations that survived on icefree land have probably in most cases been genetically flooded by postglacial immigrants.

The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") originates from the [[S-L-M|same root]] as the word ''[[Islam]]''.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{OEtymD|Islam|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

The ideal society according to the [[Qur’an]] is [[Dar as-Salam]], literally, ''"the house of peace"''  of which it intones: ''And Allah invites to the 'abode of peace' and guides whom He pleases into the right path.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/010.qmt.html Qur'an 10:25]; Lewis, Bernard, The Crisis of Islam, 2001 Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], there will be an era in which justice, plenty, abundance, well-being, security, peace, and brotherhood will prevail among humanity, and one in which people will experience love, self-sacrifice, tolerance, compassion, mercy, and loyalty. Muhammad said{{cn|date=June 2017}} that this blessed period will be experienced through the mediation of the [[Mahdi]], who will come in the end times to save the world from chaos, injustice, and moral collapse. He will eradicate godless ideologies and bring an end to the prevailing injustice. Moreover, he will make religion like it was in the days of Muhammad, cause the Qur'an's moral teachings to prevail among humanity, and establish peace and well-being throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar fi `Alamat al-Mahdi al-Muntazar, 23, 34, 50, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">{{Redirect|Product space||The Product Space}}
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''product space''' is the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of [[topological space]]s equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the '''product topology'''.  This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the [[box topology]], which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces.  However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a [[product (category theory)|categorical product]] of its factors, whereas the box topology is [[Comparison of topologies|too fine]]; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural".

==Definition==
Given ''X'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i \in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;

is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[index set|indexed]] by &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where each ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is open in ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for only finitely many ''i''. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the set of all Cartesian products between one basis elements from each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for a finite product, the set of all &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the (chosen) basis of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, is a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The product topology on ''X'' is the topology generated by sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), where  ''i'' is in ''I ''  and ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an open subset of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In other words, the sets {''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')} form a [[subbase]] for the topology on ''X''. A [[subset]] of ''X'' is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]] of finitely many sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''). The ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are sometimes called [[open cylinder]]s, and their intersections are [[cylinder set]]s.

In general, the product of the topologies of each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' forms a basis for what is called the [[box topology]] on ''X''. In general, the box topology is [[finer topology|finer]] than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.

== Examples ==

If one starts with the [[standard topology]] on the [[real line]] '''R''' and defines a topology on the product of ''n'' copies of '''R''' in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary [[Euclidean topology]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[Cantor set]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the product of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the [[discrete space]] {0,1} and the space of [[irrational number]]s is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the [[natural number]]s, where again each copy carries the discrete topology.

Several additional examples are given in the article on the [[initial topology]].

== Properties ==

The product space ''X'', together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following [[universal property]]: If ''Y'' is a topological space, and for every ''i'' in ''I'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a continuous map, then there exists ''precisely one'' continuous map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' such that for each ''i'' in ''I'' the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[Image:CategoricalProduct-02.png|center|Characteristic property of product spaces]]
This shows that the product space is a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. It follows from the above universal property that a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous [[if and only if]] ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' o ''f'' is continuous for all ''i'' in ''I''. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous. Checking whether a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous in some way.

In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[open map]]s. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The converse is not true: if ''W'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of the product space whose projections down to all the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are open, then ''W'' need not be open in ''X''. (Consider for instance ''W'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; \ (0,1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) The canonical projections are not generally [[closed map]]s (consider for example the closed set &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid xy = 1\},&lt;/math&gt; whose projections onto both axes are '''R''' \ {0}).

The product topology is also called the ''topology of pointwise convergence'' because of the following fact: a [[sequence]] (or [[Net (mathematics)|net]]) in ''X'' converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; converge. In particular, if one considers the space ''X'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[real number|real]] valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s on ''I'', convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.

Any product of closed subsets of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a closed set in ''X''.

An important theorem about the product topology is [[Tychonoff's theorem]]: any product of [[compact space]]s is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

== Relation to other topological notions ==
* Separation
** Every product of [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[Hausdorff space]]s is Hausdorff&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=4317|title=Product topology preserves the Hausdorff property}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Every product of [[regular space]]s is regular
** Every product of [[Tychonoff space]]s is Tychonoff
** A product of [[normal space]]s ''need not'' be normal
* Compactness
** Every product of compact spaces is compact ([[Tychonoff's theorem]])
** A product of [[locally compact space]]s ''need not'' be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact ''is'' locally compact (This condition is sufficient and necessary). 
* Connectedness
** Every product of [[connectedness|connected]] (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected)
** Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.
* Metric spaces
** Countable products of [[metric space]]s are [[metric space|metrizable]]

==Axiom of choice==
The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.

The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, [[Tychonoff's theorem]] on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''pulation square''' (also called a '''Doolittle diagram''') is a diagram that is simultaneously a [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]] square and a [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] square. It is a [[Dual (category theory)|self-dual]] concept.

== Film career ==

After graduating in 1977 from the Architectural Institute in [[Alma-Ata]], Nugmanov enrolled at the prestigious [[VGIK|Moscow State Film Institute]] (VGIK), the world's first institute of [[cinematography]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brashinsky |first=Michael |year=2000 |title=Igla |journal=International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5212/is_2000/ai_n19127240 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His directorial debut, ''[[The Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]'', premiered in September 1988 at the "Golden Duke" Festival in Odessa, where it won the Un Certain Regard prize. Starring popular Soviet rock musician [[Viktor Tsoi]], it was one of the first films to break the [[taboo]] against talking about [[drug addiction]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="drieu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drieu |first=Cloe |date=October 2000 |title=Don't Blink Now, It's Kazakhstan  |journal=UNESCO Courier |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_2000_Oct/ai_66495271 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the [[USSR]] in February 1989 with 1,000 prints in circulation and became a [[box office]] hit viewed by over 30 million cinemagoers.&lt;ref name="drucker"/&gt; The film was also a critical success, winning First Prize at the [[Perspektive - Filmfestival der Menschenrechte|Nuremberg Film Festival]] and initiating the "Kazakh New Wave". He declared, in 1990, the motto of the New Wave of Kazakh cinema: "We demand no unified philosophy nor uniform artistic views on art. We are unified, instead, in our freedom and love of art".&lt;ref&gt;"Tysiacha i odna zabota," ''Iskusstuo kino'' 4 [1990]: 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Nugmanov served as President of the Union of Kazakh Filmmakers from 1989 until 1992, when he wrote, directed and produced ''[[The Wild East]]'', a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[punk subculture|punk]] [[samurai]] [[Ostern]] which attracted international acclaim at [[film festival]]s in [[Venice]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Tokyo]], and was awarded the Prix Special du Jury in [[Valenciennes]], France. The film marked the end of both the Kazakh New Wave and Nugmanov's active directorial career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Responsible government''' is a conception of a [[system of government]] that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=28 July 2005|accessdate=14 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213045132/http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/SARC/E-Democracy/Final_Report/Glossary.htm|archivedate=13 December 2007|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/SARC/E-Democracy/Final_Report/Glossary.htm|title=Victorian Electronic Democracy, Final Report – Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments (the equivalent of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]]) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either [[Presidential system|in full]] or [[Semi-presidential system|in part]]. If the parliament is [[bicameral]], then the government is responsible first to the parliament's [[lower house]], which is more representative than the [[upper house]], as it has more members and they are always [[Direct election|directly elected]].

Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers must have the privileges of the "floor", which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}  Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the [[head of state]] and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.

Lastly, the head of state is in turn required to effectuate their executive power only through these responsible ministers. They must never attempt to set up a "shadow" government of executives or advisors and attempt to use them as instruments of government, or to rely upon their "unofficial" advice. They are bound to take no decision or action that is put into effect under the color of their executive power without that action being as a result of the counsel and advisement of their responsible ministers. Their ministers are required to counsel them (i.e., explain to them and be sure they understand any issue that they will be called upon to decide) and to form and have recommendations for them (i.e., their [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] or advisement) to choose from, which are the ministers' formal, reasoned, recommendations as to what course of action should be taken.

An exception to this is [[Israel]], which operates under a simplified version of the [[Westminster system]].

== Canada ==
In the Canadian system, responsible government was developed between 1846 and 1850, with the executive Council formulating policy with the assistance of the legislative branch the legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system whereby the governor took advice from an executive Council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money. &lt;ref&gt;Phillip A. Buckner, ''The Transition to Responsible Government: British Policy in British North America, 1815-1850'' (1985) ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of elected legislative assemblies starting with [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly| Nova Scotia]] in 1758, governors and their executive councils did not require the consent of elected legislators in order to carry out all their roles.  It was only in the decades leading up to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 that the governing councils of those [[British North America]]n colonies became responsible to the elected representatives of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/compendium/web-content/c_d_responsiblegovernmentministerialaccountability-e.htm | title = Responsible Government and Ministerial Responsibility | date = October 2015 | publisher = Parliament of Canada | access-date = 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsible government was a major element of the gradual development of Canada towards independence. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with [[self-governing colony|self-government]] than with parliamentary accountability; hence there is the notion that the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] "gave up responsible government" when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933, as a result of financial problems. It did not regain responsible government until it became a [[province of Canada]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/responsible-government-1855-to-1933.php | title = Responsible Government, 1855-1933 | date = 2016 | publisher = Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Website | access-date = 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], the British government became more sensitive to unrest in its remaining colonies with large populations of European-descended colonists. Elected assemblies were introduced to both [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] with the [[Constitutional Act 1791| Constitutional Act of 1791]]. Many reformers thought that these assemblies should have some control over the executive power, leading to political unrest between the governors and assemblies in both Upper and Lower Canada. The [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] of Upper Canada [[Sir Francis Bond Head]] wrote in one dispatch to London that if responsible government were implemented "Democracy, in the worst possible Form, will prevail in our Colonies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1839 |title= Despatches from Sir F.B. Head, relative to Canada, with Answers from Secretary of State|url=https://parlipapers.proquest.com/parlipapers/docview/t70.d75.1839-018414?accountid=12339 |location= |publisher= Parliament of the United Kingdom |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], and the 1837–1838 [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] led by [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was appointed governor general of [[British North America]] and had the task of examining the issues and determining how to defuse tensions. In [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|his report]], one of his recommendations was that colonies which were developed enough should be granted "responsible government". This term specifically meant the policy that British-appointed governors should bow to the will of elected colonial assemblies.

The first instance of responsible government in the [[British Empire]] outside of the United Kingdom itself was achieved by the colony of [[Nova Scotia]] in January–February 1848 through the efforts of [[Joseph Howe]]. The [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly erected by the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]] reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First Responsible Government in the British Empire.&lt;br&gt;
The first [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] chosen exclusively from the party having a majority in the representative branch of a colonial legislature was formed in Nova Scotia on 2 February 1848. Following a vote of want of confidence in the preceding Council, [[James Boyle Uniacke]], who had moved the resolution, became Attorney General and leader of the Government. Joseph Howe, the long-time campaigner for this "Peaceable Revolution", became [[Provincial Secretary]]. Other members of the Council were Hugh Bell, Wm. F. Desbarres, Lawrence O.C. Doyle, Herbert Huntingdon, James McNab, Michael Tobin, and George R. Young.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The colony of [[New Brunswick]] soon followed in May 1848 when [[Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Edmund Walker Head]] brought in a more balanced representation of Members of the Legislative Assembly to the Executive Council and ceded more powers to that body.
[[File:Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine]], Father of Responsible Government]]
[[File:RobertBaldwin23.jpg|thumbnail|[[Robert Baldwin]], Father of Responsible Government]]

In the [[Province of Canada]], responsible government was introduced with the ministry of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine]] and [[Robert Baldwin]] in spring 1848; it was put to the test in 1849, when Reformers in the legislature passed the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]]. This was a law that provided compensation to French-Canadians who suffered losses during the Rebellions of 1837–1838 in Lower-Canada. [[File:Young Canada Delighted with Responsible Government c092201-v8.jpg|thumb|Punch in Canada, February 3, 1849 by Frederick William Lock depicting "Young Canada" being "delighted" by Lord Elgin pulling the strings of “Responsible Government”]]
The Governor General, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], had serious misgivings about the bill but nonetheless [[Royal Assent|assented]] to it despite demands from the [[Tories]] that he refuse to do so. Elgin was physically assaulted by an English-speaking mob for this, and the [[Montreal]] Parliament building was burned to the ground in the ensuing [[Montreal Riots|riots]]. Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.

In time, the granting of responsible government became the first step on the road to complete independence. Canada gradually gained greater and greater autonomy over a considerable period of time through inter imperial and commonwealth diplomacy, including the [[British North America Act of 1867]], the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster of 1931]], and even as late as the patriation of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act in 1982]] (see [[Constitution of Canada]]).

== Australia and New Zealand ==

While the various colonies in Australia were either sparsely populated or penal settlements or both, executive power was in the hands of the Governors, who, because of the great distance from their superiors in London and the resulting very slow communication, necessarily exercised vast powers.
However, the early colonists, coming mostly from the United Kingdom, were familiar with the [[Westminster system]] and made efforts to reform it to increase the opportunity for ordinary men to participate.

The Governors and London therefore set in motion a gradual process of establishing a Westminster system in the colonies, not so fast as to get ahead of population or economic growth, nor so slow as to provoke clamouring for revolutionary change as happened in America. Initially, this took the form of appointed or partially elected Legislative Councils. Then, during the 1850s, all Australian colonies except Western Australia, along with New Zealand, established both representative and responsible government; Western Australia did the same in 1890.

== Cape Colony ==
[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Molteno]], Father of Responsible Government and first [[Prime Minister]] of the Cape.]]
[[File:John Molteno and Saul Solomon preside over Cape Government - Zingari cartoon 1873.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon critical of responsible government, showing power and positions divided between various factions by Cape leaders, depicted as owls, [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] (to the right) and [[Saul Solomon]].]]
The [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], in Southern Africa, was under responsible self-government from 1872 until 1910 when it became the [[Cape Province]] of the new [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Harrington: ''The Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, with special reference to party politics 1872–1910''. Government Printer, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under its previous system of [[representative government]], the Ministers of the Cape Government reported directly to the [[British Cape Colony|British Imperial Governor]], and not to the locally elected representatives in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]]. Among Cape citizens of all races, growing anger at their powerlessness in influencing unpopular imperial decisions had repeatedly led to protests and rowdy political meetings – especially during the early "Convict Crisis" of the 1840s.
A popular political movement for responsible government soon emerged, under local leader [[John Molteno]]. A protracted struggle was then conducted over the ensuing years as the movement (known informally as "the responsibles") grew increasingly powerful, and used their parliamentary majority to put pressure on the British Governor, withholding public finances from him, and conducting public agitations. Not everyone favoured responsible government though, and pro-imperial press outlets even accused the movement of constituting "crafts and assaults of the devil".&lt;ref&gt;''The Zingari''. 9 June 1871. p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters believed that the most effective means of instituting responsible government was simply to change the section of the constitution which prevented government officials from being elected to parliament or members of parliament from serving in executive positions. The conflict therefore centred on the changing of this specific section. "Although responsible government merely required an amendment to s.79 of the constitution, it transpired only after nearly twenty years in 1872 when the so-called "responsibles" under Molteno were able to command sufficient support in both houses to secure the passage of the necessary bill."&lt;ref&gt;GE Devenish (1978). ''Our legal heritage''. De Rebus Procuratoriis, p.486. University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, with a parliamentary majority and with the Colonial Office and new Governor [[Henry Barkly]] won over, Molteno instituted responsible government, making the Ministers directly responsible to the Cape Parliament, and becoming the Cape's first [[Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYoPkk04Yp4C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=john+charles+molteno+responsible+government#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20charles%20molteno%20responsible%20government&amp;f=false|title=African Historical Biographies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing period saw an economic recovery, a massive growth in exports and an expansion of the colony's frontiers. Despite political complications that arose from time to time (such as an ill-fated scheme by the [[British Colonial Office]] to enforce a [[confederation]] in Southern Africa in 1878, and tensions with the [[Afrikaner]]-dominated [[South African Republic|Government of Transvaal]] over trade and railroad construction), economic and social progress in the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] continued at a steady pace until a renewed attempt to extend British control over the hinterland caused the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]]s in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Lewsen: ''The First Crises in Responsible Government in the Cape Colony''. University of The Witwatersrand / Argief-jaarboek vir Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis. 1940/3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under responsible government was that it was the only state in southern Africa (and one of very few in the world at the time) to have a [[Cape Qualified Franchise|non-racial system of voting]].

''The Life and Times of John Charles Molteno. Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. Volume II''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., Waterloo Place, 1900. p.214&lt;/ref&gt;
Later however – following the [[South Africa Act 1909]] to form the [[Union of South Africa]] – this [[universal suffrage|multi-racial universal suffrage]] was steadily eroded, and eventually abolished by the [[Apartheid]] government in 1948.

In the early 1860s, the [[Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] was involved in a bitter dispute with the Liberals, who sought to institute a system of responsible government modeled on that of Britain. Bismarck, who strongly opposed that demand, managed to deflect the pressure by embarking energetically and successfully on the [[unification of Germany]]. The Liberals, who were also strong German nationalists, backed Bismarck's unification efforts and tacitly accepted that the Constitution of Imperial Germany, crafted by Bismarck, did not include a responsible government – the Chancellor being accountable solely to the emperor and needing no parliamentary confidence. Germany gained a responsible government only with the [[Weimar Republic]] and more securely with the creation of the [[German Federal Republic]]. Historians account the lack of responsible government in the formative decades of united Germany as one of the factors contributing to the prolonged weakness of German democratic institutions, lasting also after such a government was finally instituted.

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Sandpile formation by revolving rivers|journal=Physical Review Letters| date=2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.014501|pmid=12906542|bibcode=2003PhRvL..91a4501A|volume=91|issue=1|pages=014501|arxiv=cond-mat/0206493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

'''''Savage Worlds''''' is a generic [[role-playing game]] and [[Miniature wargaming|miniatures wargame]] written by [[Shane Lacy Hensley]] and published by [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group]]. The game emphasizes speed of play and reduced preparation over realism or detail. The game received the 2003 Origin Gamers' Choice Award for best role-playing game.&lt;ref name="OriginsAward"&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Winners Presented at Origins 2004 |publisher=[[Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design]] |url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2003 |accessdate=2008-07-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430164136/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2003|archivedate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settings==
Although ''Savage Worlds'' is a generic rules system, Pinnacle has released "Savage Settings" - campaign settings or modules designed specifically for the ''Savage Worlds'' rules. These have included ''Evernight'', ''50 Fathoms'', ''Necessary Evil'', ''Rippers'', and ''Low Life''. Pinnacle has also published setting books based on the company's earlier lines, including ''[[Deadlands]]: Reloaded'' as well as the ''Tour of Darkness,'' ''Necropolis,'' and ''Weird War II'' settings based on the ''[[Weird Wars]]'' line.

Beginning with ''50 Fathoms'', the majority of settings released by Pinnacle feature a concept known as a "Plot Point Campaign". In such campaigns, a series of loosely defined adventure scenarios are presented. A main storyline is presented as a series of "Plot Points" and additional [[side-quests]] (or "Savage Tales") expand the scope of the campaign. This format allow a group of characters to explore the game universe while playing through (or disregarding) the main storyline in a manner similar to that of [[role-playing video game]]s.

A licensing system is in place for electronic and book publishers to release material for the ''Savage Worlds'' game. Such "Savaged!" licensees are allowed to use the ''Savage Worlds'' mascot "Smiling Jack" as a logo on their products. Multiple PDF adventure scenarios are available using this licensing system, as well as setting related supplements like the ''[[Vampire Earth]] RPG Sourcebook'' and the ''Shaintar Player's Guide''.

==System==

===Character creation===
Player characters are built using a point allocation system, though game masters are encouraged to design non-player characters to the needs of the game rather than to fit the system. Characters in ''Savage Worlds'' are composed of a variety of [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]. These include [[Race (fantasy)|Race]], Traits, Edges, Hindrances and sometimes [[statistic (role-playing games)#Powers|Powers]].

====Race====
A character's race usually refers to his or her species, which may grant or impose modifiers to characteristics. In some settings (such as the [[Pirates Constructible Strategy Game|''Pirates of the Spanish Main'' RPG]]) this may instead refer to nationality, which typically does not. Nationality based differences may occur in campaigns where certain Skill specializations, Edges and Hindrances are affected by cultural or technological differences or are included to add flavor to a character. For instance, in ''Deadlands: Reloaded'' a non-Chinese character may learn Chinese Martial Arts but cannot acquire and use its Chi-based Powers. In ''Weird War II'' American, British, or French soldiers have special Edges and Hindrances to reflect their different national and military cultures.

====Traits (Attributes &amp; Skills)====
A character's traits are characteristics that are rated by a single polyhedral [[dice|die]]. The more sides the trait is rated in, the better the character is at the trait - ranging from a 4-sided die (d4 - the lowest) to a 12-sided die (d12 - the highest). So a character with a Strength trait of a ten-sided die (d10) is stronger than a character whose Strength trait is rated with a six-sided die (d6). Traits are divided into [[Attribute (role-playing games)|Attributes]], which are inherent, and [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|Skills]], which are learned.

The five Attributes used in ''Savage Worlds'' are Agility (Physical Precision and Speed), Smarts (Mental Power), Spirit (Willpower), Strength (Physical Power) and Vigor (Physical Health). Attributes start at Level 1 (d4) and cost one point per additional level; Level 1 (d4) in an Attribute would cost nothing and Level 5 (d12) would cost four points. The number of points assigned to spend on Attributes is usually 5 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds.

Attributes are also used to set the point cost of skills in that Attribute's group. The player can buy levels in a Skill at cost as long as its level is lower than its controlling Attribute. The point cost doubles if the Skill level exceeds the controlling Attribute. For instance, Healing is a Smarts-based skill. If a character had a Smarts of Level 1 (4-sided die, or d4) and wants to buy the Healing skill at Level 2 (six-sided die, or d6), it will cost 3 points - one point for Healing at Level 1 (d4) and two points for Healing at Level 2 (d6). If they had a Smarts of Level 2 (or d6) it would only have cost 2 points - one point for Level 1 (d4) and another for Level 2 (d6). The number of points assigned to spend on Skills is usually 15 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds.

In addition to Attributes a character has the following [[statistic (role-playing games)#Derived statistics|derived statistics]]: Pace (ground speed), Parry (the ability to defend one's self), Toughness (resistance to damage) and Charisma (presence and charm). Some setting supplements add a fifth derived statistic such as Reason (Problem Solving), Sanity (Mental Health) or Grit (Mental Strength) to reflect the special needs of the gameworld.

Like in the [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|FUDGE]] and [[Fate (role-playing game system)|FATE]] systems the skills are broad and allow the character to use them for a variety of related tasks. For instance, a character with Fighting would not just be skilled in fighting with their bare hands or with melee weapons. They might also be able to identify and counter an opponent's fighting style, know the name and reputation of a skilled fighter they meet, figure out the nationality and rank of a soldier by their uniform and insignia, or locate and hire a mercenary or bodyguard. Healing could be used to diagnose an illness, identify medicinal herbs or pharmaceutical drugs, find a healer or medical specialist, or prevent a disease outbreak in an encampment by organizing sanitation protocols.

====Edges and Hindrances====
Characters are also customized with [[statistic (role-playing games)#Advantages and disadvantages|advantages and disadvantages]] known as Edges and Hindrances. Edges and Hindrances, unlike Traits, are not rated with dice. Edges (character advantages) cost points, are based on their character Rank (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary), and are unlocked as the character levels up. They are also grouped by Type, which may - depending on the campaign or world - affect their availability. Beginning Edges can only be granted at character creation. Social Edges affect interaction skills. Combat Edges affect the character's fighting skills and Leadership Edges affect group or massed combat. Professional Edges are related to the character's job or role and affects their career skills. Power, Weird, or Wild Card Edges are supernatural, paranormal, or superhuman advantages and grant bonuses to Powers; they may not be available in mundane game worlds. Hindrances (character disadvantages) grant points and are ranked as Minor (which grants a character point) or Major (which grants two character points).

====Powers====
Some gameworlds have the option of granting superhuman abilities to characters -usually with a magical, mystical, technological, [[Psychic|psionic]], racial, or mutant origin. They are ranked like Edges (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary) and can be expanded by leveling up.

===Task resolution===
Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of character actions and interactions in the game. Usually a trait die is rolled against a target number of four. If the roll equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds; otherwise it fails.

If a player rolls the highest number possible on a given die (such as an 8 on an eight-sided die), the die may be re-rolled and its result added to the initial roll. This is known as "Acing". A die may continue to Ace as long as the highest die number is rolled.

Player characters and significant non-player characters are known as "Wild Cards". Wild Cards get to roll a second die, known as a "Wild Die", alongside their trait rolls. This roll may Ace as normal. The player of the Wild Card uses the higher of the two rolls (trait die or Wild Die) to determine the actual result of the roll. In addition Wild Cards also receive a number of Bennies (Slang for benefits, also called poker chips in Dead Lands) per session. These can be traded in to reduce or negate damage from a given attack, or to reroll a trait die, and are used as rewards for good play.

Combat initiative is determined by a standard deck of playing cards (with two jokers); characters act in sequence according to the fall of the cards from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by suit (in order from best to worst, spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). Jokers beat all other cards and additionally give bonuses on rolls made in the round one receives them. The deck is shuffled at the end of every round in which a joker was dealt.

Any player that receives a Joker during initiative may take his action at any time during the round.  So if he wishes to act first, or in response to another PC or NPC acting he may at any point.

==History==
In 1997, Pinnacle published ''Deadlands: the Great Rail Wars'', a [[Miniature_wargaming|miniature wargame]] set in the "Weird West" world of Hensley's  [[Deadlands]] role-playing game. The rules were a greatly simplified version of the full ''Deadlands'' system, focused on single-figure skirmishes. In 2003 the rules from ''The Great Rail Wars'' were revised and expanded into a generic, simple but complete role-playing system and retitled ''Savage Worlds''. At [[Origins International Game Expo|Origins]] 2003, ''Savage Worlds'' was awarded the Gamer's Choice Award in the Roleplaying Game category.&lt;ref name="OriginsAward"/&gt; The main rulebook was revised and released as a [[PDF]] format eBook in late 2004, with a print version following in early 2005. The same year, Great White Games began releasing rules expansions in the form of several PDF format genre toolkit books. Self-contained miniature skirmish games based upon the ''Savage Worlds'' engine were also released in print and PDF form.

''[[Deadlands]] Reloaded'', a version of the classic Pinnacle game using the ''Savage Worlds'' rules, was released in May 2006. In late 2005, Pinnacle entered into an agreement with [[WizKids]] to publish self-contained RPGs set in the worlds of ''[[Pirates of the Spanish Main|Pirates]]'', ''[[Rocketmen]]'', and ''[[MageKnight]]'' using the ''Savage Worlds'' rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizkidsgames.com/wk_article.asp?cid=40452&amp;frame=company|title=Pinnacle Entertainment Group to Produce WizKids RPGs, Scenario Books|date=2005-11-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125231523/http://www.wizkidsgames.com/wk_article.asp?cid=40452&amp;frame=company|archivedate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three licenses, only ''The Pirates of the Spanish Main RPG'' saw release, and was published in April 2007. Pinnacle released another licensed game, ''The Savage World of [[Solomon Kane]]'', in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peginc.com/Press/SK_Announce_Aug082006.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Savage World of Solomon Kane to be an RPG|publisher=Greta Pinnacle Entertainment|date=2006-08-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132245/http://www.peginc.com/Press/SK_Announce_Aug082006.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Pinnacle released the ''Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition'', a [[digest size]] [[paperback]] edition of the rules. It featured the revisions to melee damage rules first introduced in ''Deadlands Reloaded'', as well as new chase rules, and was released at Origins 2007. At that event, ''Deadlands Reloaded'' won the [[Origins Award]] in the category of Best Roleplaying Game Supplement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peginc.com/Press/DL_OriginsWin_July102007.pdf Deadlands: Reloaded Wins Origins Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132239/http://www.peginc.com/Press/DL_OriginsWin_July102007.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Pinnacle released ''Savage Worlds Deluxe'', a hardcover and expanded version of the rules found in the Explorer's Edition.

In August 2012, Pinnacle released the digest size paperback edition of the Deluxe rules, ''Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition''.

In 2015 Pinnacle announced a series of supplements converting [[Rifts (role-playing game)|''Rifts'']] to the Savage Worlds system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.peginc.com/rifts-is-coming-for-savage-worlds/| title= Rifts is Coming for Savage Worlds!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Pinnacle announced a new edition: Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (#SWADE). &lt;ref&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/ref&gt; funded in six minutes.

A '''screen memory''' is a distorted memory, generally of a visual rather than verbal nature,&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ‘’Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis’’ (PFL 1) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from childhood. The term was coined by [[Sigmund Freud]], and the concept was the subject of his 1899 paper, ''Screen Memories''.

Freud was struck by the presence, in himself and in other adults, of vivid but bland memories standing from early childhood; and he came to believe that their strength and their preservation both derived from their association with other, less innocent infantile occurrences.  As he concluded in his 1899 paper, “The falsified memory is the first that we become aware of….the essential elements of an experience are represented in memory by the inessential elements of the same experience”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in A Phillips, ‘’On Flirtation’’ (London 1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Later writers have emphasised the element of [[psychological trauma]] underpinning the screen memory, as well as the way it can encapsulate in miniature the [[Core Conflictual Relationship Theme|core conflicts]] of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;G S Reed ed., ‘’On Freud’s ‘Screen Memories’ ‘’ (2014) p. 47 and p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denial and memory construction==
The construction of the screen memory turns on the balance between memory and [[denial]].  The blocking of an unpleasant event, thought or perception is facilitated if some harmless, but associated object can be substituted for the unpleasantness itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ‘’The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis’’ (London 1945) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The ego searches for memories that can serve as “screens” for the unpleasantness behind, which is thereby removed from consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ‘’The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis’’ (London 1945) p. 529&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related applications==

*Freud considered [[sexual fetishism]] as cognate to screen memories, the fetish serving as a screen for infantile sexual strivings.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ‘’On Sexuality’’ (PFL 7) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
*Screen memories may also serve as a source for artistic creation – a process that has been followed for example with respect to [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;G S Reed ed., ‘’On Freud’s ‘Screen Memories’ ‘’ (2014) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">In 1936, [[Alfred Tarski]] set out an [[axiomatization]] of the [[real number]]s and their arithmetic, consisting of only  the 8 [[axiom]]s shown below and a mere four [[primitive notion]]s:&lt;ref name=tarski&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarski|first1=Alfred|title=Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences|date=24 March 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504472-0|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of reals denoted '''R''', a [[binary relation|binary]] [[total order]] over '''R''', denoted by [[infix]] &lt;, a [[binary operation]] of addition over '''R''', denoted by infix +, and the constant 1.

The literature occasionally mentions this axiomatization but never goes into detail, notwithstanding its economy and elegant [[Metamathematics|metamathematical]] properties. This axiomatization appears little known, possibly because of its [[second-order logic|second-order]] nature. Tarski's axiomatization can be seen as a version of the more usual [[real number#Definition|definition of real numbers]] as the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]]; it is however made much more concise by using unorthodox variants of standard algebraic axioms and other subtle tricks (see e.g. axioms 4 and 5, which combine together the usual four axioms of [[abelian group]]s).

The term "Tarski's axiomatization of real numbers" also refers to the theory of [[real closed field]]s, which Tarski showed completely axiomatizes the [[first-order logic|first-order]] theory of the structure 〈'''R''', +, ·, &lt;〉.

==The axioms==
''Axioms of order'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;):

;Axiom 1 :If ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then not ''y'' &lt; ''x''. That is, "&lt;" is an [[asymmetric relation]].

;Axiom 2 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', there exists a ''y'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''. In other words, "&lt;" is [[dense order|dense]] in '''R'''.

;Axiom 3 :"&lt;" is [[Dedekind-complete]]. More formally, for all ''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''', if for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', then there exists a ''z'' such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''Y'', if ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

To clarify the above statement somewhat, let ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R''' and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;'''R'''. We now define two common English verbs in a particular way that suits our purpose:

:''X precedes Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

:The real number ''z separates'' ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if for every ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and every ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''Y'' with ''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''z'', ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''.

Axiom 3 can then be stated as:

:"If a set of reals precedes another set of reals, then there exists at least one real number separating the two sets."

''Axioms of addition'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +):

;Axiom 4 :''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 5 :For all ''x'', ''y'', there exists a ''z'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y''.

;Axiom 6 :If ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w'', then ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'' or ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''.

''Axioms for one'' (primitives: '''R''', &lt;, +, 1):

;Axiom 7 :1&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.

;Axiom 8 :1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

These axioms imply that '''R''' is a [[linearly ordered group|linearly ordered]] [[abelian group]] under addition with distinguished element 1. '''R''' is also [[Dedekind-complete]] and [[divisible group|divisible]].

Tarski stated, without proof, that these axioms gave a total ordering. The missing component was supplied in 2008 by Stefanie Ucsnay.&lt;ref name=total-order&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ucsnay|first1=Stefanie|title=A Note on Tarski's Note|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=Jan 2008|volume=115|issue=1|pages=66–68|jstor=27642393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This axiomatization does not give rise to a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]], because the formal statement of axiom 3 includes two [[universal quantifier]]s over all possible subsets of '''R'''. Tarski proved these 8 axioms and 4 primitive notions independent.

==How these axioms imply a field==
Tarski sketched the (nontrivial) proof of how these axioms and primitives imply the existence of a [[binary operation]] called multiplication and having the expected properties, so that '''R''' is a complete [[ordered field]] under addition and multiplication. This proof builds crucially on the integers with addition being an abelian group and has its origins in [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus']] definition of magnitude.

[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|In Western business cultures, a [[handshake]] when meeting someone is a signal of initial cooperation.]]

'''Tit for tat''' is an English saying meaning "equivalent [[retaliation]]". It is also a highly effective [[strategy]] in [[game theory]] for the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]]. The strategy was first introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]] in [[Robert Axelrod]]'s two tournaments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawrules.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/the-axelrod-tournaments/ The Axelrod Tournaments]&lt;/ref&gt; held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the [[simplest]] strategy and the most successful in direct competition.

The phrase originally came from another phrase "tip for tap", first used in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Game theory: a critical text|author=Shaun Hargreaves Heap, [[Yanis Varoufakis]]|page=191|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-25094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intelligent agent|agent]] using this strategy will first cooperate, then subsequently replicate an opponent's previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to [[superrationality]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in [[biology]].

== Implications ==
The success of the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasizes an adversarial nature, took many by surprise. Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions. After the first competition, new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other; a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat would have had to be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind.

This result may give insight into how groups of animals (and particularly human societies) have come to live in largely (or entirely) cooperative societies, rather than the individualistic "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.#Nature, red in tooth and claw|red in tooth and claw]]" way that might be expected from individuals engaged in a [[Hobbes]]ian state of nature. This, and particularly its application to human society and politics, is the subject of [[Robert Axelrod]]'s book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]''.

Moreover, the tit-for-tat strategy has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals who have been in competition for a period of time no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.

In the case of conflict resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as ''clear'', ''nice'', ''provocable'', and ''forgiving''. Firstly, It is a ''clear'' and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to be ''nice'' as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also ''provocable'' because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is ''forgiving'' as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.

The implications of the tit-for-tat strategy have been of relevance to conflict research, resolution and many aspects of applied social science.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010) ''Group Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
While Axelrod has empirically shown that the strategy is optimal in some cases of direct competition, two agents playing tit for tat remain vulnerable.  A one-time, single-bit error in either player's interpretation of events can lead to an unending "death spiral": if one agent defects and the opponent cooperates, then both agents will end up alternating cooperate and defect, yielding a lower payoff than if both agents were to continually cooperate. This situation frequently arises in real world conflicts, ranging from schoolyard fights to civil and regional wars. The reason for these issues is that tit for tat is not a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]], except under knife-edge conditions on the [[Discounted utility|discount rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Game Theory Evolving
  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-691-00943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While this subgame is not directly reachable by two agents playing tit for tat strategies, a strategy must be a [[Nash equilibrium]] in all subgames to be subgame perfect.  Further, this subgame may be reached if any noise is allowed in the agents' signaling.  A subgame perfect variant of tit for tat known as "contrite tit for tat" may be created by employing a basic reputation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boyd |first= Robert |title= Mistakes Allow Evolutionary Stability in the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game |journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume = 136 |pages = 47–56 |year = 1989 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80188-2 |pmid= 2779259 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tit for two tats could be used to mitigate this problem; see the description below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Richard
  | title = The Selfish Gene
  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]
  | year = 1989
  | isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tit for tat with forgiveness" is a similar attempt to escape the death spiral. When the opponent defects, a player employing this strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next move anyway. The exact probability that a player will respond with cooperation depends on the line-up of opponents.

Furthermore, the tit-for-tat strategy is not proved optimal in situations short of total competition.  For example, when the parties are friends it may be best for the friendship when a player cooperates at every step despite occasional deviations by the other player.  Most situations in the real world are less competitive than the total competition in which the tit-for-tat strategy won its competition.

==Tit for two tats==
'''Tit for two tats''' is similar to tit for tat in that it is nice, retaliating, forgiving and non-envious{{clarify|date=February 2018}}, the only difference between the two being how forgiving the strategy is.

In a tit for tat strategy, once an opponent defects, the tit for tat player immediately responds by defecting on the next move.  This has the unfortunate consequence of causing two retaliatory strategies to continuously defect against each other resulting in a poor outcome for both players.  A tit for two tats player will let the first defection go unchallenged as a means to avoid the "death spiral" of the previous example.  If the opponent defects twice in a row, the tit for two tats player will respond by defecting.

This strategy was put forward by [[Robert Axelrod]] during his second round of computer simulations at [[RAND]].  After analyzing the results of the first experiment, he determined that had a participant entered the tit for two tats strategy it would have emerged with a higher cumulative score than any other program.  As a result, he himself entered it with high expectations in the second tournament.  Unfortunately, owing to the more aggressive nature of the programs entered in the second round, which were able to take advantage of its highly forgiving nature, tit for two tats did significantly worse (in the game-theory sense) than tit for tat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Real-world use==

=== Peer-to-peer file sharing ===
{{See also|BitTorrent_(protocol)#Downloading torrents and sharing files}}

[[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] peers use tit-for-tat strategy to optimize their download speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Bram | last=Cohen |title=Incentives Build Robustness in BitTorrent | publisher=BitTorrent.org | date=2003-05-22 | accessdate=2011-02-05 |url= http://www.bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use a variant of Tit for two Tats which is called ''regular unchoking'' in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have a limited number of upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will ''choke'' the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. ''Regular unchoking'' corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner's dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (''unchoke''). This is called ''optimistic unchoking''. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.

===Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities===

Studies in the prosocial behaviour of animals have led many ethologists and evolutionary psychologists to apply tit-for-tat strategies to explain why altruism evolves in many animal communities.  Evolutionary game theory, derived from the mathematical theories formalised by [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1953), was first devised by [[Maynard Smith]] (1972) and explored further in bird behaviour by [[Robert Hinde]]. Their application of game theory to the evolution of animal strategies launched an entirely new way of analysing animal behaviour.

[[Reciprocal altruism]] works in animal communities where the cost to the benefactor in any transaction of food, mating rights, nesting or territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary. The theory also holds that the act of altruism should be reciprocated if the balance of needs reverse. Mechanisms to identify and punish "cheaters" who fail to reciprocate, in effect a form of tit for tat, are important to regulate reciprocal altruism. For example, tit-for-tat is suggested to be the mechanism of cooperative predator inspection behavior in [[guppy|guppies]].

=== War ===
The tit-for-tat inability of either side to back away from conflict, for fear of being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the source of many conflicts throughout history.

However, the tit for tat strategy has also been detected by analysts in the spontaneous [[non-violent]] behaviour, called "[[Live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]" that arose during trench warfare in the [[First World War]]. Troops dug in only a few hundred feet from each other would evolve an unspoken understanding. If a sniper killed a soldier on one side, the other could expect an equal retaliation. Conversely, if no one was killed for a time, the other side would acknowledge this implied "truce" and act accordingly. This created a "separate peace" between the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''. Richard Dawkins. BBC. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ethics]], '''value''' denotes the degree of importance of some thing or action, with the aim of determining what actions are best to do or what way is best to live ([[normative ethics]]), or to describe the significance of different actions. Value systems are proscriptive and prescriptive beliefs, they affect ethical behavior of a person or are the basis of their intentional activities. Often primary values are strong and secondary values are suitable for changes, What makes an action valuable may in turn depend on the ethical values of the objects it increases, decreases or alters. An object with "ethic value" may be termed an "ethic or philosophic good" ([[noun]] sense).{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of actions or outcomes. As such, values reflect a person's sense of right and wrong or what "ought" to be. "Equal rights for all", "Excellence deserves admiration",  and "People should be treated with respect and [[dignity]]" are representatives of values. Values tend to influence attitudes and behavior and these types include [[ethics|ethical]]/[[morality|moral]] values, [[doctrine|doctrinal]]/[[ideology|ideological]] (religious, political) values, [[norm (sociology)|social]] values, and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] values. It is debated whether some values that are not clearly physiologically determined, such as [[altruism]], are [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic]], and whether some, such as acquisitiveness, should be classified as [[vice]]s or [[virtue]]s.

==Types of study==
Ethical value may be regarded as a study under [[ethics]], which, in turn, may be grouped as [[philosophy]]. Similarly, ''ethical value'' may be regarded as a subgroup of a broader field of [[Values (Western philosophy)|philosophic value]] sometimes referred to as [[axiology]]. Ethical value denotes something's degree of [[importance]], with the aim of determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. 

The study of ethical value is also included in [[value theory]]. In addition, values have been studied in various disciplines: [[anthropology]], [[behavioral economics]], [[business ethics]], [[corporate governance]], [[moral philosophy]], [[political sciences]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[theology]].

=== Similar concepts===
''Ethical value'' is sometimes used synonymously with [[Good and evil|goodness]]. However, goodness has many other meanings and may be regarded as more ambiguous.

==Personal versus cultural perspectives==
Personal values exist in relation to cultural values, either in agreement with or divergence from prevailing norms.  A culture is a social system that shares a set of common values, in which such values permit social expectations and collective understandings of the good, beautiful and constructive.  Without normative personal values, there would be no cultural reference against which to measure the virtue of individual values and so cultural identity would disintegrate.

===Personal values===

Personal values provide an internal reference for what is good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable and constructive. Values are one of the factors that generate behaviour{{Dubious |reason=It appears to be a bold statement.

=== Cultural values ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]], constructed by sociopolitical scientists [[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]

Individual [[culture]]s emphasize values which their members broadly share. Values of a [[society]] can often be identified by examining the level of [[honour|honor]] and respect received by various groups and ideas.  In the [[United States of America]], for example, top-level professional athletes receive more respect (measured in terms of monetary payment) than university professors. Another example is that certain voters (taken from surveys){{Citation needed|reason=No surveys have been cited in this statement|date=March 2018}} in the United States would not willingly elect an atheist as president, suggesting that believing in a God is a generally shared value.

'''Values clarification''' differs from '''cognitive [[moral education]]''':

* Value clarification consists of "helping people clarify what their [[personal life|lives]] are for and what is worth working for. It encourages students to define their own values and to understand others' values."&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;
Santrock, J.W. (2007). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive moral education builds on the belief that students should learn to value things like [[democracy]] and [[justice]] as their moral reasoning develops.&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; 
 
Values relate to the [[Norm (social)|norms of a culture]], but they are more global and intellectual than norms.  Norms provide rules for behavior in specific situations, while values identify what should be judged as [[Good and evil|good or evil]]. While norms are standards, patterns, rules and guides of expected behavior, values are abstract concepts of what is important and worthwhile. Flying the national flag on a holiday is a norm, but it reflects the value of [[patriotism]].  Wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are normative behaviors to manifest [[respect]] at a funeral. Different cultures represent values differently and to different levels of emphasis. "Over the last three decades, traditional-age college students have shown an increased interest in personal well-being and a decreased interest in the welfare of others."&lt;ref name= "Santrock"/&gt; Values seemed to have changed, affecting the beliefs, and attitudes of the students.

Members take part in a culture even if each member's personal values do not entirely agree with some of the normative values sanctioned in that culture. This reflects an individual's ability to synthesize and extract aspects valuable to them from the multiple [[subculture]]s they belong to.

If a group member expresses a value that seriously conflicts with the group's norms, the group's authority may carry out various ways of encouraging [[conformity]] or [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] the [[Deviance (sociology)|non-conforming behavior]] of that member. For example, imprisonment can result from conflict with social norms that the state has established as law.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Furthermore, institutions in the [[global economy]] can genuinely respect values which are of three kinds based on a "triangle of coherence".&lt;ref&gt;Lamy, Pascal, WTO Director-General, Speech to the European University Institute in Florence on 19 February 2011 (http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl187_e.htm)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, a value may come to expression within the World Trade Organization ([[World Trade Organization|WTO]]), as well as (in the second instance) within the United Nations – particularly in the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) – providing a framework for global legitimacy through accountability. In the third instance, the expertise of member-driven international organizations and civil society depends on the incorporation of flexibility in the rules, to preserve the expression of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] in a [[globalization|globalized world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Pierre Valette-Florence|title=Marketplace Lifestyles in an Age of Social Media|year=2012|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7656-2561-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

Nonetheless, in warlike economic competition, differing views may contradict each other, particularly in the field of culture. Thus audiences in Europe may regard a movie as an artistic creation and grant it benefits from special treatment, while audiences in the United States may see it as mere entertainment, whatever its artistic merits. [[European Union|EU]] policies based on the notion of "cultural exception" can become juxtaposed with the policy of "cultural specificity" on the liberal Anglo-Saxon side. Indeed, [[international law]] traditionally treats films as property and the content of television programs as a service.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Consequently, cultural interventionist policies can find themselves opposed to the Anglo-Saxon liberal position, causing failures in international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;
Hacker, Violaine (2011a), "Building Medias Industry while promoting a community of values in the globalization: from quixotic choices to pragmatic boon for EU Citizens", Politické Védy-Journal of Political Science, Slovakia, pp. 64–74.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and transmission==
Values are generally received through cultural means, especially [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] and [[Dual inheritance theory|transmission]] or [[socialization]] from parents to children.  Parents in different cultures have different values.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; For example, parents in a [[hunter–gatherer]] society or surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] value practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian parents value social and emotional abilities and having an even temperament.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Spanish parents want their children to be sociable.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Swedish parents value security and happiness.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; Dutch parents value independence, long attention spans, and predictable schedules.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; American parents are unusual for strongly valuing intellectual ability, especially in a narrow "book learning" sense.&lt;ref name=Day /&gt; The [[Kipsigis people]] of Kenya value children who are not only smart, but who employ that intelligence in a responsible and helpful way, which they call ''ng'om''. Luos of Kenya value education and pride which they call "nyadhi".&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/10/parental_ethnotheories_and_how_parents_in_america_differ_from_parents_everywhere.html |title=Parental ethnotheories and how parents in America differ from parents everywhere else. |last=Day|first=Nicholas |date=10 April 2013 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that influence the development of cultural values are summarized below.

The [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world]] is a two-dimensional [[Inglehart–Welzel cultural map of the world|cultural map]] showing the cultural values of the countries of the world along two dimensions: The ''traditional versus secular-rational values'' reflect the transition from a religious understanding of the world to a dominance of science and bureaucracy. The second dimension named ''survival values versus self-expression values'' represents the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society.&lt;ref name=wvs-old&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |title=The WVS Cultural Map of the World |publisher=WVS |author1=Ronald Inglehart |author2=Chris Welzel |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019112321/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs/articles/folder_published/article_base_54 |archivedate=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can be distinguished as tight and loose in relation to how much they adhere to social norms and tolerates deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pelto |first1=Pertii J. |title=The Differences between ‘Tight’ and ‘Loose’ Societies |journal=Trans-Action |date=1968 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=37–40 |doi=10.1007/bf03180447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uz |first1=Irem |title=The Index of Cultural Tightness and Looseness Among 68 Countries |journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |date=2015 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=319–35 |doi=10.1177/0022022114563611}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. A history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. It has been suggested that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelfand|first=Michele J.|last2=Raver|first2=Jana L.|last3=Nishii|first3=Lisa|last4=Leslie|first4=Lisa M.|last5=Lun|first5=Janetta|last6=Lim|first6=Beng Chong|display-authors=etal|date=2011-05-27|title=Differences Between Tight and Loose Cultures: A 33-Nation Study|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1100|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6033|pages=1100–1104|doi=10.1126/science.1197754|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21617077|bibcode=2011Sci...332.1100G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Jesse R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|date=2014|title=Tightness–looseness across the 50 united states|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/22/7990.full.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1317937111|pmid=|access-date=|volume=111|pages=7990–7995|pmc=4050535}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Studies in [[evolutionary psychology]] have led to similar findings. The so-called regality theory finds that war and other perceived collective dangers have a profound influence on both the psychology of individuals and on the social structure and cultural values. A dangerous environment leads to a hierarchical, authoritarian, and warlike culture, while a safe and peaceful environment fosters an egalitarian and tolerant culture.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and forms==

===Relative or absolute===
[[Relativism|Relative]] values differ between people, and on a larger scale, between people of different cultures. On the other hand, there are theories of the existence of ''absolute values'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie/Vol%2015/Wittgenstein.pdf On Wittgenstein's Claim That Ethical Value Judgments Are Nonsense] by Arto Tukiainen. Minerva – An Internet Journal of Philosophy 15 (2011): 102–11. {{ISSN|1393-614X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can also be termed ''[[noumenal]] values'' (and not to be confused with mathematical [[absolute value]]). An absolute value can be described as [[Absolute (philosophy)|philosophically absolute]] and independent of individual and cultural views, as well as independent of whether it is known or apprehended or not. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was pessimistic towards the idea that an elucidation would ever happen regarding the absolute values of actions or objects; ''"we can speak as much as we want about "life" and "[[meaning of life|its meaning]]," and believe that what we say is important. But these are no more than expressions and can never be facts, resulting from a tendency of the mind and not the heart or the will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wittgenstein's Ethical Thought|author=Yaniv Iczkovits|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9781137026354|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=WCIwY41bB1kC&amp;pg=PA46  46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic or extrinsic===
Philosophic value may be split into ''[[instrumental value]]'' and ''[[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]s''. An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic and extrinsic properties]].

An ''ethic good'' with ''instrumental value'' may be termed an [[ethic mean]], and an ''ethic good'' with ''intrinsic value'' may be termed an [[end-in-itself]]. An object may be both a mean and end-in-itself.

====Summation====
Intrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories.&lt;ref name=riukas&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Valu/ValuRiuk.htm Inherent and Instrumental Values in Ethics] by Stanley Riukas&lt;/ref&gt; Some objects are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other objects that are good. "Understanding science" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods. In these cases, the [[Summation|sum]] of instrumental (specifically the [[all instrumental value]]) and intrinsic value of an object may be used when putting that object in [[value system]]s, which is a set of consistent values and measures.

===Intensity===
The ''intensity'' of philosophic value is the degree it is generated or carried out, and may be regarded as the prevalence of the good, the object having the value.&lt;ref name=riukas/&gt;

It should not be confused with the amount of value per object, although the latter may vary too, e.g. because of [[instrumental value conditionality]]. For example, taking a fictional life-stance of accepting waffle-eating as being the end-in-itself, the intensity may be the speed that waffles are eaten, and is zero when no waffles are eaten, e.g. if no waffles are present. Still, each waffle that had been present would still have value, no matter if it was being eaten or not, independent on intensity.

''Instrumental value conditionality'' in this case could be exampled by every waffle not present, making them less valued by being far away rather than easily accessible.

In many [[life stances]] it is the product of value and intensity that is ultimately desirable, i.e. not only to generate value, but to generate it in large degree. [[maximization (ethics)|Maximizing]] lifestances have the highest possible intensity as an imperative.

===Positive and negative value===
There may be a distinction between positive and negative philosophic or ethic value. While positive ethic value generally correlates with something that is pursued or maximized,  negative ethic value correlates with something that is avoided or minimized.

Negative value may be both [[intrinsic negative value]] and/or [[instrumental negative value]].

===Protected value===
A ''protected value'' (also [[sacred]] value) is one that an individual is unwilling to trade off no matter what the benefits of doing so may be. For example, some people may be unwilling to kill another person, even if it means saving many others individuals. Protected values tend to be "intrinsically good", and most people can in fact imagine a scenario when trading off their most precious values would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritov, and  Baron|first=Ilana, and Jonathan|title=Protected Values and Omission Bias|location=University of Jerusalem, University of Pennsilvanya|pages=89, 90|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/pvom.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such trade-offs happen between two competing protected values such as killing a person and defending your family they are called ''tragic trade-offs.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tetlock|first=Philip E.|title=Thinking the unthinkable: sacred values and taboo cognitions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00135-9|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=320–24|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00135-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protected values have been found to be play a role in protracted conflicts (e.g., the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]) because they can hinder businesslike (&lt;nowiki&gt;''utilitarian''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran|first=Scott|last2=Ginges|first2=Jeremy|date=2012-05-18|title=Religious and Sacred Imperatives in Human Conflict|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6083/855|journal=Science|language=en|volume=336|issue=6083|pages=855–57|doi=10.1126/science.1216902|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22605762}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experimental studies directed by [[Scott Atran]] and Ángel Gómez among combatants on the [[ISIS]] frontline in Iraq and with ordinary  citizens in Western Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that commitment to sacred values motivate the most "devoted actors" to make the costliest sacrifices, including willingness to fight and die, as well as a readiness to forsake close kin and comrades for those values if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutson |first=Mathew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/why-do-people-die-fighting-cause |title=Why do people die fighting for a cause? |work=Science  |date=September 5, 2017 |accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of [[utilitarianism]], protected values are [[bias]]es when they prevent utility from being maximized across individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron, Jonathan|first=Ilana, Ritov|title=Protected Values and omissions Bias as Deontological Judgements|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|pages=134–35|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/plm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Baron]] and Mark Spranca,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Jonathan and Spranca, Mark (1997). "Protected values". ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes''. '''70'''(1), 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; protected values arise from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s as described in theories of [[deontological ethics]] (the latter often being referred to in context with [[Immanuel Kant]]). The protectedness implies that people are concerned with their participation in transactions rather than just the consequences of it.

==Value system==
A ''value system'' is a set of [[consistent]] values used for the purpose of [[ethical]] or [[ideological]] [[integrity]].

===Consistency===
As a member of a society, group or community, an individual can hold both a personal value system and a communal value system at the same time. In this case, the two value systems (one personal and one communal) are '''externally [[Consistency|consistent]]''' provided they bear no contradictions or situational exceptions between them.

A value system in its own right is '''internally consistent''' when
* its values ''do not contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are or could be
** ''abstract'' enough to be used in all situations and
** ''consistently'' applied.

Conversely, a value system by itself is '''internally inconsistent''' if:
* its values ''contradict'' each other and
* its exceptions are
** highly ''situational'' and
** ''inconsistently'' applied.

===Value exceptions===
'''Abstract''' exceptions serve to reinforce the ranking of values. Their definitions are generalized enough to be relevant to any and all situations. '''Situational''' exceptions, on the other hand, are ad hoc and pertain only to specific situations. The presence of a type of exception determines one of two more kinds of value systems:
* An '''idealized''' value system is a listing of values that lacks exceptions. It is, therefore, absolute and can be codified as a strict set of proscriptions on behavior. Those who hold to their idealized value system and claim no exceptions (other than the default) are called ''absolutists''.
* A '''realized''' value system contains exceptions to resolve contradictions between values in practical circumstances. This type is what people tend to use in daily life.

The difference between these two types of systems can be seen when people state that they hold one value system yet in practice deviate from it, thus holding a different value system. For example, a [[religion]] lists an absolute set of values while the practice of that religion may include exceptions.

Implicit exceptions bring about a third type of value system called a '''formal''' value system. Whether idealized or realized, this type contains an implicit exception associated with each value: "as long as no higher-priority value is violated". For instance, a person might feel that lying is wrong. Since preserving a life is probably more highly valued than adhering to the principle that lying is wrong, lying to save someone’s life is acceptable. Perhaps too simplistic in practice, such a hierarchical structure may warrant explicit exceptions.

===Conflict===
Although sharing a set of common values, like hockey is better than baseball or ice cream is better than fruit, two different parties might not rank those values equally. Also, two parties might disagree as to certain actions are [[Right (ethics)|right]] or [[wrongdoing|wrong]], both in theory and in practice, and find themselves in an [[ideological]] or physical conflict. [[Ethonomics]], the discipline of rigorously examining and comparing value systems{{Citation needed|reason=No citation for this as the true definition|date=June 2017}}, enables us to understand [[politics]] and motivations more fully in order to resolve conflicts.

An example conflict would be a value system based on [[individualism]] pitted against a value system based on [[collectivism]]. A rational value system organized to resolve the conflict between two such value systems might take the form below. Note that added exceptions can become [[recursion|recursive]] and often convoluted.
* ''Individuals may act freely unless their actions harm others or interfere with others' freedom or with functions of society that individuals need, provided those functions do not themselves interfere with these proscribed individual rights and were agreed to by a majority of the individuals.''
* ''A society (or more specifically the system of order that enables the workings of a society) exists for the purpose of benefiting the lives of the individuals who are members of that society. The functions of a society in providing such benefits would be those agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society.''
* ''A society may require contributions from its members in order for them to benefit from the services provided by the society. The failure of individuals to make such required contributions could be considered a reason to deny those benefits to them, although a society could elect to consider hardship situations in determining how much should be contributed.''
* ''A society may restrict behavior of individuals who are members of the society only for the purpose of performing its designated functions agreed to by the majority of individuals in the society, only insofar as they violate the aforementioned values. This means that a society may abrogate the rights of any of its members who fails to uphold the aforementioned values.''

==Economic and philosophic value==
{{Further|Value (economics)}}
Philosophical value is distinguished from [[economic value]], since it is independent on some other desired condition or commodity. The economic value of an object may rise when the exchangeable desired condition or commodity, e.g. money, become high in supply, and vice versa when supply of money becomes low.

Nevertheless, economic value may be regarded as a result of philosophical value. In the [[subjective theory of value]], the [[personal philosophic value]] a person puts in possessing something is reflected in what economic value this person puts on it. The limit where a person considers to purchase something may be regarded as the point where the ''personal philosophic value'' of possessing something exceeds the personal philosophic value of what is given up in exchange for it, e.g. money. In this light, everything can be said to have a "personal economic value" in contrast to its "societal economic value."

'''Wilhelm  Mautner''' (1889-1944) was born in [[Vienna]]. He was an Austrian-German economist and attorney-in-fact of the Rotterdamse Bank who spent a part of his life in the Netherlands. Mautner was born Jewish. He was also an art collector.

==Early years==
After a short professional career in banking and industry, he studied economics in Paris, Vienna and Tübingen, where he finished his studies and wrote a thesis about Bolshevism in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mautner|first1=Wilhelm|title=Der Bolschewismus - Voraussetzungen und Geschichte|publisher=W. Kohlhammer|location=Stuttgart|edition=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he moved to the Netherlands.

==World War II==

From 1929 until 1944 he lived in Amsterdam. Mautner never married and had no children. On 22 July 1941, he drew up a will in which he appointed his brother in Ohio in the United States as his sole heir. During the war Mautner attempted unsuccessfully to escape from the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/recommendations/recommendation_189_a.html All the information used for this article is from the Restitutions Committee] [RC. 1.89]-[9 February 2009], unless otherwise specified. &lt;/ref&gt; Mautner tried to get an exit visa for the United States with the help of his brother, who lived in New York. In December 1943 Mautner was removed from his home in Amsterdam during a raid and transported to [[Westerbork transit camp]] and from there to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]&lt;ref&gt;Prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt (1940-1945) Database Personal records&lt;/ref&gt; concentration camp. Mautner died on or around 29 September 1944 in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Art collection==

Mautner collected paintings. His collection also included some Dutch old masters. He continued purchasing works of art during the war. At that time he was in frequent contact with [[Max Jakob Friedlander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprovenance.nl/varia/|title=Ruth Kaloena Krul - Kunsthistorische Herkomst|website=www.artprovenance.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, he was no longer able to do so in his own name because of his Jewish origins. He gave works of art to various people for safekeeping. In February 1942, Mautner was ordered to move to Tugelaweg in Amsterdam as a result of the forced relocation of Jews. He sent 15 paintings for safe-keeping with the collector Dr J. van Dongen on the city's Museumplein. The latter kept all of these items until after the war. Other works, including a Brueghel and a Timmermann, were sold under duress in 1943 by Mautner. Various of Mautner's works of art and other possessions were recovered for his heirs, by custodians of his estate after the war. The 15 paintings in J.A. van Dongen's custody were probably bought by van Dongen with the consent of Mautner's heirs.
Three of the paintings that Mautner sold under duress are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The latter two were acquired by the [[Führermuseum|Sonderauftrag Linz]] and returned to the Netherlands after the war, where they became part of the NK-Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl, Search, Undirected Search, "Mautner", retrieved April 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sold 12 paintings, primarily 19th century, to W. Kadzik from Vienna. Mautner could not act as a seller, due to his Jewish origin, so he asked his friend Hans Alfred Wetzlar to fulfill the formalities. It is unknown where the works are.

'''Ziran''' is a key concept in [[Daoism]] that literally means "self so; so of its own; so of itself" and thus "naturally; natural; spontaneously; freely; in the course of events; of course; doubtlessly". &lt;ref&gt;Slingerland, Edward G. (2003). ''Effortless action: Wu-wei as conceptual metaphor and spiritual ideal in early China''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513899-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Karyn. ''Learning from Chinese Philosophies: Ethics of Interdependent And Contextualised Self.'' Ashgate World Philosophies Series. {{ISBN|0-7546-3382-9}}. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This Chinese word is a two-character [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''zi'' (自) "nose; self; oneself; from; since" and ''ran'' (然) "right; correct; so; yes", which is used as a ''-ran'' [[suffix]] marking [[adjective]]s or [[adverb]]s (roughly corresponding to English ''-ly''). In Chinese culture, the nose (or zi) is a common metaphor for a person's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan, W. A. (1989). "A Linguistic Interpretation of Discourse and Perspective in Daoism", ''Philosophy East and West'' 39(2), 171-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word 'ziran' first occurs in the [[Daodejing]] (17, 23, 25, 51) and refers to the structure of [[Tao|Dao]], which cannot be referred back to anything else. It is generally accepted that the philosopher [[Laozi]], author of the Daodejing, coined the term. Ziran is a central concept of Daoism, closely tied to the practice of [[Wu wei|wuwei]], detached or effortless action. Ziran refers to a state of "as-it-isness,"&lt;ref&gt;Fu, C. W. (2000). "Lao Tzu's Conception of Tao", in B. Gupta &amp; J. N. Mohanty (Eds.) ''Philosophical Questions East and West'' (pp. 46–62). Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important quality for anyone following Daoist beliefs. To become nearer to a state of ziran, one must become separate from unnatural influences and returned to an entirely natural, spontaneous state. Ziran is related to developing an "altered sense of human nature and of nature per se".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, David L. (1987). "On Seeking a Change of Environment: A Quasi-Taoist. Philosophy", ''Philosophy East and West'' 37(2), 160-171&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sensibility of Taoism, the moral import can be most found in ziran.

==Recent reinterpretation==
Ziran has been interpreted and reinterpreted in a great number of ways over time. Most commonly it has been seen as a model that was followed by the Dao, Heaven, Earth, and Man in turn, based on the traditional translation and interpretation of Chapter 25 of the Daodejing. Wang's more modern translation eliminates the logical flaw that arises when one considers that to model oneself after another entity may be to become less natural, to lose the 'as-it-isness' that ziran refers to. Wang reinterprets the words of Chapter 25 to be instructions to follow the model set by Earth's being Earth, by Heaven's being Heaven, and by the Dao being the Dao; each behaving perfectly in accordance with ziran. This interpretation reaffirms that the base nature of the Dao is one of complete naturalness.&lt;ref name="Wang 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confuchina.com/05%20zongjiao/Lao%20Zi's%20Concept%20of%20Zi%20Ran.htm|title="It-self-so-ing" and "Other-ing" in Lao Zi's Concept of Zi Ran|last=Wang|first=Qingjie James|date=25 January 2003|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence by Ziran==
Wing-Chuek Chan provides another translation of 'ziran:' "It is so by virtue of its own".&lt;ref name="Chan 2005"&gt;Chan, Wing-Chuek (2005). "On Heidegger's Interpretation of Aristotle: A Chinese Perspective", ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' 32(4),  539-557.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings up ziran's link to another Daoist belief, specifically that the myriad things exist because of the qualities that they possess, not because they were created by any being to fulfill a purpose or goal. The only thing that a being must be when it exists in accordance with ziran is ultimately natural, unaffected by artificial influences.

==Additional information==
Ziran and Tianran are related concepts. Tianran refers to a thing created by heaven that is ultimately untouched by human influence, a thing fully characterized by ziran. The two terms are sometimes interchangeably used.&lt;ref name="Chan 2005" /&gt; It can be said that by gaining ziran, a person grows nearer to a state of tianran.

Ziran can also be looked at from under Buddha's influence, "non-substantial". It is then believed to mean 'having no nature of its own'.&lt;ref&gt;Pregadio, Fabrizio. ed. (2008). ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'' M-Z Vol 2. Routledge. pg. 1302&lt;/ref&gt; In this aspect it is seen as a synonym of real emptiness.

D. T. Suzuki, in a brief article penned in 1959, makes the suggestion of ''ziran'' as an aesthetic of action: "Living is an act of creativity demonstrating itself. Creativity is objectively seen as necessity, but from the inner point of view of Emptiness it is 'just-so-ness,' (ziran). It literally means 'byitself-so-ness,' implying more inner meaning than 'spontaneity' or 'naturalness'".&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, D. T. (1959). "Basic Thoughts Underlying Eastern Ethical and Social Practice." ''Philosophy East and West'' 9(1/2) Preliminary Report on the Third East-West Philosophers' Conference. (April-July, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Elan Vital (disambiguation)}}

'''''Élan vital''''' ({{IPA-fr|elɑ̃.vital}}) is a term coined by [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] in his 1907 book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'', in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. ''Elan vital'' was translated in the English edition as "vital impetus", but is usually translated by his detractors as "vital force".  It is a hypothetical explanation for [[evolution]] and [[developmental biology|development]] of [[organisms]], which Bergson linked closely with [[consciousness]] – with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atkinson ed., ''The Philosophy Book'' (2011) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
Distant anticipations of Bergson can be found in the work of the pre-Christian [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]], who postulated a "vital force" emanated by the sun to all living creatures on the Earth's surface, and in that of [[Zeno of Elea]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Benre, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 98-9&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of ''élan vital'' is also similar to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s concept of the will-to-live.&lt;ref&gt;L. Vikka, ''The Intrinsic Value of Nature'' (1997) p. 56-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==

It was believed by some that this essence (''élan vital'') could be harvested and embedded into an inanimate substance and activated with electricity, perhaps taking literally another of Bergson's metaphorical descriptions, the "current of life".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] attempted to recoup the novelty of Bergson's idea in his book ''Bergsonism'', though the term itself underwent substantial changes by Deleuze. No longer considered a [[mystical]], elusive force acting on brute matter, as it was in the [[vitalism|vitalist]] debates of the late 19th century, ''élan vital'' in Deleuze's hands denotes an internal force,&lt;ref&gt;K. Ansell-Pearson, ''Germinal Life'' (2012) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; a substance in which the distinction between organic and inorganic matter is indiscernible, and the emergence of life undecidable.

The notion of ''élan vital'' also had considerable influence on the psychiatrist and phenomenologist [[Eugène Minkowski]] and his own concept of a ''personal élan''&lt;ref&gt;H. Spiegelberg, ''Phenomenology in Psychology and Psychiatry'' (1972) p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; – the element which keeps us in touch with a feeling of life (and is lost in [[autism]]).&lt;ref&gt;J. Picchione, ''The New Avant-Garde in Italy'' (2004) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Army in World War I|French army]] incorporated the doctrine of ''élan vital'' into its thinking during the leadup to the [[First World War]] by arguing that the spirit of individual soldiers was more important for victory than weapons.&lt;ref name="MacMillan"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZZapAQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 | publisher=[[Random House]] | author=MacMillan, Margaret | authorlink=Margaret MacMillan | year=2013 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | pages=258 | isbn=978-1-4000-6855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
* Current general consensus by geneticists is that they see no life force other than the organisational matrix contained in the [[genes]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Weir, ed., ''Genes and Human Self-Knowledge'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[biologist]] [[Julian Huxley]] dryly remarked that Bergson’s ''élan vital'' is no better an explanation of life than is explaining the operation of a railway engine by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive driving force"). The same alleged epistemological fallacy is parodied in [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[soporific]] power."&lt;ref&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [[:s:fr:Le Malade imaginaire/3ème intermède|Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Huxley happily used the term ''élan vital'' in a more metaphorical sense, as may be seen from the following excerpt:
{{quote|"When I was just last in New York, I went for a walk, leaving Fifth Avenue and the Business section behind me, into the crowded streets near the Bowery. And while I was there, I had a sudden feeling of relief and confidence. There was Bergson’s ''élan vital''—there was assimilation causing life to exert as much pressure, though embodied here in the shape of men, as it has ever done in the earliest year of evolution: there was the driving force of progress"|lecture 1, n.p.,{{Citequote|date=August 2014}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080806205313/http://library.rice.edu/collections/WRC/finding-aids/manuscripts/0050/ J. Huxley papers]}}

*Author and popular theologian [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis]] rejected Bergson's concept in his essay The Weight of Glory stating "...even if all the happiness they promised could come to man on earth, yet still each generation would lose it by death, including the last generation of all, and the whole story would be nothing, not even a story, for ever and ever. Hence all the nonsense that Mr. Shaw puts into the final speech of Lilith, and Bergson’s remark that the élan vital is capable of surmounting all obstacles, perhaps even death—as if we could believe that any social or biological development on this planet will delay the senility of the sun or reverse the second law of thermodynamics."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, Essay Collection'' (2000) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;
