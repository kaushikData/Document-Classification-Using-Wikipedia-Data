      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5717">In [[Canada]], an '''allophone''' is a resident, whose [[mother tongue]] or [[home language]] is neither [[French language|French]] nor [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/language/note.cfm 2006 Census: Portrait of the Canadian Population in 2006, by Language: Note]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/events/allos.htm Allophone[s&amp;#93; - Events, Issues and Concepts - Quebec History]&lt;/ref&gt;. The term parallels ''[[anglophone]]'' and ''[[francophone]]'', which designate people whose mother tongues are  English and French, respectively. Native speakers of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#United States.2C Canada and Greenland|aboriginal languages]] are generally not treated as allophones.

==Origin of term ==
The word "'''allophone'''" (from Greek {{lang|grc|ἀλλόφωνος}} ''allóphōnos'' "speaking a foreign tongue")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)llo/fwnos|ἀλλόφωνος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is formed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] roots {{lang|grc|ἄλλος}} (''állos''), meaning "other", and {{lang|grc|φωνή}} (''phōnḗ''), meaning "sound" or "voice". The term became popularized during the [[Quiet Revolution]] as [[French Canadian]] society in Quebec sought to integrate immigrants, most of whom had traditionally integrated into the [[English-speaking Quebecers|English-speaking community]]. As integrating immigrants was deemed essential to assure the survival of French-speaking Quebec in light of plummeting birth rates, demographers devised this category to monitor the integration of immigrants into French- and English-speaking communities. Because allophones often adopt English, French or both languages at home or learn one language before another, they can be grouped into English or French communities based on [[home language]] or first official language learned.

== Demographics ==
=== Canada ===
In 2006, 20% of the [[population]] of [[Canada]] were allophones.&lt;ref&gt;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-402-x/2008/50000/ceb50000_000-fra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ontario ====
In 2001, 24.2% of the [[population]] of [[Ontario]] were allophones.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/economy/demographics/census/cenhi4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Allophones constitute an increasing share of the Quebec population and are the main source of population increase in the province, reflecting both increased levels of immigration, declining birthrates among established anglophone and francophone populations, and a shift in immigration from English-speaking countries to Asia and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm#allophones Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, allophones were 6.6% of the population; by 2001, this had increased to 10.0%. Speakers of Arabic, Spanish and Haitian Creole experienced the greatest growth from 1996 to 2001.&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.ca"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm#frequently Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories]&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing numbers of allophones speak French at home: about 20.4% of allophones in the province reported that they spoke French most often at home in 2001, compared with 16.6% in 1996 and 15.4% in 1991.&lt;ref name="www12.statcan.ca"/&gt; Most allophones live in [[Greater Montreal|Montreal]], Quebec's largest metropolitan area. They tend to migrate out of the province: between 1996 and 2001, over 19,170 migrated to other provinces; 18,810 who migrated to [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/lang/tables/migration.cfm Net population gains or losses from interprovincial migration by language group, provinces and territories, 1991-1996 and 1996-2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of [[allophone]] students in [[Quebec]] attend [[francophone]] [[schools]].&lt;ref&gt; https://www.lapresse.ca/news/education/201703/31/01-5084210-les-allophones -frequentent-the-schools-speaking au quebec.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional vocabulary within [[American English]] varies. Below is a list of [[lexicon|lexical]] differences in vocabulary that are generally associated with a region. A term featured on a list may or may not be found throughout the region concerned, and may or may not be recognized by speakers outside that region. Some terms appear on more than one list.

== Regionalisms ==
Historically, a number of everyday words and expression used to be characteristic of different dialect areas of the [[United States]], especially the North, the [[Midland American English|Midland]], and the South; many of these terms spread from their area of origin and came to be used throughout the nation. Today many people use these different words for the same object interchangeably, or to distinguish between variations of an object. Such traditional lexical variables include:{{refn|group=notes|Examples in this section are from the ''Dictionary of American Regional English'' (2002), which published lexicology from interviews carried out between 1965 and 1970, except where otherwise noted.&lt;ref name="DARE"&gt;Cassidy, Frederic Gomes, and Joan Houston Hall (eds). (2002) ''Dictionary of American Regional English''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; }}
* ''[[faucet]]'' (North) and ''spigot'' (South)&lt;ref name="Metcalf"&gt;Metcalf, Alan A. (2000) ''How we talk: American regional English today''. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[frying pan]]'' (North and South, but not Midland), ''spider'' (obsolete New England),&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Harold Byron, and Gary N. Underwood (eds). (1971) ''Readings in American Dialectology''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''skillet'' (Midland and South)
* ''[[Rain gutter|gutter]]'' (Northeast, South, and West), ''eaves trough'' (West and Inland North), and ''rainspouting'' (Maryland and Pennsylvania)
* ''pit'' (North) and ''seed'' (elsewhere)
* ''teeter-totter'' (North; widespread),&lt;ref name="Metcalf"/&gt; ''[[seesaw]]'' (South and Midland; now widespread), and ''dandle'' (Rhode Island)
* ''[[firefly]]'' (more Northern and Western) and ''lightning bug'' (widespread)
* ''pail'' (North, north Midland) and ''[[bucket]]'' (Midland and South; now widespread)
*''sneakers'' (Northeast and fairly widespread) and ''tennis shoes'' (widespread outside the Northeast)
*''soda'' (Northeast, Greater Milwaukee, Great St. Louis, California, and Florida), ''pop'' (Inland North, Upper Midwest, and Northwest), ''coke'' (South), and ''tonic'' (Eastern New England possibility)
* ''you guys'' (widespread), ''y'all'' (Southern and South Midland), ''you'uns'' and '' yins'' (Western Pennsylvania), and ''yous'' or ''youse'' (New York City, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Northeastern Pennsylvania)&lt;ref name="Vaux"/&gt;

However many differences still hold and mark boundaries between different dialect areas, as shown below. From 2000-2005, for instance, ''The Dialect Survey'' queried North American English speakers' usage of a variety of linguistic items, including vocabulary items that vary by region.&lt;ref name="Vaux"&gt;Vaux, Bert, Scott A. Golder, Rebecca Starr, and Britt Bolen. (2000-2005) ''[http://www4.uwm.edu//FLL/linguistics/dialect/index.html The Dialect Survey]''. Survey and maps.&lt;/ref&gt; These include: 
* generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage
* drink made with milk and ice cream
* long sandwich that contains cold cuts, lettuce, and so on
* rubber-soled shoes worn in gym class, for athletic activities, etc.

Below are lists outlining regional vocabularies in the main dialect areas of the United States.

The '''''Anonymi Chronicon Austriacum''''' (Anonymous Austrian chronicle) is an anonymous [[Middle Latin]] chronicle that covers the years 973–1327.&lt;ref name=Molinier&gt;[[Auguste Molinier]], [http://www.persee.fr/doc/shf_0000-0000_1903_num_3_1_942_t1_0207_0000_2 "2903. Chronicon Austriacum (973–1327), publiée dans A. Rauch, ''Rerum Austriacarum scriptores'', II, 209–312,"] ''Collections numériques de la Sorbonne'', '''3''' (1903), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1793 by Adrian Rauch alongside the ''[[Annales Zwetlenses]]'', both from a paper manuscript he found in the [[Austrian National Library|Bibliotheca Palatina Vindobonensis (Palatine Library of Vienna)]]&lt;!--, numbered MS rec. 1548 and compiled by [[Ladislaus Sunthaym]]--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rauch&gt;Cf. Rauch, 209ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an important source for the late 13th and early 14th century in [[Austria]]. It also contains pertinent information about [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] during the reigns of the German kings [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] (1292–98) and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]] (1298–1308).&lt;ref name=Molinier/&gt; It is the only source for the [[Mongol raid in the Latin Empire]] in 1242. Its account of this raid was copied into the ''[[Chronicon Leobiense]]'' and the ''[[Continuatio Sancrucensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;István Vásáry, ''Cumans and Tatars: Oriental Military in the Pre-Ottoman Balkans, 1185–1365'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5451">'''Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle''' is a term used for several [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[chronicle]]s written in [[Bulgaria]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

==11th/12th centuries==
The term is used when referring to an [[apocryphal]] [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] chronicle written in Bulgaria in the late eleventh or early twelfth century.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;Antoanetta Granberg, {{cite web|url= http://www.helsinki.fi/slavicahelsingiensia/preview/sh35/pdf/4.pdf|title=Transferred in Translation. Making a State in Early Medieval Bulgarian Genealogies}}[http://www.helsinki.fi/slavicahelsingiensia/preview/sh35/pdf/4.pdf]&amp;nbsp;{{small|(252&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, SLAVICA HELSINGIENSIA 35, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borislavov2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yassen Borislavov|title=Bulgarian wine book: history, culture, cellars, wines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUI7Z_RdBawC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=1 January 2004|publisher=TRUD Publishers|isbn=978-954-528-478-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work is also known as the "apocryphal Bulgarian chronicle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ifla.org/VII/s13/pubs/AnonymousClassics2004.pdf Anonymous classics: a list of uniform headings for European literatures]. Second edition revised by the Working group set up by the IFLA Standing Committee of the Section on Cataloguing&lt;/ref&gt;

Such chronicles were relatively common in Bulgaria and [[Byzantium]] of that period, and their defining characteristic was that they purported to come from a [[prophet]], delivering God's message and announcing that the Apocalypse is near.&lt;ref name=ag/&gt;

==15th century==
Several sources refer to an early 15th-century work of that name.&lt;ref name="KhristovKosev1963"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Khristo Angelov Khristov|author2=Dimitǔr Konstantinov Kosev|title=A short history of Bulgaria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruIbAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 November 2011|year=1963|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historyistorii︠a︡1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=United Center for Research and Training in History|author2=Edinen t︠s︡entŭr za nauka i podgotovka na kadri po istorii︠a︡|title=Revue bulgare d'histoire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eFBAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=10 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=Pub.

According to Khristov this work is focused on the [[Ottoman invasion of the Balkans]].&lt;ref name="KhristovKosev1963"/&gt; Imber, however, is more critical of its coverage of that time period. According to him that work provides a narrative from 1296 to the death of Sultan [[Bayezid I]] in 1403 and only has a few brief and rather inaccurate entries focusing on the Ottoman civil war.&lt;ref name="Imber1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Imber|title=The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lIppAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 November 2011|year=1990|publisher=Isis Press|isbn=978-975-428-015-9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been identified it as one of the two important Slavonic literary histories for that time and place.&lt;ref name="Imber1990"/&gt; Due to the relatively undescriptive name, it is possible that Khristov and Imber discuss two different works.

Göyünç, Kreiser and Neumann discuss the work of that name noting that it reaches the year 1417 and that has been "identified as an Old-Bulgarian translation of the Byzantine chronicle of [[John Chrostasmenos]] ([[John Chrysostom]]?)."&lt;ref name="GöyünçKreiser1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nejat Göyünç|author2=Klaus Kreiser|author3=Christoph K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24983">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Arts in ''Second Life''}}
'''Arts in ''Second Life''''' is an artistic area of a 3D social network (called ''[[Second Life]]'') that has served, since 2003, as a platform for various artistic pursuits and exhibitions. SL Photography is one of the most popular forms of artistic expression with images known as "snapshots" produced while travelling through ''Second Life''{{'}}s virtual environment. Many of these snapshots are displayed through various mediums that include Art Galleries, [[Machinima]] websites and Second Life Magazines.

== Art exhibits ==
Second Life has created an environment where artists can display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings even allow art patrons to "meet" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many real life sales.

Numerous art gallery simulations (called "sims") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the  Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary events such as the virtual book launch for "Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human," by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).

The modeling tools from ''Second Life'' allow the artists also to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to physical constraints or high associated costs. The virtual arts are visible in over 2050 "museums" (according to SL's own search engine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/thursdays/ |title=Thursdays |accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy, [[real life]] gallerist, along with his wife Roos Demol hired a [[real life]] architect, [[New York City|New York]] based, Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life. Dunkleys goal was to design an interactive gallery with art in mind in a virtual world. "Ten Cubed" is a radical departure in art exhibition, a futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. On January 31, 2008, "Ten Cubed" was launched. 
For its [[inaugural]] exhibition, ''Crossing the Void II'', owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five artists working in and with modern technologies. These artists included Chris Ashley based in [[Oakland, California]], [[Jon Coffelt]] based in [[New York, New York]], Claire Keating based in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], Scott Kildall based in [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Nathaniel Stern]] originally based in [[New York, New York]] now in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depoconsulting.com/blog/?p=16 Inaugural artists in ''Crossing the Void II''for "Ten Cubed," curated by Haydn Shaughnessy]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Real life]] as well as Second Life editions are available from the gallery.

The virtual creations from the [[metaverse]] are disclosed in real life by initiatives such as Fabjectory (statuettes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabjectory.com/secondlife/ |title=Fabjectory |accessdate = 2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Secondlife-Art.com (oil paintings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.secondlife-art.com/| title= Secondlife-Art.com: real life paintings from Second Life| accessdate= 2007-03-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070213084658/http://www.secondlife-art.com/#| archivedate= 2007-02-13| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 the huge gallery called crossworlds gallery opened its doors in Secondlife; therefore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.de |title=crossworlds gallery at gallery.de |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the aim was to create an open space for art in virtual worlds. Also in 2007, artists Adam Nash, Christopher Dodds and [[Justin Clemens]] won a A$20,000 Second Life Artists in Residence grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/the_arts/features/australias_first_second_life_arts_residency |title=Australia's first Second Life arts residency - Australia Council for the Arts |publisher=Australiacouncil.gov.au |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311224257/http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/the_arts/features/australias_first_second_life_arts_residency |archivedate=2010-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/theyre-virtually-famous/2008/04/10/1207856776808.html?s_cid=rss_technology |title=They're virtually famous - Technology |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mahesh Sharma |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/old-funds-for-new-worlds/story-e6frg8n6-1111116470411 |title=Old funds for new worlds |publisher=The Australian |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]]. Their ''Babelswarm'' installation was launched in Second Life and The Lismore Regional Gallery in [[NSW]], Australia on April 11, 2008 by Australia Council Chairman [[James Strong (Australian businessman)|James Strong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelswarm.com/review.html |title=Babelswarm |publisher=Babelswarm |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2010-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707203226/http://www.babelswarm.com/review.html# |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the French Artist Fred Forest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/70_a_en.htm#text |title=Web Net Museum-Fred forest-Retrospective-Art sociologique-Esthetique de la communication-Interrogation-Oeuvres Actions-Les robinets planetaires |publisher=Webnetmuseum.org |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; had entered the virtual world of Second Life to show his art project for the first time in his country. He inaugurated his "Experimental Center of the Territory of M2" ("Centre expérimental du terrioire du M2"), where he invited politicians to discuss about sustainable development and digital identity card ( Capucine.net). In another art project, he discussed about art institutions in France in his action called "l'art de la corrida".

== Live music ==
Live music performances in ''Second Life'' takes place in three distinctly different ways;
* With in-world voice chat, where the user dons a headset and microphone then enables a Second Life browse to "broadcast" his voice to other users, much like a telephone conference call.
* With streaming, where vocal and instrumental music by ''Second Life'' residents can be provided with the aid of Internet broadcast software, such as Shoutcast. This is input, via microphones, instruments or other audio sources, into computer audio interfaces and streamed live to audio servers. Similar to webcast radio, the audio stream from the live performance can be received in ''Second Life'' for the enjoyment of other Residents on their computer speakers. This started with performances by Astrin Few in May 2004 and began to gain popularity mid-2005. For example, the UK band Passenger performed on the Menorca Island in mid-2006. Another UK band, [[Redzone]], toured in ''Second Life'' in February 2007.
* With inworld samples, where sounds samples are uploaded and an inworld user interface – instruments – is made to trigger those. Unlike streaming, performing with inworld samples make use of the ''Second Life'' environment and creates a three-dimensional sound experience to the audience. The [[Avatar Orchestra Metaverse]] is the most prolific representative with this approach.

Linden Lab added an Event Category "Live Music" in March 2006 to accommodate the increasing number of scheduled events. By the beginning of 2008, scheduled live music performance events in ''Second Life'' spanned every musical genre, and included hundreds of live musicians and DJs who perform on a regular basis. A typical day in ''Second Life'' will feature dozens of live music performances.

In 2008 the UK act [[Redzone]] announced they would release their new live album only via Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=30314_0_2_1_C |title=New Redzone live album only available in Second Life |publisher=Side-line.com |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redzone]] also began choreographing and synchronising their performances via MIDI in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redzone.tv/redzone/press/news/2008.htm |title=MIDI-to-SecondLife Synchronisation Perfected |publisher=Redzone.tv |accessdate=2010-02-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many amateur performers start their music careers in Second Life by performing at virtual karaoke bars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-18485 |title=Of Avatars and Microphones |publisher=Ireport.com |date=2008-05-03 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Open Mic, then progress to performing for "pay", or Linden dollars, in-world.

== Filming with machinima ==

[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|Film made in Second Life using [[machinima]].]]

''Second Life'' is popular for filming with [[machinima]]. Virtual worlds can contain all aspects of real world filming techniques as well as many more not possible in the real world. It is far easier to create 3D objects in ''Second Life'' and film them than create them from 'scratch' using traditional [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] software.
There are many machinima and performing arts groups that are active in ''Second Life'' and which participate in creative events such as the annual 48 Hour Film Project. There are also several machinima groups that actively promote the works of Second Life artists such as Machinima Mondays, Rezzed TV, MAGE Magazine and the Machinima Artist's guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Theater ==
Live theater is presented in ''Second Life''. The [[SL Shakespeare Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slshakespeare.com/ |title=The SL Shakespeare Company: Homepage |publisher=Slshakespeare.com |accessdate=2008-10-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031212730/http://slshakespeare.com/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed an act from ''Hamlet'' live in February 2008. In 2009, the company produced scenes from ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.

In 2007 Johannes von Matuschka and Daniel Michelis developed Wunderland, an interactive SL theatre play at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slwunderland.wordpress.com |title=Wunderland |publisher=Slwunderland.wordpress.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, HBO hosted a comedy festival in ''Second Life,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3pointd.com/20070228/hbo-comedy-festival-coming-to-second-life/ |title=HBO Comedy Festival Coming to Second Life |publisher=3pointd.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2010-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064015/http://www.3pointd.com/20070228/hbo-comedy-festival-coming-to-second-life/# |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; using live streaming audio. In March 2009, SL residents staged a two-day Virtually Funny Comedy Festival to "help build awareness for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day 2009 and of course, comedy in Second Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-228896 |title=Virtual Comedians Pick a Red Nose in Second Life |publisher=iReport.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011/12, an all-[[Furry fandom|furry]] performing arts troupe, Ravenswood Theatricals, was launched at their own venue with successful, non-commercial virtual renditions of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (2011 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the latter of which was received with glowing reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Forepawz Golem, "[http://www.slarf.org/phantom-of-the-opera/ The Phantom of the Opera — Show Review]," ''Second Life Avatar Review Files'', March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://renoobed.wordpress.com/2011/11/19/the-ravenswood-theatre-company-presents-phantom-of-the-opera/ The Ravenswood Theatre Company Presents Phantom of the Opera]," ''Renoobed'', Nov. 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of further productions of established real-life pieces such as ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Tanz der Vampire]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', and ''[[Into the Woods]]'' are reportedly planned, as well as a gala presentation of various musical numbers from upcoming productions.

==Virtual dance==

[[Virtual dance]] has been elevated in Second Life.

Ballet Pixelle® (formerly Second Life Ballet) was the first performing [[ballet company]] in Second Life (2006).  Ballet Pixelle®, with founder and artistic director Inarra Saarinen, produces all original animations, choreography, and music composed specifically for each ballet.  All dance is done as art, not automation, with the dancers actually dancing with each other and the music—there is no artificial synchronization involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wwwballetpixelle.org/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727204428/http://wwwballetpixelle.org/# |archive-date=2013-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la-performance.org/&lt;/ref&gt; started in May 2008 with live dance shows. Two shows are produced in a year, in March/April/May 2010 modern ballet show 'BACK TO BLACK'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la-performance.org/show/174/back-to-black&lt;/ref&gt; with music by [[Queen (band)]], [[Francisco de la Torre (composer)|Francisco de la Torre]], [[Metallica]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Paula Cole]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Suzi Quatro]].

==Books ==
There have been several books written about experiences in ''Second Life''. ''Second Life Love''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/second-life-love/id466840476?mt=11 | title=Second Life Love (iTunes)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Second-Life-Love-Olsen/dp/1447816242/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322436821&amp;sr=1-3 | title=Second Life Love (Amazon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is example of such a book. It is a dialog between Per Olsen en Li Gang Qin about their partnership in Second Life. The authors have never seen each other in real life.
&lt;br /&gt;
Other books include ''Second Life For Dummies''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Second-Life-Dummies-Sarah-Robbins/dp/0470180250 | title=Second Life For Dummies (Amazon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Sarah Robbins and Mark Bell, which was published in 2008 and provides assistance for new users of the virtual world, including basics, how to meet people, ideas for activities and places to visit, including how to access real life education in ''Second Life''.

==Second Life artists==

=== Annabeth Robinson ===
{{Main article|Annabeth Robinson}}

Annabeth Robinson, or AngryBeth Shortbread, creates online performances or installations using Second Life. For example, Robinson contributed to the 'Kritical Works in SL' project in 2008 to create a sound installation called ''Ping Space''.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Denise |title=Virtual Worlds and New Realms of Creativity: The Kritical Works in SL Project |journal=International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media |volume=4 |issue=2-3 |pages=137–153(17) |date=1 May 2008 |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~simon/misc/Mardi%20Gras%20Conference%20Proceedings%202009/Session%202/Doyle.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-25 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a piece of work that involved two cubes reverberating sound from each other which would only happen when one cube was 300&amp;nbsp;ft above the other.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; Other such work can be found at the [[Annabeth Robinson]] page.

=== Garrett Lynch ===

{{Main article|Garrett Lynch}}

Garrett Lynch is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing. Since 2008 he has created a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces.  In these works Lynch explores the "real" and the "virtual" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds such as [[Second life|Second Life]] without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity.  This process involves the use of his real name for his "representation" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a [[sandwich board]] prop stating this that is worn continuously.

In 2010/2011 he was artist in residence at [[HUMlab]], Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency.&lt;ref name=Yoshikaze&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yoshikaze.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Garrett%20Lynch | title=Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency | author= |work= | publisher=Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency | accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HUMlab new artist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.humlab.umu.se/?p=2739 | title=HUMlab weblog announcing new artist | author=Jim Barrett |date=29 November 2010 |work= | publisher=HUMlab | accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes of the residence have since been published as an artists book and an article in Metaverse Creativity (Volume 2, Number 2).&lt;ref name=metaverse-creativity&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Garrett |title=A Metaverse Art Residency: ‘Garrett Lynch Yoshikaze "Up-in-the-air" Second Life Residency’ |journal=Metaverse Creativity |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=2012 |pages=163–181 |publisher=Intellect Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Lynch has and is currently performing with a custom-built scale reproduction of his Second Life "representations" sandwich board.

=== Gleman Jun ===

Gleman Jun is an Italian artist in Second Life. In the dynamic effects of colors, lights and transparencies, he expresses his creativity in a constantly evolving and transforming himself. In his case, a work of art is composed of two different elements:
vision and technique. "Vision" is the image that passes through his mind suddenly. "Technique" is the experience that allows the memory to translate the vision into a "real" and shareable object.

=== Second Front ===

Second Front is the first performance art group of [[Second life|Second Life]]. Founded in 2006, its current seven-member troupe includes Gazira Babeli (Italy), Yael Gilks (London), [[Bibbe Hansen]] (New York), Doug Jarvis (Victoria), [[Scott Kildall]] (San Francisco), Patrick Lichty (Chicago) and Liz Solo (St. Johns).

Second Front members collaborate remotely and their performances have been shown live in New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Brussels, Berlin, Vancouver and many other cities. The group has been written about in publications including [[ArtForum]], [[Art in America]], Realtime Arts (Australia), Exibart (Italy) and Digital Art, (Second Edition) by [[Christiane Paul (curator)]].

==Second Life Art group==
SL Art is one of the most popular art groups in Second Life. Its goal is to recognize the art in virtual worlds at the same level of [[Outline of the visual arts|visual art]] in real life. There are several second Life publications that work to promote Second Life Art, including Windlight Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwwindlightmagazine.com{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the SL Newser,&lt;ref&gt;http://slnewser.blogspot.ca/p/meet-crew.html&lt;/ref&gt;  and the SL Enquirer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slenquirer.com/2015/10/spotlight-on-halloween-mage-dean-lawson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Christ_Pantocrator_mosaic_from_Hagia_Sophia_2744_x_2900_pixels_3.1_MB.jpg|thumb|Jesus Christ Pantocrator (Detail from the [[deesis]] [[mosaic]] in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]])]]

In [[Christian iconography]], '''Christ Pantocrator''' is a specific [[depiction of Jesus|depiction of Christ]].  ''Pantocrator'' or ''Pantokrator'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Χριστὸς Παντοκράτωρ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pantokra/twr|παντοκράτωρ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, used in this context, derived from of one of many [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] in Judaism.

When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek as the [[Septuagint]], ''Pantokrator'' was used both for ''YHWH Sabaoth'' "[[Lord of Hosts]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/First and Second Books of Kings|2 Kings]] ([[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]]) 7:8 and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 3:13&lt;/ref&gt; and for ''[[El Shaddai]]'' "[[God Almighty]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Job|Job]] 5:17, 15:25 and 22:25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], ''Pantokrator'' is used once by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] ({{bibleverse|2|Cor|6:18|KJV}}) and nine times in the [[Book of Revelation]]: {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|1:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|4:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|11:17|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|15:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|16:7|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|16:14|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:6|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:15|KJV}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|21:22|KJV}}. The references to God and Christ in Revelation are at times interchangeable, ''Pantokrator'' appears to be reserved for God except, perhaps, in 1:8.

==Meaning==
[[File:Christ Pantokrator, Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily.jpg|thumb|Christ Pantocrator mosaic in [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] from the [[Cefalù Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]
The most common translation of ''Pantocrator'' is "Almighty" or "All-powerful". In this understanding, ''Pantokrator'' is a compound word formed from the Greek words {{lang|grc|πᾶς}}, ''{{transl|grc|pas}}'' (&lt;small&gt;[[genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|παντός}} ''{{transl|grc|pantos}}''), i.e. "all"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pa{{=}}s1|πᾶς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|κράτος}}, ''{{transl|grc|kratos}},'' i.e. "strength", "might", "power".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kra/tos1|κράτος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often understood in terms of potential power; i.e., ability to do anything, [[omnipotence]].

Another, more literal translation is "Ruler of All" or, less literally, "Sustainer of the World". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for "all" and the verb meaning "To accomplish something" or "to sustain something" ({{lang|grc|κρατεῖν}}, ''{{transl|grc|kratein}}''). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God can do everything).

The Pantokrator, largely an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic theological conception, is less common by that name in Western (Roman) Catholicism and largely unknown to most Protestants. In the West the equivalent image in art is known as [[Christ in Majesty]], which developed a rather different [[iconography]].

''Christ Pantocrator'' has come to suggest Christ as a mild but stern, all-powerful judge of humanity.

==Iconography==
[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Christ Pantocrator (Sinai)|The oldest known icon of ''Christ Pantocrator'']], [[encaustic painting|encaustic on panel]] ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]). The two different facial expressions on either side may emphasize Christ's [[Hypostatic union|two natures]] as fully God and fully human.&lt;ref&gt;''God's Human Face: The Christ-Icon'' by Christoph Schoenborn (1994) {{ISBN|0-89870-514-2}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine'' by John Galey (1986) {{ISBN|977-424-118-5}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The icon of Christ Pantokrator is one of the most common religious images of Orthodox Christianity. Generally speaking, in [[Byzantine art|Medieval eastern roman]] church art and architecture, an [[icon]]ic mosaic or fresco of Christ Pantokrator occupies the space in the central dome of the church, in the half-dome of the [[apse]], or on the [[nave]] vault. Some scholars (Latourette 1975: 572) consider the Pantocrator a Christian adaptation of images of Zeus, such as the great [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus enthroned at Olympia]]. The development of the earliest stages of the icon from Roman Imperial imagery is easier to trace.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 96–99; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78–80; James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', pp. 91–97, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of Christ Pantocrator was one of the first [[images of Jesus|images of Christ]] developed in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian Church]] and remains a central icon of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In the half-length image, Christ holds the [[New Testament]] in his left hand and makes the gesture of teaching or of [[blessing]] with his right. 
The typical Western [[Christ in Majesty]] is a full-length icon. In the early [[Middle Ages]], it usually presented Christ in a [[mandorla]] or other geometric frame, surrounded by the [[Four Evangelists]] or their symbols.

[[Christ Pantocrator (Sinai)|The oldest known surviving example]] of the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic disputes]] that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], in the remote desert of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, "An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''49'''.3 (September 1967) pp. 197–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed to be a very high-quality icon, probably produced in [[Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The icon, traditionally half-length when in a [[semi-dome]],&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise the size of the figure would have to be greatly reduced to avoid the head appearing at the flattening top of the semi-dome.&lt;/ref&gt; which became adopted for panel icons also, depicts Christ fully frontal with a somewhat melancholy and stern aspect, with the right hand raised in blessing or, in the early encaustic panel at Saint Catherine's Monastery, the conventional rhetorical gesture that represents teaching. The left hand holds a closed book with a richly decorated cover featuring the [[Cross]], representing the [[Gospel]]s. An icon where Christ has an open book is called "Christ the Teacher", a variant of the Pantocrator. Christ is bearded, his brown hair centrally parted, and his head is surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. The icon is usually shown against a gold background comparable to the gilded grounds of mosaic depictions of the Christian emperors.

Often, the [[Christogram|name of Christ]] is written on each side of the halo, as [[ICXC|IC and XC]]. Christ's fingers are depicted in a pose that represents the letters IC, X and C, thereby making the [[Christogram]] ''ICXC'' (for "Jesus Christ"). The IC is composed of the Greek characters [[iota]] (Ι) and [[lunate sigma]] (C; instead of Σ, ς)—the first and last letters of 'Jesus' in Greek ({{lang|el|Ἰησοῦς}}); in XC the letters are [[Chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ) and again the lunate sigma—the first and last letters of 'Christ' in Greek ({{lang|el|Χριστός}}).

In many cases, Christ has a [[cruciform halo]] inscribed with the letters  Ο Ω Ν, i.e. {{lang|grc| ὁ ὢν}} [[I Am that I Am#Hellenistic Judaism|"He Who Is"]].

The '''dancing procession of Echternach''' is an annual [[Roman Catholic]] dancing procession held at [[Echternach]], in eastern [[Luxembourg]].  Echternach's is the last traditional dancing procession in [[Europe]].

The procession is held every [[Whit Tuesday]]&lt;ref&gt;go to [https://archive.org/web/web.php WayBackMachine] enter: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/dancproc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514151612/http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/dancproc.html |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, select the 14th of April 2012 for ''The Dancing Procession of Echternach''&lt;/ref&gt; around the streets of the [[List of cities in Luxembourg|city]] of Echternach.  It honours [[Willibrord]], the [[patron saint]] of Luxembourg, who established the [[Abbey of Echternach]].  Echternach has developed a strong tourism industry  centred on the procession, which draws many thousands of tourists and [[pilgrim]]s from around the world. The procession is inscribed in 2010 as ''hopping procession of Echternach'' on the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00392 The hopping procession of Echternach]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The procession==

The event &lt;ref name="organisation"&gt;[http://www.willibrord.lu/spip.php?article50 Participation, course of the procession and organisation]&lt;/ref&gt; begins in the morning at the bridge over the [[Sauer|River Sauer]], with a sermon delivered by the parish priest (formerly by the [[abbot]] of the [[monastery]]). "Willibrordus-Brauverein" officials put together the procession, forming several dozen alternating groups of musicians and pilgrims. The procession then moves through the town streets towards the [[basilica]], a distance of about {{convert|1.5|km|mi}}. While the musicians play the "Sprangprozessioùn" tune–a traditional melody, not entirely unlike an Irish jig or reel, that has been handed down through the centuries–the pilgrims, in rows of four or five abreast and holding the ends of white handkerchiefs, "dance" or "jump" from left to right and thus slowly move forward. Because of the numbers of pilgrims attending, it is well after midday before the last of the dancers has reached the church.  A large number of priests, nuns, and monks also accompany the procession, and not infrequently there are several [[bishop]]s as well. On arrival at the church, the dance is continued past the tomb of Saint Willibrord, which stands in the [[crypt]] beneath the [[high altar]]. [[Litany|Litanies]] and prayers in the Saint's honour are recited, and the event concludes with a benediction of the sacrament.

In the past, the dancing procession has adopted other forms. At one stage the pilgrims would take three steps forward and two steps backwards, thus taking five steps in order to advance one; at another stage the pilgrims would repeatedly stop at the sound of the bell donated by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]], falling to their knees before moving forward a few more steps. Again, pilgrims would crawl under a stone, facing the cross of St. Willibrord. A 'cattle-bell dance' used to take place in front of the cross, which was erected on the marketplace; this dance was prohibited in 1664.

==History==

Willibrord's Abbey of Echternach was a major Christian centre in the [[Middle Ages]], and maintained a famous [[library]] and [[scriptorium]].  However, it owes its modern fame to the quaint dancing procession. This aspect of the cult of the saint may be traced back almost to the date of his death; among the stream of pilgrims to his tomb in the abbey church have been [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperors]] [[Charlemagne]], [[Lothair I]], [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad]], and later Maximilian (in 1512).

[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] historians are reluctant to ascribe any pre-Christian antecedents to the dancing procession, and claim only that its origin cannot be stated with certainty. There might be elements of [[Paganism|pagan]] cult, such as the ones that were criticised by [[Saint Eligius]] in the 7th century. Documents of the fifteenth century speak of it as a long-established custom at that time, and a similar "dancing" procession, which used to take place in the small town of [[Prüm]], in the [[Eifel]], was documented as early as 1342. Legends are told that relate the dancing procession to an averted plague or offer a fable about a condemned fiddler, but the dancing procession to the saint's tomb is an annual ceremony done as an act of [[penance]] on behalf of afflicted relations and especially in order to avert [[epilepsy]], [[Chorea (disease)|Saint Vitus Dance]], or [[convulsion]]s.

The procession took place annually without intermission until 1777. There has been an uneasy relationship with the church hierarchy; in 1777, the music and dancing of the 'dancing saints' were forbidden by Archbishop Wenceslas, who declared that there should only be a pilgrim's procession, and, in 1786, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] abolished the procession altogether. Attempts were made to revive it ten years later, and, although the French Revolution effectually prevented it, it was recommenced in 1802, and has continued ever since. In 1826, the government tried to change the day to a Sunday, but, since 1830, it has always taken place on [[Whit Tuesday]], a traditional day that, significantly, bears no direct relation to St. Willibrord himself.

The '''Etching Revival''' is the re-emergence and invigoration of [[etching]] as an original form of [[printmaking]] during a period of time stretching approximately from 1850 to 1930.

==Historical outline==
During the century after [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt's]] death the techniques of etching and [[drypoint]] brought to their highest point by him gradually declined. By the late eighteenth century, with brilliant exceptions like [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], most etchings were reproductive or illustrative.

However, in the 1840s and 50's in France, a number of artists did produce some landscape etchings which seemed to recapture some of the spirit of the [[Old Master print]]. [[Daubigny]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and especially [[Charles Jacque]] produced etchings that were different from those heavily worked reproductive plates of the previous century.

Several people were of special importance to the French Etching Revival. The publisher [[Alfred Cadart]],&lt;ref name="Oxford 359"&gt;Martin Kemp (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=95J-ppmZmt8C&amp;pg=PA359 ''The Oxford History of Western Art''], Oxford University Press (2000), p. 359, {{ISBN|0-19-860012-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the printer Auguste Delâtre, and [[Maxime Lalanne]], an etcher who wrote a popular textbook of etching in 1866, established the broad contours of the movement. Cadart founded the ''Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; des Aquafortistes'' in 1862, reviving the awareness of the beautiful, original etching in the minds of the collecting public.&lt;ref name="Oxford 359" /&gt; [[Charles Méryon]] was an early inspiration, and close collaborator with Delâtre, laying out the various possible techniques of modern etching and producing works that would be ranked with Rembrandt and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;van Breda, Jacobus. "Charles Meryon: Paper and Ink," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 3 No. 3 (September-October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Treatise on Etching'' by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880. It played a significant role in the Etching Revival in America. However, before the translation of Lalanne's book, [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton]] had become an enthusiastic promoter of etching in Britain. His ''Etching and Etchers'' (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled ''[[The Portfolio]]'', that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.[[File:Zaandam2.jpg|thumb|''Zaandam by [[James MacNeill Whistler]], c.1889]]

For Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was [[Francis Seymour Haden]], the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one the highpoints of etching history. Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.

It was Whistler who convinced the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], one of the members of the French Revival, to come to England as a teacher. This linking of the art of the two countries, though short-lived, did much to validate etching as an art form. Very soon, French etching would show the same modernist signs that French art showed generally, while English and American etching remained true to the kind of technical proficiency and subject matter artists revered in Rembrandt. One distinct aspect of the revival, in contrast with the Old Master period, was an interest in giving unique qualities to each impression of a print.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury, Sara. "Giving a Good Impression: B.J.O. Nordfeldt's Inscribed Etchings," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 7 No. 2 (July-August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall in popularity==
Etching as a collected and therefore as a practised art appears to have died with the [[Great Depression]]. Without a large group of collectors many artists returned to their canvases. Etchings fell hugely in value until the 1980s when a new market (albeit a small one) began to develop for what is now seen as a small but important tributary of the stream of 19th- and 20th-century art.

{{multiple image|width=180|footer=From left: Title page of Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'' as published by [[Nathaniel Butter]] in 1608, and the falsely-dated title page of the quarto published by [[William Jaggard]] and [[Thomas Pavier]] in 1619.|image1=King Lear Q1.jpg|image2=King Lear 1619.jpg}}
'''False Folio''' is the term that [[Shakespeare]] scholars and [[bibliography|bibliographers]] have applied to [[William Jaggard]]'s printing of ten Shakespearean and [[Shakespeare Apocrypha|pseudo-Shakespearean]] plays together in 1619, the first attempt to collect Shakespeare's work in a single volume. There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowery|first1=J. Franklin|title=The Bindings of Edward Gwynn in the Folger Library|date=2011|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is part of [http://library.tcu.edu/spcoll/ Special Collections] at [http://www.tcu.edu Texas Christian University] in Fort Worth, Texas.

The term "false folio" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the [[First Folio]] of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description "[[Folio (printing)|folio]]" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual [[quarto]] format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is ''false'' folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by [[Alfred W. Pollard]], [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]], and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos''.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos: A Study in the Bibliography of Shakespeare's Plays 1594–1685,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1909; pp. 81–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice.  Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]]; [[Stationers' Register]]], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were:

*''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1608" on the title page. False date. [[Thomas Pavier]] was the stationer who possessed the rights to ''Henry V'', and was an associate of Jaggard.
*''[[King Lear]]'' – "Printed for [[Nathaniel Butter]] 1608." False date and name. Butter had printed Q1 of ''Lear'' in 1608.
*''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' – "Printed by J. Roberts, 1600." False date and name. This was one play to which Jaggard did not have valid title; it belonged to stationer Laurence Hayes.
*''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – "Printed for Arthur Johnson, 1619." False date and name. Johnson published Q1 of ''Merry Wives'' in 1602.
*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – "Printed by James Roberts, 1600." False date and name.
*''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619", date "corrected" to 1609 in second state.
*''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1600". False date.
*''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619."
*''The Whole Contention Between the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York'' – "Printed at London, for T. P." This was the major innovation of the collection: Jaggard joined together two previously separate texts, ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]],'' published by [[Thomas Millington (publisher)|Thomas Millington]] in 1594 and 1600), and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' published by Millington in 1595 and 1600). In 1602, Pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from Millington.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 161, 216–17, 249–50, 317–18, 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pericles'' was printed after ''The Whole Contention'', since their [[signature mark|signatures]] (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.)

As Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' ''Merchant of Venice'', he may also have lacked rights to Butter's ''Lear'' and Johnson's ''Merry Wives''. There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the "Pavier quartos" instead of the "False Folio."&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Blayney, "Compositor B and the Pavier Quartos," ''The Library,'' 5th series, Vol. 27 issue 3, pp. 179–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William S. Kable, ''The Pavier Quartos and the First Folio of Shakespeare,'' Dubuque, IA, W. C. Brown Co., 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary "piracy,"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare's Fight with the Pirates and the Problems of the Transmission of His Text,'' London, A. Moring, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Massai, ''Shakespeare and the Rise of the Editor,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fox''' (known by a variety of different names, including '''Mesquakie''' (Meskwaki), '''Mesquakie-Sauk''', '''Mesquakie-Sauk-Kickapoo''', '''Sauk-Fox''', and '''Sac and Fox''') is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language, spoken by a thousand [[Meskwaki]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] in various locations in the [[Midwestern United States]] and in [[northern Mexico]].

== Dialects ==

There are three distinct dialects: Fox (also called ''Mesquakie, Meskwaki''), [[Sauk people#Language|Sauk]] (also rendered ''Sac''), and [[Kickapoo people#Language|Kickapoo]] (also rendered ''Kikapú''; considered by some to be a closely related but distinct language&lt;ref&gt;Moctezuma Zamarrón, José Luis 2011, [http://site.inali.gob.mx/pdf/libro_kickapoo.pdf El sistema fonológico del Kickapoo de Coahuila analizado desde las metodologías distribucional y funcional]. México: [[INALI]]&lt;/ref&gt;). If Kickapoo is counted as a separate language rather than a dialect of Fox, then there are only between 200 and 300 speakers of Fox.  Extinct Mascouten was most likely another dialect, though it is scarcely attested.

== Revitalization ==
Most speakers are elderly or middle-aged, making it highly [[Endangered languages|endangered]].

Until the early 1900s, Fox was a phonologically very conservative language and preserved many features of [[Proto-Algonquian]]; records from the decades immediately following 1900 are particularly useful to Algonquianists for this reason. By the 1960s, however, an extensive progression of phonological changes had taken place, resulting in the loss of intervocalic semivowels and certain other features.&lt;ref&gt;''Language change in the speech community: change by loss of a stylistic register'', in ''Historical Linguistics: Toward a Twenty-First Century Reintegration'' ({{ISBN|0521583322}}), page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems{{anchor|Writing systems}}==
[[File:Bis carta en lengua kikapu.pdf|thumb|Letter in the Kickapoo language written in Coahuila, Mexico in the 1950s]]
Besides the [[Latin script]], Fox has been written in two indigenous scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fox I" is an [[abugida]] based on the cursive French alphabet (see [[Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics]]). Consonants written by themselves are understood to be syllables containing the vowel /a/. They are &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt; /pa/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; /ta/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; /sa/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; /ša/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;tt&lt;/span&gt; /ča/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;の&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /ya/,&lt;ref&gt;"の" used here for /ya/ is a graphic approximation; it's a small clockwise loop with a long tail.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; /wa/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; /ma/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; /na/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;&lt;small&gt;K&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /ka/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; /kwa/. The characters ''d'' for /š/, ''tt'' for /č/, and ''8'' for /kw/ derive from French ''ch, tch,'' and ''q(u)''.

Vowels are written by adding dots to the consonant: &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;l.&lt;/span&gt; /pe/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;l·&lt;/span&gt; /pi/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;l..&lt;/span&gt; /po/.

"Fox II" is a consonant–vowel alphabet, though according to Coulmas /p/ is not written (as /a/ is not written in Fox I). Vowels (or /p/ plus a vowel) are written as cross-hatched tally marks, approximately × /a/, &lt;s&gt;{{sc|ii}}&lt;/s&gt; /e/,&lt;ref&gt;If the cross-hatching does not show up (perhaps because this line has been copied without formatting), this is like a small capital H with the cross-bar sticking out on either side.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;s&gt;{{sc|iii}}&lt;/s&gt; /i/,&lt;ref&gt;Like Chinese 卅 but lower and wider.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;s&gt;{{sc|iiii}}&lt;/s&gt; /o/.&lt;ref&gt;Like Chinese 卌, but lower and wider.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are (approximately) + /t/, C /s/, Q /š/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;ı&lt;/span&gt; /č/, &lt;span style="font-family:script;"&gt;ñ&lt;/span&gt; /v/,&lt;ref&gt;Actually, like one script ''n'' stacked on another.&lt;/ref&gt; ═ /y/, ƧƧ /w/, &lt;small&gt;田&lt;/small&gt; /m/, # /n/, C′ /k/, ƧC /kw/.

'''George Charles Williamson''' (1858–1942)&lt;ref name=met/&gt; was a British art historian, [[antiquarian]], and author of numerous books on European art and artists. He sometimes wrote under the pen name '''Rowley Cleeve'''.&lt;ref name=dlp/&gt;

==Biography==
Williamson wrote many books on European art and artists, focusing on the period from the Renaissance to the late 19th century. A number of these were issued as volumes in the publisher [[George Bell &amp; Sons]]' ''Miniature Series of Painters'', of which he was also the series editor.&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt; He wrote some of these under his real name and some under his 'Rowley Cleeve' pseudonym.&lt;ref name=dlp/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldry/&gt;

He also wrote guides for art collectors on various topics—including several on [[portrait miniatures]]—and he assembled catalogues for collectors of art and antiques. For the American banker [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], he put together a four-volume catalogue of Morgan's collection of miniatures; a fifth volume was never completed due to Morgan's death.&lt;ref name=socialarchive/&gt; Williamson also served as an adviser to Morgan on some purchases for his collection.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;

Williamson occasionally wrote on literary, historical, and cultural topics outside the field of art. Among these are ''Curious Survivals'', a book on English customs, and a book on the voyages of the Elizabethan naval commander [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]].

Among Williamson' coauthored books is a study of the painter [[Angelica Kauffmann]], one of the founding members of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (RA). ''Angelica Kauffmann, R.A.: Her Life and Her Works'', written with [[Lady Victoria Manners]], was prompted by the discovery in the RA archives of a manuscript in Kauffmann's handwriting, written in Italian and previously untranslated, which gives an account of Kauffmann's paintings post-1781.&lt;ref name=findlen/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; Manners and Williamson wrote that this enabled them to "come to certain definite conclusions regarding many pictures hitherto ascribed to other artists."&lt;ref name=mw/&gt; They included numerous reproductions in both colour and black-and-white on the grounds that prior books on Kauffman had presented inadequate reproductions of her paintings.&lt;ref name=mw/&gt;

A few of Williamson's papers from the period 1921–1937 are held by [[Boston College]].&lt;ref name=archivegrid/&gt;

'''Grime's Graves''' is a large [[Neolithic]] [[flint mining]] complex in [[Norfolk]], England. It lies {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north east from [[Brandon, Suffolk]] in the [[East of England]]. It was worked between c. 2600 and c. 2300 BC, although production may have continued well into the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze]] and [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]]s (and later) owing to the low cost of [[flint]] compared with metals. Flint was much in demand for making polished stone axes in the Neolithic period. Much later, when flint had been replaced by metal tools, flint [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] were in demand for other uses, such as for building and as strikers for [[musket]]s.

The [[scheduled monument]]&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1003619 |desc=Grimes Graves, including round barrow in Grimes Graves Plantation|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  extends over an area of some {{convert|37|ha|abbr=on}} and consists of at least 433 shafts dug into the natural [[chalk]] to reach seams of flint. The largest shafts are more than {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}} in diameter at the surface. It has been calculated that more than 2,000 tonnes of chalk had to be removed from the larger shafts, taking 20 men around five months, before stone of sufficient quality was reached. An upper 'topstone' and middle 'wallstone' seam of flint was dug through on the way to the deeper third 'floorstone' seam which most interested the miners.  The site is managed by [[English Heritage]] and can be visited.

The site is also a biological and geological [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteDetail.aspx?SiteCode=S1002530&amp;SiteName=&amp;countyCode=29&amp;responsiblePerson=&amp;SeaArea=&amp;IFCAArea=   |title=Designated Sites View:   Grime's Graves |series=Sites of Special Scientific Interest|publisher=Natural England|accessdate= 16  May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Geological Conservation Review]] site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=4174&amp;gcr=2327 |title= Grime`s Graves (Quaternary of East Anglia)   |series=Geological Conservation Review |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee|accessdate=  25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[Breckland]] [[Special Area of Conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteGeneralDetail.aspx?SiteCode=UK0019865&amp;SiteName=&amp;countyCode=29&amp;responsiblePerson=&amp;unitId=&amp;SeaArea=&amp;IFCAArea= |title=Designated Sites View:  Breckland | series=Special Areas of Conservation|publisher=Natural England|accessdate = 25  May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Special Protection Area]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=  https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteGeneralDetail.aspx?SiteCode=UK9009201&amp;SiteName=&amp;countyCode=29&amp;responsiblePerson=&amp;unitId=&amp;SeaArea=&amp;IFCAArea= |title=Designated Sites View: Breckland  | series=Special Protection Areass|publisher=Natural England|accessdate =25   May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining method==
[[Image:Grimesgraves1.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of old shaft and galleries]]
In order to remove the chalk efficiently, the ancient miners built wooden platforms and ladders as they dug downwards and piled the spoil around the shaft opening using turf revetments to hold it in place for the season, when the shaft and all its galleries were thoroughly and fastidiously backfilled to promote stability. The landscape around Grime's Graves has a characteristic pockmarked appearance caused by the infilled shafts. This is probably what inspired the later [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] inhabitants of the area to name it after their god [[Odin|Grim]] (literally the masked, or hooded one, a euphemism for [[List of names of Odin|Woden]]). Although the pagan Anglo-Saxons seem to have had some idea of what the site was, as the name of the site means literally 'The masked one's quarries,' (or Grim's Graben,) it wasn't until Canon [[William Greenwell]] excavated one of the shafts from 1868- 1870 that their purpose was discovered in modern times. Other similar sites have been found in Europe like [[Cissbury Ring|Cissbury]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Krzemionki]] in [[Poland]] and [[Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes|Spiennes]] in [[Belgium]].

===Tools===
[[Image:Grimesgraves2.jpg|thumb|left|Deer antler pick]]
The miners used [[pickaxe|pick]]s fashioned from the antler of [[red deer]]. They probably used wooden shovels, although this is only inferred by analogy with other flint mines with better conditions for the preservation of artefacts. Analysis of the antlers (Clutton-Brock 1984: 25) has shown that the miners were mainly right-handed and favoured the left antlers out of those that were naturally shed seasonally by the deer. The 28 pits excavated up to 2008 yielded an average of 142.5 antler picks each, of which an average of 14.8 have been found to be left-handed.

Once they had reached the floorstone flint, the miners dug lateral galleries outwards from the bottom, following the flint seam. The medium-depth shafts yielded as much as 60 tons of flint [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s, which were brought to the surface and roughly worked into shape on site. The [[Lithic reduction#Blank|blank]] tools were then possibly traded elsewhere for final polishing. It is estimated that 60 tons of flint could have produced as many as 10,000 of the polished [[Stone tool|stone axe]]s, which were the mines' main product. Extrapolation across the site suggests that Grime's Graves may have produced around 16-18,000 tonnes of flint across the 433 shafts recorded to date. However, there are large areas of the site covered by later activity which are believed to conceal many more mineshafts.

There were other hard stones used for axe manufacture, those of the [[Langdale axe industry]] and [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]] being traded across Europe, as well as other less well-known igneous and metamorphic rocks. The axes were much in demand for forest clearance and settlement, development of farmland for arable crops and raising animals, which characterises the Neolithic period.

===Customs and Beliefs ===
[[Image:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|Neolithic flint axe, about {{convert|31|cm|abbr=on}} long]]
One unproductive shaft (pit 15) appears to have been turned into a shrine. An [[altar]] of flint lumps had been built with a chalk bowl at its base and antler picks piled around. In front of the altar had been placed a [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]] of chalk, a chalk phallus and some balls, also of chalk. It may have been an attempt to ensure that the mine remained productive or 'fertile' after this particular shaft turned out to have little flint in it.  However, it is possible that the Venus figurine and the phallus are modern fakes – there is a lack of primary evidence surrounding their recovery in 1939, and rumours circulated at the time of the excavation that they were planted in order to deceive Leslie Armstrong, the archaeologist overseeing the dig.(Piggot 1986: 190, Longworth et al. 1991: 103-105).

===Neolithic infrastructure===
[[File:Grimes Graves, near Thetford, Norfolk - geograph.org.uk - 41510.jpg|thumb|The remains of mineshafts, pits, and spoil heaps pockmark the surface of Grime's Graves]]
Such a large industry may have required supporting infrastructure. Assuming no more than two shafts were open at any one time, around 120 red deer may have needed to be bred and managed nearby, in order to provide a steady supply of antler as well as skin, food and other products that the miners would require. Alternatively, the mines may have been worked intermittently by local farmers, as happened in many early metal mines during the [[Bronze Age]] and the later [[Iron Age]].

Earlier flint mines in Britain such as Cissbury in [[Sussex]] were just as important as Grime's Graves, and there were many very local sources of flint which were exploited on the [[downland]]s. However, it is probably relevant that Grime's Graves were close to the very rich soils of [[the Fens]], and forest clearance here would rely on local products.

There was also extensive farming settlement during the Bronze Age, known from [[midden]]s that infill the mouths of many Neolithic mineshafts. Animal bones from these middens show that the Bronze Age people kept cattle, which they milked, sheep and a few pigs. They also grew barley, wheat and peas.

===The site today===
Grime's Graves is in the care of [[English Heritage]]. It is open to the public and it is possible to descend a {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} ladder and explore one of the shafts. There is a small exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/grimes-graves-prehistoric-flint-mine/ English Heritage page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only shaft of its kind open to the public in Britain.

==History==
Gustav Milne studied archaeology at [[University of Oxford]] and completed his [[Master of Philosophy|MPhi]] at the [[University of London]], where he wrote a thesis on ancient harbor installations.&lt;ref name=thamesdis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/contact/gustav-milne|title=Gustav Milne - Project Director - Thames Discovery Project|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gustav started his career as a volunteer for the [[Museum of London|Guildhall Museum]] at the site of [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]] in the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/community-lecture-45-years-of-foreshore-archaeology-with-gustav-milne-tickets-45230374267#|title=Community Lecture: 45 Years of Foreshore Archaeology with Gustav Milne by Thames Discovery Programme - Event Brite|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1973 and 1991 Gustav worked for the [[Museum of London]] as a professional rescue archaeologist, working on various archaeological digs including [[Pudding Lane]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Amaz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gustav-Milne/e/B001HPGY0C|title=Gustav Milne - Amazon|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he wrote many reports on his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/library/browse/issue.xhtml?recordId=1087975&amp;recordType=MonographSeries|title=Milne, G. and Milne, C., (1982).

'''Hampton-on-Sea''' was a drowned and abandoned village in what is now the Hampton area of [[Herne Bay, Kent]]. It grew from a tiny fishing hamlet in 1864 at the hands of an [[oyster farming|oyster fishery]] company, was developed from 1879 by land agents, abandoned in 1916 and finally drowned due to coastal [[erosion]] by 1921. All that now remains is the stub of the original pier, the Hampton Inn, and the rocky arc of Hampton-on-Sea's ruined [[coastal management|coastal defence]] visible at low tide. The site is notable for sharing its history with the eccentric [[Edmund Reid]].  Reid was previously the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] head of [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] who handled the [[Whitechapel murders|Jack the Ripper]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HF6CztAvV20C&amp;pg=PA7|page=7|title=Jack the Ripper: Case Closed|author=Andrew Cook|publisher=Amberley Publishing|year=2009|isbn=1-84868-327-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement he chose to champion the plight of the beleaguered residents of the settlement.&lt;ref name="Easdown2008"/&gt;

==Location==
Today [[Hampton, Herne Bay]] is the coastal west end of [[Herne Bay, Kent]].  The site of Hampton-on-Sea is now underwater due to coastal [[erosion]], but it was on the west side of the northern end of Hampton Pier Avenue, between the 1959 sea defences and the remains of the sea wall which are exposed at low water in Hampton bay.&lt;ref name="Easdown2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Easdown|first=Martin|title=Adventures in Oysterville: The failed oyster and seaside development of Hampton-on-Sea|publisher=Michael's Bookshop, Ramsgate|year=2008|ISBN=1-907369-14-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hampton-on-Sea existed and until 1934, the Hampton-on-Sea site was under the jurisdiction of Blean Rural District Council, the boundary with Herne Bay Council running north-south along the line of the present-day Hampton Pier Avenue.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt; In 1934, the area was transferred to Herne Bay Urban District Council,&lt;ref Name="p.43"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.43&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974 to [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury City Council]].

==History==

===Background===
On the sea-bed, offshore of this site, are remains of prehistoric and Roman activity.&lt;ref name="KCNwhitstable2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:DXABpqdPbJQJ:www.coastalkent.net/data/action_plan/document_14_Historic%2520Environment,%2520Kent%2520Coast.pdf+oyster+fisheries+herne+bay&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;sig=AHIEtbT582zxT3rmVIW26vUKMO14_v-6HQ|title=Kent Coastal Network: Towards integration on the Kent coast|last= Dyson|first=Lis|date=c. 2008|work=Historic environment: section: Whitstable|publisher=Kent Coastal Network|pages=7|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hampton'' means "home farm", and before the development there were two farmhouses, a beerhouse, a few cottages containing the Mount and Quick fishing families, and the West Brook which was also known as Hampton Brook. The settlement had a reputation for a wild life, and Hill Farmhouse was said to have cellars or caves underneath for smuggling. Some cottages were built of old boats and wreckage; Hampton Farmhouse was then 300 yards from the sea and dated back to the 17th century.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="p.4"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.4&lt;/ref&gt; A low sea cliff made of soil edged the coast west of Hampton Pier, and coastal erosion was already an acknowledged problem for the farmers by 1836.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kentish Gazette]]'', May 1836&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="p.3"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Ridout1882"&gt;''Ridout's Guide to Herne Bay'', 1882&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether the coastline at this site receded by {{convert|175|m|ft}} in the years between the completion of Hampton Pier in 1865, and the start of construction of modern coastal defences in 1958.&lt;ref name="CCCSwalecliffePlan2009-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid=337&amp;type=TEENG|title=Canterbury City Council Online|last=Jordan|first=Neil|date=2009–2010|work=Swalecliffe Coastal Strategy Plan|publisher=CCC|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea floodings have been officially recorded on this coastline since the great storm of 1897.&lt;ref name="CCCseaflooddates09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid=76|title=Canterbury City Council Online|year=2009|work=Planning Coastal Management – History|publisher=CCC|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oyster fisheries===
[[File:Hampton-on-Sea 10.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of Hampton Pier built by oyster fisheries, 1865&lt;ref name="CCCfloodstrategy2009"/&gt;]]
[[Oyster]]s had thrived in the [[Thames Estuary]] since the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] promoted them; they were sold in city streets and eaten raw.&lt;ref Name="p.5"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The Herne Bay, Hampton and Reculver Oyster Fishery Company was incorporated with £10,000 capital in £10 shares on 25 July 1864 with Frank Buckland as chairman and Mr Cholmondeley Pennell as deputy.&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FowlerOysterCulture2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/25/01/Notes_on_oyster_cullture.pdf|title=Notes on oyster culture|last=Fowler|first=G. Herbert|date=c. 1890|pages=261|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1860–1864 had been a boom year for [[oyster farming]], especially in nearby [[Whitstable]], and the Government supported the trade in 1866 by passing an Act to promote cultivation.&lt;ref Name="p.3"/&gt; The company's proposals included five oyster [[smack (ship)|smacks]] or [[yawl]]s, a pier with storehouses, housing for workers and five freshwater [[fish pond|breeding ponds]]. In spite of objections from local business competition, the company acquired an Act of Parliament and land at Hampton. According to the Act of 25 July 1864, the company had sole rights to [[fishing dredge|dredge]] for oysters for seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) from Swalecliffe to [[Reculver]] and up to three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) – but mainly one and a half miles – from shore. The total area under its jurisdiction was nine square miles, of which a third was foreshore, and it employed thirty-three regular men; sometimes up to a hundred. In 1865 and 1866 their chairman Cholmondeley Pennell applied unsuccessfully for extensions to these rights.&lt;ref Name="p.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt; Before selling the oysters dredged from the Estuary, the company obtained brood oysters from Essex, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt; The smacks took the oysters twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays to [[Billingsgate]].&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/hernebayhampton00cogoog/hernebayhampton00cogoog_djvu.txt|title=Internet Archive|date=20 April 1866|work=The Herne Bay, Hampton And Reculver Oyster Fishery Company: Evidence Taken On Oath In The Committee Of The House Of Lords, April 19–20, 1866 (1866)|publisher=House of Lords|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="p.7"/&gt;

[[File:Hampton-on-Sea 018.jpg|thumb|left|Hampton Brook; fishpools were on right]]
The company was successful at first, although stressed by underfunding and the cost of the pier, and by 1866 an enquiry commission stated: "The Company have already cleared about five square miles, and culched about one square mile of their grounds, and have laid down on parts of their beds many millions of oysters". However, as the company was still relatively new, they had not yet developed their oysters to quite the same market value as the long-established Whitstable ones. A sideline for the Hampton fishermen was cement stones, because they were found on the Hampton fishing grounds.&lt;ref name="Collard-1902-map"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collard|first=Allan Ovendon|title=The oyster and dredgers of Whitstable|publisher=Joseph Collard, London|year=1902|pages=map page|url=http://oystertown.net/features/toadomap.html|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were boulders the size of a man's head, sold to manufacturers of Roman cement.&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collard-1902-pp33-36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collard|first=Allan Ovendon|title=The oyster and dredgers of Whitstable|publisher=Joseph Collard, London|year=1902|pages=33–36|url=http://oystertown.net/features/toadow1.html|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a dispute with the rival Whitstable Oyster Company, and Whitstable was fined £1 per oyster taken from Hampton's grounds, while Hampton was accused of not fully exploiting its breeding ponds and of importing foreign oysters for resale.&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="p.7"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationalArchivesCCA-U372"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=054-ccau372&amp;cid=6-139#6-139|title=The National Archives|year=2010|work=Whitstable Oyster Fishery Company: CCA-U372, 1724–1978, in Canterbury Cathedral Archives. Section: Legal papers  CCA-U372/X/272  1874–1876|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, local inshore fishermen complained that their traditional territory was now defended on the company's behalf by ''HMS Buzzard'' and that the company employed outsiders for long hours and low pay.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kentish Gazette]]'' 16 March 1869&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''HMS Buzzard'' was a wooden paddle sloop launched in 1849 and broken up in 1883&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1870s the oyster trade went into decline and suffered over-fishing, and in 1876 the Government set up a [[select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]] to enquire into scarcity and price. The result was the 1877 Act which prevented sale of dredged oysters in June to August, and freshwater pond oysters between May and August.&lt;ref name="FowlerOysterCulture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/25/01/Notes_on_oyster_cullture.pdf|title=Notes on oyster culture|last=Fowler|first=G. Herbert|date=c. 1890|pages=265|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following three severe winters, oysters died in the shallow Estuary waters and the company went into liquidation. The business passed into the hands of hotel owner Major Davis who closed it down when his operation went to Faversham. Company assets were sold on 20 July 1881 and it officially wound up in 1884.&lt;ref Name="p.9"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tramway===
[[File:OS map Hampton-on-Sea 1878 114.jpg|thumb|right|1878 map showing tramline]]
The tramway began and ended with the oyster fishery from 1864 to 1884. So that cargo could begin its journey to Kent and London on a horse-tram, the tramway was built due south from the pier to the railway which had been built in 1861. This track, which was later to become Hampton Pier Avenue, was straightened at its northern end and raised above risk of flood for the tram. By 1866 the tracks were still not laid along the pier itself,&lt;ref Name="p.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt; but according to the [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] map of 1878, it had been completed by then. At the southern end, the tramway curved westward, running beside Westbrook, and reached the railway line just east of the point where Westbrook crosses it, and to the west of where Hampton Close is today: see 1878 map, pictured. One Judah Downs won £900 in a dispute over land crossed by the tramway, and the company later bought him out as well.&lt;ref Name="p.6"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.6&lt;/ref&gt; After the company went into liquidation, the tramway was removed in the 1880s. For much of the 20th century it was possible to see where the tramway reached the railway line.&lt;ref Name="p.9"/&gt;

===Resort===
[[File:OS map Hampton 1872 004.jpg|thumb|left|1872 coastline with old pier and oyster fishery]]
Thomas Kyffin Freeman, owner of the ''Herne Bay Argus'', formed the Hampton-on-Sea Estate Association Limited in 1879 with £60,000 capital in £10 shares, but only sold 398 shares. He built a [[bandstand]], built foundations for [[library|reading rooms]] and planned tennis courts, a [[miniature golf]] course, an [[archery]] green and a recreation ground. He organised a sports day with free [[tea (meal)|teas]] and [[amusement ride]]s, but too many visitors arrived and he ran out of teas.&lt;ref Name="p.9"/&gt; With builder Thomas Richard Geelong Hoe he planned a housing estate, and a Hampton-on-Sea nameboard was put up at [[Herne Bay railway station]] in expectation of this, but then he died in 1880. The company was eventually dissolved in 1905.&lt;ref Name="p.10"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick Francis Ramuz, Mayor of Southend and land agent, bought the property cheaply. [[:File:Fred C Palmer Hampton Inn 001.jpg|The Hampton Pier Inn]] (today the Hampton Inn) became the Land Company's base for its administration of the {{convert|750|acre|km2}} of land it had bought altogether in Herne Bay. Planned street names which no longer exist were Swalecliffe Gardens, Hampton Grand Parade, Marine Drive, Canterbury Gardens, Hampton Gardens, Eddington Gardens next to Hampton Farmhouse and Herncliffe Gardens incorporating the oyster fishery's Hampton Terrace. The company proposed a genteel resort with large brick [[bungalow]]s and [[villa]]s, a temperance hotel plus church, and shops plus tavern. Freeman's idea for a recreation ground was resurrected for good measure.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;

Ramuz divided the "Grand Parade Estate at Hampton-on-Sea" into 124 development plots for the first auction on 17 September 1888 "to suit all classes" and set up a sales marquee onsite. Cheap, refundable train fares and a free lunch were promised to prospective purchasers.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.10-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=HBPress1888sept17&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', September 1888&lt;/ref&gt; All the plots were sold within one and a half hours after the buyers, mostly from London, were serenaded by the [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs 3rd Battalion]] band during their free lunch. Plots facing the sea made £18, and those at the back £8 to £9, with the old farmhouse making £100 and the tavern plot £39: all moneys were payable in instalments. The Land Company made £2,000.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=HBPress1888sept22&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', 22 September 1888&lt;/ref&gt;

By the date of the second marquee-auction of 126 more plots, the Land Company had built roads and was repairing the pier. Plots were advertised more energetically than before and promoted on the basis of Herne Bay's smallness, cheapness, ripeness for speculation and its proximity to the railway line. Sales were aimed at landlords wanting to buy cheaply and rent at profit, because at that time house-ownership was uncommon and tenancy was the norm. Prospective purchasers were promised trams and buses to take tenants to the railway station, or even an extra railway station close to the estate. The empty and rural nature of this spot was translated into promises of [[botany|botanising]], shooting, bathing, sailing and angling.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=HBPress1888oct13/&gt; Although no cheap train was provided on this occasion, plots sold at £8 to £32, making the Land Company £1,370.&lt;ref Name="HBPress1888oct"&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', October 1888&lt;/ref&gt; During 1889 sales were promoted by newspaper advertisements rather than auctions, and the pier's repairs were said to be ongoing. According to these advertisements there were [[croquet]] lawns and tennis courts plus a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]].&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;&lt;ref Name=HBPress1889&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

A third sale of 144 plots took place on 7 July 1890 making £2,450 for the Land Company, and events included a regatta with a coastguards' race and pair-oared rowing race, plus a traditional ''duck hunt'' in which a man acts as duck. The fourth and final auction of 124 plots on 28 July 1890 promised yet another special train from London and the opportunity to buy the shop plots and more villa plots. Four shop plots went for £54, villa plots for £3 to £7, and we are not told the sum earned by the company. Some plots remained unsold, and these were advertised throughout 1891.&lt;ref Name=HBPress1890july&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', July 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=HBPress1891may09&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', 9 May 1891&lt;/ref&gt; Following the four auctions and three years of advertising, very few plots were developed, and the temperance hotel, church, shops and tavern were never built.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;

===Causes of erosion and flooding===

====Hampton pier====
[[File:Hampton-on-Sea 009.jpg|thumb|left|Hampton Pier, 2010]]
Hampton pier was built of wood and concrete by the oyster company in 1865 at cost of £28,000;&lt;ref name="CCCfloodstrategy2009"/&gt; it was {{convert|1050|ft|m}} long so that the landing stage was in deep enough water to allow for the two-[[fathom]] [[draft (hull)|draught]] of the [[smack (ship)|smacks]]. It curved slightly westwards to allow the company's oyster smacks and European oyster trading boats to berth on the lee side in a north-easterly wind.&lt;ref Name="p.5"/&gt; Its purpose was threefold: a landing stage for oysters and materials, a shelter for the oyster smacks and a breakwater for fishing grounds.&lt;ref name="InternetArchive1866"/&gt; The [[Lord Mayor of London]] Thomas Gabriel arrived in a special train to open it on 15 September 1866.&lt;ref Name="p.7"/&gt; After the collapse of the oyster fishery, the pier was said to be under repair by land agent Frederick Francis Ramuz in October 1888.&lt;ref Name=HBPress1888oct13&gt;''Herne Bay Press'', 13 October 1888&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the pier became derelict.  In the great storm of 28–29 November 1897 it was badly damaged, and then partially demolished in 1898 to halt erosion and save the houses of Hampton-on-Sea.&lt;ref Name=Mail1898dec05&gt;''Daily Mail'', 5 December 1898&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, the Council bought it and at a cost of £2,000 the Surveyor to the Council [[F.W.J. Palmer (engineer)|F.W.J. Palmer]] rebuilt the stub in 1903–1904 as it is today, at {{convert|350|ft|m}} long. The remaining piles and ruins of the old pier were a shipping hazard and had to be buoyed with large warning notices.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt;

====Tidal causes====
[[File:Hampton 1978 001c.JPG|thumb|right|Possible eddy during 9–10 knot tide race at Hampton, based on 1978 map]]
The cause of the [[erosion]] and flooding which eventually drowned this development was the original Hampton Pier. The [[tide|ebb and flow]] of [[oceanography|tidal streams]] is powerful in the shallow [[Thames Estuary]], where its tidal waters are caught in the vortex of the tidal push from [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] waters via both the north and south of the British Isles. Off Herne Bay, the running ebb current moves at 10.15 [[knot (unit)|knots]], and the flow at {{convert|9.14|kn|km/h}}. Where strong currents meet and divide, or are disrupted by uneven coastal features, there are [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]. After Hampton Pier was first built, the flow running west along Herne Bay beach dropped its sand and pebbles on the east side of the pier instead of replenishing beach material in front of the new development. Subsequently, after being forced into a loop around the pier-end it was possibly forced into a shoreward eddy by deep-water currents. That means that at a certain point in the flow-tide it could have continued briefly westward past Hampton-on-Sea, then turned inshore and looped back strongly eastwards along the beach towards Hampton Pier Avenue, eroding land at Hampton-on-Sea and then turning north along Hampton Pier Avenue and the pier, carrying soil with it. It is said that the later shortening of the pier was not enough and that erosion will continue, so such an eddy may explain the need for today's shore defences along the north end of Hampton Pier Avenue. An additional possibility is related to the strong ebb flow's history of removing the headlands of Herne Bay's original bay before the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ILNhernebay1850"&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated London News. "The watering places of England: Herne Bay"|date=13 July 1850|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; This current moving east, being baulked and turned north suddenly by the new sea defences of Hampton Pier Avenue and Hampton Pier, might easily erode the little Hampton-on-Sea bay in default of the Hampton Pier headland.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reeds1995pp309-11"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reed's Nautical Almanac|publisher=Macmillan|year=1995|pages=309–311|isbn=0-333-61049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the above theories allow for scoured coastal material to be removed to deeper waters to the north of Hampton-on-Sea by the ebb tide and by the occasional eddy, besides being dropped at Long Rock by an alternate normal east-west flow tide. When there are exceptional conditions on top of these tidal streams, for example a low pressure system causing higher water level coinciding with strong north-westerly winds, coastal flooding can occur.&lt;ref name="CCCwhyfloodinghappens09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid=77|title=Canterbury City Council Online|year=2009|work=Planning Coastal Management – Why flooding happens|publisher=CCC|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes on land====
[[File:Hampton-on-Sea 025.jpg|thumb|right|Westbrook culvert, 2010]]
Hampton Brook, now Westbrook, reached the sea through a stone [[culvert]] but seaweed often blocked it, making it overflow and become stagnant. The land between the houses and the often-foetid Hampton Brook was low-lying enough to be subject to flood during a combination of spring tide, prolonged rainfall and onshore wind. Either the digging or the filling-in of the oyster company's [[fish farming|fishpools]] created soft, unstable land.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.23-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings, sea wall and flooding===
[[File:Hampton-on-Sea 1910 023.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edmund Reid]] and neighbour examine the most northerly house of Herncliffe Gardens as it falls into the sea, by [[Frederick Christian Palmer|Fred C. Palmer]], early 1910]]
Hampton Terrace was built for the oyster company's workers in 1866, and it later became part of Herncliffe Gardens which no longer exists. The Hampton Oyster Inn, today the Hampton Inn, was built by a brewer opposite the pier entrance.&lt;ref Name="p.7"/&gt; Only eight plots bought from the Land Company were developed: Hampton Terrace in Herncliffe Gardens was extended by three villas; four villas were built in Eddington Gardens alongside the old Hampton Farmhouse; lastly Pleasant Cottage, later called Hampton Bungalow, was built in Swalecliffe Avenue in the late 1890s. Of the roads and plots created by the Land Company, only Swalecliffe Avenue and Hampton Pier Avenue survive today.&lt;ref Name="p.10-21"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="p.49"&gt;Easdown 2008 p.49&lt;/ref&gt; Wave damage in the great storm of 28–29 November 1897 damaged the three Herncliffe Garden houses, and brought coastal erosion closer to the properties. In 1899, a wall of faggots and four {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[groyne]]s were ineffectual against the onset of the sea. John Davis and W.H. Banks abandoned numbers One and Two Herncliffe Gardens in July 1899, while numbers Three to Twelve remained tenanted until at least 1902, and in 1899–1900 a sea wall was built to protect the houses. By 1901 number Three had been abandoned, though officially listed as occupied, and the high-water mark had reached the corner of number One.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt; By 1905 Hampton Grand Parade and half of Marine Drive had been eroded away, then a storm broke through the sea wall and scoured out the land from behind it. In spite of having had to buy back land from worried investors, the Land Company continued to advertise empty houses in Herncliffe Gardens for sale. By 1910 the two seaward-end houses had been demolished, and by the end of 1911 all twelve houses of Herncliffe Gardens terrace were abandoned and then demolished with the sea at the back doors. In 1916,&lt;ref name="BBC-Geoghegan-18nov2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11765712|title=BBC News Magazine|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date=18 November 2010|work=The secrets of Britain's abandoned villages|publisher=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington Gardens was abandoned by its last resident, Edmund Reid. By the 1920s only Hampton Farmhouse and numbers One and Two Eddington Gardens were left of Hampton-on-Sea, and the latter two were demolished in 1921. It is at that point that Hampton-on-Sea is said to have been finally drowned. In 1934, the old farmhouse was the last to go.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt;

===Edmund Reid===
{{Main article|Edmund Reid}}
[[File:EdmundReid 001b.jpg|right|thumb|Edmund Reid at Hampton-on-Sea, by [[Frederick Christian Palmer|Fred C. Palmer]], 1912]]
(b. 1846; d. Herne Bay 5 December 1917) In 1903, [[Edmund Reid|Edmund James Reid]] moved into number Four, Eddington Gardens: the house at the landward end of the terrace, previously advertised for £300. At that point the sea was still about two hundred yards away. He had retired in 1896 or 1898, having been head of [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] in the [[Metropolitan police]], and his most famous case was the [[Whitechapel murders]] in 1888.&lt;ref name=Reid-LWNarticle-1912&gt;{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Edmund|title=Hunted – Jack the Ripper – ex detective inspector Reid's new theory|url=http://www.casebook.org/dissertations/spe3.html|accessdate=20 February 2011|newspaper=Lloyd's Weekly News|date=4 February 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named his house ''Reid's Ranch'', painted castellations and cannon on its side and soon became known as the eccentric champion of the beleaguered Hampton-on-Sea residents. His house contained a parrot and many photographs of his London cases. His garden contained a cannonball found on his property, a post from the end of the old pier and a flagpole with a union flag. From a wooden kiosk in his garden named the ''Hampton-on-Sea Hotel'' he sold soft drinks and postcards featuring himself and the fast-vanishing remains of Hampton-on-Sea. [[File:Edmund reid.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Edmund Reid before 1898]] Some of these were photographed by [[Frederick Christian Palmer|Fred C. Palmer]] of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]], who was the ''[[Kentish Gazette|Herne Bay Press]]'' photographer for all big events. The stagnant Hampton Brook became a butt of Reid's jokes and he renamed it ''Lavender Brook'', sending sardonic letters to the Council about erosion, Hampton Brook, public facilities and the pier as shipping hazard. With two neighbours he built a bridge over the brook, but it was declared dangerous and demolished by the Council. The sea flowed closer to his property, and in 1915 he was the last remaining resident of Eddington Gardens and of Hampton-on-Sea.  He abandoned his house in 1916, moved to Herne Bay, married in 1917 and died aged 71 on 5 December of the same year. He was buried in [[Eddington, Kent#Cemetery|Herne Bay Cemetery]] in plot S62 on 8 December 1917.&lt;ref Name="p.23-41"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanOfHerneBayCemetery&gt;{{cite web|title=Herne Bay Cemetery (CT6 7HB)|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/images/bereavement/maps/HBC.pdf|work=Plan of Herne Bay Cemetery|publisher=Canterbury City Council|accessdate=21 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123213328/http://canterbury.gov.uk/images/bereavement/maps/HBC.pdf|archivedate=23 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===

By the 1920s and 30s on the higher land of Hampton, the first houses on Hampton Pier Avenue and Swalecliffe Avenue were being built; this time as a suburb of Herne Bay. Houses eventually filled Hampton Hill to the east of Hampton Pier Avenue, and Studd Hill to the south of the Hampton-on-Sea site. From 1929 to 1966 there was a boating lake in place of the landward oyster pond; it is now a playground. Besides the stub of Hampton Pier and the Hampton Inn, the curved shape of the Land Company's 1900 sea wall, visible at low tide, is all that is left of Hampton-on-Sea.&lt;ref name="PictorialGuide1920"&gt;{{cite book|title=A pictorial and descriptive guide to Canterbury, Herne Bay, Whitstable and the Isle of Thanet|publisher=Ward Lock &amp; Co.

The coast was conserved in 1959 to 1960 with a new sea defence, and in the same years the landscaping that followed a cliff drainage scheme running down from the Studd Hill estate replaced [[Glaucium flavum|sea poppies]] and summer [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] with lawn.&lt;ref name="CCCfloodstrategy2009"/&gt;

Coastal erosion at Hampton-on-Sea has been estimated at {{convert|2|m|yds|abbr=on}} per annum&lt;ref name="CCCfloodstrategy2009"/&gt; between the construction of the old Hampton Pier in 1865 to 1959 when the Council built the sea wall.

This area with a [[coastal management|defensive frontage]] of {{convert|220|m|yds|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} is now known as the Hampton [[balancing lake|Flood Basin]] and Hampton Brook, now officially Westbrook, is still prone to floodlocking, as occurred in 2001.&lt;ref name="CCCfloodreportFeb2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid=2478&amp;type=NEWSARC|title=Canterbury City Council Online|date=8 February 2001|work=Flood report|publisher=CCC|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCwestbrookimprovements2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/main.cfm?objectid=350&amp;type=TEENG|title=Canterbury City Council Online|date=c. 2002|work=Specific Problem Areas and Proposed Improvements – 1|publisher=CCC|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1959 sea wall and [[groyne]]s were updated in 1983, and Hampton Pier Avenue's rock armour [[revetment]] was upgraded in 1994, it is thought that eventually the sea defences would need to be raised. Nevertheless, although sea-damage was done by the great 1953 and 1978 storms, the upgraded defences protected this coast from the severe 1996 storm. Costs of increasing flood defences here are estimated at £1–7&amp;nbsp;million, especially as the work has to be modified because this area is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|SSSI]] and [[Special Protection Area|SPA]].&lt;ref name="SSSImanagementplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.se-coastalgroup.org.uk/assets/pdfs/igsf/docs/Appendices/Appendix_D.pdf |title=se-coastalgroup.org.uk |work=Page 1 Isle of Grain to South Foreland Shoreline Management Plan Review: Appendix D: Thematic studies |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004103823/http://www.se-coastalgroup.org.uk/assets/pdfs/igsf/docs/Appendices/Appendix_D.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost and limitations meant that a short-term solution of £635,000 capital works was recommended by the [[City of Canterbury|Council]] Steering Group on 29 June 2009 to be implemented from winter 2011 to spring 2011.

It's where the stream runs out across the beach, and you can stand on the sands and look over the edge of the cliffs without even standing on your toes.  Farther along the cliffs are higher and crumbly and falling into the sea all the time, which was one reason why nobody wanted to buy Dilly Dally.  A few more years and it would be in the sea along with the cliff."&lt;ref name="WS-HalfTermTrail2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Will|title=Half Term  Trail|edition=1|year=1955|publisher=Blackie|location=London|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11394">The '''International Corpus of English''' (ICE) is a set of [[text corpus|corpora]] representing varieties of English from around the world. Over twenty countries or groups of countries where English is the first language or an official second language are included.

==History==
[[Sidney Greenbaum]]'s goal to compile corpora that would compare the syntax of world English became the ICE project that was achieved by Professor Charles F. Meyer. Sidney Greenbaum anticipated for international teams of researchers to collect comparable national variations of English both written and spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Proejct|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable variations would be British English, American English, and Indian English, that would be represented through a computer corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpora are used by researchers to compare the syntax of the varieties of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Gerald|date=May 2004|title=Introduction|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.uta.edu/10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00347.x|journal=World Englishes|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=225–226|doi=10.1111/j.0883-2919.2004.00347.x|issn=0883-2919}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE corpora completion would have comprehensive linguistic analysis of varieties of English that have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ongoing research for ICE is implemented by international teams in diversified regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb/beta/getstart2.pdf|title=The ICE Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began in 1990 with the primary aim of collecting material for comparative studies of English worldwide. Twenty-three research teams around the world are preparing electronic corpora of their own national or regional variety of English.  Each ICE corpus consists of one million words of spoken and written English produced after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://ice-corpora.net/ice/&lt;/ref&gt; For most participating countries, the ICE project is stimulating the first systematic investigation of the national variety. To ensure compatibility among the component corpora, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation.

==  Description ==
Each corpus contains one million words in 500 texts of 2000 words,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ice-corpora.net/ice/design.htm|title=Corpus Design @ ICE-corpora.net|website=ice-corpora.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the sampling methodology used for the [[Brown Corpus]]. Unlike Brown or the [[LOB Corpus|Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB) Corpus]] (or indeed mega-corpora such as the [[British National Corpus]]), however, the ''majority'' of texts are derived from spoken data.

With only one million words per corpus, ICE corpora are considered very small for modern standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Gerald|date=|title=The ICE project and world Englishes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.uta.edu/doi/10.1111/weng.12276/full|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1111/weng.12276/full|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICE corpora are  contain 60% (600,000 words) of orthographically transcribed ''spoken'' English. The father of the project, Sidney Greenbaum, insisted on the primacy of the spoken word, following Randolph Quirk and Jan Svartvik's collaboration on the original London-Lund Corpus (LLC). This emphasis on word-for-word transcription marks out ICE from many other corpora, including those containing, e.g. parliamentary or legal paraphrases.

The corpora consist entirely of data from 1990 or later. The subjects from which the data was collected are all adults who were educated in English and were either born, or moved at an early age, to the country to which their data is attributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are speech and text samples from both men and women of many age groups, but the corpus website makes it a point to note that, "The proportions, however, are not representative of the proportions in the population as a whole: women are not equally represented in professions such as politics and law, and so do not produce equal amounts of discourse in these fields."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The British Component of ICE, ICE-GB, is fully parsed with a detailed Quirk ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Randolph, Greenbaum, Sidney, Leech, Geoffrey and Svartvik, Jan (1985). ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] grammar, and the analyses have been thoroughly checked and completed. This analysis includes a [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[parsing]] of the entire corpus. The treebank can be thoroughly searched and explored with the ''ICE Corpus Utility Program'' or ''ICECUP'' software. More information is in the handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Gerald, Wallis, Sean, and Aarts, Bas (2002). ''Exploring Natural Language. Working with the British Component of the International Corpus of English'' Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure compatibility between the individual corpora in ICE, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice/ The International Corpus of English website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many corpora are currently available for download on the ICE official webpage, though some require a license. Others, however, are not ready for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ice-corpora.net/ice/|title=International Corpus of English (ICE) Homepage @ ICE-corpora.net|last=|first=|date=|website=ice-corpora.net|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textual and Grammatical Annotation ===
Researchers and Linguists follow specific guidelines when annotating data for the corpus, which can be found [http://ice-corpora.net/ice/manuals.htm here], in the International Corpus of English Manuals and Documentation. The three levels of annotation are Text Markup, Wordclass Tagging, Syntactic Parsing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch/en/annotate|title=Annotation|website=www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Textual Markup ====
Original markup and layout such as sentence and paragraph parsing is preserved, with special markers indicating it as original. Spoken data is transcribed orthographically, with indicators for hesitations, false starts, and pauses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Word Class Tagging ====
Word Classes, also called [[Part of speech|Parts of Speech]], are grammatical categories for words based upon their function in a sentence.

British texts are automatically tagged for wordclass by the ICE tagger, developed at University College London, which uses a comprehensive grammar of the English language.

All other languages are tagged automatically using the PENN Treebank and the CLAWS tagset. While the tags are not corrected manually, they are checked regularly for quality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Syntactic Parsing ====
The sentence are parsed automatically and, if necessary, are manually corrected with ICECUP, a syntax tree editor created specifically for the corpus.

Dependency parsing is also done automatically with the Dependency Parser Pro3GreS. The results are not manually verified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Pragmatic Parsing ====
Ireland is currently the only participant country who includes pragmatic annotation in their data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1677">The '''International Linguistic Association''' ('''ILA''') was founded in 1943 as the Linguistic Circle of New York. Its founding members were academic linguists in the New York area, including many members of the [[École Libre des Hautes Études]] in exile. The model for the new organization was the [[Société de Linguistique de Paris]]. Early members included [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Morris Swadesh]], [[André Martinet]], Henri F. Muller, [[Giuliano Bonfante]], [[Robert Austerlitz]], [[Robert Fowkes]], Henry Lee Smith, [[Wolf Leslau]], and [[Louis Herbert Gray|Louis H. Gray]].

The Circle began publishing the journal [[WORD_(journal)| WORD]] in 1945 under the editorship of [[Pauline Taylor]]. Both the Circle and the journal soon became known as one of the main sources of new ideas in American linguistics before the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] era.

In 1969, the society's name was changed to International Linguistic Association, as an acknowledgment of the fact that its membership now extended far beyond New York City.

The ILA holds an annual meeting every April (usually in New York) and sponsors individual talks on six Saturdays during the academic year. WORD is now under the editorship of Jonathan J. Webster of the City University of Hong Kong; since 2015, the journal has been published by Routledge/Taylor&amp;Francis.

'''John E. Woods''' is a Professor of Iranian and Central Asian History in the Departments of History and of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and the College at the [[University of Chicago]].

John Woods received his B.A. from the [[University of Texas]], where he was among the first to receive Title VI funding for the study of [[Arabic]].  In 1960, he was also among the first to receive a [[Fulbright]] fellowship for the Arabic study, traveling to [[Cairo]] to learn Arabic.  After a period of study in the University of Tehran, he completed his doctorate in Iranian history from [[Princeton University]] in 1974 under the supervision of Martin B. Dickson.  In 1970 he first came to teach at [[University of Chicago]], and quickly distinguished himself as a leading scholar of Middle Eastern and Islamic studies.  Professor Woods focuses primarily on the history of Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia from the 13th to 18th century. He is particularly interested in aspects of the encounter of sedentary and nomadic people in those regions during that time period. He is at present working on several projects dealing with the age of Chinggis Khan and Timur (Tamerlane). He has played a central role in the [[Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago|Center for Middle Eastern Studies]] since 1980, serving four terms as director. He has won recognition for excellence in undergraduate and graduate teaching at Chicago and is a recipient of the [[Farabi International Award]] for contributions in Iranian and Islamic studies.

'''José Argüelles''', born '''Joseph Anthony Arguelles''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑːr|ˈ|ɡ|w|eɪ|.|ᵻ|s}}; January 24, 1939 – March 23, 2011),&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/us/03arguelles.html | work=The New York Times | first=Margalit | last=Fox | title=José Argüelles, New Ager Focused on Time, Dies at 72 | date=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valum Votan/José Arguelles Has Ascended|url=http://www.lawoftime.org/|publisher=http://www.lawoftime.org/|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[New Age]] [[author]] and [[artist]]. He was the founder of Planet Art Network and the Foundation for the [[Law]] of Time. He held a Ph.D. in [[Art History]] and [[Aesthetics]] from the [[University of Chicago]] and taught at numerous colleges, including [[Princeton University]], the [[University of California, Davis]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], and [[The Evergreen State College|Evergreen State College]]. As one of the originators of the [[Earth Day]] concept (due in part to the influence of [[astrologer]] [[Dane Rudhyar]]), Argüelles founded the first [[Whole Earth Festival]] in 1970, at [[Davis, California]]. He is best known for his leading role in organizing the 1987 [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, for inventing (with the assistance of his wife Lloydine) the perpetual [[Dreamspell]] calendar in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Dreamspell: The Journey of Timeship Earth 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and for the central role that he played in the emergence of the [[2012 phenomenon]]. Towards the end of his life, Argüelles focused on issue of [[consciousness]], elaborating the concept of a [[noosphere]] (based on the work of [[Teilhard de Chardin]] and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]) as a global work of art. Specifically, he envisioned a "[[rainbow]] bridge" encircling the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Argüelles, José (2011), ''Manifesto for the Noosphere: The Next Stage in the Evolution of Human Consciousness'', New York: Evolver Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

Argüelles' father, Enrique Garcia Arguelles, was born in Jalisco, Guadalajara, Mexico to Sabino Garcia Arguelles and Maria Gomez Marquez. His mother, Ethel Pearl Martin, was born to Martin John Meyer and Laura Olga Hein in Potsdam, Minnesota. Joseph Anthony (Jose) Arguelles and his twin brother Ivan W. Arguelles were born in Rochester, Minnesota on January 24, 1939. José (born Joseph) was the twin brother of the poet [[Ivan Argüelles]] and the uncle of the linguist [[Alexander Argüelles]]. José Argüelles married twice and was the father of two children, Josh and Tara, by his first wife, writer and artist Miriam Tarcov. His second wife was Lloydine Burri. After concluding his teaching career in [[California]], Argüelles lived in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Ashland, Oregon]]. In the year 1999 he met Stephanie South who became his biographer.

== Influences ==

Argüelles' principal teacher and mentor was the unconventional [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] and former monk [[Chögyam Trungpa]], with whom he studied at [[Naropa University]] (then the Naropa Institute) in the mid-1970s. [[Astrologer]] [[Dane Rudhyar]] was also one of Argüelles' most influential mentors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;South, Stephanie (2009) ''2012: Biography of a Time Traveler - the Journey of Jose Argüelles'', Pompton Plains, NJ: [http://www.newpagebooks.com/ New Page Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Argüelles cited several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[New Age]] influences, among them [[Hopi]] elders [[Dan Katchongva]] and [[Thomas Banyacya]] and [[Lakota people|Lakota]] medicine man Arvol Looking Horse as well as part-[[Cheyenne]] author [[Frank Waters]]; part-[[Lakota people|Lakota]], former [[Mormon]], [[Beat Generation]] poet [[Tony Shearer]]; [[Anishinaabe]] spiritual leader Vincent La Duke (a.k.a. Sun Bear); [[Chuluaqui Quodoushka]] founder Harley Reagan; [[Brooke Medicine Eagle|Brooke "Medicine Eagle" Edwards]]; and Diane Fisher (a.k.a. Dhyani Ywahoo).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Argüelles' significant intellectual influences included [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the writings of [[Carl Jung]] and [[Mircea Eliade]].

Later in his life, Argüelles adopted the "Banner of Peace" from a design created by the Russian painter, explorer, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]] to accompany the adoption of the [[Roerich Pact]] for protecting cultural properties during wartime.

== Artist ==

As a painter and visual artist, he provided illustrations for numerous books, as well as mural paintings at different universities. However, his scope as an artist included his education as an Art History Professor, and his views on art as a "psychophysical aesthetic" can be found in his doctoral dissertation ''Charles Henry and the Formation of a Psychophysical Aesthetic'' (Chicago University Press, 1972). When teaching as an untenured assistant professor at the [[University of California, Davis]], one of his final exams to his students was to create "something they believed in"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; - this became a living art event which eventually became the basis for the annual [[Whole Earth Festival]], still held today at the University of California, Davis. After experimenting with [[LSD]] in the mid-1960s, Argüelles produced a series of [[psychedelic art]] paintings&lt;ref&gt;Arguelles, Jose ''Mandala'' 1972 (The psychedelic [[mandala]]-like paintings of Jose Argüelles are reproduced on color plates in the back of the book)&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Humphrey Osmond]]—who originally coined the word "psychedelic"—named these "The Doors of Perception" (after [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] 1954 [[The Doors of Perception|book of the same name]], itself a title drawn from [[William Blake|William Blake's]] early 19th-century work ''[[Milton a Poem]]''). In a 2002 interview, Argüelles says of his artwork, "as fantastic as painting was, it was a limited medium in terms of audience."&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Argüelles viewed his role as a [[visionary]], saying "My job as a visionary is to envision the best possible outcome for humanity."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; He dedicated much of his life to promoting an alternative calendar based on a cycle of 13 months of 28 days each, which he believed would help bring about world peace. He coined the slogan "Time is Art" for the Planetary Art Network (PAN) slogan, suggesting that time is a vehicle for our creative experience.

== Spiritual Leader ==

José Argüelles was the principal organizer of the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event on August 16–17, 1987, said to have been the first globally synchronized [[meditation]] event. It focused on dates that had been identified by [[Tony Shearer]] in his book ''Lord of the Dawn'' (1971), a collection of poems in honor of the [[Aztec]] [[deity]] [[Quetzalcoatl]] (associated with the planet [[Venus]]) and describing major cycles of time.  Argüelles' ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology'' (1987), was published in conjunction with the Harmonic Convergence. In it, Argüelles described a  [[numerology|numerological]] system combining elements taken from the pre-Columbian [[Maya calendar]] with the ''[[I Ching]]'' and elements of [[shamanism]].  These were interspersed with parallel concepts drawn from modern sciences such as "[[genetic code]]s" and "galactic convergences".&lt;ref&gt;Hess 1993: 72&lt;/ref&gt;  The book popularized the concept of [[Hunab Ku]], associating the Colonial Maya concept of "One God" with an [[Aztec]] design from a woven rug Argüelles had obtained in a marketplace in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico.

Argüelles (who called himself Valum [[Votan]]), working together with his wife Lloydine (a.k.a. Bolon Ik), produced a calendar and divination system ''[[Dreamspell]]: The Journey of Timeship Earth 2013'' and a game/tool ''Telektonon: The Talking Stone of Prophecy.'' The former, based on the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] with special emphasis on the 260-day ''[[tzolk'in]]'' count, was the source of Argüelles' 13 Moon/28 Day Calendar. This calendar begins on July 26 (heliacal rising of the star Sirius) and runs for 364 days. The remaining date, July 25, is celebrated in some quarters as the "Day out of Time/Peace through Culture Festival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Stella | last=Mutch | title=A Day Out of Time | publisher=Going Coastal Magazine | url=http://www.goingcoastalmagazine.com/articl20.htm | accessdate=2009-04-30 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818152927/http://www.goingcoastalmagazine.com/articl20.htm | archivedate=2010-08-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; - celebrated in over 90 countries around the world. Argüelles attributed the origins of the calendar to "Galactic Mayas," who he believed were [[ancient astronauts]] that had visited the ancient Mayas and taught them elements of civilization. One of their leaders was an individual he called Pacal Votan, known to [[Mayanist]]s as [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]], who was buried in an elaborate tomb at the site of [[Palenque]]. (''Telektonon'' was Argüelles' term for a stone speaking tube in the pyramid where Pakal is entombed.)

== The Law of Time ==
In ''Time and the Technosphere'' (2002), Argüelles devises and promotes a notion that he calls the "Law of Time", in part framed by his interpretations of how Maya calendrical mathematics functioned. In this notional framework Argüelles claims to have identified a "fundamental law" involving two timing frequencies: one he calls "mechanised time" with a "12:60 frequency", and the other "natural [time] codified by the Maya [that is] understood to be the frequency 13:20".&lt;ref&gt;Terminology and statements in quotation marks taken from 2002 interview with Argüelles, as transcribed in Moynihan (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; To Argüelles, "the irregular 12-month [Gregorian] calendar and artificial, mechanised 60-minute hour" is a construct that artificially regulates human affairs, and is out-of-step with the natural "synchronic order". He proposes the universal abandonment of the Gregorian calendar and its replacement with a [[Calendar reform#13-month calendars|thirteen moon, 28 day calendar]], in order to "get the human race back on course" by the adoption of this calendar of perfect harmony so the human race could straighten its mind out again."&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some critics claim {{Who|date=June 2010}} Argüelles [[Co-option|co-opts]] an ancient tradition by recasting it in [[New Age]] terms, but he explained that his tools and calendar were not intended to be the same as the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Maya calendar]]. Argüelles' approach is actually a form of [[syncretism]]. Many of Dreamspell's influences come from non-Maya sources, such as the 13-month/28-day calendar, a magic square devised by [[Benjamin Franklin]], the ''[[I Ching]]'', [[numerology]], and assorted [[mystical]] and [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]] works such as [[Erich von Däniken]]'s ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' (1970), which emphasizes theories of [[ancient astronauts]].&lt;ref&gt;Feder 1990: 189; Hess 1993: 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Argüelles' calendar is based on a different day-count than the traditional Maya calendar. For example, in the traditional count January 1, 2005 is 5 ''Muluk'', while in the Dreamspell it is 2 ''Etznab''. This is attributed to a change of 52 days in the count that Argüelles made to accommodate a "Time Shift' in 1992.  As mathematician Michael Finley notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the 365 day Maya [[haab]] makes no provision for leap years, its starting date in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] advances by one day every four years.   The beginning of Argüelles' year is fixed to July 26.  Thus his count of days departs from the haab as it was known to Maya scribes before the Spanish conquest. Argüelles claims that the Thirteen Moon Calendar is synchronized with the calendar round. Clearly, it is not.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation is from Finley (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Argüelles' 13 Moon Calendar with a July 26 new year maintained the same symmetrical cross-referencing of year bearers the ancient Maya used.  The first day of the year in both the 13 Moon Calendar and the Maya's Haab always begins on one of only four glyphs, called year bearers.  In the Mayan calendar the first day of the year on the Haab consistently corresponds with one of four glyphs derived from the [[tzolk'in]], called "year bearers." The year-bearer glyph from the tzolk'in is used to identify the character of the 365-day year that follows. In this way the ''[[tzolk'in]]'' and ''[[haab']]'' are continuously cross-patterned with each other in an ongoing matrix, but fully synchronize only once in 52 years.

In defense Argüelles has stated that the 13 moon 28 day synchronometer (calendar) is "correct and biologically accurate for the whole planet." [http://www.earthportals.com/Portal_Messenger/speakout.html]

== Planet Art Network ==

Argüelles co-founded the Planet Art Network (PAN) with Lloydine in 1983 as an autonomous, meta-political, worldwide peace organization engaging in art and spirituality. Active in over 90 countries, PAN identifies the [[Roerich Pact]] and has adopted its associated Banner of Peace as a symbol for "Peace Through Culture".

The Planet Art Network operates as a network of self-organized collectives, centralized by a shared focus of promoting the worldwide adoption of Argüelles' Dreamspell 13-Moon/28 day Calendar. The network upholds the slogan "Time is Art", suggesting that time is a vehicle for our creative experience, instead of the familiar saying "Time is Money".

The British anthropologist [[Will Black]] conducted research into Jose's Arguelles' Planet Art Network for several years. In his book ''Beyond the End of the World: 2012 and Apocalypse'' (2010), Black documents a general loss of interest in Dreamspell and in PAN in recent years.  Black points out that, as general interest in the [[2012 phenomenon]] increased as a result of the proximity of the supposed "end date," the significance of PAN and the value placed on Arguelles' ideas waned. Although Argüelles and his Dreamspell system were instrumental in encouraging people to consider the meaning of 2012, further investigation by individuals tended to provoke questioning of the Dreamspell.

==First Noosphere World Forum==

At the time of his death, he was the director of the Noosphere II project of the Foundation's Galactic Research Institute, inclusive of the First Noosphere World Forum, a project that involves creating a dialogue that unifies a network of organizations working to promote a positive shift of consciousness by 2012 with the vision of the whole earth as a work of art.

'''Judith Lorber''' (born November 28, 1931) is Professor Emerita of Sociology and Women’s Studies at The [[CUNY Graduate Center]] and [[Brooklyn College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. She is a foundational theorist of [[social construction of gender difference]] and has played a vital role in the formation and transformation of gender studies. She has more recently called for a de-gendering of the social world.

Lorber was actively involved in [[Sociologists for Women in Society]] from the early 1970s. She developed and taught some of the first courses in the [[sociology of gender]], [[women's studies]], and [[feminist theory]] at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School, where she was the first Coordinator of the Women's Studies Certificate Program in 1988–1991. She was Chair of the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] Sex and Gender Section in 1992–93 and was awarded the [[Jessie Bernard Award]] in 1996 “in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”

== Biography ==

Judith Lorber was born in [[Brooklyn]] New York where she attended public elementary and high school. She graduated from [[Queens College]], CUNY in 1952, and received an M.A. and Ph.D. from [[New York University]] in 1971. She started developing and teaching courses in [[women’s studies]] in 1972, and taught at [[Fordham University]] in the [[Bronx]] and at [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[CUNY Graduate School]] until she retired from teaching in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Centers-and-Institutes/Center-for-the-Study-of-Women-and-Society/Faculty-and-Staff#Profiles|title=Faculty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lives in New York/NY. She is the sister of artist Stephen Lorber (born 1943).

== Work ==

=== Gender, mental health and illness ===

The main perspective of Lorber’s work has been [[social construction]]—the idea that in social interaction, people produce their identities and statuses, and at the same time, reproduce the structure and constraints of their social world. This perspective analyzes illnesses as social states in which norms and expectations for behavior while ill emerge from the interaction of patients and health-care workers with each other and with family members, friends, and co-workers. Lorber’s next research project (with Roberta Satow) was interviewing psychiatric residents, social workers, and indigenous paraprofessionals in a ghetto community mental health center on issues of cultural congruity with patients and the stratification of prestige and work assignments.&lt;ref&gt;see co-authored articles out of this project under publications http://www.robertasatow.com/author.html#books&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Lorber’s last work on gender and health care, ''Gender and the Social Construction of Illness'', was published in 1997 as part of the Gender Lens series. A second edition, which she co-authored with Lisa Jean Moore, was published by [[Rowman and Littlefield]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gender and the Social Construction of Illness – Second Edition | publisher=Rowman Altamira |author1=Lorber, Judith  |author2=Moore, Lisa Jean | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7591-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book shows that because gender is embedded in the economy, the family, politics, and the medical and legal systems, it is a major factor in the behavior of patients and health care professionals. She also co-authored ''Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives'' with Lisa Jean Moore. The first edition was published by Roxbury in 2007, and the second edition by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2011. The overall perspective is that of the transformation of the body through gendered social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gendered bodies: feminist perspectives | publisher=Roxbury Pub. Co. |author1=Lorber, Judith  |author2=Moore, Lisa Jean | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-933220-41-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women physicians ===

Her work on [[women physicians]], which culminated in ''Women Physicians: Careers, Status, and Power'', published in 1984, as well as a series of papers published from 1981 to 1987, was a logical combination of her feminism and [[medical sociology]]. In it, she showed how the difficulties [[women physicians]] encountered in their career advancement when compared to a matched sample of men physicians were the result of the processes of sponsorship and patronage in the informal organization of the medical profession. She thus expanded the analysis of the informal structure of the medical profession, which had been applied only to men physicians, to women, who were, at that point, entering [[medical school]] in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Book Reviews | journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illness | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=100 | doi=10.1111/1467-9566.ep11346518| year=1986 | last1=Elston | first1=Mary Ann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the physicians that Lorber met in the course of her work on women physicians, Florence Haseltine, set her on the road to her next research project—on patient's experiences with one of the new procreative technologies -- [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF), doctor-assisted conception. The research she conducted with Lakshmi Bandlamudi and Dorothy Greenfeld found that couples shaped their experiences through their behavior with clinic staff and other caretakers and with each other, creating meaning and some sense of control for themselves. Judith Lorber applied a [[feminist analysis]] to the growing use of IVF in male infertility, where the woman is fertile but the man isn’t. This situation sets the stage for marital bargaining, in which the woman seemingly is in a strong position, but which turns out to the man's advantage because of his dominance in the gender politics of the family. The [[feminist]], [[ethical]], and medical implications of this research were explored in papers published in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;for instance: 1991. "Can Women Physicians Ever Be True Equals in the American Medical Profession?" In Current Research in Occupations and Professions, vol. 6, edited by Judith A. Levy.  Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, https://books.google.com/books/about/Current_Research_on_Occupations_and_Prof.html?id=ZnAS_gAACAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist politics ===

Lorber’s feminism (and love of science fiction thinking) appeared in print as early as 1975 in "Beyond Equality of the Sexes: The Question of the Children," followed by "Dismantling Noah's Ark" in 1986. In 1987, she became the Founding Editor of [[Gender &amp; Society]], the official publication of  [[Sociologists for Women in Society]](SWS). As a hands-on editor, Judith Lorber shaped the papers, the linguistic style, and the emerging themes. The journal was (and still is) extremely successful and is the main source of SWS’s current finances. She and Susan Farrell edited the first Gender &amp; Society reader, ''The Social Construction of Gender'', published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16138663.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpWxAAAAIAAJ|title=The Social construction of gender|first=Judith|last=Lorber|date=1 December 1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-3956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Lorber made a significant contribution to [[gender studies]] by writing her own book that has since then become a bible and mandatory reading in women’s studies classes.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2782284|title=Review of Paradoxes of Gender|first=Rosanna|last=Hertz|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=100|issue=5|pages=1336–1338|doi=10.1086/230645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/9405277778/gender-question|title=The Gender Question|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes of Gender'', published by [[Yale]] in 1994, contends that sex, sexuality, and gender are all socially constructed but that gender is the overarching category—a major [[social status]] that organizes almost all areas of social life. Therefore, bodies and sexuality are gendered—biology, physiology, and sexuality do not add up to gender, which is a [[social institution]] that establishes patterns of expectations for individuals, orders the social processes of everyday life, is built into the major social organizations of society, and is also an entity in and of itself. Lorber's theoretical approach to gender is masterful and unusual by  mainstream empirical social science standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3175205|title=Review of Feminist Theory Today: An Introduction to Second-Wave Feminism, ; Modern Feminist Thought: From the Second Wave to "Post-Feminism.", ; Paradoxes of Gender|first=Christine|last=Di Stefano|date=1 January 1998|publisher=|journal=Signs|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1068–1072|doi=10.1086/495303}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paradoxes'' has been translated into Italian and German and has influenced a generation of graduate students in the United States and other countries. The first chapter, “Night to His Day: The Social Construction of Gender,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.meac.org/Resources/ed_services/SG_WEB/SeeingGender/PDFs/SocialConstructionOfGender.pdf | title="Night to his Day": The Social Construction of Gender | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | author=Lorber, Judith | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325153009/http://www.meac.org/Resources/ed_services/SG_WEB/SeeingGender/PDFs/SocialConstructionOfGender.pdf | archivedate=March 25, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been widely anthologized, as has a paper based on the second chapter, “Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.” The book has impacted not only sociology,&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; but also the fields  of  anthropology,  history,  social  psychology, sociolinguistics,  men's  studies,  culture  studies, and even law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol1/iss1/6/|title=Toward Gender Equality: The Promise of Paradoxes of Gender to Promote Structural Change|first=Giampetro-Meyer,|last=Andrea|date=1 January 1994|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gender Inequalities: Feminist Theories and Politics'' was first published in 1998 by Roxbury and is now in its fifth edition, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2012. It sums up the last 35 years of feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics. | year=1998 | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | author=Lorber, Judith | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401165143/http://www.socqrl.niu.edu/myers/feminisms.html | archivedate=April 1, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revisioning Gender'', which she co-edited with Beth Hess and [[Myra Marx Ferree]], was published by [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] in 1999. It is a collection of original essays in different areas of social research that have been changed by the use of gender as a conceptual framework. She co-edited the ''Handbook of Gender and Women’s Studies'', published by Sage UK in 2006 with [[Mary Evans]] and [[Kathy Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies | publisher=SAGE |author1=Lorber, Judith |author2=Davis, Kathy |author3=Evans, Mary | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7619-4390-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Toward a World Beyond Gender" ===

Lorber’s current work is to go “beyond.” In "Beyond the Binaries: Depolarizing the Categories of Sex, Sexuality, and Gender," published in Sociological Inquiry in 1996, she argued that sociological data would be more accurate if it used more than the two polarized categories of sex, sexuality, and gender. In “Crossing Borders and Erasing Boundaries: Paradoxes of Identity Politics,” published in Sociological Focus in 1999, she pulled apart racial and transgender categories. In fact, Judith Lorber has gone so far as to argue that we should imagine a social world that is not organized by gender. She explored this idea in “Using Gender to Undo Gender: A Feminist Degendering Movement, ” published in Feminist Theory in 2000. ''Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Social Change'' puts together all the “beyond” ideas and asks us to imagine a world without gender. It was published in 2005 by [[W.W. Norton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csx.sagepub.com/content/35/3/246.full.pdf%20html|title=Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Feminist Change|first=Bandana|last=Purkayastha|date=1 April 2006|publisher=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=286–288|doi=10.1177/0891243205285013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[American Sociological Association]] Annual Meetings, held in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], the theme was “utopias.” Judith Lorber gave an invited presentation at the opening plenary: “Gender Equality: Utopian and Realistic.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | title=Video of Lorber's opening lecture at ASA plenary 2012 Denver | publisher=American Sociological Association | people=Crenshaw, Kimberlé  Lorber, Judith  van Parijs, Philippe | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222001648/http://videoarchive.asanet.org/presentations/2012ondemand_opening_plenary_session_equality.html?plist=2012 | archivedate=2013-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also presented an invited paper, “Toward a World Beyond Gender: A Utopian Vision,” with [[Barbara J. Risman]] and Jessica Holden Sherwood. Recently, she has written and given presentations about the heroine of the popular [[Stieg Larsson]] trilogy -- “The Gender Ambiguity of [[Lisbeth Salander]]: Third-wave Feminist Hero?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Men Who Hate Women and Women Who Kick Their Asses: Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy in Feminist Perspective | publisher=Vanderbilt University Press | author=King, Donna | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-8265-1849-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology" ===

Judith Lorber is published in Chapter 3 of "The Gendered Society Reader," an anthology edited by Michael S. Kimmel; Amy Aronson; and Amy Kaler, with a text titled “Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.”

In the text, Lorber discusses the social constructs built into our society differentiating the genders. Lorber argues that “bodies differ in many ways physiologically; but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are ‘female’ and ‘male and ‘women’ and ‘men’".&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith (2011). Ch.3 "Seeing Is Believing: Biology as Ideology," pp. 11-18 in ''The Gendered Society Reader'', Ed. Michael S. Kimmel, Amy Aronson, Amy Kaler. Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2011; p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lorber points out that though the physiological differences of the sexes are there, each individual body does not always fit into its own category and “neither sex nor gender are pure categories”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber exemplifies this by separating the genders and discussing differences within the separate ‘female’ and ‘male’ categories; she argues some women do not have ovaries and uteri, menopause differentiates menstruating women for those who do not, some men lactate, and some men cannot produce sperm. As she discusses the blurred lines surrounding individual bodies within their gender categories, she continues to exemplify the pre-determined social classifications surrounding gender in our society by using competitive sports.

In Lorber’s section of this Chapter 3 headed ‘What Sports Illustrate,’ she argues that the pre-determined societal beliefs surrounding gender have turned competitive sports into a way for men to legitimize aggression and create their masculine identity. Conversely, Lorber believes that the female sex in competitive sports is made a mockery of and continually takes a “secondary status” to competitive male sports.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber uses the example of basketball to confirm her belief. She correlates the female secondary status to assumptions surrounding women’s physiology. As well Lorber believes this assumption of physiology influences rules in women's sports, rules in sporting competitions, and how women are treated in sporting competitions.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

However, Lorber connects these social barriers that continually separate the sexes in sports, with the economical barriers oppressing the female sex. She compares competitive sports to big businesses and therefore argues that they are no longer just a social construct but an economic, political, and ideological issue developed by those who define and profit from competitive sports.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lorber (2011), pp. 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorber continues to describe social boundaries set up by gender using technology; she brings up two examples—computers and cars. When computers first came into use, office jobs involving them were given to women, as it appeared to be a clerical duty. It was not until computers were revealed to be complex and intellectually demanding that they became the domain of men. “By the 1960s programing was split into more and less skilled specialties, and the entry of women into the computer field in the 1970s and 1980s was confined to the lower paid specialties…employers invoked women and men’s purportedly natural capabilities for the jobs for which they were hired”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; This means women will do the more menial tasks, where men will shape the industry and control it. Lorber also describes how this has influenced young people; for example we see far more young men and boys playing computer games and getting involved in computer clubs. In this way we are furthering women’s supposed natural disadvantage with computers by allowing boys to get more education and comfort with computers than girls.

This pattern of male control over technology continues when it comes to cars. Lorber references the fact that in couples a man will almost always be the more frequent driver, regardless of aptitude. This may seem like an inconsequential example, but Lorber asks us to consider in different contexts what a vehicle can mean. She describes the importance of the mobility, literally and figuratively, given to women by driving. Feminists used driving “to campaign for women’s suffrage in parts of the United States not served by public transportation and they effectively used motorcades and speaking from cars as campaign tactics”.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Lorber also describes the sense of liberation felt by many women when they first experienced driving, while participating in First World War efforts. This gendering of who a driver can be does limit women’s options in the world more than we consider when we simply see the male in a couple taking the wheel.

Lorber finalizes her arguments discussing the paradoxes of human nature. She confirms, “gendered people do not emerge from physiology or hormones, but from the exigencies of the social order”.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber points out that the diversity of humans could be categorized, regrouped and broken up into different ways of comparison than the traditional sex differentiation that disregards the real issues of who is truly like whom.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; She argues that the problem of basing knowledge on presumptions of gender differences reaffirms the categorization of the ‘male’ versus ‘female’. When relying on the conventional categorization of gender, one is able to find what they are looking for.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber (2011), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber states, “we see what we believe, whether it is that ‘female’ and ‘males’ are essentially different or that ‘women’ and ‘men’ are essentially the same.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

== Selected honors and awards ==

Judith Lorber received the [[American Sociological Association]]’s [[Jessie Bernard]] Career Award in 1996 for “scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/about/awards/bernard.cfm | title=Jessie Bernard ASA Major Award | accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was President of the [[Eastern Sociological Society]] in 2001–2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essnet.org/OfficersPast.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010002414/http://www.essnet.org/OfficersPast.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the Sex and Gender Section of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1993, and President of [[Sociologists for Women in Society]] in 1981–82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socwomen.org/web/about/leadership/3003-past-presidents-and-officers.html | title=Past Presidents and Officers | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415214534/http://www.socwomen.org/web/about/leadership/3003-past-presidents-and-officers.html | archivedate=April 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean studies''', or '''Koreanology''' is an academic discipline that focuses on the study of [[Korea]], which includes the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and diasporic Korean populations. Areas commonly included under this rubric include [[History of Korea|Korean history]], [[Korean culture]], [[Korean literature]], [[Korean art]], [[Korean music]], [[Korean language]] and linguistics, Korean sociology and anthropology, Korean politics, Korean economics, Korean folklore, Korean [[ethnomusicology]] and increasing study of Korean popular culture. It may be compared to other [[area studies]] disciplines, such as [[American studies]] and [[Chinese studies]]. Korean studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including "[[East Asian studies]]" or "[[Asian studies]]."

The term Korean studies first began to be used in the 1940s, but did not attain widespread currency until [[South Korea]] rose to economic prominence in the 1970s. In 1991, the South Korean government established the [[Korea Foundation]] to promote Korean studies around the world.{{ref|kf1}}

Korean studies was originally an area of study conceived of and defined by non-Koreans. Korean scholars of Korea tend to see themselves as linguists, sociologists, and historians, but not as "Koreanists" unless they have received at least some of their education outside Korea and are academically active (for example publishing and attending conferences)in languages other than Korean (most Korean studies publications are in English but there is also a significant amount of Korean Studies activity in other European languages), or work outside Korean academia. In the mid-2000s, Korean universities pushing for more classes taught in English began to hire foreign-trained Koreanists of Korean and non-Korean origin to teach classes. This was often geared towards foreigners in Korean graduate schools. There are now graduate school programs in Korean Studies (mostly active at the MA level) in most of the major Korean universities. BA programs in Korean Studies have now been opened at two Korean universities. The BA programs are distinctive in that they have few foreign students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">'''Lowell Lindsay Bennion''' (July 26, 1908 – February 21, 1996) was an American educator, sociologist, and humanitarian.  He wrote extensively on religious living in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormon or LDS Church), and was an advocate for volunteer service in [[Utah]] and [[Idaho]].

==Biography==
Bennion was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], the son of [[Milton Bennion]] and Cora Lindsay Bennion.  In 1928, Bennion graduated from the [[University of Utah]], married Merle Colton and then left to serve in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]–German [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] of the LDS Church.&lt;ref name= Bradford-2000-p90 &gt;{{harvnb|Bradford|2000|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bennion spent much of his mission in [[Zürich]], where he served as [[branch president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Bradford |first= Mary Lythgoe |title= Lowell L. Bennion: Teacher, Counselor, Humanitarian |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought|Dialogue Foundation]] |year= 1995 |page= 39 |isbn= 1560850817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After serving two and a half years as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] Bennion began studies towards his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]].  His wife came to France to live with him at about this point.

After earning his Ph.D. in sociology in 1933, Bennion returned to Utah and founded the [[Institute of Religion]] adjacent to the University of Utah in 1934.&lt;ref name= Bradford-2000-p90 /&gt;  Bennion later founded [[Teton Valley Boys Ranch]] and served as its director for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Dennis |last= Lythgoe |date= March 27, 1990 |title= Return of Teton Boys Ranch Perpetuates Bennion's Legacy |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/93874/RETURN-OF-TETON-BOYS-RANCH-PERPETUATES-BENNIONS-LEGACY.html |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served as a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] in the LDS Church. The first [[food bank]] and [[homeless shelter]]s in Utah were founded by Bennion.&lt;ref name= Bradford-2000-p90 /&gt;

[[File:Marie Antoinette The Journey.jpg|thumb|right|Orion Publishing Group]]

'''''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''''' is a sympathetic 2001 biography of [[archduchess]] [[Marie Antoinette]], the [[Queen of France]] (1774–1792) by [[Antonia Fraser]].  It is the basis for the 2006 [[Sofia Coppola]] film ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]''.

The book, which was relaunched to coincide with the release of the related film, has had considerable success.  It has been translated into French and Italian, been awarded the Enid McLeod Literary Prize, received critical praise including being described "definitive" by British historian, [[Amanda Foreman (biographer)|Amanda Foreman]], author of a bestselling biography of [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire]]. It is considered, by some modern historians, as the most thorough and balanced biography of the queen,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} though it naturally builds upon earlier biographies, first hand accounts, and even the infamous [[libelle (literary genre)|libelles]] which destroyed the queen's reputation.

==Reception==
Steve Raiteri from [[Library Journal]] commends ''Mechademia'' as a "great first effort [...] bridg[ing] the gap between academics and fans."&lt;ref name=Raiteri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6403916.html |title=Graphic Novels: Religion and Comics |last=Raiteri |first=Steve |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[Library Journal]] |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625221944/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6403916.html |archivedate=2009-06-25 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Christophe Thouny, writing for ''Animation'' also thought the writing and tone was accessible by both academics and fans.&lt;ref name=Thouny&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thouny |first=Christophe |year=2008 |title=Untitled Review |journal=Animation |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=212–217 |doi=10.1177/17468477080030020703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading criticizes the journal for its review and commentary section because they "read like summaries of the works (films and books) discussed with no actual critique of the work". However, Sizemore commends the journal's academic essay section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2007/06/25/mechademia-1/ |title=Mechademia 1 |last=Sizemore |first=Ed |date=June 25, 2007 |publisher=Comics Worth Reading |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125025446/http://comicsworthreading.com/2007/06/25/mechademia-1/ |archivedate=November 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By contrast, Raiteri in [[Library Journal]] states that fans will find the Review and Commentary section "the most accessible" section of the journal.&lt;ref name=Raiteri /&gt; Kevin Gifford contrasts ''Mechademia'' with shallower works on anime, praising its "insightful essays and reviews" and detail, calling it "worthwhile reading for anyone hungry for intelligent writing" about anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Mechademia Volume 1 |magazine=Newtype USA |publisher=A.D.

A review of the second volume of ''Mechademia'' by Comics Worth Reading's Johanna Draper Carlson criticises the journal for its dry tone and "flat statements following after each other separated only by footnote numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/09/14/mechademia-2-networks-of-desire/ |title=Mechademia 2: Networks of Desire |last=Draper Carlson |first=Johanna |date=September 14, 2008 |publisher=Comics Worth Reading |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125024629/http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/09/14/mechademia-2-networks-of-desire/ |archivedate=November 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later review by Ed Sizemore recommends that ''Mechademia'' "should stop trying to develop a theme for each issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/02/24/mechademia-3-limits-of-the-human/ |title=Mechademia 3: Limits of the Human |last=Sizemore |first=Ed |date=February 24, 2009 |publisher=Comics Worth Reading |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519052311/http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/02/24/mechademia-3-limits-of-the-human/ |archivedate=May 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood comments that the journal's "strong academic bent may put off some potential readers but give it a chance and peruse through the many varied topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activeanime.com/html/2007/01/18/mechademia-emerging-worlds-of-anime-and-manga/ |title=Mechademia: Emerging Worlds of Anime and Manga |last=Ellingwood |first=Holly |date=January 18, 2007 |work=Active Anime |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228021836/http://activeanime.com/html/2007/01/18/mechademia-emerging-worlds-of-anime-and-manga/ |archivedate=December 28, 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; A later review by Scott Campbell commends the third volume of ''Mechademia'' as being "extremely insightful and thought provoking ...

William McClain criticises the fourth volume for having articles that are "too restrictive" in focus, calling attention to the lack of discussion, in this volume, of how anime and manga culture has spread internationally.  McClain also criticises the volume for not including enough visual aids for the general reader, but praises the ''Mechademia'' journal as a whole for its experimental approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClain |first=William |url=http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/view/961/478 |title=Mechademia Volume 4: War/Time |work=International Journal of Communication |publisher= |volume=4 |year=2010 |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231034636/http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/view/961/478 |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Grabiner feels that ''War/Time'' takes the approach that war has become a part of everyday life in post-war Japanese society, and praises the broad range of essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grabiner |first=Ellen |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v5_4/grabiner/ |title=Review of Mechademia 4: War/Time |work=ImageTexT: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies |publisher=University of Florida |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228042017/http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v5_4/grabiner/ |archivedate=December 28, 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Iles feels that the strength of ''Mechademia'' is that it provides "theoretically informed, historically grounded, jargon-free research that highlights first and foremost, not the self-serving virtuosity of the researcher, but the interpretive depth of the material under analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iles |first=Timothy |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2011/Iles3.html |title=Mechanical, Academic, Anime: Mechademia 4 and Mechademia 5 |work=Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies |publisher= |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204042534/http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2011/Iles3.html |archivedate=February  4, 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originally claimed that speech perception is done through a specialized [[Modularity of mind|module]] that is [[Nature (innate)|innate]] and human-specific. Though the idea of a module has been qualified in more recent versions of the theory,&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt; the idea remains that the role of the speech [[motor system]] is not only to produce speech articulations but also to detect them.

The hypothesis has gained more interest outside the field of [[speech perception]] than inside. This has increased particularly since the discovery of [[mirror neuron]]s that link the production and perception of motor movements, including those made by the vocal tract.&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

The theory was initially proposed in the [[Haskins Laboratories]] in the 1950s by [[Alvin Liberman]] and [[Franklin S. Cooper]], and developed further by [[Donald Shankweiler]], [[Michael Studdert-Kennedy]], [[Ignatius Mattingly]], [[Carol Fowler]] and [[Douglas Whalen]].

==Origins and development==

The hypothesis has its origins in research using [[pattern playback]] to create reading machines for the [[Blindness|blind]] that would substitute sounds for orthographic letters.&lt;ref&gt;Liberman, A. M. (1996). Speech: A special code. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-12192-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a close examination of how spoken sounds correspond to the acoustic [[spectrogram]] of them as a sequence of auditory sounds. This found that successive [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s overlap in time with one another (a phenomenon known as [[coarticulation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}} [http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/LSA317/lsa317_fowler_saltzman1993.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggested that speech is not heard like an acoustic "alphabet" or "cipher," but as a "code" of overlapping speech gestures.

===Associationist approach===
Initially, the theory was associationist: infants mimic the speech they hear and that this leads to [[Behaviorism|behavioristic]] associations between articulation and its sensory consequences. Later, this overt mimicry would be short-circuited and become speech perception.&lt;ref name="Liberman54"/&gt;  This aspect of the theory was dropped, however, with the discovery that prelinguistic [[infant]]s could already detect most of the phonetic contrasts used to separate different speech sounds.&lt;ref name="Liberman67"/&gt;

===Cognitivist approach===

The behavioristic approach was replaced by a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] one in which there was a [[language module|speech module]].&lt;ref name="Liberman67"/&gt;  The module detected speech in terms of hidden [[distal object]]s rather than at the proximal or immediate level of their input. The evidence for this was the research finding that speech processing was special such as [[duplex perception]].&lt;ref name="LibermanDuplex"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | doi=10.3758/bf03204471
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing distal objects===
Initially, speech perception was assumed to link to speech objects that were both
* the invariant movements of speech articulators&lt;ref name="Liberman54"/&gt;
* the invariant [[motor command]]s sent to muscles to move the vocal tract articulators&lt;ref name="lib70"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liberman |first1=A.

This was later revised to include the phonetic gestures rather than motor commands,&lt;ref name="Liberman67"/&gt; and then the gestures intended by the speaker at a prevocal, linguistic level, rather than actual movements.&lt;ref name="lib85"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4075760 |year=1985 |author1=Liberman |first1=A.

===Modern revision===
The "speech is special" claim has been dropped,&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt; as it was found that speech perception could occur for nonspeech sounds (for example, slamming doors for [[duplex perception]]).&lt;ref name="Duplex"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Mirror neurons===

The discovery of [[mirror neuron]]s has led to renewed interest in the motor theory of speech perception, and the theory still has its advocates,&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt; although there are also critics.&lt;ref name="Massaro01"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Nonauditory gesture information===

If speech is identified in terms of how it is physically made, then nonauditory information should be incorporated into speech [[percept]]s even if it is still [[Subjectivity|subjectively]] heard as "sounds". This is, in fact, the case.
* The [[McGurk effect]] shows that seeing the production of a spoken [[syllable]] that differs from an auditory cue synchronized with it affects the perception of the auditory one. In other words, if someone hears "ba" but sees a video of someone pronouncing "ga", what they hear is different&amp;mdash;some people believe they hear "da".
* People find it easier to hear speech in [[noise]] if they can see the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Categorical perception===

Using a [[speech synthesizer]], speech sounds can be varied in [[place of articulation]] along a continuum from {{IPA|/bɑ/}} to {{IPA|/dɑ/}} to {{IPA|/ɡɑ/}}, or in [[voice onset time]] on a continuum from {{IPA|/dɑ/}} to {{IPA|/tɑ/}} (for example). When listeners are asked to discriminate  between two different sounds, they perceive sounds as belonging to discrete categories, even though the sounds vary continuously. In other words, 10 sounds (with the sound on one extreme being {{IPA|/dɑ/}} and the sound on the other extreme being {{IPA|/tɑ/}}, and the ones in the middle varying on a scale) may all be acoustically different from one another, but the listener will hear all of them as either {{IPA|/dɑ/}} or {{IPA|/tɑ/}}. Likewise, the English consonant {{IPA|/d/}} may vary in its acoustic details across different phonetic contexts (the /d/ in {{IPA|/du/}} does not technically sound the same as the one in {{IPA|/di/}}, for example), but all {{IPA|/d/}}'s as perceived by a listener fall within one category (voiced alveolar plosive) and that is because "linguistic representations are abstract, canonical, phonetic segments or the gestures that underlie these segments."&lt;ref name="np"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors = Nygaard LC,Pisoni DB |year=1995 |title=Speech Perception: New Directions in Research and Theory |editor1=J.L.

===Speech imitation===
If people can hear the gestures in speech, then the imitation of speech should be very fast, as in when words are repeated that are heard in [[headphone]]s as in [[speech shadowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Perception-action meshing===

==Criticisms==

The motor theory of speech perception is not widely held in the field of speech perception, though it is more popular in other fields, such as [[theoretical linguistics]]. As three of its advocates have noted, "it has few proponents within the field of speech perception, and many authors cite it primarily to offer critical commentary".&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;361&lt;/sup&gt;  Several critiques of it exist.&lt;ref name="Massaro02"&gt;{{cite book
|last1=Massaro 
|first1=D. W. 
|year=1997
|title= Perceiving talking faces: From speech perception to a behavioral principle |location=Cambridge, MA
|publisher=MIT Press
|isbn = 978-0-262-13337-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14348425|year = 1965|author1 = Lane|first1 = H|title = The Motor Theory of Speech Perception: A Critical Review|journal = Psychological Review|volume = 72|issue = 4|pages = 275–309|doi=10.1037/h0021986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple sources===

Speech perception is affected by nonproduction sources of information, such as context. Individual words are hard to understand in isolation but easy when heard in sentence context. It therefore seems that speech perception uses multiple sources that are integrated together in an optimal way.&lt;ref name="Massaro02"/&gt;

===Production===

The motor theory of speech perception would predict that speech motor abilities in infants predict their speech perception abilities, but in actuality it is the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15260865|year = 2004|author1 = Tsao|first1 = F. M.|title = Speech perception in infancy predicts language development in the second year of life: A longitudinal study|journal = Child Development|volume = 75|issue = 4|pages = 1067–84|last2 = Liu|first2 = H. M.|last3 = Kuhl|first3 = P. K.|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00726.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also predict that defects in speech production would impair speech perception, but they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=6081929|year = 1967|author1 = MacNeilage|first1 = P. F.|title = Speech production and perception in a patient with severe impairment of somesthetic perception and motor control|journal = Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|volume = 10|issue = 3|pages = 449–67|last2 = Rootes|first2 = T. P.|last3 = Chase|first3 = R. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this only affects the first and already superseded behaviorist version of the theory, where infants were supposed to learn ''all'' production-perception patterns by imitation early in childhood. This is no longer the mainstream view of motor-speech theorists.

===Speech module===
Several sources of evidence for a specialized speech module have failed to be supported. 
* [[Duplex perception]] can be observed with door slams.&lt;ref name="Duplex"/&gt;
* The [[McGurk effect]] can also be achieved with nonlinguistic stimuli, such as showing someone a video of a basketball bouncing but playing the sound of a ping-pong ball bouncing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
* As for [[categorical perception]], listeners can be sensitive to acoustic differences within single phonetic categories.
As a result, this part of the theory has been dropped by some researchers.&lt;ref name="Galantucci"/&gt;

===Sublexical tasks===
The evidence provided for the motor theory of speech perception is limited to tasks such as syllable discrimination that use speech units not full spoken words or spoken sentences. As a result, "speech perception is sometimes interpreted as referring to the perception of speech at the sublexical level. However, the ultimate goal of these studies is presumably to understand the neural processes supporting the ability to process speech sounds under ecologically valid conditions, that is, situations in which successful speech sound processing ultimately leads to contact with the mental lexicon and auditory comprehension."&lt;ref name="Hickok07"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Hickok | first1 = G.

| issue = 5 
| pages = 393–402 
| year = 2007 
| pmid = 17431404 
| pmc = 
}} See page 394&lt;/ref&gt; This however creates the problem of " a tenuous connection to their implicit target of investigation, speech recognition".&lt;ref name="Hickok07"/&gt;

===Imitation===

The motor theory of speech perception faces the problem that the research linking speech perception to speech production is also consistent with the brain processing speech to imitate spoken [[Lexical item|word]]s. The brain must have a means to do this if language is to exist, since a child's [[vocabulary]] expansion requires a means to learn novel spoken words, as does an adult's picking up of new names.&lt;ref name="Skoyles"/&gt; Imitation has to be initiated for all vocalizations since a word's novelty cannot be known until after it is heard, and so after when the information needed to identify its articulation gestures and [[motor goal]]s has gone. As result vocal imitation needs to be initiated by default into [[short term memory]] for every heard spoken vocalizations.&lt;ref name="Skoyles"/&gt; If speech perception uses multiple sources of information, this default imitation processing  would  provide as a secondary use an extra source for word perception. Since imitation will be most needed for vocalizations that are not proper words, this could explain why sublexical tasks that do not use proper words so strongly link to processing of motor gestures.&lt;ref name="Skoyles"/&gt;

==Birds==

It has been suggested that [[bird]]s also hear each other's [[bird song]] in terms of vocal gestures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Mtaileb II''' is located {{convert|900|m|ft}} west northwest of Mtaileb on the north facing, wooded, [[sandstone]] slopes, in a junction of two ravines beneath the main [[Bikfaya]] road. A small Neolithic assemblage of tools was collected in beige and grey flint with small [[axe]]s and picks. One slightly polished trapezoidal axe was found. The material is stored in the [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]] marked "1500 m S.W. Mazraat-ech-Chaar".&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6610">"Education Nation" is [[NBC News]]' initiative to engage citizens in a solutions-focused conversation about the state of [[education in the United States]]. The initiative was launched in the fall of 2010 and continues to be a key feature of the news division through local events and on-air programming across the network's shows and platforms throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weprin|first=Alex|title=NBC News slates 'Education Nation' Programming Across Networks, Bill Clinton to close out event|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nbc-news-slates-education-nation-programming-across-networks-bill-clinton-to-close-out-event_b88820|publisher=TVNewser|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education Nation 2013==

Fall 2013 saw Education Nation reach its fourth year. This year continued NBC News' sustained focus on highlighting education news and content across platforms. The initiative culminated in the Education Nation summit, which was held October 6 through 8 at the [[New York Public Library]]. The 2013 summit theme, "What It Takes," examined the state of education in the United States, with a specific focus on preparing students for future education and employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Nation 2013: Summit|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/education-nation/education-nation-2013-summit-n15296 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education Nation summit consisted of a series of workshops, panels, and town hall meetings exploring such themes as the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], personalized learning, and keeping up with global competition. Notable speakers and presenters included Governor [[Steve Beshear]] of Kentucky, Governor [[Mike Pence]] of Indiana, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] of Massachusetts, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil [[Rex Tillerson]],  Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education [[Dennis Walcott]], and New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]. This year's summit also featured an Innovation Challenge for education technology startups, sponsored by the [[Robin Hood Foundation]], which was won by San Francisco-based [[CodeHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC NEWS AND ROBIN HOOD LAUNCH THE THIRD-ANNUAL"INNOVATION CHALLENGE" AT "EDUCATION NATION"|url=https://www.nbcumv.com/nbc-news-and-robin-hood-launch-third-annual%E2%80%9Cinnovation-challenge%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%9Ceducation-nation%E2%80%9D |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CodeHS Wins Innovation Challenge at Education Nation|url=http://gettingsmart.com/2013/10/codehs-wins-innovation-challenge-education-nation/|publisher=Getting Smart|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education Nation 2012==

Heading into its third year, the “Education Nation” initiative will employ all platforms of NBC News— including MSNBC, programs like “NBC Nightly News,” “Today,” “Rock Center,” and “Meet the Press,” digital properties such as [http://www.msnbc.com msnbc.com] and [http://www.EducationNation.com EducationNation.com], and live events across the country—in a continued effort to shine a spotlight on the challenges, potential solutions and innovations spanning today's education landscape. In 2012, “Education Nation” will deepen public engagement in a solutions-focused discussion on improving student achievement and preparedness for the workforce— giving special attention to innovation and technology.

The centerpiece of “Education Nation” 2012 will be the national summit in New York City from Sept. 23-25. The event will be held in a new venue to be announced later in 2012. In addition to the summit, the network is also continuing “Education Nation On-The-Road” in the spring of 2012. Making stops in Denver, Atlanta and Miami in April and May, the NBC News team hosting a series of panels and events involving NBC News anchors and correspondents, local leaders, officials, educators, parents, and students.

==Education Nation 2011==

In 2011, “Education Nation” launched its first on-the-road tour, hosting a series of panels and events focused on local education issues in Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

In September, NBC News hosted its second-annual “Education Nation” Summit on [[Rockefeller Plaza]] from Sunday, Sept. 25 through Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2011. In addition to the events, NBC News also constructed the "Education Nation Experience"—a state-of-the-art public exhibit where visitors could engage with videos and interactive tools to explore the skills, knowledge and training required to succeed in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Nation Experience|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/things-to-do/this-week-in-new-york/1978713/education-nation-experience|publisher=Time Out NY|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunday's events included a national Teacher Town Hall with hundreds of teachers from across the country and thousands more online at [http://www.EducationNation.com EducationNation.com],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dwyer|first=Liz|title=Teachers to take center stage at NBC's upcoming Education Nation Summit|url=http://www.good.is/post/teachers-to-take-center-stage-at-nbc-s-upcoming-education-nation-summit|publisher=GOOD Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world premiere of ''[[American Teacher]]''—a [[documentary film]] narrated by [[Matt Damon]].

'''Navizon, Inc.''' is a provider of [[location-based service]]s and products. Navizon was an early developer of technology that makes it possible to determine the geographic position of a mobile device using as reference the location of [[cell phone tower]]s and [[Wi-Fi positioning system|Wi-Fi-based]] wireless [[Wireless access point|access points]] instead of [[GPS]]. Navizon also developed technology for locating mobile devices indoors with room and floor-level accuracy.

Navizon, initially known as Mexens Technology,  was founded by a team from the Internet Protocol geolocation market. Its founder and CEO, [[Cyril Houri]], was founder and CEO of Infosplit, a provider of IP address geolocation services started in 1999 that was acquired in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Navizon".

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}

[[Ayn Rand]]'s philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] has been and continues to be a major influence on the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement, particularly in the United States. Many libertarians justify their political views using aspects of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''For the New Intellectual'' (1961) Random House; see also, Peikoff, Leonard, ''Objectivisim: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand'' (1991) Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the views of Rand and her philosophy among prominent libertarians are mixed and many Objectivists are hostile to libertarians in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Peter |title=On Moral Sanctions |journal=The Intellectual Activist |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=May 18, 1989 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_sanctions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical disagreements ==

===Aggression===
Some libertarians, including [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Walter Block]], hold the view that the [[non-aggression principle]] is an irreducible concept: it is not the logical result of any given ethical philosophy but, rather, is self-evident as any other axiom is.  Rand, too, argued that liberty was a precondition of virtuous conduct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=From My 'Future File' |journal=The Ayn Rand Letter |volume=3 |issue=26 |date=September 23, 1974 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that her non-aggression principle itself derived from a complex set of previous knowledge and values.  For this reason, Objectivists refer to the non-aggression principle as such, while libertarians who agree with Rothbard's argument call it "the non-aggression [[axiom]]."

Rothbard and other [[anarcho-capitalists]] hold that government requires non-voluntary taxation to function and that in all known historical cases, the state was established by force rather than [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/easaran/chap3.asp |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Anatomy of the State: What the State Is Not |work=Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus consider the establishment and maintenance of the [[night-watchman state]] supported by Objectivists to be in violation of the non-aggression principle. On the other hand, Rand believed that government can in principle be funded through voluntary means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/taxation.html|title=Taxation|author=|date=|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary financing notwithstanding, libertarians consider that a government would by definition still violate individual rights (commit aggression) by enforcing a monopoly over a given territory[https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/roy-a-childs-jr/objectivism-and-the-state-an-open-letter-to-ayn-rand/]. Objectivists do not specify what would be the legitimate expanse of the state's territory, nor what would be the proper way of reaching political decisions without violating the rights of disagreeing minorities[http://en.liberpedia.org/Proper_government].

===Objectivism's rejection of the "primitive"===
Jennifer Burns in her biography ''[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', notes how Rand's position that "Native Americans were savages", and that as a result "European colonists had a right to seize their land because native tribes did not recognize individual rights", was one of the views that "particularly outraged libertarians."&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns also notes how Rand's position that "Palestinians had no rights and that it was moral to support Israel, the sole outpost of civilization in a region ruled by barbarism", was also a controversial position amongst libertarians, who at the time were a large portion of Rand's fan base.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Libertarians and Objectivists often disagree about matters of foreign policy. Rand's rejection of what she deemed to be "primitivism" extended to the [[Middle East peace process]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RandArabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aynrand.org/404|title=404|author=|date=|website=aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Arab-Israeli War of 1973]], Rand denounced [[Arabs]] as "primitive" and "one of the least developed cultures" who "are typically nomads."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt; Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being "the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent", while decreeing that "when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt;

The United States [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]'s first candidate for [[President of the United States]], [[John Hospers]], credited Rand as a major force in shaping his own political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John, ''Libertarianism'', Nash, 1971; "Conversations with Ayn Rand," ''Liberty'', July 1990, pp. 23–36, and Sept. 1990, pp. 42–52; and, "Memories of Ayn Rand," ''Full Context'', May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Boaz]], executive vice president of the [[Cato Institute]], an American libertarian [[think tank]], described Rand's work as "squarely within the libertarian tradition" and that some libertarians are put off by "the starkness of her presentation and by her cult following."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boaz |first=David |title=Ayn Rand at 100 |date=February 2, 2005 |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3661 |accessdate=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] described Rand as "an utterly intolerant and dogmatic person who did a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best of Both Worlds |last=Doherty |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |journal=Reason |date=June 1995 |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Rand biographer quoted [[Murray Rothbard]] as saying that he was "in agreement basically with all [Rand's] philosophy," and saying that it was Rand who had "convinced him of the theory of [[natural rights]]..."&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Barbara, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', Doubleday, 1984, p. 413; according to his biographer, [[Justin Raimondo]], Rothbard wrote a letter to Rand declaring, "''Atlas Shrugged'' is the greatest novel ever written," Raimondo, Justin, ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard'', Prometheus Books, 2000, p. 118, cf. Rothbard, Murray, "Letters: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand," ''The National Review'', January 18, 1958, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothbard would later become a particularly harsh critic of Rand, writing in ''The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult'' that:

{{quote|The major lesson of the history of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[objectivist]&lt;/nowiki&gt; movement to libertarians is that It Can Happen Here, that libertarians, despite explicit devotion to reason and individuality, are not exempt from the mystical and totalitarian cultism that pervades other ideological as well as religious movements. Hopefully, libertarians, once bitten by the virus, may now prove immune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult |year=1972 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html |accessdate=2009-08-04}} Rothbard's essay was later revised and printed as a pamphlet by ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine in 1987, and by the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some Objectivists have argued that Objectivism is not limited to Rand's own positions on philosophical issues and are willing to work with and identify with the libertarian movement. This stance is most clearly identified with [[David Kelley]] (who separated from the Ayn Rand Institute because of disagreements over the relationship between Objectivists and libertarians), [[Chris Sciabarra]], [[Barbara Branden]] (Nathaniel Branden's former wife), and others. Kelley's [[The Atlas Society|Atlas Society]] has focused on building a closer relationship between "open Objectivists" and the libertarian movement[https://www.sflacademy.org/introduction-to-objectivism/].

== Rand's view of libertarians ==

Rand condemned libertarianism as being a greater threat to freedom and capitalism than both modern liberalism and conservatism.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_libertarians|title=FAQ|author=|date=|website=www.aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regarded Objectivism as an integrated philosophical system. Libertarianism, in contrast, is a political philosophy which confines its attention to matters of public policy. For example, Objectivism argues positions in [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]], whereas libertarianism does not address such questions. Rand believed that political advocacy could not succeed without addressing what she saw as its methodological prerequisites. Rand rejected any affiliation with the libertarian movement and many other Objectivists have done so as well.&lt;ref name="Schwartz, Peter 1988 pp. 311–333"&gt;Schwartz, Peter, "Libertarianism: the Perversion of Liberty," in ''[[The Voice of Reason (book)|The Voice of Reason]]'', L. Peikoff, editor (1988) New American Library, pp. 311–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand said of libertarians that:
{{quote|They're not defenders of capitalism. They're a group of publicity seekers.... Most of them are my enemies... I've read nothing by Libertarians (when I read them, in the early years) that wasn't my ideas badly mishandled—i.e., the teeth pulled out of them—with no credit given."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;}}

In a 1981 interview, Rand described libertarians as "a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people" who "plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

Responding to a question about the Libertarian Party in 1976, Rand said:
{{quote|The trouble with the world today is philosophical: only the right philosophy can save us. But this party plagiarizes some of my ideas, mixes them with the exact opposite—with religionists, anarchists and every intellectual misfit and scum they can find—and call themselves libertarians and run for office."&lt;ref name="answers73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ayn Rand Answers, the Best of Her Q&amp;A |isbn=0-451-21665-2 |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ayn Rand Institute board member [[John A.

On June 25, 2012, the [[Cato Institute]] announced that [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] would become its next president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pressroom.php?display=news&amp;id=209 |title=Cato Institute and Shareholders Reach Agreement in Principle |date=June 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cato's public announcement, Allison was described as a "revered libertarian." In communication to Cato employees, he wrote, "I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Slate |title=Cato Shrugged: Panic About An Incoming Leader's Admiration for Ayn Rand |first=David |last=Weigel |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/08/30/cato_shrugged_panic_about_an_incoming_leader_s_admiration_for_ayn_rand.html |date=August 12, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}} Allison leaves "objectivists" uncapitalized.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2012, Brook explained the changes to ''[[The American Conservative]]'':

{{quote|I don’t think there’s been a significant change in terms of our attitude towards libertarians. Two things have happened. We’ve grown, and we’ve gotten to a size where we don’t just do educational programs, we do a lot more outreach and a lot more policy and working with other organizations. I also believe the libertarian movement has changed. It’s become less influenced by Rothbard, less influenced by the anarchist, crazy for lack of a better word, wing of libertarianism. As a consequence, because we’re bigger and doing more things and because libertarianism has become more reasonable, we are doing more work with them than we have in the past. But I don’t think ideologically anything of substance has changed at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/yaron-brook-on-the-ayn-rand-institutes-newfound-ecumenism/ |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |title=Yaron Brook on the Ayn Rand Institute’s Newfound Ecumenism |first=Jordan |last=Bloom |publisher=The American Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Old Russian Law''' or '''Russian Law''' is a legal system in [[Kievan Rus']] (since the 9th century), in later [[Rus' (region)|Old Rus' states]] (knyazhestva, or [[Principality|princedoms]] in the period of [[feudal fragmentation]]), in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and in Moscow Rus' (see: [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and [[Tsardom of Russia]]).

==History==

===Ryad===

According to Old Russian chronicles, in 862, [[East Slavs|Slavs]] and [[Baltic Finns|Finns]] invited Varangians under the leadership of prince [[Rurik]] to rule in their land:

{{quote|They said to themselves, "Let us seek a prince ''who may rule over us and judge us according to the Law''." They accordingly went overseas to the [[Rus' people|Varangian Russes]]: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans, English, and Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The [[Chud]]s, the Slavs, the [[Krivichs|Krivichians]], and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', "Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. ''Come to rule and reign over us''."|''The Laurentian Text of [[Primary Chronicle]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF|author=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor1=Samuel Hazzard Cross|editor2=Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor|title=The Russian Primary chronicle: Laurentian text|url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/dokumente/a/a011458.pdf|year=1953|publisher=[[Medieval Academy of America]]|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Russian state settled on the oral treaty, or "'''ryad'''" (Old Russian: рядъ) between the prince ([[knyaz]]) with his armed force ([[druzhina]]) on the one hand, and tribal "nobility" and formally all people on the other hand. The prince and his druzhina defended people, decide lawsuits, provided trade and built towns. And people paid [[tribute]] and took part in [[irregular military]]. During the ensuing centuries the ''ryad'' was playing an important role in Old Russian princedoms: the prince and his administration (druzhina) found their relationship with people ("all land", "all townsmen" in Old Russian chronicles) on the treaty. A breach of the treaty could result in exile of the prince ([[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav Yaroslavich]] and [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod Yaroslavich]]) or even in murder of the prince ([[Igor of Kiev|Igor Rurikovich]] and [[Igor II of Kiev|Igor Olgovich]]).&lt;ref&gt;Melnikova, Elena.

One of the result of [[Rus'–Byzantine War (disambiguation)|Rus'–Byzantine War]]s was conclusion of [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Treaties with Byzantine]] in the 10th century, where, apart from Byzantine legal rules, also Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') - rules of Old Russian oral [[Custom (law)|customary law]] reflected.

[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s Pravda of the beginning of the 11th century was the first written law in Rus'. This short [[Code (law)|code]] regulated the relationship between the princely druzhina ("rusins") and the people ("slovenins") concerning [[criminal law]]. After Yaroslav's death, his sons [[Iziaslav I of Kiev|Izyaslav]], [[Vsevolod I of Kiev|Vsevolod]], [[Sviatoslav II of Kiev|Svyatoslav]] and their druzhina got together and promulgated a code concerning the violation of property rights in princely lands (Pravda of Yaroslav's sons) in the middle of the 11th century. Yaroslav's Pravda and Pravda of Yaroslav's sons became a basis for the Short edition of Russkaya Pravda.

In the period of [[Vladimir II Monomakh|Vladimir Monomakh]]'s reign at the beginning of the 12th century, the Vast edition of Russkaya Pravda was given, which contained rules of criminal, [[Procedural law|procedural]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] law, including trade, [[Family law|family]] law and rules of the bond of obligation.

Later written secular law also included statutory charters, trade treaties, statutes of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], big codes of Moscow Rus' - Sudebniks (see below), and other texts.

===[[Byzantine law]] and church law===
Translations of Byzantine legal codes, including [[Nomocanon]], were widely spread in Old Rus' (see: [[Kormchaia]], [[Merilo Pravednoye]]),&lt;ref&gt;Schapov, Yaroslav. ''Byzantine and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] Legal Heritage in Rus' at 11-13th centuries'' / ed. by Lev Cherepnin. - Moscow: [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]], 1978. – 290 p. ({{lang-ru|Щапов Я.Н. Византийское и южнославянское правовое наследие на Руси в XI–XIII вв. / отв. ред. Л.В. Черепнин. – М.: Наука, 1978. – 290 с.}}).&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't widely applied in secular or church legal practice, restricted mainly in [[canon law]]. The Church in Old Rus' did not have wide influence and depended on the power of the state. Thus, church law mainly dealt with family law and sanctions against moral violation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Viktor Zhivov|Zhivov, Viktor]]. ''The History of Russian Law as a Linguistic and [[Semiotics|Semiotic]] Problem'' // Zhivov, Viktor. Investigations in the Field of History and Prehistory of Russian Culture. - Moscow: Yazyki Slavyanskoy Kultury ("Languages of Slavic culture"), 2002. – P. 187–305. ({{lang-ru|Живов В.М.

'''Punk visual art''' is artwork associated with the [[punk subculture]]. It often graces [[punk rock]] [[album cover]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] for punk concerts, [[punk zine]]s and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' album designed by [[Jamie Reid]]. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

Los Angeles artist [[Mark Vallen]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-for-a-change.com/Punk/punka.htm "A visual survey of early Punk Rock Album Covers," Essay by artist, Mark Vallen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at [[CBGB]] and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC.  Among those featured were [[John Holmstrom]] and [[Legs McNeil]] of the fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'',; [[Alan Vega]] (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]];  photographers [[Marcia Resnick]] and [[Jimmy De Sana]]; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists [[Tom Otterness]] and [[Beth and Scott B]], who were associated with ''X Magazine''.

Also in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Diego Cortez]].  Other early punk art exhibits included the "Times Square Show" (1980) and "New York New Wave" at PS 1 (1981).  Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of [[ABC No Rio]] Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32342">'''SF Masterworks''' is a series of [[science fiction]] books started by Millennium and currently published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] (both being imprints of the UK based [[Orion Publishing Group]]).

It began in 1999 and comprises selected pieces of science-fiction literature from 1950 onwards (with a few exceptions). The list was compiled by the managing director of [[Orion Books]], [[Malcolm Edwards]], with the help of "leading SF writers and editors" and the goal of bringing important books back into print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/03Edwards.html Locus Online: Malcolm Edwards interview excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt; The list was described by science fiction author [[Iain M. Banks]] as "amazing" and "genuinely the best novels from sixty years of SF".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621053514/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/promotions/gollancz-sf-masterworks |archivedate=2013-06-21 |df= }} Orion Books Masterworks Website &lt;/ref&gt;

It has a companion series in the [[Fantasy Masterworks]] line. A separate ''Future Classics''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ Gollancz editor Simon Spanton on the Future Classics promotion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914123601/http://www.uksfbooknews.net/2007/09/06/gollancz-editor-simon-spanton-on-the-future-classics-promotion/ |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; line has also started featuring eight science fiction novels from the last few decades.

Gollancz officially relaunched the series in March 2010 beginning with reissues of the first ten titles. These titles have new cover designs (no longer featuring numbers) and introductions, and other existing titles are planned to be reprinted. Gollancz also added new titles to the series beginning in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Gollancz Science Fiction and Fantasy New Books Catalogue: Jan-July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Also published in the 1999-2009 ''SF Masterworks'' numbered paperback series.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Also published in the current (since 2010) ''SF Masterworks'' new design series.

==New design==

[[File:SF_Masterworks_table_display_at_London_bookshop,_May_2017.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of titles from the series on display at a London bookshop.]]

The new designs sport yellow/white spines, with the SF Masterworks logo written vertically down the left hand side of the cover.  For titles that were previously issued in the original series, generally the cover artwork is tinted in a different colour from the original version; for example, [[The Dispossessed]] cover artwork is primarily red in the original release, but was partly tinted green when republished in the new series.

'''Sikachi-Alyan''' is a small [[Nani people|Nanai]] village on the bank of the [[Amur River|Amur]] river located 75&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Khabarovsk]]. The place is famous for its neolithic [[Petroglyphs of Sikachi-Alyan|petroglyph]]s (masks) carved on the surface of basalt stones. The drawings date back to the 13th century BC. The local findings demonstrate the ancient history of this area. There is a museum and an open-air reconstruction of an ancient village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.khabkrai.ru/invest2.nsf/pages/petroglyphs_ru.htm Server of Khabarovsk Krai government (ru)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320171157/http://gov.khabkrai.ru/invest2.nsf/pages/petroglyphs_ru.htm |date=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expert needed|Linguistics|talk=History_of_spewllng|reason=This article lacks  a scholarly explanation of the phenomenon and its history on a global scale, spanning many cultures, languages, and writing systems, both past and present|date=November 2013}}
{{Reading}}
'''Spelling''' is the combination of [[alphabet|alphabetic]] [[Grapheme|letters]] to form a written word. It is a [[linguistic]] process of [[Phonemic orthography|correct writing]] with the necessary [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] and [[diacritic]]s present in a [[reading comprehension|comprehensible]], usually [[standardization|standardized]] order. While a part of a language's [[orthography]], not all languages have purely phonemic alphabets. Standardized spelling is a [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] element.

Spellings originated as [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s of the sounds of [[speech|spoken]] language according to the [[alphabetic principle]]. They remain largely reflective of the sounds, although [[phonemic orthography|fully phonemic spelling]] is an ideal that most languages' orthographies only approximate, some more closely than others. This is true for various reasons, including that pronunciation changes over time in all languages, yet spellings as visual norms may resist change. In addition, words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system, and different meanings of a word or [[homophone]]s may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually.

==Spelling standards and conventions==
Uniformity in the spelling of words is one of the features of a [[standard language]] in modern times, and [[official language]]s usually have standard spellings. However, this is a relatively recent development linked to the compiling of dictionaries, the founding of national academies and other institutions of language maintenance, including widespread [[education]] and [[literacy]], and often doesn't apply to [[minority language|minority]] and [[regional language]]s.

In countries where there is an official [[language academy]]; such as France, the Netherlands, and Germany, reforms are regularly made so that spelling better matches the changing pronunciation.

Examples include:
* [[German orthography reform of 1996]]
* [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|Portuguese spelling reform]]
* [[Reforms of French orthography#Rectifications of 1990|French ''rectifications orthographiques'']] of 1990.

[[English-language spelling reform]] proposals have been regularly made since the 16th century, but have made little impact apart from a few spellings preferred by [[Noah Webster]] having contributed to [[American and British English spelling differences]].

In October 2018 the Welcome Collection used the spelling of women as womxn in a tweet, explaining "we feel that it is important to create a space/venue that includes diverse perspectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45810709|title=Should women be spelt womxn?|last=Regan|first=Alex|date=2018-10-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Learning===
Learning proper spelling by rote is a traditional element of elementary education and divergence from standard spelling is often perceived as an indicator of low intelligence, [[illiteracy]], or [[Social class|lower class]] standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcentury.com/1992.html 1992: Gaffe with an 'e' at the end, by Paul Mickle / The Trentonian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spelling test]]s are commonly used to assess a student's mastery over the words in the spelling lessons the student has received so far. They can also be an effective practice method. [[Spelling bee]]s are competitions to determine the best speller of a group.  Prominent spelling bees are even televised, such as the [[National Spelling Bee]] in the United States.

===Alteration===
{{Main|Sensational spelling}}
Divergent spelling is a popular advertising technique, used to attract attention or to render a [[trademark]] "suggestive" rather than "merely descriptive." The pastry chains [[Dunkin' Donuts]] (Dunkin' Donuts changes its name to Dunkin' from January 2019)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5406137/dunkin-donuts-name-change/|title=It's Just Dunkin' Now. Chain Officially Drops 'Donuts' From Its Name|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Krispy Kreme]], for example, employ non-standard spellings.

===Misspellings===
{{Main|Commonly misspelled words}}
&lt;!-- Funny as pictures of misspellings are, we really don't need that many examples.  One is plenty – if you have an absolutely fantastic picture, consider replacing the current picture rather than adding it.--&gt;
[[Image:misspelling.purchase.arp.500pix.jpg|thumb|right|A misspelling of ''purchased'' on a service station sign.]]

While some words admit multiple spellings, some are not considered standard, and thus are misspellings.  A misspelled word can be a series of letters that represents no correctly spelled word of the same language at all (such as "liek" for "like") or a correct spelling of another word (such as writing "here" when one means "hear", or "no" when one means "know"). Misspellings of the latter type can easily make their way into printed material because they are not caught by simple computerized [[spell checker]]s.

Misspellings may be due to either [[typo|typing error]]s (e.g. the transposition error ''[[teh]]'' for ''the''), or lack of knowledge of the correct spelling. Whether or not a word is misspelled may depend on context, as is the case with American / British English distinctions.  Misspelling can also be a matter of opinion when variant spellings are accepted by some and not by others. For example, "miniscule" (for "minuscule") is a misspelling to many,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/miniscule "miniscule"], ''Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary''; states that this spelling is "widely regarded as an error"&lt;/ref&gt; and yet it is listed as an acceptable variant in some dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/M0316900.html "miniscule"], ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=minuscule*1+0&amp;dict=a "miniscule"], ''Cambridge Dictionary of American English''&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known Internet scam involves the registration of [[domain names]] that are deliberate misspellings of well-known corporate names in order to mislead or defraud. The practice is commonly known as "[[typosquatting]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivkinradler.com/rivkinradler/Publications/newformat/200409Lewis.shtml "Typosquatters Act May Apply to Misspelling Domain Names to Mislead Surfers"], Shari Claire Lewis, ''New York Law Journal'', September 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable English misspellings in history===
&lt;!--
NOTE TO EDITORS
Please do not include "wrong" transliterations from other languages here!  For example somebody included "Hercules" as a misspelling for the Greek hero known as "Heracles" in the Greek language.  Hercules is the Latin version, that's all.  Same with names that are radically different from language to language – Confucius / Kong Fuzi are two different ways of romanizing the same name, and while Kong Fuzi certainly sounds closer to the original, it's not that Confucius is anymore "wrong" than calling Deutschland "Germany" in English.
--&gt;
* [[Cleveland, Ohio]] &amp;ndash; the leader of the crew that surveyed the town's territory was General [[Moses Cleaveland]], and the region was named in his honor; reportedly the town's first newspaper, the ''Cleveland Advertiser'', could not fit the town's name in its masthead without removing the first "a" from the name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OxuzT2E6Hm8C&amp;pg=PA138 ''Ohio'', p. 138], Victoria Sherrow, Marshall Cavendish, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Google]] &amp;ndash; accidental misspelling of [[googol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/5157798/QI-Quite-Interesting-facts-about-100.html QI: Quite Interesting facts about 100], ''telegraph.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Google's vice president, as quoted on a [[BBC]] ''[[The Money Programme]]'' documentary, January 2006, the founders &amp;ndash; noted for their poor spelling &amp;ndash; registered Google as a trademark and web address before someone pointed out that it was incorrect.
* [[Ovaltine]], a popular bedtime drink in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Australia]], came about because someone misspelled the original name ''Ovomaltine'' on the trademark documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mullardantiques.co.uk/what-do-radios-and-ovaltine-have-in-common-the-ovaltiney-radio|title=What Do Radios and Ovaltine have in common?

* Referer &amp;ndash; common misspelling of the word referrer. It is so common, in fact, that it made it into the official specification of HTTP – the communication protocol of the World Wide Web – and has, therefore, become the standard industry spelling when discussing [[HTTP referer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/referer referer – Definitions from Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=July 2018}}
*[[Sequim, Washington]] &amp;ndash; "In 1879 the first post office was built and named 'Seguin' for the surrounding area. [...] In 1907, due to a Postal Official's error in reading an official report, the post office was titled 'Seguim' for approximately a month. With the next report, the Official read the letter 'g' as a 'q' and the post office here became known as 'Sequim.' The name change apparently did not worry the residents enough to protest. It has been known as Sequim ever since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, J. |year=2005 |title= Sequim History'' |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |publisher= City of Sequim, Washington |url=http://www.ci.sequim.wa.us/planning/ParksPlan/AppendexC.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to some,&lt;!-- some opinions say this is an incorrect rumor --&gt; the name of [[Quartzsite, Arizona|Quartzsite]], a mining town in Arizona, was spelled incorrectly. It should be Quartzite, after the mineral [[quartzite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.quartzsite.az.us/wp-content/uploads/general-plan/QGP%20Housing%20Element%20Table%20of%20Contents.pdf Town of Quartzsite 2003 General Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zenith]] &amp;ndash; Arabic ''zamt'' was misread; in Latin letters, at the time, the letter ''i'' was never dotted, so "m" looked like "ni".&lt;ref&gt;Norbury, J. K. W. Word Formation in the Noun and Adjective.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arab, Alabama]] &amp;ndash; This town in north Alabama was named Arad, after its founder, Arad Thompson, but the name was misspelled on a US Post Office map as "Arab", and the misspelled name stuck.

'''''The Myth of God Incarnate''''' is a book edited by [[John Hick]] and published by [[SCM Press]] in 1977. [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], in a 1980 [[literature review]] of academic work on the [[incarnation]], noted the "...well-publicized symposium entitled ''The Myth of God Incarnate'', including contributions on the [[New Testament|NT]] from M. Goulder and F. Young, which provoked several responses."&lt;ref&gt;Dunn (1980): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in another literature review, [[R. T. France]] commented that "theology dropped out of the headlines again, until in 1977 the title, if not the contents, of ''The Myth of God Incarnate'' revived public interest".&lt;ref&gt;France (1981): 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' 2005 obituary for contributor [[Maurice Wiles]] (father of [[Andrew Wiles]]) described the book as "a highly controversial volume of essays."&lt;ref&gt;
"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1491502/The-Rev-Professor-Maurice-Wiles.html The Rev Professor Maurice Wiles]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
The controversy prompted a sequel, ''Incarnation and Myth: the Debate Continued'' (1979), edited by [[Michael Goulder]], another contributor to the original volume.

In the preface to the book, the contributors start by describing their "clear" perception that Christianity has always been a changing and diverse "movement"&lt;ref name=Hick-ix&gt;Hick (1977): ix.&lt;/ref&gt; quoting [[T. S. Eliot]]—"Christianity is always adapting itself into something which can be believed." They also explain that they are "convinced" that growing knowledge of Christian origins leads to accepting that Jesus was ... 'a man approved by God' for a special role within the divine purpose," but that later Christian conceptions of him "as God incarnate, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity" were a "mythological or poetic way of expressing his significance for us."&lt;ref name=Hick-ix/&gt; The contributors also mention that: "we have met together for discussion five times during the last three years, and we now offer the results in the hope that they will stimulate a wider discussion both inside and outside the churches."&lt;ref name="Hick-xi"/&gt;

== Overview ==

The contributors to Hick's collection of essays divided their work into two sections: the first examining "Christian sources"; and the second examining "the development of doctrine."&lt;ref name=Hick-xi&gt;Hick (1977): xi.&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface, however, they note that this division is not absolute, since sources and contemporary issues are related, and discussion of either references the other.&lt;ref name=Hick-xi/&gt;

== Christianity without Incarnation? ==

Maurice Wiles' 10-page introductory chapter to the volume questions whether "the incarnation of God in the particular individual Jesus of Nazareth" is actually essential to Christianity,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1&gt;Wiles (1977): 1.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether there can be "a Christianity without (in this sense) incarnation?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt; He structures his essay in three numbered parts, each of which is a subquestion. Wiles' subquestions explore whether his main question "is (1) a proper, (2) a necessary and (3) a constructive question to ask."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt;

=== A proper question? ===

Regarding his first subquestion, Wiles addresses the "many ears" he expects might find ''Christianity'' and ''incarnation'' "so nearly synonymous that the suggestion of a possible 'Christianity without incarnation' will sound to them equally paradoxical and unintelligible."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-1/&gt; He explains that ''incarnation'', in the sense in which he is using the term, is just one "interpretation of the significance of Jesus."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2&gt;Wiles (1977): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles provides three analogies from other Christian thinking to illustrate his meaning: the [[eucharist]], the relationship between the authority and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy of the Bible]], and the relationship between incarnation and the [[virgin birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; In each case, abstract doctrines have been so associated with concrete applications, that denials of the concrete applications have historically been seen as denials of the abstract doctrines, hence heresies.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; However, with the eucharist in particular, [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theologians affirmed a meaningful understanding of the eucharist, despite denying the concrete application of [[transubstantiation]]—that bread and wine physically become the body and blood of Jesus in the Roman Catholic [[mass (liturgy)|mass]].&lt;ref name=Wiles1-2/&gt; Wiles concludes that his main question (regarding Christianity without incarnation) is not a contradiction but a proper question, just like the Reformation question regarding a eucharist without transubstantiation.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3&gt;Wiles (1977): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A necessary question? ===

Wiles offers, under three subheadings, three lines of argument in support of his position that "separating 'Christianity' and 'incarnation' is not merely ... admissible ... but ... inescapable."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3/&gt; According to Wiles, the question of separation is a necessary question arising from: (a) the origins, (b) the history, and (c) contemporary affirmation of incarnational doctrine.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-3/&gt; Regarding (a) origins, Wiles contends that, "Incarnation, in its proper sense, is not something directly presented in scripture. It is a construction ..." He acknowledges that New Testament (NT) writers "talk of [Jesus] as God's pre-existent Son come down to earth."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4&gt;Wiles (1997): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wiles' views this as a [[figure of speech|manner of speech]] ("one of a number of ways in which Christians thought and spoke of Jesus.").&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; He proposes that it is no longer reasonable, to "the main body even of convinced believers",&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; to speak in such terms as the NT writers, which presume what moderns do not, namely "supernatural divine intervention ... as a natural category of thought and faith."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt;

Wiles offers an additional argument for the necessity of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, by expressing dissatisfaction with the intelligibility of (b) historical formulations of incarnational doctrine: "Are we sure that the concept of an incarnate being, one who is both fully God and fully man, is after all an intelligible concept?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-5&gt;Wiles (1997): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he concedes that "negative generalizations are notoriously dangerous claims to make,"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; he ventures that "the church has never succeeded in offering a consistent or convincing picture" of how Jesus could actually be both God and man.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; In particular he suggests a tendency to err in favour of Jesus as divine,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-4/&gt; citing the seventh century [[Monothelitism|Monothelite]] controversy and [[Eric Lionel Mascall|E. L. Mascall]] as a distinguished exemplar of the traditional view writing at the time Wiles' essay was published.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-5/&gt; Wiles concludes his grounds for the necessity of his main question by further appeal to (c) the writing of his own contemporaries. He notes that ''incarnation'', as understood in the work of [[John Austin Baker|John Baker]], for example, is so far removed from the original NT usage, that "it is not genuinely the same idea that is being expressed." Wiles quotes Baker: "Jesus did not see himself ... as a divine pre-existent being from heaven."&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Baker (1970): 242; quoted in Wiles (1997): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A constructive question? ===

To conclude his analysis of the value of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, Wiles anticipates that "some people" might "feel" that were such questioning to "lead to the abandonment of traditional incarnational doctrine, that could only be regarded as an entirely negative and destructive outcome."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-6&gt;Wiles (1997): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; To help allay such fears, Wiles offers three ideas, historically highly valued in Christian traditions and associated with the incarnation but, he argues, are "not necessarily bound to the incarnation and would not therefore be eliminated from a 'Christianity without incarnation'.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7&gt;Wiles (1997): 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The first idea, listed as (a), is "the conviction that the physical world can be the carrier of spiritual value." Wiles notes that this [[Dualistic cosmology|anti-dualist]] position within Christianity, denying strict separation between the spiritual and the physical, is shared with [[Judaism]], which clearly has no doctrine of Jesus as God incarnate.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; Wiles clarifies that he is proposing a Christianity that retains a genuine broad sense of incarnation of spirituality, especially in its doctrine of creation,&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; just without applying this too strictly to the person of Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt;

The second idea, listed as (b), is "the significance of Jesus as a model for human life."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8&gt;Wiles (1997): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wiles observes that there has been considerable diversity in what people have considered to be lives patterned on Jesus as the standard;&lt;ref name=Wiles1-7/&gt; and that even the NT does not provide a comprehensive picture of just precisely how Jesus lived his entire life. He quotes [[Robert Lightfoot (priest)|R. H. Lightfoot]], who famously declared, "the form of the earthly no less than of the heavenly Christ is for the most part hidden from us."&lt;ref name=Lightfoot&gt;Lightfoot (1935): 225; quoted in Wiles (1997): 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Even given these limitations, Wiles reflects that "on any showing to which the name of Christian could conceivably be given [Jesus'] life would remain of substantial importance to us."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; So, Wiles suggests, Jesus' significance as a role-model "is not directly affected by the way in which his relationship to God is understood."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt;

Before concluding his essay, Wiles considers what he believes to be the most important traditional incarnation-related idea, transformed but retained under his new understanding. Listed as (c), it is the view that in Jesus, "God has acted decisively for the salvation of the world."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; He anticipates the objection that his transformation would "imply that the worship of Christ, traditional throughout the whole of Christian history, was idolatrous in character."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; He acknowledges that "It is at this point that the greatest difficulties are likely to be felt. Can they be met?"&lt;ref name=Wiles1-8/&gt; Although he provides no conclusive answer, Wiles stresses that his new understanding of incarnation could still provide for Jesus to "remain a personal focus of the transforming power of God in the world."&lt;ref name=Wiles1-9&gt;Wiles (1997): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=The first stone [[henge]] to be discovered in Britain for a century would be cause enough for major celebration. But there's double bubbles as Tony Robinson and his hardy team of archaeologists celebrate their 200th dig. Jane Marchand from [[Dartmoor National Park Authority]]&lt;ref name="DNPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk|title=Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=2015-06-24|publisher=DNPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; was alerted by a walker to standing stones peering out of an East Devon [[reservoir]] at low level. This is Francis Pryor's dream site, but Mick has also been interested in Dartmoor for some time. They have [[stone circle]]s, [[stone row]]s and [[cairns]] apparently dating from 3000 to 1500 BC. There is a central mound which interests Francis, and which Phil thinks is Stone Age, thus pre-dating the other monuments.

[[File:Lake Texcoco c 1519.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Valley of Mexico]] at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], showing Tlacopan in relation to Tenochtitlan and other cities in the Valley of Mexico.]] 
'''Tlacopan''' (meaning "florid plant on flat ground"), also called '''Tacuba''', was a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[city-state]] situated on the western shore of [[Lake Texcoco]] on the site of today's neighborhood of [[Tacuba (Mexico)|Tacuba]] in [[Mexico City]]. Nearby was the city of Tiliuhcan.

==History==
Founded by [[Tlacomatzin]], Tlacopan was a [[Tepanec]] kingdom subordinate to nearby [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]].

Tlacopan sided with [[Tenochtitlan]] and [[Texcoco (Aztec site)|Texcoco]] in their conquest of Azcapotzalco, becoming a member of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] which formed the nucleus of the [[Aztec]] Empire.&lt;ref name=Miguel&gt;León-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxxviii}} The ruler of Tlacopan, [[Totoquihuaztli]], then took the title ''Tepaneca tecuhtli'', "Lord of the Tepanecs" (probably taken from the rulers of Azcapotzalco). Tlacopan was to remain a junior partner in the alliance, receiving only a fifth of the tribute gained from joint campaigns with its more powerful allies.

The Triple Alliance ended with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] by [[Hernán Cortés]] and native allies in 1521. Over the centuries, [[Mexico City]] expanded to include the former site of Tlacopan, today's neighborhood of [[Tacuba (Mexico)|Tacuba]] in the Mexico City borough of [[Miguel Hidalgo, D.F.|Miguel Hidalgo]].

[[File:Wooden toys (cropped).JPG|thumb|300px|A variety of traditional wooden [[Channapatna toys]] from India]]
A '''toy''' is an item that is used in [[Play (activity)|play]], especially one designed for such use. Playing with toys can be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and "fly it". 
Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only.

The origin of toys is [[prehistoric]]; [[dolls]] representing [[infant]]s, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults are readily found at archaeological sites. The origin of the word "toy" is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. Toys are mainly made for children.&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=toy|title=toy - Origin and meaning of toy by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-01/what-oldest-toy-world|title=FYI: What Is the Oldest Toy in the World?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing with toys is considered to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us. Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help their bodies grow strong, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, and practice skills they will need as adults. Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.

==History==
[[File:Little horse on wheels (Ancient greek child's Toy).jpg|thumb|upright|Little horse on wheels, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] children's toy. From a tomb dating 950–900 BCE, [[Kerameikos]] Archaeological Museum, Athens]]

Most children have been said to play with whatever they can find, such as sticks and rocks. 
Toys and games have been unearthed from the sites of ancient civilizations. They have been written about in some of the oldest literature. Toys excavated from the [[Indus valley civilization]] (3010–1500 BCE) include small carts, whistles shaped like birds, and toy monkeys which could slide down a string.&lt;ref name=Indialife&gt;[http://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Indialife.html MrDonn.org – Daily Life in Ancient India, including the mysterious Indus Valley Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919170202/http://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Indialife.html |date=19 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest toys are made from materials found in nature, such as rocks, sticks, and [[clay]]. Thousands of years ago, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] children played with [[doll]]s that had wigs and movable limbs which were made from stone, pottery, and wood.&lt;ref name=Maspero&gt;{{cite book|last=Maspero|first=Gaston Camille Charles|authorlink=Gaston Maspero|title=Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt|publisher=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece and [[Ancient Rome]], children played with dolls made of wax or [[terracotta]], sticks, [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]], and [[yo-yo]]s. When Greek children, especially girls, came of age it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of their childhood to the gods. On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Barry B.|title=Classical Myth; Third Edition|publisher=Prentice Hall|year =2001|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=33–34|isbn=0-13-088442-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Valerie|title=History of the Yo-Yo|publisher=Spintastics Skill Toys, Inc.|year=1996|url=http://www.spintastics.com/HistoryOfYoYo.asp|accessdate=2006-10-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060809224918/http://www.spintastics.com/HistoryOfYoYo.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known [[mechanical puzzle]] also comes from Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BC. The game consisted of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from these pieces. In Iran "puzzle-locks" were made as early as the 17th century (AD).

===Enlightenment era===
Toys became more widespread with the changing attitudes towards children engendered by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Children began to be seen as people in and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household and that they had a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]] invented the first [[jigsaw puzzle]] in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, [[Americas|America]], England and [[Wales]], Ireland and Scotland. The [[rocking horse]] (on bow rockers) was developed at the same time in England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsrockinghorses.co.uk/history.shtml|title=History of the Rocking Horse|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reif Spielzeug.jpg|thumb|upright|A boy with a [[Hoop rolling|hoop]]. Hoops have long been a popular toy across a variety of cultures.]]
Blowing bubbles from leftover washing up soap became a popular pastime, as shown in the painting ''The Soap Bubble'' (1739) by [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]. Other popular toys included [[hoop rolling|hoops]], [[toy wagon]]s, [[kite]]s, [[spinning wheel]]s and [[puppet]]s. The first [[board game]]s were produced by [[John Jefferys]] in the 1750s, including ''A Journey Through Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;FRB Whitehouse (Table Games of Georgian and Victorian Days, Priory House, Herfortshire, UK, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; The game was very similar to modern board games; players moved along a track with the throw of a [[dice]] (a [[teetotum]] was actually used) and landing on different spaces would either help or hinder the player.&lt;ref name="everydaytoys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaytoys.com/collectible-toys/history-of-toys/|title=History of Toys|accessdate=2012-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220111708/http://everydaytoys.com/collectible-toys/history-of-toys/|archivedate=20 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the emphasis was put on toys that had an educational purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model [[Noah's Ark]] with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, which led to the application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.&lt;ref name="everydaytoys" /&gt;

More complex mechanical and optics-based toys were also invented. [[Carpenter and Westley]] began to mass-produce the [[kaleidoscope]], invented by Sir [[David Brewster]] in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items within three months in London and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce [[magic lantern]]s for use in [[phantasmagoria]] and galanty shows, by developing a method of [[mass production]] using a copper plate printing process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included [[royal family|royalty]], [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and geographical/man-made structures from around the world.&lt;ref name="Heard"&gt;[http://www.heard.supanet.com/html/lantern_history.html Shedding some light on the magic lantern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221231502/http://www.heard.supanet.com/html/lantern_history.html |date=21 December 2013 }}.  Mervyn Heard.  Accessed 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[zoetrope]] was invented in 1833 by British mathematician [[William George Horner]] and was popularized in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Kristin Thompson, Film History: An Introduction, 3rd edition (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010), 4. {{ISBN|978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood and porcelain [[doll]]s in miniature [[doll house]]s were popular with middle class girls, while boys played with marbles and toy trains.

===Mass market===
[[File:Hornby pt1901.jpg|thumb|Frank Hornby's 1901 patent number GB190100587A for what later became known as [[Meccano]]]]

The golden age of toy development was at the turn of the 20th century. [[Real wage]]s were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. [[William Harbutt]], an English painter, invented [[plasticine]] in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. [[Frank Hornby]] was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on [[Engineering mechanics|engineering principles]] in the twentieth century: [[Meccano]], [[Hornby Railways|Hornby Model Railways]] and [[Dinky Toys]].

Meccano was a [[Scale model|model]] construction system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, [[Angle iron|angle]] [[girder]]s, wheels, axles and [[gear]]s, with [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. [[Dinky Toys]] pioneered the manufacture of [[die-cast toy]]s with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The [[Britains (toy brand)|Britain's company]] revolutionized the production of [[toy soldiers]] with the invention of the process of [[hollow casting]] in lead in 1893&lt;ref&gt;Joplin, N. (1996). ''Toy Soldiers''. London: Quintet Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.

Puzzles became greatly fashionable as well. In 1893, the English lawyer [[s:Author:Angelo John Lewis|Angelo John Lewis]], writing under the pseudonym of Professor Hoffman, wrote a book called ''Puzzles Old and New''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzlemuseum.com/library/hoffm/hoff-bk.htm|title="PUZZLES OLD and NEW " by Professor Hoffmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained, amongst other things, more than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time. The [[Tangram]] puzzle, originally from China, spread to Europe and America in the 19th century.

During the [[Second World War]], some new types of toys were created through accidental innovation. After trying to create a replacement for [[synthetic rubber]], the American [[Earl L. Warrick]] inadvertently invented "nutty putty" during [[World War II]]. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as [[Silly Putty]]. Similarly, [[Play-Doh]] was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner.&lt;ref name=mit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/Invent/iow/sillyputty.html|title=On the invention of silly putty, from Lemelson-MIT Program|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 [[Richard T. James|Richard James]] was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and fall to the floor. He was intrigued by the way it flopped around on the floor. He spent two years fine-tuning the design to find the best gauge of steel and coil; the result was the [[Slinky]], which went on to sell in stores throughout the United States.

After the [[Second World War]] as society became ever more affluent and new technology and materials (plastics) for toy manufacture became available, toys became cheap and ubiquitous in households across the Western World. Among the more well known products of the 1950s there was the Danish company [[Lego]]'s line of colourful interlocking plastic brick construction sets, [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], the [[Barbie doll]] and [[Action Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/toys.html|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOYS|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are computerized dolls that can recognize and identify objects, the voice of their owner, and choose among hundreds of pre-programmed phrases with which to respond.&lt;ref name=VanPatten&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Patten|first=Denise|title=A Brief History of Talking Dolls – From Bebe Phonographe to Amazing Amanda|publisher=About.com|url=http://collectdolls.about.com/od/dollsbymaterial/a/talkingdolls.htm|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials that toys are made from have changed, what toys can do has changed, but the fact that children play with toys has not.

==Culture==
The act of children's play with toys embodies the values set forth by the adults of their specific community, but through the lens of the child's perspective. Within cultural societies, toys are a medium to enhance a child's cognitive, social, and linguistic learning.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K|title=Children and Play:Understanding Children's Worlds|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-631-23521-7|pages=89–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLLhoS7LDEkC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=toys+symbolism+of+other+cultures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VUlJGRykDj&amp;sig=moH6NCUKK_FlLHvVEeXFLuoyf-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuqSsLDQAhUD8CYKHTY0ChYQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=toys%20symbolism%20of%20other%20cultures&amp;f=false|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, societies utilize toys as a way to enhance a child's skillset within the traditional boundaries of their future roles in the community. In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view the adult world.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossie|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Toys,Play, Culture, and Society. An anthrological approach with reference to North Africa and the Sahara|date=2005|publisher=SITREC|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-974811-3-0|pages=88–91|url=https://www.academia.edu/5180690/Toys_Play_Culture_and_Society._An_anthropological_approach_with_reference_to_North_Africa_and_the_Sahara|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other cultures, toys are used to expand the development of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005" /&gt;

In addition, children from differing communities may treat their toys in different ways based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent communities may tend to be possessive of their toys, while children from poorer communities may be more willing to share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Starr2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starr|first1=Benjamin|title=TOY STORIES: CHILDREN'S FAVORITE TOYS AROUND THE WORLD|url=https://www.visualnews.com/2013/03/13/toy-stories-childrens-favorite-toys-around-the-world/|accessdate=2016-12-05|publisher=Visual News|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child development==
Toys, like play itself, serve multiple purposes in both humans and animals. They provide entertainment while fulfilling an educational role. Toys enhance [[cognition|cognitive behavior]] and stimulate creativity. They aid in the development of physical and mental skills which are necessary in later life.

One of the simplest toys, a set of simple wooden [[Block (toy)|blocks]] is also one of the best toys for developing minds.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Andrew Witkin, director of marketing for [[Mega Brands]] told Investor's Business Daily that, "They help develop hand-eye coordination, math and science skills and also let kids be creative."&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsuruoka |first=Doug |title=Toys: Not All Fun And Games |journal=Investor's Business Daily |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |date=5 January 2007 |url=http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=23&amp;issue=20070105 |doi= |id= |accessdate=2007-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009073731/http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=23&amp;issue=20070105 |archivedate=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other toys like [[marbles]], [[jackstones]], and [[ball]]s serve similar functions in child development, allowing children to use their minds and bodies to learn about [[spatial relationships]], [[cause and effect]], and a wide range of other skills.

One example of the dramatic ways that toys can influence child development involves clay sculpting toys such as [[Play-Doh]] and [[Silly Putty]] and their home-made counterparts. Mary Ucci, Educational Director of the Child Study Center of [[Wellesley College]], has demonstrated how such toys positively impact the [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], [[Child development#Social-emotional|emotional development]], and [[social development]] of children.&lt;ref name=Ucci&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ucci | first =Mary | title =Playdough: 50 Years' Old, And Still Gooey, Fun, And Educational | journal =Child Health Alert | volume =24 | issue = | pages = | publisher = | date =April 2006 | url =http://web110.epnet.com/citation.asp?tb=1&amp;_ug=sid+50E579A7%2D22F7%2D4ED5%2DADF6%2DF699A2D5EB3B%40sessionmgr2+dbs+afh+cp+1+B804&amp;_us=mh+1+sl+%2D1+hs+False+or+Date+ss+SO+sm+KS+mdbs+afh+ri+KAAAGEIB00091355+dstb+KS+sel+False+frn+1+1CD0&amp;_uso=tg%5B0+%2D+db%5B0+%2Dafh+hd+False+op%5B0+%2D+st%5B0+%2DToys++in++Child++development++AND++DE++%22TOYS%22+ex%5B0+%2Dproximity+mdb%5B0+%2Dimh+A6B6&amp;cf=1&amp;fn=1&amp;rn=2&amp; | accessdate =2007-02-17 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (Note that the full-text online version requires login.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Toys for infants often make use of distinctive sounds, bright colors, and unique [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]]. Through play with toys infants begin to recognize shapes and colors. Repetition reinforces memory. [[Play-Doh]], [[Silly Putty]] and other hands-on materials allow the child to make toys of their own.

[[Educational toy]]s for school age children of often contain a [[puzzle]], problem-solving technique, or mathematical proposition. Often toys designed for older audiences, such as teenagers or adults, demonstrate advanced concepts. [[Newton's cradle]], a desk toy designed by [[Simon Prebble]], demonstrates the [[Conservation law|conservation of momentum and energy]].

Not all toys are appropriate for all ages of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cffd4f9HBL0C&amp;q=Not+all+toys+are+appropriate+for+all+ages+of+children&amp;dq=Not+all+toys+are+appropriate+for+all+ages+of+children|title=The Mommy Guide: Real-life Advice and Tips from Over 250 Moms and Other Experts|last=Bernard|first=Susan|date=1994|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=9780809237975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some toys which are marketed for a specific age range can even harm the development of children in that range.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Age compression===
"Age compression" is a toy industry term that describes the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than they did in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old.&lt;ref name="Pressler"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pressler|first=Margaret Webb|title=Bored with her toys|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/01/AR2006040100186.html|accessdate=2 April 2006|newspaper=Washington Post|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that "move fast and things that fight". An industry executive points out that girls have entered the "tween" phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.&lt;ref name="Pressler"/&gt;

Girls gravitate towards "music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities". As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=KID+RHINO+ADDRESSES+AGE+COMPRESSION+BY+TWEAKING+PRODUCTS,+STRATEGIES&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mb_X5MShjG&amp;sig=4H5ZmdAehHrMmsszR9ddzfpXFto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4mryQxrDZAhVow1kKHR-uDvcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=KID%20RHINO%20ADDRESSES%20AGE%20COMPRESSION%20BY%20TWEAKING%20PRODUCTS%2C%20STRATEGIES&amp;f=false|title=Kid Rhino Addresses Age Compression By Tweaking Products, Strategies|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard-Google Books|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them.&lt;ref name="Tansel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tansel|first=Utku|title=Effects of age compression on traditional toys and games|url=http://blog.euromonitor.com/2010/10/effects-of-age-compression-on-traditional-toys-and-games.html|publisher=Euromonitor International|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls' development, for example, the [[Hello Kitty]] brand, and the [[Disney Princess]] franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.

==Gender==
[[File:Tank toy radio.JPG|thumb|right|A toy tank with a remote control. Such toys are generally thought of as boys' toys.]]
{{main|Gender|Girls' toys and games|Boys' toys and games}}

Certain toys, such as [[Barbie]] dolls and toy soldiers, are often perceived as being more acceptable for one gender than the other. The turning point for the addition of gender to toys came about in the 1960s and 1970s. Before 1975, only about two percent of toys were labeled by gender, whereas today on the Disney store's website, considered a dominating global force for toys by researcher Claire Miller, all toys are labeled by gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The journal [[Sex Roles (journal)|''Sex Roles'']] began publishing research on this topic in 1975, focusing on the effects of gender in youth. Too, many psychological textbooks began to address this new issue. Along with these publications, researchers also started to challenge the ideas of male and female as being opposites, even going as far as to claim toys which have characteristics of both gender are preferable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zosuls|first=Kristina M.|last2=Miller|first2=Cindy Faith|last3=Ruble|first3=Diane N.|last4=Martin|first4=Carol Lynn|last5=Fabes|first5=Richard A.|date=2011-06-01|title=Gender Development Research in Sex Roles: Historical Trends and Future Directions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-010-9902-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=64|issue=11-12|pages=826–842|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9902-3|issn=0360-0025|pmc=3131694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone for research on gender is the use of meta-analysis, which provides a way to assess patterns in a systematic way, which is especially relevant for a topic such as gender, which can be difficult to quantify.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nature and nurture have historically been analyzed when looking at gender in play, as well as reinforcement by peers and parents of typical gender roles and consequently, gender play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Toy companies have often promoted the segregation by gender in toys because it enables them to customize the same toy for each gender, which ultimately doubles their revenue. For example, Legos added more colors to certain sets of toys in the 1990s, including colors commonly attributed to girls such as lavender.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=bd6261e7-ba5f-4849-aaef-fb04d4e35a90@sessionmgr120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=a9h&amp;AN=9611122255|title=Toy story: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted by researchers that, "Children as young as 18 months display sex-stereotyped toy choices".&lt;ref name=Caldera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldera|first=Yvonne M. |last2=Huston|first2=Aletha C. |last3=O'Brien|first3=Marion |title=Social Interactions and Play Patterns of Parents and Toddlers with Feminine, Masculine, and Neutral Toys|journal=Child Development|volume=60|issue=1|pages=70–76|date=February 1989|doi=10.2307/1131072|pmid=2702876|jstor=1131072}}&lt;/ref&gt; When eye movement is tracked in young infants, infant girls show a visual preference for a doll over a toy truck (d &gt; 1.0). Boys showed no preference for the truck over the doll. However, they did fixate on the truck more than the girls (d = .78).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, G. M., Wilcox, T., &amp; Woods, R. (2009). Sex differences in infants' visual interest in toys. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 427–433. doi: 10.1007/s10508-008-9430-1&lt;/ref&gt; This small study suggests that even before any self-awareness of gender identity has emerged, children already prefer sex-typical toys. These differences in toy choice are well established within the child by the age of three.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, G. M., &amp; Saenz, J. (2012). Early androgens, activity levels and toy choices of children in the second year of life. Hormones and Behavior, 62, 500–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 different children ages three to four and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed to play with the toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders in order to create a better balance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trawick-Smith|first=Jeffrey|last2=Wolff|first2=Jennifer|last3=Koschel|first3=Marley|last4=Vallarelli|first4=Jamie|date=2015-07-01|title=Effects of Toys on the Play Quality of Preschool Children: Influence of Gender, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-014-0644-7|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=249–256|doi=10.1007/s10643-014-0644-7|issn=1082-3301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some parents promote gender neutral play, many parents encourage their sons and daughters to participate in sex-typed activities, including doll playing and engaging in housekeeping activities for girls and playing with trucks and engaging in sports activities for boys.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Role Stereotypes, Expectancy Effects, and Parents' Socialization of Gender Differences, Jacquelynne S.

(Eds.), Sex Differences in the Brain from Genes to Behavior (1ed., pp. 275–290).New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A study done by researcher Susan Witt suggests that stereotypes are oftentimes only strengthened by the environment, which perpetuates them to linger in older life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This stereotypical attribution of sex-typical toys for girls and boys is gradually changing, with toys companies creating more gender neutral toys, as the benefits associated with allowing children to play with toys that appeal to them far outweighs controlling their individual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://toyreviewexperts.com/gender-neutral-toys-how-they-empower-our-kids/ |title=Gender Neutral Toys: How They Empower Our Kids |work=Toy Review Experts |author= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many stores are beginning to change their gender labels on children's play items. Target removed all identification related to gender from their toy aisles and Disney did the same for their costumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/upshot/boys-and-girls-constrained-by-toys-and-costumes.html|title=Boys and Girls, Constrained by Toys and Costumes|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|date=2015-10-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Disney store is an especially prevalent example of gender in play because they are a global identity in the toy world. A study done regarding their website found that though they have removed gender labels from their costumes, the toys online reflect more stereotypical gender identities. For example, males were associated with physicality and females were associated with beauty, housing, and caring.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Auster, Carol J., and Claire S. Mansbach. "The Gender Marketing of Toys: An Analysis of Color and Type of Toy on the Disney Store Website."''&amp;nbsp;Sex Roles'', vol. 67, no. 7-8, 2012, pp. 375-388'', Sociological Abstracts.''&lt;/ref&gt; Too, though they promote their toys as being for both genders, there is no section for boys and girls combined on their website. Those which are generally deemed for both genders more closely resemble what many would label "boy toys," as they relate closer to the stereotype of masculinity within play.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Traditions within various cultures promote the passing down of certain toys to their children based on the child's gender. In South American Indian communities, boys receive a toy bow and arrow from their father while young girls receive a toy basket from their mother.&lt;ref name="Smith2010" /&gt; In North African and Saharan cultural communities, gender plays a role in the creation of self-made dolls. While female dolls are used to represent brides, mothers, and wives, male dolls are used to represent horsemen and warriors. This contrast stems from the various roles of men and women within the Saharan and North African communities. There are differences in the toys that are intended for girls and boys within various cultures, which is reflective of the differing roles of men and women within a specific cultural community.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005" /&gt;

Research on the repercussions of gender in toys suggests that play should be encouraged to be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Economics==

With toys comprising such a large and important part of human existence, it makes sense that the toy industry would have a substantial economic impact. Sales of toys often increase around holidays where gift-giving is a tradition. Some of these holidays include Christmas, Easter, [[Saint Nicholas Day]], and [[Three Kings Day]].

In 2005, toy sales in the United States totaled about $22.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka/&gt; &lt;!-- This reference has a slightly lower figure, but isn't from as reliable a source.

Toy companies change and adapt their toys to meet the changing demands of children thereby gaining a larger share of the substantial market. In recent years many toys have become more complicated with flashing lights and sounds in an effort to appeal to children raised around television and the internet. According to [[Mattel]]'s president, Neil Friedman, "Innovation is key in the toy industry and to succeed one must create a 'wow' moment for kids by designing toys that have fun, innovative features and include new technologies and engaging content."

In an effort to reduce costs, many mass-producers of toys locate their factories in areas where wages are lower. China manufactures about 70 percent of the world’s toys and is home to more than 8,000 toy firms, most of which are located in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Dezhi|last2=Wei|first2=William|last3=Hu|first3=Daiping|last4=Muralidharan|first4=Etayankara|title=Survival strategy of OEM companies: a case study of the Chinese toy industry|journal=International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management|date=5 September 2016|volume=36|issue=9|pages=1065–1088|doi=10.1108/IJOPM-04-2015-0212}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of all toys sold in the U.S., for example, are manufactured in China.&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka/&gt; Issues and events such as power outages, supply of raw materials, supply of labor, and raising wages that impact areas where factories are located often have an enormous impact on the toy industry in importing countries.

Many traditional toy makers have been losing sales to video game makers for years. Because of this, some traditional toy makers have entered the field of [[electronic game]]s and even turning [[audio games]] into toys, and are enhancing the brands that they have by introducing interactive extensions or internet connectivity to their current toys.&lt;ref name = "Ibisworld"&gt;{{cite news

The things that are built are sometimes used as toys once completed, but generally speaking, the object is to build things of one's own design, and old models often are broken up and the pieces reused in new models.

The oldest and, perhaps most common construction toy is a set of simple wooden [[Toy block|blocks]], which are often painted in bright colors and given to babies and toddlers. Construction sets such as [[Lego]] bricks and [[Lincoln Logs]] are designed for slightly older children and have been quite popular in the last century. 
Construction sets appeal to children (and adults) who like to work with their hands, puzzle solvers, and imaginative sorts.

Some other examples include [[Bayko]], [[Konstruk-Tubes]], [[K'Nex]], [[Erector Set]]s, [[Tinkertoy]]s, and [[Meccano]], and generic construction toys such as [[Neodymium magnet toys]].

===Dolls and miniatures===
{{main|doll}}
[[File:Child and Doll.jpg|thumb|left|A girl and her [[doll]] in the 1900s.]]

A [[doll]] is a model of a human (often a baby), a humanoid (like [[Bert and Ernie]]), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include [[Husk|cornhusks]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], wood, [[porcelain]] (sometimes called china), [[Bisque doll|bisque]], [[celluloid]], [[wax]], and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.

Sometimes intended as decorations, keepsakes, or [[collectible]]s for older children and adults, most dolls are intended as toys for children, usually girls, to play with. Dolls have been found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs which date to as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name="Maspero"/&gt;

Dolls are usually miniatures, but baby dolls may be of true size and weight. A doll or [[stuffed animal]] of soft material is sometimes called a [[plush toy]] or [[Stuffed toy|plushie]]. A popular toy of this type is the [[Teddy Bear]].
[[File:Pierre Despereax 09.19.2012 (8004871773).jpg|thumb|upright|Teddy Bear]]
A distinction is often made between dolls and [[action figure]]s, which are generally of plastic or semi-metallic construction and poseable to some extent, and often are merchandising from television shows or films which feature the characters. Modern action figures, such as [[Action Man]], are often marketed towards boys, whereas dolls are often marketed towards girls.

[[Toy soldiers]], perhaps a precursor to modern [[action figures]], have been a popular toy for centuries. They allow children to act out battles, often with toy military equipment and a castle or fort. Miniature animal figures are also widespread, with children perhaps acting out farm activities with animals and equipment centered on a toy farm.

===Vehicles===
[[File:Knatterboot.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pop pop boat|toy boat]].]]
{{main|Vehicle}}

Children have played with miniature versions of vehicles since ancient times, with toy two-wheeled [[cart]]s being depicted on [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|ancient Greek vases]].&lt;ref name=Hils/&gt; [[Wind-up toy]]s have also played a part in the advancement of toy vehicles. Modern equivalents include toy [[motor vehicle|car]]s such as those produced by [[Matchbox (toy company)|Matchbox]] or [[Hot Wheels]], miniature aircraft, toy boats, [[military vehicle]]s, and [[toy train|train]]s. Examples of the latter range from wooden sets for younger children such as [[BRIO]] to more complicated realistic [[Rail transport modeling|train models]] like those produced by [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]], [[Doepke Toys|Doepke]] and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]]. Larger die-cast vehicles, 1:18 scale, have become popular toys; these vehicles are produced with a great attention to detail.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Puzzles===
{{main|Puzzle}}
[[File:Rubik's cube.svg|upright|thumb|A Rubik's Cube]]
A '''puzzle''' is a [[problem]] or enigma that challenges ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based on the process of inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] skills. A popular puzzle toy is the [[Rubik's Cube]], invented by Hungarian [[Ernő Rubik]] in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.

There are many different types of puzzles, for example a [[maze]] is a type of [[tour puzzle]]. Other categories include; [[construction puzzle]]s, [[stick puzzle]]s, [[tiling puzzle]]s, [[disentanglement puzzle]]s, [[sliding puzzle]]s, [[logic puzzle]]s, [[picture puzzle]]s, [[lock puzzle]]s and [[mechanical puzzle]]s.

===Collectibles===

{{Main|Collectible}}

Some toys, such as [[Beanie Baby|Beanie Babies]], attract large numbers of enthusiasts, eventually becoming [[collectible]]s. Other toys, such as [[Boyds Bears]] are marketed to adults as collectibles. Some people spend large sums of money in an effort to acquire larger and more complete collections. The record for a single [[Pez dispenser]] at auction, for example, is US$1100.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|title=New Auction Gems: Common Folks; Venerable Houses Woo Unstuffy Buyers With Unstuffy Stuff|work=The New York Times|page=37|date=23 April 1995|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6061EF93B5D0C708EDDAD0894DD494D81|accessdate=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotional merchandise===

Many successful films, television programs, books and sport teams have official merchandise, which often includes related toys. Some notable examples are ''[[Star Wars]]'' (a space fantasy franchise) and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], an English [[association football|football]] club.
 
Promotional toys can fall into any of the other toy categories; for example they can be dolls or action figures based on the characters of movies or professional athletes, or they can be balls, yo-yos, and [[lunch box]]es with logos on them. Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. [[Model aircraft]] are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as [[Die cast toy|toy cars and truck]]s and [[model train]]s are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a [[Prize (marketing)|prize]]. Toys are also used as [[Premium (marketing)|premiums]], where consumers redeem [[Proof of purchase|proofs of purchase]] from a product and pay shipping and handling fees to get the toy.  Some people go to great lengths to collect these sorts of promotional toys.

===Digital toys===
[[File:Aibo-DASA.JPG|left|thumb|An [[Aibo]].]]
Digital toys are toys that incorporate some form of interactive digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/business/tech-toys-that-can-make-the-video-screen-passe.html|title=Tech Toys That Go Beyond the Screen|first=Farhad|last=Manjoo|date=26 November 2014|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of digital toys include [[virtual pets]] and [[handheld electronic games]]. Among the earliest digital toys are [[Mattel Auto Race]] and the [[Little Professor]], both released in 1976.  The concept of using technology in a way that bridges the digital with the physical world, providing unique interactive experiences for the user has also been referred to as "Phygital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phygitalien.com/what-is-phygital/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216182145/http://phygitalien.com/what-is-phygital/ |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical activity===
{{Main|Physical activity}}
[[File:Jakarta old football.jpg|thumb|A boy from [[Jakarta]] with his ball. [[Ball game]]s are good exercise, and are popular worldwide.]]

A great many toys are part of active play. These include traditional toys such as [[Hoop rolling|hoop]]s, [[top]]s, [[jump rope]]s and [[ball]]s, as well as more modern toys like [[Frisbee]]s, [[foot bag]]s, [[astrojax]], and [[Myachi]].

Playing with these sorts of toys allows children to exercise, building strong bones and muscles and aiding in [[physical fitness]]. Throwing and catching balls and frisbees can improve hand–eye coordination. Jumping rope, (also known as skipping) and playing with foot bags can improve balance.

==Safety regulations==
{{main|Toy safety}}
[[File:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|left|Toys with small parts, such as these [[Lego]] elements are required by law to have warnings about choking hazards in some countries.]]

Many countries have passed [[safety standards]] limiting the types of toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as [[choking]] or [[fire hazard]]s that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials used to make a toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.

For toy safety, every country has its own regulations. But since the [[globalization]] and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This is why it is of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletter.sgs.com/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000006/sgs-safeguards-02812-korea-plans-to-limit-five-chemicals-in-childrens-products-a4-en-12.pdf "Korea plans to limit five chemicals in children's products"], SGS SafeGuards, Retrieved 02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Countries or trade zones such as the [[European Union]] regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products.

There have also been issues of toy safety regarding lead paint. Some toy factories, when projects become too large for them to handle, outsource production to other less known factories, often in other countries. Recently, there were some in China that America had to send back. The subcontractors may not be watched as closely and sometimes use improper manufacturing methods. The U.S. government, along with mass market stores, is now moving towards requiring companies to submit their products to testing before they end up on shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/business/worldbusiness/11lead.html | work=The New York Times | title=Why Lead in Toy Paint? It's Cheaper | first=David | last=Barboza | date=11 September 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal==
[[File:Crashbobby 02-small.JPG|thumb|Some communities require recycling of the batteries in toys such as [[qfix|qfix robot "crash-bobby"]].]]

When toys have been outgrown or are no longer wanted, reuse is sometimes considered{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. They can be donated via many charities such as [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[Salvation Army]], sold at [[garage sale]]s, [[auction]]ed, sometimes even donated to museums. However, when toys are broken, worn out or otherwise unfit for use, care should be taken when disposing of them. Donated or resold toys should be gently used, clean and have all parts.&lt;ref name=Goodwilldonationguidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwill.org/page/guest/about/howweoperate/donations/dosanddonts|title=Goodwill Industries International - Dos and Don'ts|date=13 August 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813014318/http://www.goodwill.org/page/guest/about/howweoperate/donations/dosanddonts|archivedate=13 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before disposal of any battery-operated toy, batteries should be removed and recycled; some communities demand this be done. Some manufacturers, such as [[Little Tikes]], will take back and recycle their products.

In 2007, massive [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls of toys produced in China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LIPTON|first=ERIC S.|title=As More Toys Are Recalled, Trail Ends in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19toys.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=19 June 2007|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; led many U.S.-based charities to cut back on, or even discontinue, their acceptance of used toys. Goodwill stopped accepting donations of any toys except stuffed animals, and other charities checked all toys against government-issued checklists.&lt;ref name=Recall&gt;{{cite news

The [[WEEE directive|WEEE directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment)]], which aims at increasing re-use and recycling and reducing electronic waste, applies to toys in the United Kingdom as of 2 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/innovation/sustainability/weee/page30269.html|title=EC Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) - DTI|date=23 June 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623125558/http://www.dti.gov.uk/innovation/sustainability/weee/page30269.html|archivedate=23 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy use in animals==
It is not unusual for some animals to play with toys. An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young chimpanzees use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/09/101220-chimpanzees-play-nature-nurture-science-animals-evolution/|title=Chimp "Girls" Play With "Dolls" Too—First Wild Evidence|date=22 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology, DOI: 10,1016 / j . cub.2010.11.024&lt;/ref&gt; They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.

'''Urban fiction''', also known as '''street lit''' or '''street fiction''' is a [[literary genre]] set in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the socio-economic realities and culture of its characters as the urban setting. The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside of city living. Profanity, sex, and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. Most authors of this genre draw upon their past experiences to depict their storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Urban fiction: words on the street|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/08785ece-86ee-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c.html|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2015-11-13|access-date = 2016-02-23|issn = 0307-1766|first = Neil|last = Munshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis and historical forces ==
Contemporary urban fiction was (and largely still is) a genre written by [[African Americans]]. In his famous essay "[[The Souls of Black Folk]]", [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] discussed how a veil separated the African American community from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/114/|title=Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. The Souls of Black Folk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, fiction written by people outside the African American culture could not (at least with any degree of verisimilitude) depict the people, settings, and events experienced by people in that culture. Try as some might, those who grew up outside the veil (i.e., outside the urban culture) may find it difficult to write fiction grounded in inner-city and African American life.

City novels of yesteryear that depict the low-income survivalist realities of city living can also be considered urban fiction or street lit. In her book, ''The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Advisory-Guide-Street-Literature/dp/0838911102/ The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Vanessa Irvin Morris points out that titles considered canonical or "classic" today, could be considered the urban fiction or "street lit" of its day.

Titles that depict historical inner-city realities include Stephen Crane's ''[[Maggie: A Girl of the Streets|Maggie, A Girl of the Streets]]'' (1893), Charles Dickens' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1838), [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]'s ''[[The Sport of the Gods]]'' (1902) and [[Langston Hughes|Langston Hughes']] The Ballad Of The Landlord (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urban fiction (or nonfiction) would not exist without Langston Hughes|url = http://www.chicagonow.com/lupus-purple-reigns/2016/02/urban-fiction-or-nonfiction-would-not-exist-without-langston-hughes/|website = www.chicagonow.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allpoetry.com/The-Ballad-Of-The-Landlord The Ballad Of The Landlord]&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, urban fiction is not just an African American or Latino phenomenon, but rather, the genre exists along a historical continuum that includes stories from diverse cultural and ethnic experiences.

== Emergence of contemporary urban fiction ==
In the 1970s, during the culmination of the [[Black Power]] movement, a jailed Black man named Robert Beck took the pen name [[Iceberg Slim]] and wrote ''Pimp'', a dark, gritty tale of life in the inner-city underworld. While the book contained elements of the Black Power agenda, it was most notable for its unsparing depiction of street life.

Iceberg Slim wrote many other novels and attained an international following. Some of the terminology he used in his books crossed over into the lexicon of [[African American Vernacular English|Black English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/iceberg_slim.html|title=Iceberg Slim: biography, bibliography, filmography and links - Biography Project: An Independent Reference Resource for counterculture-subculture-underground|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers included [[Donald Goines]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324786/bio]&lt;/ref&gt; and, notably, [[Claude Brown]]'s ''Manchild in the Promised Land'', which was published in 1965. Also published that year was ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'' by [[Alex Haley]]''.'' Because Haley's non-fictional read captured the realistic nature of African American urban life for coming-of-age young men, the book has consistently served as a standard for reading among African American teenaged boys.

== Hip hop lit: hip hop music as an urban ballad ==
During the 1980s and early 1990s, urban fiction in print experienced a decline. However, one could make a cogent argument that urban tales simply moved from print to music, as [[hip hop music]] exploded in popularity. Of course, for every emcee who signed a recording contract and made the airwaves, ten more amateurs plied the streets and local clubs, much like urban [[bards]], [[griot]]s or [[troubadour]]s telling urban fiction in an informal, oral manner rather than in a neat, written form.

One of the most famous emcees, [[Tupac Shakur]], is sometimes called a ghetto prophet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTERVIEWS: Kendrick Lamar CONFIRMS Engagement To Whitney Alford, Calls Tupac Shakur A Prophet, Discusses J. Cole Trying To Sign Him|url = http://www.theybf.com/2015/04/03/interviews-kendrick-lamar-confirms-engagement-to-whitney-alford-calls-tupac-shakur-a|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an author of urban fiction in lyrical form. Shakur's early poetry was posthumously compiled into a volume entitled ''[[The Rose That Grew from Concrete (book)|The Rose That Grew from Concrete]]'' in 1999.

Modern hip-hop literature in print form is a thriving and popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;PINTO, C. "Urban lit blazes off bookshelves." Gannett News Service. 2009, August 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-fiction publications from figures in the hip-hop realm such as [[Russell Simmons]], [[Kevin Liles]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[FUBU]] founder [[Daymond John]] feature prominently in this genre. [[Karrine Steffans]] and shock jock [[Wendy Williams (radio host)|Wendy Williams]] have written blockbuster books for this audience. Both Steffans and emcee [[50 Cent]] have had such success with their books that they were given their own imprints to usher in similar authors, such as for [[50 Cent]]'s [[G-Unit Books]].

== Contemporary street lit: The new wave of urban fiction ==

===1990s===
Toward the end of the 1990s, urban fiction experienced a revival, as demand for novels authentically conveying the urban experience increased, and new [[business models]] enabled fledgling writers to more easily bring a manuscript to market and to libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Urban Fiction Makes Its Way From Streets to Libraries|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/nyregion/23fiction.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2008-10-22|access-date = 2016-02-23|issn = 0362-4331|first = Anne|last = Barnard}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first writers in this new cycle of urban fiction was [[Omar Tyree]], who published the novel ''[[Flyy Girl]]'' in 1996, reissued as a reprint in 1999.

The genre gained significant momentum in 1999 with [[Sister Souljah]]'s bestseller ''[[The Coldest Winter Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(Morris, Hughes-Hassell, Agosto, &amp; Cottman, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teri Woods]]'s ''True to the Game'' was also published in 1999, and became the standard from which the entrepreneurial publishing and distribution of contemporary urban fiction took note. The simultaneous publishing of these three novels created a momentum of readership for urban fiction and carried that wave for years. Thus ''The Coldest Winter Ever'', ''True to the Game'', and ''Flyy Girl'' are considered classics in the renaissance of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;(Morris, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Souljah describes the untapped market for urban fiction and the stereotypes that held it back in its early years:

{{Cquote|The publishing industry did not realize that there was a huge market of Black readers. A lot of people in publishing fell into the same stereotypes that people in the mainstream fall victim to: that Black people either can't read or can't write, or don't read and don't write [...] When ''The Coldest Winter Ever'' came out... it took to task those stereotypes and showed that, yes, Black people love great stories like every other people from every other culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Melody K.|title=Urban fiction set to heat up the summer with hot new titles|journal=JET|date=April 7, 2008|volume=113|issue=13|pages=50|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===2000–present===
In less than a decade, urban fiction has experienced a renaissance that boasts thousands of titles. The newest wave of street fiction is urban Latino fiction novels such as ''Devil's Mambo'' by Jerry Rodriguez, Chained by Deborah Cardona (a.k.a. Sexy) and [[Jeff Rivera]]'s ''Forever My Lady''.

Major writers of contemporary urban fiction include [[Wahida Clark]], [[Vickie Stringer]], [[Nikki Turner]], [[Kole Black]], [[K'wan Foye|K'wan]], [[Toy Styles]], Kwame Teague, who many believed penned [[Teri Woods]]' ''Dutch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Message from the Penitentiary|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-ferranti/a-message-from-the-penite_b_9212556.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the writing duo [[Meesha Mink]] &amp; De'Nesha Diamond.

There is also an unexpected literary wave of hip-hop fiction and street lit, which was sparked by Sister Souljah.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Authors with a book or books in this offering include [[Saul Williams]], [[Abiola Abrams]], and [[Felicia Pride]]. These are hip hop lit or street lit books that take a more literary approach using metaphor, signifying and other literary devices. These books may also be used in socially redeeming or classroom capacities, while maintaining love and positivity for the music and hip hop culture.

With this new wave of renaissance, "street lit" was breaking new ground when it came to promotion and exposure. Aside from hand-to-hand sales, which seems to work best in a genre where word-of-mouth has proven to be worth more than any large ad campaign, the Internet has increased the authors' and publishers' ability to reach out to the genre's readers.

With Internet savvy, many self-published authors who once had no shot of recognition are now household names, such as author Rasheed Clark, who went from relatively unknown, to being honored with fourteen Infini Literary Award nominations for his first two novels, ''Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God'' and ''Cold Summer Afternoon'', both of which became instant bestsellers and proved that Clark was a fresh voice in African American fiction, and a leading African-American writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jessie Carney|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture [Four Volumes]|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313357978|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors in this genre such as [[K'wan|K'wan Foye]], Nikki Turner, [[Toy Styles]], Kole Black, are known for bringing street teams and other musical promotion efforts to the book scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tome Rule: Toy Styles can write a novel in a week.

In 2010, the hip hop music label, Cash Money Records, established a publishing branch to their brand, Cash Money Content. However, Cash Money Content's last book, ''Animal 3'', was published in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = K’wan Animal III:Revelations set to release Nov. 4th!|url = http://cashmoneycontent.com/kwan-animal-iiirevelations-set-to-release-nov-4th/|website = Cash Money Content|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vickie Stringer is an urban lit author, as well as founder and CEO of her own publishing company, Triple Crown Publications, a publisher of 45 novels and 35 writers as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Melody K.|title=Urban fiction set to heat up the summer with hot new titles|journal=JET|date=April 7, 2008|volume=113|issue=13|pages=48|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forums like [[AALBC.com|AALBC]] are often used to keep track of the progressive urban fiction genre as it grows tremendously daily.

===Criticism===
Early criticism of street lit was that books were badly edited due to lack of [[copy editing]] by independent publishers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Simone Cade|title=Critical Engagements: Adolescent African American Girls &amp; Urban Fiction|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109198478|pages=23–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years the mainstream publishing industry recognized the genre's potential and signed many street lit authors to contracts, thus producing better packaged product. One such author was Treasure E. Blue, according to Kirkus Reviews Magazine, a self-published sensation—it has reportedly sold 65,000 copies before getting signed to a major six-figure deal with Random House Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HARLEM GIRL LOST by Treasure E. Blue |url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/treasure-e-blue/harlem-girl-lost/|website = [[Kirkus Reviews]] |access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reach of urban fiction into a large youth readership is undeniable today. Researchers have turned their attention to its influence on urban literacy, particularly among adolescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Simone Cade|title=Critical Engagements: Adolescent African American Girls &amp; Urban Fiction|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109198478|pages=24–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite misgivings about editing quality issues, secondary school teachers in suburban settings have included urban literature in curricula, referring to it as "multicultural young adult literature" to expose students to "authentic" voices representing urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''vowel length''' is the perceived [[length (phonetics)|duration]] of a [[vowel]] sound. Often the [[chroneme]], or the "longness", acts like a consonant, and may have arisen from one etymologically, such as in [[Australian English]]. While not distinctive in most other dialects of [[English language|English]], vowel length is an important [[phonemic]] factor in many other languages, for instance in
[[Arabic phonology#Vowels|Arabic]],
[[Finnish phonology#Length|Finnish]],
[[Fijian language#Phonology|Fijian]], 
[[Kannada]],
[[Japanese phonology#Vowels|Japanese]],
[[Old English phonology#Vowels|Old English]],
[[Scottish Gaelic phonology#Vowels|Scottish Gaelic]]
and
[[Vietnamese phonology#Vowels|Vietnamese]]. It plays a phonetic role in the majority of dialects of British English and is said to be phonemic in a few other dialects, such as Australian English, [[South African English]] and [[New Zealand English]]. It also plays a lesser phonetic role in [[Cantonese]], unlike other [[varieties of Chinese]].

Many languages do not distinguish vowel length phonemically. Those that do usually distinguish between '''short vowels''' and '''long vowels'''. A very few languages distinguish three phonemic vowel lengths, such as [[Luiseño language|Luiseño]] and [[Mixe language|Mixe]]. However, some languages with two vowel lengths also have words in which long vowels appear adjacent to other short or long vowels of the same type: Japanese ''[[hōō]]'' "phoenix" or [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀάατος'' {{IPA|[a.áː.a.tos]}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H. G., and R. Scott (1996). ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (revised 9th ed. with supplement). Oxford: Oxford University Press. p.1&lt;/ref&gt; "inviolable". Some languages that do not ordinarily have phonemic vowel length but permit [[hiatus (linguistics)|vowel hiatus]] may similarly exhibit sequences of identical vowel phonemes that yield ''phonetically'' long vowels, such as [[Georgian language|Georgian]] გააადვილებ {{IPA|[ɡa.a.ad.vil.eb]}} "you will facilitate it".

==Related features==
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is often reinforced by allophonic vowel length, especially when it is lexical. For example, [[French language|French]] long vowels are always in stressed syllables. [[Finnish language|Finnish]], a language with two phonemic lengths, indicates the stress by adding allophonic length, which gives four distinctive lengths and five physical lengths: short and long stressed vowels, short and long unstressed vowels, and a half-long vowel, which is a short vowel found in a syllable immediately preceded by a stressed short vowel: ''i-s'''o'''''.

Among the languages with distinctive vowel length, there are some in which it may occur only in stressed syllables, such as in [[Alemannic German]] and [[Egyptian Arabic]]. In languages such as [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Classical Latin]], vowel length is distinctive also in unstressed syllables.

In some languages, vowel length is sometimes better analyzed as a sequence of two identical vowels. In [[Finnic languages]], such as Finnish, the simplest example follows from [[consonant gradation]]: ''haka → haan''. In some cases, it is caused by a following [[chroneme]], which is etymologically a consonant: ''jää'' "ice" ← [[Proto-Uralic]] *''jäŋe''. In non-initial syllables, it is ambiguous if long vowels are vowel clusters; poems written in the [[Kalevala meter]] often syllabicate between the vowels, and an (etymologically original) intervocalic ''-h-'' is seen in that and some modern dialects (''taivaan'' vs. ''taivahan'' "of the sky"). Morphological treatment of [[diphthong]]s is essentially similar to long vowels. Some old Finnish long vowels have developed into diphthongs, but successive layers of borrowing have introduced the same long vowels again so the diphthong and the long vowel now again contrast (''nuotti'' "musical note" vs. ''nootti'' "diplomatic note").

In Japanese, most long vowels are the results of the phonetic change of [[diphthong]]s; ''au'' and ''ou'' became ''ō'', ''iu'' became ''yū'', ''eu'' became ''yō'', and now ''ei'' is becoming ''ē''. The change also occurred after the loss of intervocalic phoneme {{IPA|/h/}}. For example, modern ''Kyōto'' ([[Kyoto]]) has undergone a shift: /kjauto/ → /kjoːto/. Another example is ''shōnen'' (''boy''): /seuneɴ/ → /sjoːneɴ/ [ɕoːneɴ].

==Phonemic vowel length==
Many languages make a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] distinction between long and short vowels: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Kannada]], etc.

Long vowels may or may not be analyzed as separate phonemes. In Latin and Hungarian, long vowels are analyzed as separate phonemes from short vowels, which doubles the number of vowel phonemes.

Vowel length contrasts with more than two phonemic levels are rare, and several hypothesized cases of three-level vowel length can be analysed without postulating this typologically unusual configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Odden, David (2011). The Representation of Vowel Length. In Marc van Oostendorp, Colin J. Ewen, Elizabeth Hume, &amp; Keren Rice (eds.) The Blackwell Companion to Phonology. Wiley-Blackwell, 465-490.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonian language|Estonian]] has three distinctive lengths, but the third is [[suprasegmental]], as it has developed from the allophonic variation caused by now-deleted grammatical markers. For example, half-long 'aa' in ''saada'' comes from the agglutination *''saata+ka'' "send+(imperative)", and the overlong 'aa' in ''saada'' comes from *''saa+ta'' "get+(infinitive)". As for languages that have three lengths, independent of vowel quality or syllable structure, these include [[Dinka language|Dinka]], [[Mixe language|Mixe]], [[Yavapai language|Yavapai]] and [[Wichita language|Wichita]]. An example from Mixe is {{IPA|[poʃ]}} "guava", {{IPA|[poˑʃ]}} "spider", {{IPA|[poːʃ]}} "knot". In Dinka the longest vowels are three [[mora (linguistics)|moras]] long, and so are best analyzed as overlong {{IPA|/oːː/}} etc.

Four-way distinctions have been claimed, but these are actually long-short distinctions on adjacent syllables.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} For example, in [[Kikamba language|kiKamba]], there is {{IPA|[ko.ko.na]}}, {{IPA|[kóó.ma̋]}}, {{IPA|[ko.óma̋]}}, {{IPA|[nétónubáné.éetɛ̂]}} "hit", "dry", "bite", "we have chosen for everyone and are still choosing".

==Vowel length in English==
{{tone|section|date=October 2018}}
The [[Received Pronunciation#Long and short vowels|vowels of Received Pronunciation]] are commonly divided into short and long phonemes. The short vowels are {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (as in ''kit''), {{IPA|/ʊ/}} (as in ''foot''), {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (as in ''dress''), {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (as in ''strut''), {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in ''trap''), {{IPA|/ɒ/}} (as in ''lot''), and {{IPA|/ə/}} (as in the first syllable of ''ago'' and in the second of ''sofa''). The long vowels are {{IPA|/iː/}} (as in ''fleece''), {{IPA|/uː/}} (as in ''goose''), {{IPA|/ɜː/}} (as in ''nurse''), {{IPA|/ɔː/}} as in ''north'' and ''thought'', and  {{IPA|/ɑː/}} (as in ''father'' and ''start''). While a different degree of length is present, there are also differences in the [[vowel quality|''quality'']] ([[tense (phonetics)|lax vs tense]]) of these vowels. In [[General American#Vowels|General American]], only tenseness is usually distinguished and vowels are transcribed without the length mark.

===Allophonic vowel length===
In most varieties of English, for instance [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[General American]], there is allophonic variation in vowel length: vowels are shortened before [[fortis consonant|fortis]] consonants but have full length in all other contexts (i.e. word-finally, before [[lenis consonant|lenis]] consonants, and before nasals and /l/).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Beverley|last2=Mees|first2=Inger|title=Practical Phonetics and Phonology|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415506496|page=58|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is known as [[clipping (phonetics)|''pre-fortis clipping'']]. Thus the vowel in ''bad'' /bæd/ is of normal length but the vowel in ''bat'' /bæt/ is shortened. The clipping effect can result in phonologically long vowels becoming shorter than phonologically short vowels when they occur in pre-fortis position.

===Contrastive vowel length===
In [[Australian English phonology|Australian English]], there is contrastive vowel length in closed syllables between long and short {{IPA|/e æ a/}} and sometimes {{IPA|/ɪ/}}. The following can be [[minimal pair]]s of length for many speakers:

{| style="margin-left: 1em;" cellspacing="3"
|-
| {{IPA|[bɪd]}} ''bid'' || vs || {{IPA|[bɪːd]}}{{citation needed|reason=The Macquarie Dictionary lists /bɪəd/ as the only pronunciation of 'beard'|date=January 2016}} ''beard''
|-
| {{IPA|[feɹi]}} ''ferry'' || vs || {{IPA|[feːɹi]}} ''fairy''
|-
| {{IPA|[mænɪŋ]}} ''Manning'' the last name || vs || {{IPA|[mæːnɪŋ]}} ''manning''
|}

==="Long" and "short" vowels in orthography===
In English orthography, letters representing vowels in words of the form ''CVC'' and ''CVCe'' are traditionally called "long" and "short". A vowel letter is called "long" if it's pronounced the same as in the letter's name and "short" otherwise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mheonline.com/ccssehandbook/grade2/ccslh_g2_fs_3_1a_l1.html|title=Part 3: Reading: Foundational Skills|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mheonline.com|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is commonly used for educational purposes when teaching children how to read; however, this system does not cover all vowels of English and the terminology is not linguistic. In phonetic transcription, "long" vowels may be marked with a macron; for example, /ā/ may be used to transcribe IPA /eɪ/. This is sometimes used in dictionaries, most notably in [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/static/pdf/help/guide-to-pronunciation.pdf|title=Guide to Pronunciation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Pronunciation respelling for English#Traditional respelling systems|Pronunciation respelling for English]] for more).

==Origin==

Vowel length may often be traced to [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. In Australian English, the second element {{IPA|[ə]}} of a diphthong {{IPA|[eə]}} has assimilated to the preceding vowel, giving the pronunciation of ''bared'' as {{IPA|[beːd]}}, creating a contrast with the short vowel in ''bed'' {{IPA|[bed]}}.

Another common source is the vocalization&lt;!--This means the changing of a consonant into a vowel. No article describes this concept in general, but l-vocalization describes the case of l changing to a vowel.--&gt; of a consonant such as the [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}} or [[voiced palatal fricative]], e.g. Finnish [[illative case]], or even an approximant, as the English 'r'. A historically-important example is the [[laryngeal theory]], which states that long vowels in the [[Indo-European languages]] were formed from short vowels, followed by any one of the several "laryngeal" sounds of [[Proto-Indo-European]] (conventionally written h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). When a laryngeal sound followed a vowel, it was later lost in most Indo-European languages, and the preceding vowel became long. However, Proto-Indo-European had long vowels of other origins as well, usually as the result of older sound changes, such as [[Szemerényi's law]] and [[Stang's law]].

Vowel length may also have arisen as an [[allophony|allophonic]] quality of a single vowel phoneme, which may have then become split in two phonemes. For example, the Australian English phoneme {{IPA|/æː/}} was created by the incomplete application of a rule extending {{IPA|/æ/}} before certain voiced consonants, a phenomenon known as the [[Phonological history of English short A#Bad–lad split|bad–lad split]]. An alternative pathway to the phonemicization of allophonic vowel length is the shift of a vowel of a formerly-different quality to become the short counterpart of a vowel pair. That too is exemplified by Australian English, whose contrast between {{IPA|/a/}} (as in ''duck'') and {{IPA|/aː/}} (as in ''dark'') was brought about by a [[open vowel|lowering]] of the earlier {{IPA|/ʌ/}}.

[[Estonian language|Estonian]], a [[Finnic language]], has a rare{{citation needed|date=December 2014|reason=Is the rare thing really supposed to be length phonemicization by loss of allophony trigger; and not the shift from a two-length system into a three-length one?}} phenomenon in which allophonic length variation has become phonemic after the deletion of the suffixes causing the allophony. Estonian had already inherited two vowel lengths from [[Proto-Finnic language|Proto-Finnic]], but a third one was then introduced. For example, the Finnic imperative marker *''-k'' caused the preceding vowels to be articulated shorter. After the deletion of the marker, the allophonic length became phonemic, as shown in the example above.

==Notations in the Latin alphabet==

===IPA===
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] the sign {{IPA|ː}} (not a colon, but two triangles facing each other in an [[hourglass shape]]; Unicode {{code|U+02D0}}) is used for both vowel and consonant length. This may be doubled for an extra-long sound, or the top half ({{IPA|ˑ}}) used to indicate a sound is "half long". A [[breve]] is used to mark an [[extra-short]] vowel or consonant.

Estonian has a three-way [[phonemic contrast]]:
:''saada'' {{IPA|[saːːda]}} "to get" (overlong)
:''saada'' {{IPA|[saːda]}} "send!" (long)
:''sada'' {{IPA|[sada]}} "hundred" (short)

Although not phonemic, the distinction can also be illustrated in certain accents of English:
:''bead'' {{IPA|[biːd]}}
:''beat'' {{IPA|[biˑt]}}
:''bid'' {{IPA|[bɪˑd]}}
:''bit'' {{IPA|[bɪt]}}

===Diacritics===
* [[Macron (diacritic)|Macron]] (ā), used to indicate a long vowel in [[Maori language|Maori]], [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and many transcription schemes, including romanizations for [[Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the [[Hepburn romanization]] for [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Yale romanization of Korean|Yale]] for [[Korean language|Korean]]. While not part of their standard orthography, the macron is used as a teaching aid in modern [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] textbooks. Macron is also used in modern official [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] orthographies of some minority languages ([[Mansi language|Mansi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babel.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/media/downloads/grammar/NorthernMansi/Phonology/Northern-Mansi_Phonemes_unified.pdf|format=PDF|title=OB-UGRIC LANGUAGES: CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES, LEXICON, CONSTRUCTIONS, CATEGORIES TRANSLITERATION TABLES FOR NORTHERN MANSI : Counterparts of Cyrillic, FUT Counterparts of Cyrillic, FUT Cyrillic, FUT and IPA characters and IPA characters and IPA characters for Northern Mansi|website=Babel.gwi.uni-muenchen.de|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]], [[Evenki language|Evenki]]).
* [[Breve]]s (ă) are used to mark short vowels in several [[linguistics|linguistic]] transcription systems, as well as in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].
* [[Acute accent]] (á), used to indicate a long vowel in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], and pre-20th-century transcriptions of [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], etc.
* [[Circumflex]] (â), used for example in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The circumflex is occasionally used as a surrogate for the macrons, particularly in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] and in the [[Kunrei-shiki]] romanization of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or in transcriptions of [[Old High German]]. In transcriptions of [[Middle High German]], a system where inherited lengths are marked with the circumflex and new lengths with the macron is occasionally used.
* [[Grave accent]] (à) is used in [[Scottish Gaelic]].
* [[Ogonek]] (ą), used in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] to indicate long vowels.
* [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Trema]] (ä), used in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] to indicate long vowels.

===Additional letters===
* ''Vowel doubling'', used consistently in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]] and in closed syllables in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Example: Finnish ''tuuli'' {{IPA|/ˈtuːli/}} 'wind' vs. ''tuli'' {{IPA|/ˈtuli/}} 'fire'.
** Estonian also has a rare "overlong" vowel length but does not distinguish it from the normal long vowel in writing, as they are distinguishable by context; see the example below.
* ''Consonant doubling'' after short vowels is very common in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and other Germanic languages, including English. The system is somewhat inconsistent, especially in loanwords, around consonant clusters and with word-final nasal consonants. Examples:
: ''Consistent use:'' ''byta'' {{IPA|/²byːta/}} 'to change' vs ''bytta'' {{IPA|/²bʏtːa/}} 'tub' and ''koma'' {{IPA|/²koːma/}} 'coma' vs ''komma'' {{IPA|/²kɔmɑː/}} 'to come'
: ''Inconsistent use:'' ''fält'' {{IPA|/ˈfɛlt/}} 'a field' and ''kam'' {{IPA|/ˈkamː/}} 'a comb' (but the verb 'to comb' is ''kamma'')
* Classical [[Milanese]] orthography uses consonant doubling in closed short syllables, e.g., ''lenguagg'' 'language' and ''pubblegh'' 'public'.&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:s:Autore:Carlo Porta|Carlo Porta]] on the Italian [[Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ie'' is used to mark the long {{IPA|/iː/}} sound in [[German language|German]] because of to the preservation and the generalization of a historic ''ie'' spelling, which originally represented the sound {{IPA|/iə̯/}}. In [[Low German]], a following ''e'' letter lengthens other vowels as well, e.g., in the name [[Bernkastel-Kues|Kues]] {{IPA|/kuːs/}}.
* A following ''h'' is frequently used in [[German language|German]] and older [[Swedish language|Swedish]] spelling, e.g., German ''Zahn'' {{IPA|[tsaːn]}} 'tooth'.
* In [[Czech language|Czech]], the additional letter ''ů'' is used for the long U sound, and the character is known as a [[kroužek]], e.g., ''kůň'' "horse". (It actually developed from the [[typographic ligature|ligature]] "uo", which noted the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/uo/}} until it shifted to {{IPA|/uː/}}.)

===Other signs===
* [[Apostrophe]], used in [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], as evidenced by the name itself. This is the convention of the Listuguj orthography (Mi'gmaq), and a common substitution for the official acute accent (Míkmaq) of the Francis-Smith orthography.
* [[Colon (punctuation)|Colon]], commonly used as an approximation of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] phonetic transcription, and in a few orthographies based on the IPA.
* [[Interpunct]], commonly used in non-IPA phonetic transcription, such as the [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] system developed by linguists for transcribing the indigenous languages of the Americas. Example: Americanist [tʰo·] = IPA {{IPA|[tʰoː]}}.

===No distinction===
Some languages make no distinction in writing. This is particularly the case with ancient languages such as [[Latin]] and [[Old English language|Old English]]. Modern edited texts often use macrons with long vowels, however. [[Australian English]] does not distinguish the vowels {{IPA|/æ/}} from {{IPA|/æː/}} in spelling, with words like ‘span’ or ‘can’ having different pronunciations depending on meaning.

==Notations in other writing systems==
In non-Latin writing systems, a variety of mechanisms have also evolved.
* In abjads derived from the [[Aramaic alphabet]], notably [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], long vowels are written with consonant letters (mostly [[approximant consonant]] letters) in a process called ''[[mater lectionis]] e.g.'' in Modern Arabic the long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}} is represented by the letter ''ا'' ([[Aleph|Alif]]), the vowels {{IPA|/uː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} are represented by ''و'' ([[Waw (letter)|wāw]]), and the vowels {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} are represented by ''ي'' ([[Yodh|yāʼ]]), while short vowels are typically omitted entirely. Most of these scripts also have optional diacritics that can be used to mark short vowels when needed.
* In [[South-Asian]] [[abugida]]s, such as [[Devanagari]] or the [[Thai alphabet]], there are different vowel signs for short and long vowels.
* [[Ancient Greek]] also had distinct vowel signs, but only for some long vowels; the vowel letters ''η'' ([[eta]]) and ''ω'' ([[omega]]) originally represented long forms of the vowels represented by the letters ''ε'' ([[epsilon]], literally "bare ''e''") and ''ο'' ([[omicron]] – literally "small ''o''", by contrast with ''omega'' or "large ''o''"). The other vowel letters of Ancient Greek, ''α'' ([[alpha]]), ''ι'' ([[iota]]) and ''υ'' ([[upsilon]]), could represent either short or long vowel phones.
* In the Japanese [[hiragana]] syllabary, long vowels are usually indicated by adding a vowel character after. For vowels {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, and {{IPA|/uː/}}, the corresponding independent vowel is added. Thus: {{lang|ja|あ}} (a), {{lang|ja|おかあさん}}, "okaasan", mother; {{lang|ja|い}} (i), にいがた "Niigata", city in northern Japan (usually {{lang|ja|新潟}}, in [[kanji]]); {{lang|ja|う}} (u), {{lang|ja|りゅう}} "ryuu" (usu. {{lang|ja|竜}}), dragon. The mid-vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} may be written with {{lang|ja|え}} (e) (rare) ({{lang|ja|ねえさん}} ({{lang|ja|姉さん}}), neesan, "elder sister") and {{lang|ja|お}} (o) [{{lang|ja|おおきい}} (usu {{lang|ja|大きい}}), ookii, big], or with {{lang|ja|い}} (i) ({{lang|ja|めいれい}} ({{lang|ja|命令}}), "meirei", command/order) and {{lang|ja|う}} (u) ({{lang|ja|おうさま}} ({{lang|ja|王様}}), ousama, "king") depending on etymological, morphological, and historic grounds.
** Most long vowels in the [[katakana]] syllabary are written with a special bar symbol {{lang|ja|ー}} (vertical in [[tategaki|vertical writing]]), called a [[chōon]], as in {{lang|ja|メーカー}} ''mēkā'' "maker" instead of {{lang|ja|メカ}} ''meka'' "[[mecha]]". However, some long vowels are written with additional vowel characters, as with hiragana, with the distinction being orthographically significant.
* In the [[Korean language|Korean]] [[Hangul]] alphabet, vowel length is not distinguished in normal writing. Some dictionaries use a double dot, {{angle bracket|:}}, for example {{lang|ko|무:}} “[[Daikon|Daikon radish]]”.
* In the Classic [[Maya script]], also based on syllabic characters, long vowels in monosyllabic roots were generally written with word-final syllabic signs ending in the vowel -''i'' rather than an echo-vowel. Hence, ''chaach'' "basket", with a long vowel, was written as ''cha-chi'' (compare ''chan'' "sky", with a short vowel, written as ''cha-na''). If the nucleus of the syllable was itself ''i'', however, the word-final vowel for indicating length was -''a'': ''tziik''- "to count; to honour, to sanctify" was written as ''tzi-ka'' (compare ''sitz' ''"appetite", written as ''si-tz'i'').
