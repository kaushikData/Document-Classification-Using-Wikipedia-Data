{{italic title}}
'''''A Bronx Tale''''' is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[one-man show]] written and performed by [[Chazz Palminteri]]. It tells the [[coming-of-age story]] of Calogero Anello, a young [[New York City|New Yorker]] torn between the temptations of organised crime and the values of his hardworking father. It originally premiered in [[Los Angeles]] in the 1980s, before moving [[Off-Broadway]]. After a [[A Bronx Tale|film version]] involving Palminteri and [[Robert DeNiro]] was released in 1993, in 2007 Palminteri performed his one-man show on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and on tour.

A musical version, ''[[A Bronx Tale (musical)|A Bronx Tale]]'' directed by [[Robert DeNiro]] remained onstage into 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kort|first=Alicia|date=January 2, 2017|title=Review: A Bronx Tale: A New Musical |publisher=[[Paste Magazine]] |publication-place= |page= |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/review-a-bronx-tale.html |accessdate=September 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Longacre Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=|first=|year=2017|title=Tickets |publisher=abronxtalethemusicial.com |publication-place= |page= |url=https://abronxtalethemusical.com/#tickets |accessdate= September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''A Bronx Tale'' tells the story of Calogero Anello, a young boy from a [[working class]] family who gets involved in the world of [[organized crime]]. Calogero's father is a bus driver who tries to instill working-class family values in his son. As Calogero gets older, the aura and mystique of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], and the charms of Sonny, the local [[mob boss]] who befriends Calogero (and ends up becoming a father figure to him), become difficult to resist. As Calogero comes of age, he must struggle with the choice of following his beloved father's values or submitting to the temptations of the life of organized crime.

==Background and productions==
Palminteri states that he began writing the play after being fired from a club when, as a doorman, he refused entry to [[talent agent|super agent]] [[Swifty Lazar]].&lt;ref&gt;"Broadway Names with Julie James," ''On Broadway,'' SiriusXM, 11 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=sanfran&gt;Winn, Steven. [http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Palminteri-revisits-A-Bronx-Tale-3193917.php "Palminteri revisits 'A Bronx Tale'"] sfgate.com, September 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Bronx Tale'' premiered in Los Angeles, achieving great critical success. Palminteri relates that "After some polishing, the show opened to positive reviews and soon attracted Hollywood interest. 'Every director, every studio head wanted to make the movie,' Palminteri said. 'They offered, $250,000, $500,000.'"&lt;ref name=sanfran/&gt; Palminteri then appeared in the play [[Off-Broadway]] at Playhouse 91, from October 10, 1989, to December 24, 1989, directed by Mark X. Travis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lortel.org/Archives/Production/1416 ''A Bronx Tale''] lortel.org, accessed January 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The play had a sold-out run and Palminteri received a 1989–1990 Special Award from the [[Outer Critics Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://outercritics.org/award-results/awards-for-1989-1990/ "1989–1990 Awards"] outercritics.org, accessed January 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vault/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northshorecenter.org/event/chazz-palminteri-in-a-bronx-tale/ "Press Release-Chazz Palmienteri In 'A Bronx Tale'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202214815/http://www.northshorecenter.org/event/chazz-palminteri-in-a-bronx-tale/ |date=February 2, 2016 }} northshorecenter.org, accessed January 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academy Award]] winning actor [[Robert De Niro]] attended a performance of ''A Bronx Tale'' and offered to buy the film rights to the show. Palminteri agreed to sell the film rights on the conditions that he would be able to write the screenplay and that he be cast as the role of Sonny. The film version of ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' premiered in 1993. The film version marked the directorial debut of De Niro and helped catapult Palminteri's film acting career.

===2007 Broadway ===
In 2007, Palminteri performed his one-man show on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The Broadway production began previews on October 4, 2007, and premiered on October 25, 2007, at the [[Walter Kerr Theatre]]. The show closed on February 24, 2008, after 108 performances and nineteen previews.&lt;ref name=vault&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/25003/Chazz-Palminteri "Chazz Palminteri Broadway"] playbillvault.com, accessed January 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]] and Produced by Go Productions with Trent Othick being the lead producer, &lt;ref name=times&gt;Isherwood, Charles.

[[File:Blurbing.jpg|thumb|The original blurb]]

A '''blurb''' is a short [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] piece accompanying a creative work. It may be written by the author or publisher or quote praise from others. Blurbs were originally printed on the back or rear dust-jacket of a book, and are now found on home video cases, [[web portal]]s, and [[news website]]s. A blurb may introduce a newspaper or magazine feature story.

== History==
[[File: Gelett Burgess.jpg|thumb|Gelett Burgess circa 1910]]
In the US, the history of the blurb is said to begin with [[Walt Whitman]]'s collection, ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''. In response to the publication of the first edition in 1855, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] had sent Whitman a congratulatory letter, including the phrase "I greet you at the beginning of a great career": the following year, Whitman had these words stamped in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/27/429723002/forget-the-book-have-you-read-this-irresistible-story-on-blurbs|title=The Curious Case Of The Book Blurb (And Why It Exists)|last=Dwyer|first=Colin|date=27 September 2015|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''blurb'' was coined in 1907 by American humorist [[Gelett Burgess]] (1866–1951).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 132. {{ISBN|0521401798}}&lt;/ref&gt; His short 1906 book ''Are You a Bromide?'' was presented in a limited edition to an annual trade association dinner. The custom at such events was to have a [[dust jacket]] promoting the work and with, as Burgess' publisher [[B. W. Huebsch]] described it, "the picture of a damsel—languishing, heroic, or coquettish—anyhow, a damsel on the jacket of every novel".

In this case, the jacket proclaimed "YES, this is a 'BLURB'!" and the picture was of a (fictitious) young woman "Miss Belinda Blurb" shown calling out, described as "in the act of blurbing." The name and term stuck for any publisher's contents on a book's back cover, even after the picture was dropped and only the text remained.

In Germany, the blurb is regarded to have been invented by [[Karl Robert Langewiesche]] around 1902. In German bibliographic usage, it is usually located on the second page of the book underneath the [[half title]], or on the dust cover.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Books==
A blurb on a book can be any combination of quotes from the work, the author, the publisher, reviewers or fans, a summary of the plot, a biography of the author or simply claims about the importance of the work.

In the 1980s, ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' ran a regular feature called "[[Logrolling]] in Our Time" which exposed writers who wrote blurbs for one another's books.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2006/more/reviews/spy-the-funny-years-1200511592/ | title=Spy: The Funny Years | publisher=Variety | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blurb requests===

Prominent writers can receive large volumes of blurb requests from aspiring authors.  This has led some writers to turn down such requests as a matter of policy.  For example, [[Gary Shteyngart]] announced in ''The New Yorker'' that he would no longer write blurbs, except for certain writers with whom he had a professional or personal connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/an-open-letter-from-gary-shteyngart]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neil Gaiman]] reports that "Every now and again, I stop doing blurbs.... The hiatus lasts for a year or two, and then I feel guilty or someone asks me at the right time, and I relent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2001/04/american-gods-blog-post-36.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob M. Appel]] reports that he received fifteen to twenty blurb requests per week and tackles "as many as I can."&lt;ref&gt;Writers's Voice, Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody blurbs===

Many humorous books and films parody blurbs that deliver exaggerated praise by unlikely people and [[Backhanded compliment|insults disguised as praise]].
* ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' – "Makes Ben Hur look like an Epic"
* ''[[1066 and All That]]'' – "We look forward keenly to the appearance of their last work"

The ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' satire of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', entitled ''[[Bored of the Rings]]'', deliberately used phony blurbs by deceased authors on the inside cover. One of the blurbs stated "One of the two or three books ...", and nothing else.

==Film==

Movie blurbs are part of the [[film promotion|promotional campaign]] for films, and usually consist of positive, colorful extracts from published reviews.

Movie blurbs have often been faulted for [[Fallacy of quoting out of context|taking words out of context]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner, L. (1996). "Why Movie Blurbs Avoid Newspapers." ''Editor &amp; Publisher: The Fourth Estate, 129,'' 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/the_best_worst_blurbs_of_2007.php |author=Bialik, Carl |authorlink=Carl Bialik |date=January 6, 2008|title=The Best Worst Blurbs of 2007: The 10 most egregious misquotes, blurb whores, and other movie-ad sins of 2007 |work=Gelf Magazine |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2010/03/good-blurbs-from-bad-reviews-repo-men-the-bounty-hunter-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid |author=Sancton, Julian |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Good Blurbs from Bad Reviews: ''Repo Men'', ''The Bounty Hunter'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGlone, Matthew S. (2005). "Contextomy: The Art of Quoting Out of Context." ''Media Culture, &amp; Society,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 511-522.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "the blurbing game is also evolving as newspaper film critics disappear and studios become more comfortable quoting Internet bloggers and movie Web sites in their ads, a practice that still leaves plenty of potential for filmgoers to be bamboozled. Luckily for consumers, there is a cavalry: blurb watchdog sites have sprung up and the number of Web sites that aggregate reviews by established critics is steadily climbing. ... Helping to keep studios in line these days are watchdog sites like eFilmCritic.com and The Blurbs, a Web column for ''Gelf'' magazine written by Carl Bialik of ''The Wall Street Journal''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Brooks |title=Hollywood's Blurb Search Reaches the Blogosphere |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 6, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/weekinreview/07barnes.html |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote in an "Explainer" column: "How much latitude do movie studios have in writing blurbs? A fair amount. There's no official check on running a misleading movie blurb, aside from the usual laws against false advertising. Studios do have to submit advertising materials like newspaper ads and trailers to the Motion Picture Association of America for approval. But the MPAA reviews the ads for their tone and content, not for the accuracy of their citations. ... As a courtesy, studios will often run the new, condensed quote by the critic before sending it to print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/11/best_film_ever.html |author=Beam, Chris |authorlink=Chris Beam |date=Nov 25, 2009 |title='(Best) Film Ever!!!' How Do Movie Blurbs Work? |work=Slate |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of blurb used in marketing a film being traceable directly back to the film's marketing team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Name and etymology ==
The etymology of the name ''Brno'' is disputed. It might be derived from the [[History of the Czech language|Old Czech]] ''brnie'' 'muddy, swampy.'&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow, 1998), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative derivations are from a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] verb ''brniti'' (to armour or to fortify) or a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken in the area before it was overrun by [[Germanic peoples]] and later [[Slavic peoples]] (this theory would make it [[cognate]] with other Celtic words for hill, such as the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] word ''bryn'').

Throughout its history, Brno's locals also referred to the town in other languages, including ''Brünn'' in German, ברין (''Brin'') in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and ''Bruna'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]. The city was also referred to as '''Brunn''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ʌ|n}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =What does Brunn mean? |url= http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/brunn.htm |publisher =AudioEnglish.org |accessdate= 2015-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in English, but this usage is not common today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= WordNet Search |url= http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;s=Brno |publisher= WordNet |accessdate= 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the [[House of Přemyslid]],&lt;ref name="brnohist"/&gt; and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with [[Olomouc]] and [[Znojmo]]. Brno was first mentioned in [[Cosmas of Prague|Cosmas']] ''Chronica Boëmorum'' dated to year 1091, when Bohemian king [[Vratislav II]] besieged his brother [[Conrad I, Duke of Bohemia|Conrad]] at Brno castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Čapka|first=František|title=Morava|series=Stručná historie států|year=2003|publisher=Libri|location=Praha|language=Czech|isbn=80-7277-186-8|page=30|chapter=Ota Olomoucký a Konrád Brněnský}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Znak Moravského markrabství.png|thumb|left|upright|120px|Coat of arms of the margraviate]]
In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each one of them had its own ruler, coming from the [[Přemyslids]] dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinated only to the [[Bohemian]] ruler in Prague. Seats of these rulers and thus "capitals" of these territories were castles and towns of Brno, [[Olomouc]], and [[Znojmo]]. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the [[Margraviate of Moravia]]. Since then, until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was therefore "evenly" divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet (cz: ''Moravský Zemský sněm''), the Moravian Land Tables (cz: ''Moravské Zemské desky''), and the Moravian Land Court (cz: ''Moravský Zemský soud'') were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia),&lt;ref name="spilberkhist"/&gt; and later its geographical position closer to [[Vienna]] also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc was larger than Brno by population, and it was the seat of the only [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] in Moravia.

[[File:Veduta z obléhání Brna Švédy v roce 1645.jpg|thumb|Unsuccessful Swedish siege in 1645.]]

In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges{{clarify|date=December 2013}} by the King, and thus it was recognized as a royal city. In 1324 Queen [[Elisabeth Richeza of Poland]] founded the current [[Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady (Brno)|Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady]] which is now her final resting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opatbrno.cz/opat_hist_en.htm|title=Opatství svatého Tomáše na Starém Brně|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc.&lt;ref name="brnohist"/&gt; These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century the Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia (Moravian rulers); one of them was elected the [[King of the Romans]]. In the 15th century Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the [[Hussite]]s during the [[Hussite Wars]]. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.

In 1641, in the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] commanded permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's [[Collegium Nordicum]] made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.&lt;ref name="Garstein"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rome and the Counter-Reformation in Scandinavia: The age of Gustavus Adolphus and Queen Christina of Sweden, 1622–1656| first=Oskar|last=Garstein| publisher=BRILL|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish army which then stayed there for 8 years.{{refn|This led to decline in population of Olomouc from over 30,000 people to mere 1,675 and total devastation of the city.|group="note"}} Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which under the leadership of [[Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches]] managed to defend itself from the Swedes under General [[Lennart Torstenson]], served as the sole capital of the state (Margraviate of Moravia). After the end of the Thirty Years' War (1648), Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.{{refn|However, Olomouc also had legal status of capital city, although this title was purely a honorary matter rather than a real role, sometimes it was referred to as "the Secondary Capital"&lt;!-- CZ: "druhé hlavní město" --&gt;.|group="note"}} Today, the [[Moravian Land Tables]] are stored in the [[Moravian Regional Archive]], and they are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/moravske-desky-zemske.aspx|title=Moravské desky zemské|publisher=Ministerstvo vnitra České republiky|accessdate=3 October 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque [[citadel]].&lt;ref name="spilberkhist"/&gt; In the 18th century Brno was besieged by [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1742 under the leadership of [[Frederick the Great]], the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the bishopric of Brno was established; [[Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske]] was the first Bishop.&lt;ref name="brnohist"/&gt;{{refn|The cathedral of the bishopric of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brno]], the [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul]], is depicted on the 10[[CZK]] coin.|group="note"}}

===19th century===
In December 1805 the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the "Battle of the Three Emperors". Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] spent several nights here at that time and again in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brno.cz/turista-volny-cas/historie-mesta/historie-v-datech/|title=Brno – Historie v datech|accessdate=28 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMBC6H_Napoleon_I_in_Moravias_capital_in_1809_Brno_Czech_Republic|title=Napoleon I. in Moravia's capital in 1809, Brno, Czech Republic - La Famille Bonaparte on Waymarking.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna, this was the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="thefirsttrain"/&gt; In the years 1859-1864 the city fortification was almost completely removed. In 1869 a [[horsecar]] service started to operate in Brno, it was the first tram service in what would later become the Czech republic.&lt;ref name="dpmbhistory"/&gt;

[[Gregor Mendel]] conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at [[St. Thomas's Abbey, Brno|St. Thomas's Abbey]] in Brno in the 1850s.

Around 1900 Brno, which until 1918 consisted in administrative terms only of the central city area, had a predominantly German-speaking population (63%), as opposed to the suburbs, which were predominantly Czech-speaking.&lt;ref name="Bruna"&gt;[http://www.bruenn.eu/de/de_u_cr1.html bruenn.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Life in Brünn/Brno was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German "Brünnerisch" was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages.&lt;ref name="Bruna"/&gt;

In 1919, after [[World War I]], two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno ({{lang-cs|Velké Brno}}). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000&lt;ref name="Hahn"/&gt; by addition of the Slavic communities of the city's neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city's better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city's cultural life.&lt;ref name="Hahn"&gt;[[Eva Hahn]], [[Hans Henning Hahn]]: ''Die Vertreibung im deutschen Erinnern.

In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (Czech: ''země Moravská''); before that it was the capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: ''země Moravskoslezská'').

In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens.&lt;ref name="Hahn"/&gt;

During the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945 all Czech universities including those of Brno were closed by the Nazis. The [[Masaryk University|Faculty of Law]] became the headquarters of the [[Gestapo]], and the university dormitory was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308040948/http://www.zasvobodu.cz/clanek.php?c=101 |title=Kounicovi koleje v Brně |url=http://www.zasvobodu.cz/clanek.php?c=101 |work=zasvobodu.cz |archivedate=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2014-01-30 |author=JUDr. František Vašek |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executions were public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moskyt.net/nase-sibenice-16-novodobe-veseni Leoš Drahota: Naše šibenice 16 - Novodobé věšení], {{ISSN|1213-6905}} "Exekuce v Kounicových kolejích byly veřejné, ale vstup byl možný, podobně jako v případě nějaké kulturní či sportovní akce, jen s platnou vstupenkou, prodávanou za tři marky."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=It seems like a user-generated site based on original research by enthusiasts|date=March 2016}}

Between 1941 and 1942, [[Holocaust train|transport]]s from Brno deported 10,081 Jews to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt (Terezín) concentration camp]]. At least another 960 people, mostly of [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed race]], followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], [[Minsk Ghetto]], [[Rejowiec, Lublin Voivodeship|Rejowiec]] and other [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghetto]]s and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s. Although Terezín was not an [[extermination camp]], 995 people transported from Brno died there.

As of, the lord mayor is Petr Vokřál. The executive body is the city council (cz: ''Rada města Brna'') and local councils of the city districts; the city council has 11 members including the lord mayor and his four deputies.

The city itself forms a separate district the [[Brno-City District]] (cz: ''Okres Brno-město'') surrounded by the [[Brno-Country District]] (cz: ''Okres Brno-venkov''), Brno is divided into 29 administrative divisions (city districts) and consists of 48 [[Cadastre|cadastral areas]]. This might sound confusing but there is a big difference between "a city district of Brno", "the Brno-City District" and "the Brno-Country District".

The city districts of Brno significantly varies in their size by both population and area. The most populated city district of Brno is the [[Brno-Centre]] which has over 91 thousand of residents and the less populated are [[Brno-Ořešín]] and [[Brno-Útěchov]] with about 500 residents. By its area the largest one is [[Brno-Bystrc]] with {{convert|27.24|km²}} and the smallest is [[Brno-Nový Lískovec]] with {{convert|1.66|km²}}.

Brno is the home to the highest courts in the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|Czech judiciary]].

Brno experienced the largest increase in population during the 19th century at the time of the industrial revolution. A slight decrease in population after 1989 was caused by [[suburbanisation]].

== Culture ==
[[File:Lisenske slavnosti vyrez.jpg|thumb|left|People wearing the traditional Moravian [[kroje]] (Moravian national folk costumes) at a "folk festival" in [[Brno-Líšeň|Líšeň]].]]

The city spends about 30 million euro every year on culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brno.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/sprava_mesta/magistrat_mesta_brna/ORF/SR2011/Vydaje.xls|title=Schválený rozpočet provozních a kapitálových výdajů - Rekapitulace dle oddílů a paragrafů|accessdate=28 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brno.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/sprava_mesta/magistrat_mesta_brna/ORF/Souhrnny_rozpocet_2010/Rozpocet_2010.xls|title=Souhrnný rozpočet statutárního města Brna na rok 2010 - Rozpočet výdajů statutárního města Brna|accessdate=28 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many museums, theatres and other cultural institutions. Brno is also a vibrant university city with about 90,000 students, and a number of festivals and other cultural events.

Since the 1990s Brno has experienced a great cultural "rebirth": façades of historical monuments are being repaired and various exhibitions, shows, etc., are being established or extended. In 2007 a summit of 15 presidents of the EU Member States was held in Brno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moraviaconvention.cz/reference/ |title=Reference – Moravia Convention Bureau|accessdate=26 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its urban character, some of the city districts still preserve traditional Moravian folklore, including folk festivals with traditional Moravian costumes (cz: ''kroje''), Moravian wines, folk music and dances. Unlike smaller municipalities, in Brno the traditional folk festivals are held locally by city districts: among the city districts where annual traditional Moravian festivals takes place are [[Brno-Židenice|Židenice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalendarakci.atlasceska.cz/zidenicke-hody-brno-zidenice-7165/|title=Židenické hody - Brno Židenice - www.kalendarakci.atlasceska.cz|accessdate=26 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brno-Líšeň|Líšeň]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlisni.cz/lisenske-hody|title=Líšeňské hody – portál vlisni.cz|accessdate=26 September 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Brno-Ivanovice|Ivanovice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivanovice.brno.cz/clanky/20070926-ci-jsou-hody-nase/|title=ČÍ JSOU HODY?

The city has the third largest historic preservation zone in the Czech Republic, the largest one being that of the Czech capital [[Prague]]. However, there is a considerable difference in the size of historical preservation zones of both cities. While Brno has 484 legally protected sites, Prague has as many as 1,330.&lt;ref name="npusearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monumnet.npu.cz/chruzemi/hledani.php|title=Národní památkový ústav: Světové dědictví, NKP, chráněná území|accessdate=21 September 2011|publisher=The National Institute for the Protection and Conservation of Monuments and Sites of the Czech Republic|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Špilberk Castle, originally a royal castle founded in the 13th century, was from the 17th century a fortress and feared prison (e.g. [[Carbonari]]).

There are several legends connected with the City of Brno; one of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brnoinfo.com/old-town-hall/|title=Old Town Hall of Brno – Brno Tourist Informations|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that there was a terrible creature terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen such a beast before, so they called it a dragon. They trembled in fear of the dragon until a brave man decided to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the [[Old Town Hall (Brno)|Old Town Hall]]. Crocodile motifs are common in Brno. A "krokodýl" (crocodile in Czech language) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl.

Next to the "dragon" at the Old Town Hall the town's second well-known emblem is displayed. This is a wagon wheel made from a tree found and felled fifty miles away from the city. According to the story, a local man wagered to fell the tree, to make a wheel out of it, and to roll the wheel to the city of Brno, all this within a single day. Since the whole achievement was considered impossible by normal human means, the man was later believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and he died in poverty as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brno.cz/en/tourist-leisure/history/brno-tales/the-wheel-bet/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802001559/http://www.brno.cz/en/tourist-leisure/history/brno-tales/the-wheel-bet |archive-date=2 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a historic memento to victory over the Swedish army in 1645, the local Petrov Cathedral rings noon an hour earlier, at 11&amp;nbsp;o'clock because the locals and Swedish army were in stalemate and the Swedish general said he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon; the bell ringer tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early. Keeping his word, the general and his army left.{{sfn|Henig|2000|p=93}}

Road transport makes Brno an international crossroad of [[highway]]s. There are two [[motorway]]s on the southern edge of the city, D1 leading to [[Ostrava]] and to [[Prague]] and D2 leading to [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref name="highways"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roads and Motorways in the Czech Republic 2009|year=2009|publisher=The Czech Road and Motorway Directorate|url=http://www.rsd.cz/rsd/rsd.nsf/0/80345976071FCBACC12575CF004E133E/$file/RSD2009en.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195307/http://www.rsd.cz/rsd/rsd.nsf/0/80345976071FCBACC12575CF004E133E/$file/RSD2009en.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not far from the city limits there is also one [[Limited-access road|expressway]], [[R52 expressway (Czech Republic)|R52]], leading to [[Vienna]]; another expressway, [[R43 expressway (Czech Republic)|R43]], which will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia, is planned.&lt;ref name="highways"/&gt; The city is gradually building the large city [[ring road]] (road I/42), several road tunnels were built (Tunnels Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky and Královopolský) and more tunnels are planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mestsky-okruh-brno.cz/useky-vmo-brno|title=Velký městský okruh Brno (VMO Brno) – Úseky VMO Brno|publisher=Ředitelsví silnic a dálnic ČR|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, due to the congestion in private transport the city continues to strive to build more [[parking ramp]]s including underground ones, but this effort has not always been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brno.idnes.cz/s-firmou-ktera-mela-stavet-parkovaci-domy-brno-neprodlouzi-smlouvu-11a-/Brno-zpravy.aspx?c=A110209_1529279_brno-zpravy_dmk|title=S firmou, která měla stavět parkovací domy, Brno neprodlouží smlouvu|publisher=iDNES.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. One of them is a public international airport [[Brno-Tuřany Airport]]. The airport has seen a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the amount of served passengers has been since in decline with the only remaining scheduled flights being to [[London]] and [[Munich]]. As an attempt to reverse the situation, [[Brno-Tuřany Airport]] is to serve as the base for the Brno-based airline [[Blue Air Moravia]] a subsidiary of [[Blue Air]] that is set to begin operations in March 2018, with plans for scheduled service to [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Milan]], [[Lviv]] and [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://worldairlinenews.com/category/blue-air-moravia/|title=Blue Air to fly Paris CDG – Turin, establishes Blue Air Moravia in Brno|date=2018-01-01|website=worldairlinenews.com|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueairmoravia.cz|title=Blue Air Moravia|access-date=2018-01-18}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, [[Medlánky Airport]], is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying [[hot air balloon]]s, [[glider aircraft|gliders]] or aircraft [[RC model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akmedlanky.cz/|title=Aeroklub Brno Medlánky|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frc-er.cz/|title=Stránky medláneckých leteckých modelářů|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225100110/http://www.frc-er.cz/|archive-date=25 December 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://letistecr.cz/zajimavosti/circa-urbem-brunensis-2-netopyrky-za-kominem.aspx|title=Zajímavosti: Circa urbem Brunensis 2. – Netopýrky za Komínem|publisher=MAGAZÍN LETIŠTĚ ČESKÉ REPUBLIKY|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycling is widespread in Brno also due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 measured in total approximately {{convert|38|km}} and are gradually being expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brnonakole.cz/zmeny-mesta-v-roce-2010/|title=Brno na kole » Změny města v roce 2010|language=Czech|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is also one long [[bikeway]] leading to [[Vienna]], which is one of Brno's [[sister cities]], the track is approximately {{convert|130|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyklobrnowien.cz/cyklostezka/|title=O nás - Cyklostezka Brno Vídeň|language=Czech|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hiking trails of the Czech Tourist Club also pass through Brno.

The '''Cave of the Ramban''' is located in the southern cliff of the Upper [[Kidron Valley]], on a slope descending into the Arab neighborhood of [[Wadi al-Joz]], [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="KlonerYiśraʼel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|title=Survey of Jerusalem: the northeastern sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuMuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2001|publisher=Rashut ha-ʻatiḳot, ha-Agudah le-seḳer arkheʼologi shel Yiśraʼel|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some to be the traditional burial place of [[Nahmanides]] (also known as Ramban), a foremost rabbinical scholar during the medieval era.

==Burial chamber==
The large [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-hewn cave]], measuring 19 by 20 m, reaches a height of 3.5 meters and is supported by two columns. The area once functioned as an ancient underground [[Jerusalem stone|stone]] quarry. Above the façade, in the upper portion of the cliff, are the remains of a square rock-cut chamber which may have been used for burials.&lt;ref name="KlonerZissu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amos Kloner|author2=Boaz Zissu|title=The Necropolis of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeQuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2007|publisher=Peeters|isbn=978-90-429-1792-7|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The cave is believed by some Jews to be the site where Ramban prayed in the 13th-century and the place of his interment. It is thus claimed to have been a holy site for Jews for many centuries.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Guinn|title=Protecting Jerusalem's holy sites: a strategy for negotiating a sacred peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9TX_Cs1ndgC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86662-0|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vilnay2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zev Vilnay|title=Legends of Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkA6-0-aDdIC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=6 November 2010|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4128-5|pages=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the cave became a subject of controversy between a group of Jewish inhabitants in Wadi al-Joz and the Muslim owner of the site, who had fenced off the cave in protest to Jewish settlement in the area.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; The National Authority for Holy Sites convinced the [[Ministry of Religious Services|Ministry of Religious Affairs]] of its religious significance and the cave was declared a holy site and handed over to the ministry’s control.&lt;ref name=YW&gt;[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=27465 Court: Ramban’s Cave Belongs to the Muslim Waqf], ''theyeshivaworld.com'', December 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|wakf]]'' subsequently petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] which resulted in a temporary injunction freezing the site's designation. In 2003, a government committee was appointed to examine the issue.&lt;ref name="Guinn2006"/&gt; While acknowledging the site's connection to the Jewish faith, it was decided that the court could rule on the matter. This however was thwarted when the holy status was reinstated by a government minister.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt; The ''wakf'' persisted in its battle for control of the site in the courts and in 2008 it was decided that the cave be placed under the ''wakfs'' authority and Jews were banned from entering.&lt;ref name=YW/&gt;

Other traditions hold that Ramban was buried in [[Silwan]], in [[Hebron]] or in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref name="MaʻozNusseibeh2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Moshe Maʻoz|author2=Sari Nusseibeh|title=Jerusalem: points of friction, and beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9evpVS_ackwC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=3 November 2010|year=2000|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-411-8843-4|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4963">'''Central Asian studies''' is the discipline of studying the [[culture]], [[history]], and [[languages]] of [[Central Asia]]. The roots of Central Asian studies as a social science discipline goes to 19th century Anglo-Russian [[Great Game]]. During the 19th century, Central Asia became a subject of systematical information collection and organization thanks to the numerous travels made by British and Russian agents, soldiers, scholars into the region. The British [[Royal Geographical Society]] and [[Russian Geographical Society]] published dozens of travel books on the region.
[[Image:Map of Central Asia.png|260px|thumb|Central Asian Countries]]
Contemporary Central Asian studies have been developed by pioneers such as [[Nicholas Poppe]], [[Denis Sinor]],  [[Ilse Laude-Cirtautas]], [[Alexandre Bennigsen]], [[Edward A. Allworth|Edward Allworth]], [[Yuri Bregel]] and [[Hasan Bulent Paksoy]] among others. Several American research universities have programs on Central Asia. The [[Mongolian and Altaic Studies Program]] within the [[Far Eastern and Russian Institute]] at the [[University of Washington]] (UW), established under Poppe's direction in 1949, became an early prototype of Central Asian Studies. [[The Central Asian Studies Program]], later formed by Cirtautas in 1968 at the UW, and the [[Department of Central Eurasian Studies (Indiana University)|Department of Central Eurasian Studies]] at [[Indiana University]] have been the leading research and teaching programs. Many scholars involved in Central Asia studies belong to the [[Central Eurasian Studies Society]].

==Travelogues of Central Asia==
One of the oldest sources for Central Asia are the memoirs of travelers who passed through Central Asia. Some of the earliest extant examples were left by [[Arab geographers]] who passed through the region. In the 19th centuries numerous [[Europe]]an and [[United States of America|American]] published their travelogues of Central Asia. This includes American journalist [[Anna Louise Strong]] who passed through [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the 1920s.

==List of Central Asian Studies Journals==

*''[[Central Asia Monitor]]'', was in publication from 1992 to 2002. Its editor-in-chief was [[Valery Chalidze]] and the primary editor was [[David Nalle]].
*''[[Central Asian Review]]'', was published from 1953-1968 through the [[Central Asian Research Centre]] in association with [[St. Antony's College]], [[Oxford University]]. The editor was [[Geoffrey Wheeler (historian)|Geoffrey Wheeler]]. In 1968 Wheeler left the Central Asian Research Center and the following year “Central Asian Review” was incorporated into the journal ''Mizan'', published by the center from 1965-1971.&lt;ref name=opc4&gt;{{

[[File:Louis-Nicolas Clerambault.jpg|thumb|French composer [[Louis-Nicolas Clérambault]] composing at the keyboard]]
A '''composer''' ([[Latin]] [[wikt:compono|''compōnō'']]; literally "one who puts together") is a [[musician]] who is an [[author]] of [[music]] in any form, including [[vocal music]] (for a [[Singing|singer]] or [[choir]]), [[instrumental music]], [[electronic music]], and music which combines multiple forms. A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].

Many composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.

==Composers and performers==
Since [[musical notation]] only incompletely expresses a piece of music, there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert. Even in a classical piece of instrumental music in which all of the melodies, chords, and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a good degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work by varying her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.

A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]].

Music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom diminished in later eras, reflected in the increased use by composers of detailed notation, including marks of expression telling the performer more precisely how the work should be executed. A culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.

The [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a "cover" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness highly valued (with the possible exception of "note-for-note" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).

In Classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

==History==
The level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.

[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]
The term "composer" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].

===Ancient Greece===
Music was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written around 200 BC to around AD 100 {{sfn|Landels|1999|loc=252}} is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Aydın]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310–1320]]
During the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.&lt;!--?--&gt; The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].

===Renaissance===

[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''Allegory of Music'', by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]
During the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

===Baroque===

During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (1600 to 1750), composers expanded the range and complexity of the music they were writing. The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D.|publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu|accessdate=27 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[François Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].

Composers of music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical Period]] (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.

Composers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Roger. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 "Incidental music"], Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 August 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.

===20th- and 21st-century music===
[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]
In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.

==Role of women==
{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
In 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993" /&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=; 11:04 AM &amp;bull; by Abbey Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="rvanews.com" /&gt;

Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|title=WQXR – New York's Classical Music Radio Station|website=WQXR|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clustering==
Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history. Based on over 12,000 prominent composers listed in ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' and using [[word count]] measurement techniques, the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris has been the main hub for classical music in all periods. It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Training==
Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.

===Undergraduate===
Bachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.

===Masters===
Master of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.

===Doctoral===
To become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].

Doctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.

Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.

===Other routes===
Some classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.

==Employment==
During the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
''Death by a Thousand Cuts'' investigates the use of [[slow slicing]] or ''lingchi'', a form of torture and capital punishment practised in mid- and late-Imperial China from the tenth century until its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="HarvardBlurb"/&gt; ''Lingchi'' involved repeatedly slicing the [[convict]]'s flesh beyond the point of death.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"&gt;{{cite web

By the time of the final imperial dynasty, the punishment could be meted out for an offence as simple as striking a teacher.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

The authors argue that this was more than a physical punishment, as the victim was [[Sedative|sedated]] with [[opium]] and killed early in the process, but about denying the victim "somatic integrity"&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SomaticIntegrity"&gt;Somatic integrity: the vital capacity to be whole as an organism, which would be denied if the body were cut into pieces.&lt;/ref&gt; and denying them any hope of a [[Afterlife|life after death]] which, the authors argue, caused them to feel [[shame]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

==Reception==
A staff reviewer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' describes the book as a "fascinating study".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

A staff reviewer at ''[[The Times]]'' states that "the authors present a nuanced picture of state-imposed execution and, without at any time condoning, succeed in their goal of contextualising ''lingchi'' in relation to Western forms of punishment" and that "this challenging and important work will appeal not solely to [[Sinology|Sinologists]],&lt;ref name="Sinology"&gt;Sinology: the study of China  and things related to China.&lt;/ref&gt; but to [[Legal history|legal historians]] and students of visual representation."&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

Jonathan Mirsky in ''[[Literary Review]]'' writes that "[the authors] write coolly and formally, but this is a book primarily about torment."&lt;ref name="LiteraryReview"&gt;{{cite web

Ninety percent of the [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] population identifies as being primarily of [[Africa]]n ancestry. About two-thirds of the population lives on [[New Providence Island]] (the location of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]), and about half of the remaining one-third lives on [[Grand Bahama]] (the location of Freeport).

The islands were sparsely settled and a haven for pirates until the late 18th century, when thousands of British Loyalists were given compensatory land grants following the American Revolution. Many new settlers were from the Southern United States and brought slaves with them to cultivate plantations. At the turn of the 20th century, the total population was 53,000.

School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16. There are 158 public schools and 52 private schools in the Bahamas catering to more than 66,000 students. The [[College of the Bahamas]], established in Nassau in 1974, provides programmes leading to [[associate's degree]]s and [[bachelor's degree]]s; the college is now converting from a [[Two-year college|two-year]] to a four-year institution.

A '''dog writer''' is someone who writes about [[dog]]s, for example in reporting on [[Conformation show|dog show]]s; or in writing articles about [[dog care]] or [[Dog training|training]] or [[List of dog breeds|breed]] features for publications about dogs; or in writing dog- or pet-care columns or 'human' interest articles about dogs for general publications.

In 1935 the term was apparently first used when the [[Dog Writers Association of America|Dog Writers Association]] was established. They state 'Some 70 years ago, there was no such thing as a dog writer. There were newsmen and newswomen and magazine writers. Most of the papers assigned [[sportswriter]]s, [[reporter]]s, and even [[copyboy]]s, to cover dog shows. Still, these were the ones who made the dog world an indelible part of our [[popular culture]] by writing about dogs on the sports pages of most papers.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwaa.org Dog Writers Association of America website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born and raised in New York City to a family that underscored the importance of education, hard work, modesty, and social responsibility, Sperling developed a political and social awareness from a very young age.
Attending [[Queens College]] in the early 1970s at the height of the [[counterculture movement]] only served to kindle in him a youthful idealism that was never extinguished. While in college, Sperling traveled widely. An overland journey from [[Istanbul]] to [[Delhi]] with stops in the fabled cities of [[Erzurum]], Tabriz, Tehran, and [[Herat]] fueled his passion for the study of faraway lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfhb.org/news/interchange-elliot-sperling-central-eurasian-studies/|title=Interchange – Elliot Sperling – Central Eurasian Studies – WFHB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short sojourn in India developed into a love affair
with that country and culture; Sperling would revisit [[India]] numerous times later (including as a Fulbright fellow). Upon his return from Delhi, having encountered for the first time Tibetans in exile, Sperling changed his major to East Asian studies.

Equipped with knowledge of Chinese made stronger by an overseas study of the language in Taiwan, Sperling matriculated at Indiana University’s Department of Uralic and Altaic Studies (renamed Central Eurasian Studies
in 1993), where his career would be shaped and developed for the next four decades. The department was already internationally renowned, in part owing to the presence on the faculty of [[Taktser Rinpoche]], the Dalai Lama’s eldest brother. Sperling studied modern and classical Tibetan, perfected his knowledge of modern and classical Chinese, and wrote his doctoral dissertation, ''Early Ming Policy toward Tibet: An Examination of the Proposition that the Early Ming Emperors Adopted a "Divide and Rule" Policy toward Tibet'', in 1983. The dissertation has been widely acknowledged as the most influential study on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China, vol 8: The Ming dynasty, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

A product of the public education system, Sperling took his first faculty position also at a public institution, the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] (USM). Shortly after arriving in Hattiesburg, he was awarded the prestigious [[MacArthur Fellowship]] (1984–89). After a short spell at USM, Sperling returned to Indiana University in 1987, as a faculty member. He would remain at the university, a much-loved teacher, until December 2015, with occasional visiting professorships elsewhere, including Harvard University (1992–93) and the University of Delhi (1994–95). Over the years, Sperling mentored numerous graduate students who pursue both academic and nonacademic careers all over the world. Sperling died in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uyghurcongress.org/en/?p=30727|title=World Uyghur Congress Devastated at Loss of Professor Elliot Sperling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In his research, based predominantly on original, primary sources in Tibetan and Chinese, Sperling focused on questions of sovereignty and boundaries; on types of political, social, and familial authority; on Chinese 
policy toward Tibet; and on the complicated roles of Tibetan officials in the service of both Tibetan and Chinese governments. He wrote about bureaucrats, monks, mediators, and envoys to the Tangut, Yuan, Ming, and Qing courts, and his research covered many periods, ranging from the ninth century to the present. In addition to his focus on the Ming period, Sperling is especially recognized for his interventions on the study of the [[Tangut people]], on Mongol presence in and influence on Tibet in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, on the reign of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]] and other eminent personalities of his era, and on Tibet’s status under the Qing. Sperling served on, consulted or directed numerous professional boards.

In his work, "Sperling has been a judicious voice in increasingly less discerning times. He has censured (including during appearances in China) the Chinese government’s oppressive policies in Tibet. He has criticized the 
Dalai Lama and Tibet’s government-in-exile (also during appearances in India) for giving up on Tibetan independence and for their ignorance of China’s real positions. He has rejected the Tibetophiles’ view of Tibet as an unspoiled bastion of pure spirituality. And he never had much patience for scholars who easily become groupies of academic fashions."&lt;ref&gt;http://vpfaa.indiana.edu/docs/emeriti_bios/2015-retired-faculty-biographies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[festschrift]] in his honor, entitled ''Trails of the Tibetan Tradition: Papers for Elliot Sperling'', was published by the Amnye Machen Institute in [[Dharamshala]], India. The volume is open access through the ''Revue d'Etudes Tibétaines''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/ret/index.php?selection=0|title=Digital Himalaya: Revue d'Etudes Tibétaines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
Sperling also was a champion of human rights. Most recently, his public engagement was exemplified in the case of [[Ilham Tohti]]. Tohti, a Uyghur professor of economics at Minzu University in Beijing, was to spend a
year at Indiana University—at the university’s invitation—in 2014 as a visiting professor. He was detained in the Beijing airport, just prior to boarding his flight to Indianapolis, on charges of “separatism” (charges that were characterized as completely made up by the U.S. State Department, the European Union, and many other international bodies) and has since been sentenced by the Chinese government to life imprisonment. Sperling became one of the most outspoken individual voices arguing for Ilham Tohti’s innocence and release. This endeavor was not new for Sperling. He had served on the Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad for the U.S. Department of State (1996–99), and he had testified before the Groupe d’information du Sénat sur le Tibet (France), the Parliamentary Human Rights Group (United Kingdom), the Congressional-Executive Committee on China, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, and many others. His expertise was particularly requested on matters of human rights in Tibet, Tibet-China relations, ethnic minorities in China, and U.S.–China relations. His opinion pieces and commentary were published in venues such as the ''New York Times'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''Times of India'', ''Jane’s Intelligence Review'', and the ''Far Eastern Economic Review''.

'''Environmental Health Officers''' (also known as '''Public Health Inspectors''' or '''Environmental Health Practitioners''') are responsible for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to [[environmental health]] and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards. Environmental Health Practitioners are multi-skilled in many areas with individuals being highly trained, usually to degree level, and often requiring additional professional training, professional competency assessment and continuing professional development in order to continue to practise in the field.
They are involved in a variety of activities, for example inspecting food facilities, investigating public health nuisances, and implementing disease control, conducting work place safety assessments and accident investigation. Environmental health officers are focused on prevention, consultation, investigation, and education of the community regarding health risks and maintaining a safe environment.

EHOs bring to the position an understanding of microbiology, risk assessment, environmental science and technology, food science, knowledge of the built environment as well as the skills and knowledge related to the tracking and control of communicable disease, investigation of environmental health related incidents and criminal investigations. They therefore must also have strong investigative skills and a thorough understanding of the application of legislation related to public health, the built environment, pollution control and workplace safety. Working in partnership with Government Ministries (such as Health, Agriculture and Environment), local municipalities, businesses, community groups, other agencies and individual members of the community, the EHO plays a major role in protecting public health. They are allowed with a permit to select what to inspect.

Some past/historic titles include inspector of nuisances, sanitarian, and sanitary inspector. Other titles that currently exist include environmental health specialist/practitioner/professional, public health officer, health officer, health inspector, and health official. The legal title used will depend on the definitions found in local legislation/jurisdiction.

Environmental health professionals are usually employed by local government or state health authorities to advise on and enforce [[public health]] standards. However, many are employed in the [[private sector]] the [[military]] and other third sector agencies such as charities and NGOs.

==Jobs==
The following represents jobs that can be found in either the public or private sectors:
* Inspection and enforcement services
* Environmental health consulting and education
* Communicable disease investigations and outbreak control
* Food safety course training
* Community planning
* Sewage disposal (septic) systems planning
* Floor plan review and approval
* Housing standards/quality inspection and control
* Urban renewal 
* Pest control
* Emergency contingency planning and implementation
* Noise control
* Air quality monitoring
* Health and safety at work inspection and control
* Water testing (drinking water &amp; recreational water)
* Tobacco control
* Community care facilities licensing
* Public Buildings
* Quality Improvement

The common identifier of environmental health personnel is that they are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of risks to human health from factors in the environment, whether on behalf of government agencies or commercial and industrial concerns.

==Roles==
A Public Health Inspector (also known as an Environmental Health Officer) investigates health hazards in a wide variety of settings, and will take action to mitigate or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food safety set by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (environmental health officer) also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness.
  
They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.

==Working conditions==
Environmental health officers work with many different people in a variety of environments. Their jobs often involve considerable fieldwork, and some travel frequently. Many environmental health officers work long and often irregular hours. They inspect pools, childcare centers, restaurants, septic systems, and many other types of establishments that relate to health and safety.

Environmental health officers may be exposed to many of the same physically strenuous conditions and hazards as industrial employees, and the work may be performed in unpleasant, stressful, and dangerous working conditions. They may find themselves in an adversarial role if the management of an organization disagrees with the recommendations for ensuring a safe working environment.

==History==
The field of environmental health can be traced back to the 1840s in England. [[Edwin Chadwick]], a Poor Law Commissioner, conducted an inquiry into the causes of poverty which concluded that people often became poor because of ill health due to a bad environment. He believed that improving sanitation was the key to breaking this vicious cycle.

Chadwick led a vigorous campaign for change which eventually won over the establishment, resulting in the [[Public Health Act 1848]]. The Act provided for the appointment of Inspectors of Nuisances – the forerunners of today’s environmental health practitioners – in areas of need.

The Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors – the organisation which was to become the United Kingdom's [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]] – was established in 1883. Over subsequent decades, the role of environmental health practitioners changed and grew, with standards of qualification rising until, in the 1960s, it became a graduate profession. The grant of a Royal Charter in 1984 set the seal on this enhanced role and status. As a result of changing roles, the titles have changed over the decades from inspector of nuisances -&gt; sanitary inspector -&gt; public health inspector / environmental health officer (see Inspector of Nuisances below). This is also true internationally, as the titles have changed to reflect the advanced education and roles of environmental health officers today.

===Inspector of Nuisances===
An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In the United Kingdom from the mid 19th century this office was generally associated with public health and sanitation.

The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was [[Thomas Fresh]]  in Liverpool in 1844. Both the 1855 Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 defined such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament later changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Empire.

The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is an Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'.

In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role in local authorities is taken by officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction. The role in the US Public Health Service is undertaken by Commissioned (uniformed) 'Environmental Health Officers'.

==Qualifications==
Environmental health is a graduate career in most countries. The minimum requirements in most countries include an approved university degree program, field training and professional certification &amp; registration.

===Australia – General===
[[Environmental Health Australia]] accredits Australian Environmental Health Degree and Graduate Diploma programs in accordance with the Environmental Health Australia  [http://accreditation.eh.org.au/ Accreditation Policy] to ensure course content meets nationally consistent requirements for practice as an EHO anywhere in Australia.

Mallet assisted him in developing his own individual style in the years that followed. {{sfn|Gaudreault|Dulac|Hidalgo|2012|p=106}} Wague was an innovative mime artist who became a film actor.{{sfn|Gaudreault|Dulac|Hidalgo|2012|p=103}} Mime was important in the early days of silent films since a typical mime sketch was short, did not depend on words and could easily be enhanced by music.{{sfn|Gaudreault|Dulac|Hidalgo|2012|p=105}}

Mallet appeared in 1897 at the relatively high-brow ''[[La Bodinière]]'' theater, where she sang ''chansons brutales'' after being introduced in a talk by Lefèvre.{{sfn|Fulcher|2011|p=271}} She sang ''Noël de Pierrot'' and ''Fête des Morts'', both compositions by [[Xavier Privas]].{{sfn|Mendès|1903|p=234}} Mallet visited London in 1897 and played Pierrot in ''A Pierrot's Life'' in matinees at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].{{sfn|Shaw|Huneker|1913|p=228}} In 1899 Mallet was an understudy for the cabaret singer and actress [[Yvette Guilbert]].{{sfn|Filon|1898|p=268}} Félicia Mallet acted in ''L'Enfant prodigue'' at the Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre, which opened on 28 April 1900 at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]], and gave programs that featured films with manually synchronized sound tracks as well as live performances.{{sfn|Mannoni|2005|p=516}}

Félicia Mallet died in 1928, aged about 65. According to [[Pierre Trimouillat]] she was "an incomparable mime, an impeccable story teller and an actress of the first order.{{sfn|Bigot|2012|p=25}}

==Style==
Mallet's style of pantomime was more human and natural than the traditional blank-faced style of [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] and his disciples, and more expressive of emotions.{{sfn|Lust|2002|p=62}} She was known for the flexibility of her face and her figure.{{sfn|Filon|1898|p=268}} The Irish critic and playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]] compared Mallet's 1897 performance to that of other Pierrot's, saying,
{{blockquote |Felicia Mallet is much more credible, much more realistic, and therefore much more intelligible — also much less slim, and not quite so youthful. Litini was like a dissolute "La Sylphide": Mallet is frankly and heartily like a scion of the very smallest bourgeoisie sowing his wild oats. She is a good observer, a smart executant, and a vigorous and sympathetic actress, apparently quite indifferent to romantic charm, and intent only on the dramatic interest, realistic illusion, and comic force of her work. And she avoids the conventional gesture-code of academic Italian pantomime, depending on popularly graphic methods throughout.{{sfn|Shaw|Huneker|1913|p=228}} }}
However, although she was praised for her ability, she was not able to attract large enough audiences with pantomime alone, and also became known as a singer.{{sfn|Filon|1898|p=268}} Mallet often sang [[Aristide Bruant]]'s songs.{{sfn|Fulcher|2011|p=269}} She and others who sang Bruant's songs tried to imitate his harsh singing style.{{sfn|Whiting|1999|p=20}} [[Léon Xanrof]] dedicated his ''Le fiacre'' to Mallet, who made it one of her most popular songs in [[café concert]] performances.{{sfn|Fulcher|2011|p=269}} Mallet, Guilbert, [[Emma Liébel]] and [[Eugénie Buffet]] were pioneers of the [[chanson réaliste]] style in their popular shows.{{sfn|Baudelaire|1996|p=12}}

'''Gravimetry''' is the measurement of the strength of a [[gravitational field]].  Gravimetry may be used when either the magnitude of gravitational field or the properties of matter responsible for its creation are of interest.

==Units of measurement==
Gravity is usually measured in units of [[acceleration]]. In the [[SI]] system of units, the standard unit of acceleration is 1 [[metre per second squared]] (abbreviated as m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Other units include the [[Galileo (unit)|gal]] (sometimes known as a ''galileo'', in either case with symbol Gal), which equals 1 [[centimetre]] per second squared, and the ''[[g-force|g]]'' (''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), equal to 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The value of the ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; approximately equals the [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface]] (although the value of ''g'' varies by location).

==Measuring gravity ==
{{details|Gravimeter}}
An instrument used to measure gravity is known as a [[gravimeter]], or gravinometer. For a small body&lt;!--large bodies have tidal effects--&gt;, [[general relativity]] predicts gravitational effects indistinguishable from the effects of [[acceleration]] by the [[equivalence principle]].  Thus, gravimeters can be regarded as special-purpose [[accelerometer]]s.  Many [[weighing scale]]s may be regarded as simple gravimeters. In one common form, a [[spring (device)|spring]] is used to counteract the force of gravity pulling on an object. The change in length of the spring may be calibrated to the force required to balance the gravitational pull. The resulting measurement may be made in units of force (such as the [[newton (unit)|newton]]), but is more commonly made in units of [[Gal (unit)|gal]]s.

Researchers use more sophisticated gravimeters when precise measurements are needed. When measuring the [[Earth's gravity|Earth's gravitational field]], measurements are made to the precision of microgals to find density variations in the rocks making up the Earth. Several types of gravimeters exist for making these measurements, including some that are essentially refined versions of the spring scale described above. These measurements are used to define [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].

Besides [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], [[wikt:stable#adjective|stability]] is also an important property of a gravimeter, as it allows the monitoring of gravity ''changes''. These changes can be the result of mass displacements inside the Earth, or of vertical movements of the Earth's crust on which measurements are being made: remember that gravity decreases 0.3 mGal for every metre of [[height]]. The study of gravity changes belongs to [[geodynamics]].

The majority of modern gravimeters use specially-designed metal or [[quartz]] [[Spring (device)#Zero-length springs|zero-length springs]] to support the test mass.  Zero-length springs do not follow [[Hooke's Law]], instead they have a force proportional to their length.  The special property of these springs is that the natural [[resonant frequency|resonant period]] of [[oscillation]] of the spring-mass system can be made very long -  approaching a thousand seconds.  This detunes the test mass from most local vibration and mechanical [[noise (acoustic)|noise]], increasing the sensitivity and utility of the gravimeter.  Quartz and metal springs are chosen for different reasons; quartz springs are less affected by magnetic and electric fields while metal springs have a much lower drift (elongation) with time.  The test mass is sealed in an air-tight container so that tiny changes of barometric pressure from blowing wind and other weather do not change the buoyancy of the test mass in air.

Spring gravimeters are, in practice, relative instruments which measure the difference in gravity between different locations. A relative instrument also requires calibration by comparing instrument readings taken at locations with known complete or absolute values of gravity. Absolute gravimeters provide such measurements by determining the gravitational acceleration of a test mass in vacuum.  A test mass is allowed to fall freely inside a vacuum chamber and its position is measured with a laser interferometer and timed with an atomic clock.  The laser wavelength is known to ±0.025 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and the clock is stable to ±0.03 ppb as well.  Great care must be taken to minimize the effects of perturbing forces such as
residual air resistance (even in vacuum), vibration, and magnetic forces.  Such instruments are capable of an accuracy of about two parts per billion or 0.002 mGal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://microglacoste.com/absolutemeters.php | title=Micro-g LaCoste Absolute Gravimeters | publisher=Micro-g LaCoste, Inc. | date=2012 | accessdate= July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reference their measurement to atomic standards of length and [[Atomic clock|time]].  Their primary use is for calibrating relative instruments, monitoring [[crustal deformation]], and in geophysical studies requiring high accuracy and stability. However, absolute instruments are somewhat larger and significantly more expensive than relative spring gravimeters, and are thus relatively rare.

Gravimeters have been designed to mount in vehicles, including aircraft (note the field of [[aerogravity]]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;), ships and submarines.  These special gravimeters isolate acceleration from the movement of the vehicle and subtract it from measurements.  The acceleration of the vehicles is often hundreds or thousands of times stronger than the changes being measured.

A gravimeter (the ''Lunar Surface Gravimeter'') deployed on the surface of the moon during the [[Apollo 17]] mission did not work due to a design error. A second device (the ''Traverse Gravimeter Experiment'') functioned as anticipated.

==Microgravimetry==
Microgravimetry is a rising and important branch developed on the foundation of classical gravimetry.  Microgravity investigations are carried out in order to solve various problems of engineering geology, mainly location of voids and their monitoring. Very detailed measurements of high accuracy can indicate voids of any origin, provided the size and depth are large enough to produce gravity effect stronger than is the level of confidence of relevant gravity signal.

==History==
The modern gravimeter was developed by [[Lucien LaCoste]] and [[Arnold Romberg]] in 1936.

They also invented most subsequent refinements, including the ship-mounted gravimeter, in 1965, temperature-resistant instruments for deep boreholes, and lightweight hand-carried instruments.  Most of their designs remain in use (2005) with refinements in data collection and data processing.

'''Helmut Rix''' (4 July 1926, in [[Amberg]] – 3 December 2004, in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]) was a [[Germany|German]] linguist and professor of the Sprachwissenschaftliches Seminar of [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität]], [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]].

He is best known for his research into [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] languages, as well as the author of the hypothesis of [[Tyrrhenian languages]].

== Biography ==
Helmut Rix was born in 1926 in Amberg to a family of teachers. Following high school and conscripted service in the [[Kriegsmarine|Nazi navy]] during [[World War II]], he studied Indo-European studies, classical philology, and history at [[University of Würzburg|Wurzburg]] in 1946 and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] from 1947. There he received his doctorate in 1950 with his dissertation ''Bausteine zu einer Hydronymie Alt-Italiens''. From 1951 he was assistant to [[Hans Krahe]] at [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] and from 1955 lecturer in Latin and Greek at the Lutheran [[Augustana Divinity School]] in [[Neuendettelsau]]. In 1959 he qualified as a full professor at Tübingen with the [[habilitation]] thesis, ''Das etruskische Cognomen'' (published in 1963 by [[Harrassowitz Verlag|Harrassowitz]]). In 1966, Rix took a position at the newly established [[University of Regensburg]] and in 1982 professorship at the [[University of Freiburg]]. He retired in 1993 and died in 2004 from a traffic accident.

'''''Hominid''''' is a short novel by Austrian writer [[Klaus Ebner]]. Taking place millions of years ago, it is a fictional story of a [[Band society|band]] of extinct [[hominid]]s who inhabit [[Central Africa]]. Referencing the seven days of [[Creation according to Genesis|biblical Creation]], the novel takes place in seven days.  As the protagonist Pitar leads his band to civilization, tension arises between the [[clan]] leader Costello and his rival Re. Over the course of the story, Pitar invents tools, discovers the use of fire, and falls in love with Maluma. The seventh day marks a turning point in the storyline, as the members of the band separate from one another.

The characters' contemporary language and Pitar's thorough knowledge of modern-day history, philosophy and science add to the grotesque humor of the novel, while his two friends quote [[Classical antiquity|classical Roman literature]] and Chinese sayings. The book was published by [[Vienna|Viennese]] publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, several Austrian and German critics and writers published reviews of the novel.

Ebner first considered writing a novel in which prehistoric characters have present-day knowledge and a modern language in 2006.&lt;ref name="gams"&gt;Gamsjäger, Sonja: ''Gespräch mit Autoren'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Believing that this topic would not suffice for a long novel, he initially did not pursue the idea. In February 2008 Ebner won the [[Wiener Werkstattpreis]] in the categories of [[short story]] and [[essay]]&amp;mdash;in addition to the prize money the organizer of the award, the Viennese publishing house FZA, offers to the winner to publish a 100-page book. Hence Ebner wrote and finalized his narrative within four months. The book was published in the October of the same year with the German title ''Hominide''.&lt;ref name="gams" /&gt; The publisher introduced the work to the public with a public reading  in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literra.info/bilder/termine/pdf/80649227f595984f.pdf?PHPSESSID=0bb7b93c01a15d68c167ae34afdef28b Invitation of publisher FZA to the public reading. Retrieved on 2009-03-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel consists of seven chapters, "Day 1" to "Day 7", with the action of each chapter occurring on consecutive days. The chapters refer to the seven days of the [[Creation according to Genesis|biblical Creation]].&lt;ref&gt;Reichel, Ingrid. “Es lebe die Satire!” Review on ''Hominide''. In: etcetera, St. Pölten 2009, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison with other works of Ebner, ''Hominid'' is the first to be about a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] subject. The author had already addressed topics of religious faith before, in the short stories “Der Schreiber von Aram (The Scribe of Aram)”&lt;ref&gt;Published by the literary magazine “die Rampe 2/94”, Linz 1994, {{ISBN|3-85320-679-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and “Momentaufnahme (Snapshot)”,&lt;ref&gt;Published in the book ''Lose (Destinies)'', Edition Nove, Neckenmarkt 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-85251-197-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently used a satirical style for his narratives.&lt;ref&gt;See Rafael, Julia. “Critic review” of the book ''Lose''. In: Literarisches Österreich nr. 1 (2008), page 27., and Götz, Hermann. “Lob dem Quickie”, critic review of the book ''Auf der Kippe''. In: Schreibkraft nr. 18 (2009), page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot synopsis ==
''Hominid'' takes place several million years ago in the [[Central Africa]]n transitional region between [[rainforest]] and [[savanna]]. The main characters are ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Australopithecus afarenses]]'', an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Carbonell, Eudald; Moyà, Salvador; Sala, Robert; Corbella, Josep: ''Sapiens. El llarg camí dels homínids cap a la intel·ligència.'' Edicions 62, Barcelona 2000, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is told through [[first-person narrative|first-person narration]] by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his [[social environment|social]] and [[natural environment]], Pitar decides to lead his [[Band society|band]] to civilization:&lt;ref&gt;See [http://fza.or.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=27#Hominide Book announcement by the publisher. Retrieved on 2009-06-25.]&lt;/ref&gt; “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Ebner, Klaus: ''Hominide'', p. 9: "“lso beschloss ich, ein wenig Klarheit ins Dunkel zu bringen, meinen Leuten eine Kerze anzuzünden, nach der Devise, es werde Licht und so.”&lt;/ref&gt; His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, [[philosophy]] and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the [[grotesque]] scenario.&lt;ref name="gerst"&gt;Gerstinger, Heinz. “Review on Hominide”. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/09, Vienna 2009, p. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], and Lao, who frequently refers to [[Chinese philosophy]].

Although it is difficult to convince his fellow [[Hominidae]] to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the [[patriarch]]al leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds [[windbreak]]s to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present [[alpha (biology)|alpha]] but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a [[parliament]] to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]]; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.&lt;ref name="gayer"&gt;Gayer, Karin. “[http://www.kultur-online.net/?q=node/8784 Schöne neue Welt der Hominiden]”. Kultur Online, Verein artCore, Bregenz (AT)/Binz (CH) 10.07.2009. Retrieved on 2009-07-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the subplots of the novel details the budding love between Pitar and Maluma, a female member of the band. Costello perceives the group of females as his personal [[harem]], but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar she breaks off her relationship with him. On each day, the characters discover new insights and artefacts, but seek rest from their exhaustion by the seventh day. This repose, however, is disrupted by the attack of a [[Machairodontinae|saber-toothed cat]]. Several members of the band are killed, including Costello, thus enabling Re to assume power. Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the band, stating, "We should leave in time, leave Re and his new Reich, which, when I'm taking into account Thorn's previous reign, would be the Third over here."&lt;ref&gt;Ebner, Klaus: ''Hominide'', p. 96: “Wir sollten rechtzeitig wegkommen, von Re und seinem neuen Reich, das, wenn ich Thorns frühere Herrschaft einrechnete, hier das dritte war.”&lt;/ref&gt; Pitar and Maluma head toward the savanna, an action which alludes to both the [[Garden of Eden|expulsion from paradise]] and the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Gamsjäger, Sonja: “Gespräch mit Autoren”, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Only odd-numbered chapters narrate the love story, which bookmarks the novel. Writer [[Karin Gayer]] mentions in her review that the love story of Pitar and Maluma, and its positioning within the text, offers "a second interpretation of the beginning and the end".&lt;ref name="gayer" /&gt;

== Characters ==
[[File:A.afarensis.jpg|thumb|Model of the ''Australopithecus'' Lucy in the museum of Barcelona]]
In a conversation with the Viennese regional leader of publisher [[Arovell Verlag|Arovell]], Ebner revealed the hidden meanings of his characters' names.&lt;ref&gt;Gamsjäger, Sonja: “Gespräch mit Autoren”. In: Arovell-Kulturzeitschrift. Musik&amp;Literatur&amp;Kunst. Nr. 72. Gosau-Salzburg-Vienna 2009, p. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Akshaya''': The name originates from [[Hindi]] (specifically [[Sanskrit]]) and signifies “the indomitable”. Akshaya is a female character with a firm personality, and belongs to the band although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. In a certain sense she represents the [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] form of governance by daring to disagree with the alpha and making her own decisions.
*'''Bongo''': Originates from the [[Bongo people (Sudan)|African people]] and language and is also used for place names in several African countries, also alluding to [[Adriano Celentano]]s film ''[[Bingo Bongo]]'' and a kind of [[Bongo (antelope)|forest antelope]]. The novel presents Bongo as a clownish, male juvenile who teases the other members of the band but is protected from backlashes by his youth and humor.
*'''Carpediem''': Latin for "[[Carpe diem|seize the day]]", literally meaning "pluck the day", which stems from a poem by [[Horace]]. Carpediem is Pitar's closest friend and uses Latin quotations and expressions.&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20101118050929/http://www.klausebner.eu/pages/buecher/glossar-zu-hominide.php Glossary of foreign language expressions]". Klaus Ebner's Official Website. Retrieved on 2009-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Costello''': English-Italian surname. Costello is the patriarch of the band. Keen on remaining in power, he recognizes that Pitar's ideas might help him prevail. For this reason he supports Pitar.
*'''Djamila''': A female character who belongs to Costello's harem. Her name stems from the [[Arabic language]] meaning "the pretty one".
*'''Ischa''': A female character who belongs to Costello's harem. Together with Djamila she woos the clan leader. Her name stems from the [[Semitic languages]] meaning "woman".
*'''Konrad''': [[Old High German]] for "bold or good adviser". [[Conrad (name)|Konrad]] is a follower of Re and acts as his speaker, also challenging and ridiculing Pitar's ideas.
*'''Lao''': Depending on the [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], the word is Chinese for "firm, solid" or "old". It is also an allusion to either or both the philosopher [[Lao-Tzu]], author of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'', or the [[Lao people]] who live in [[Southeast Asia]]. The character Lao quotes Chinese philosophers and is a friend of Pitar. When he leaves the band after the attack of the sabre-tooth, he goes in the direction of East Africa and Asia.
*'''Lucy''': An allusion to [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], the skeleton of an ''Australopithecus afarensis'' specimen discovered in 1974 in [[Ethiopia]]. Lucy is the mother of most children in the band. At the end of the book she leaves for [[East Africa]] with Lao and Maluma.
*'''Maluma''': [[Bouba/kiki effect|Maluma]] is an artificial word from [[synesthesia]], representing curvy and smooth shapes. She becomes the loving companion of Pitar. Through Maluma, Pitar discovers the power and the sweets of love.
*'''Manisha''': This name stems from the Hindi and Sanskrit languages, signifying "the wise". In [[Hinduism]], [[Manisha]] is the goddess of the mind. Among the clan's women, Manisha has a similar role as Lao has among the men. She easily holds her own in discussions with the males, and her reasoning is witty and logical.
*'''Pitar''' The protagonist's name stems from Sanskrit and means "father"; its intonation lies on the second [[syllable]]: "[[Laryngeal theory|Pitár]]". Pitar narrates the story of which he is the main character.
*'''Re''': Italian for "king", also an allusion to the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[sun deity|sun god]] Re or [[Ra]]. Re is Costello's opponent and [[antagonist]]. An aggressive character, he perceives Pitar as an enemy because of Pitar's perceived support for the band's leader. He repeatedly defies Costello but does not dare to start an open revolt. The attack of the sabre-toothed cat, which kills Costello and some other members of the band, enables Re to become the leader at the end of the novel.
*'''Rhododendron''': [[Greek language|Greek]] for "rose tree", a genus of flowering plants in the family [[Ericaceae]]. The character [[Rhododendron]] is a male member of the band with an ecological attitude. Rhododendron is only a supporting actor in the story.
*'''Ruth''': [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for "companion". [[Ruth (given name)|Ruth]] is a female band member with a distinctive strength of character. When the band is constructing their first windshield, she pushes a fervent discussion about labor law and commences a strike.
*'''Thorn''': This name stems from the [[Germanic languages]] and is the denomination of the rune [[Thurisaz (rune)|Thurisaz]] “Þ”, pronounced as “θ”. Thorn is the eldest of the clan and considered a sage. He appears only in the first two chapters, at the end of which he dies. From a dynastic point of view, he was Costello's predecessor.

== Major themes ==
The novel addresses [[wikt:Hominization|hominization]] from an ironic point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days.&lt;ref name="gerst" /&gt; The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With the evolution of mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an ''Australopitecus afarensis'' found. The characters mention that ''[[Homo erectus]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Hominide'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin&lt;ref&gt;''Hominide'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Toumaï&lt;ref&gt;''Hominide'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; represent two of the oldest-known [[Hominini|hominin]] ancestors, while ''[[Aegyptopithecus|Aegyptopithecus zeuxis]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Hominide'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="reichel" /&gt;

While scholars know of patriarchal and [[Matriarch#Comparison with matrifocality|matrifocal]] ancient societies, very little can be said about a society of a species, which is as remote as ''[[Australopithecus]]''. On the basis of examples in today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya.&lt;ref name="gayer" /&gt; Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello [[wiktionary:retrocede|retrocede]]s from her.&lt;ref&gt;''Hominide, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]], corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Eller, Cynthia. ''The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory: Why An Invented Past Will Not Give Women a Future''. Beacon Press, Boston 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8070-6792-5}}, and Stearns, Peter N. ''Gender in World History''. Routledge, New York 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-22310-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme is the [[love]] story between Pitar and Maluma. While the society of the band is depicted as driven by [[sexual attraction]] in a male [[hierarchy]], the relationship between Pitar and Maluma leads them to break away from traditional [[wiktionary:habitude|habitude]]s. Pitar is not the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha male]], but he starts a love relationship on his own, in which Maluma quits Costello's harem. The love story demonstrates love as a quite late cultural achievement of mankind. In addition, Karin Gayer emphasizes the significance of Pitar's and Maluma's love against the religious component in defining the love story and its positioning within the storyline as another concept "of the beginning and the end".&lt;ref&gt;“Die Liebesgeschichte (...) ist geschickt und unaufdringlich eingeflochten (...) wodurch sich im ersten und letzten Kapitel eine zweite Deutung von Anfang und Ende ergibt.” (“The love story (...) is embedded neatly and inconspicuously (...) which leads to a second interpretation of the Beginning and the End.)”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
''Hominid'' is a [[Novella|short novel]] which contains one single and linear storyline.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerstinger, Heinz. “Review on Hominide”. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/09, Vienna 2009, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book stems from the underlying grotesque scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow hominids, the mentioning of artifacts which have not yet been invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstinger, Heinz. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steffen Roye from the German literary magazine ''Verstärker'' states in the title of his book review that Ebner has the characters of his story "talk as if they were modern-day juveniles". When it comes to allusions, a number of them consist of quotes, usually from classical Latin writers.&lt;ref&gt;Roye, Steffen. Online review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebner's writing style is rich in detail, as Ingrid Reichel states, and she pinpoints the "artist of the word".&lt;ref&gt;Reichel, Ingrid. “Es lebe die Satire!” Review on ''Hominide''. In: etcetera, St. Pölten 2009, p 76: “K. Ebner erweist sich als Sprachkönner und Liebhaber fürs Detail.”&lt;/ref&gt; Similar judgments have been made by other critics when they reviewed the preceding works by Ebner, such as [[Wolfgang Ratz]] about ''Auf der Kippe''&lt;ref&gt;Ratz, Wolfgang. Review on ''Auf der Kippe''. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 2/08, Vienna 2008, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; or Julia Rafael about ''Lose''.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael, Julia. Review on ''Lose''. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/08, Vienna 2008, p. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
[[File:KlausEbner Lesung2008.jpg|thumb|left|Klaus Ebner at a presentation]]
[[Heinz Gerstinger]] thinks the book is a "history of the awakening of the spirit of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Gerstinger, Heinz. “Review on Hominide”. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/09, Vienna 2009, p. 21-22: "Geschichte vom Erwachen des menschlichen Geistes."&lt;/ref&gt; The author has the events glided "into the playful by his gently irony".&lt;ref&gt;Gerstinger, Heinz. “Review on Hominide”. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/09, Vienna 2009, p. 21-22: “(...) durch sanfte Ironie ins Spielerische gleiten.”&lt;/ref&gt; Several reviewers underline the narrative's ironic and satirical aspect, including the names of the characters, Latin quotations and idioms &lt;ref name="gerst" /&gt; as well as the parallelism between the seven days of Creation and scientific [[wikt:Hominization|hominization]].&lt;ref name="reichel"&gt;Reichel, Ingrid: “Es lebe die Satire!” In: Etcetera (ISSN 1682-9115) Nr. 36, St. Pölten 2009, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingrid Reichel points out the perfect publication date, just in time for the 150th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="reichel" /&gt; Similarly to other reviewers who had written about Ebner's earlier books,&lt;ref&gt;See Götz, Hermann. ''Lob dem Quickie''. In: Schreibkraft (ISSN 1606-7169) Nr. 18, Graz 2009, p. 66; Rafael, Julia. Review on ''Lose''. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 1/08, Vienna 2008, p. 27-28; Ratz, Wolfgang. Review on ''Auf der Kippe''. In: Literarisches Österreich Nr. 2/08, Vienna 2008, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; she highlights the sophisticated use of a detail-rich language which is "steeped in subtle and sensitive humor".&lt;ref&gt;Reichel, Ingrid: “Es lebe die Satire!” In: Etcetera (ISSN 1682-9115) Nr. 36, St. Pölten 2009, p. 76: “(...) von einem sensiblen und feinen Humor durchwachsen (...)”&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many explicit allusions to several [[Major religious groups|world religions]], Ingrid Reichel states that the novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for [[Darwinism|darwinists]], on no account for [[Creationism|creationists]], to a lesser extent for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] drop out entirely”.&lt;ref&gt;Reichel, Ingrid: “Es lebe die Satire!” In: Etcetera (ISSN 1682-9115) Nr. 36, St. Pölten 2009, p. 76: “für Menschen mit Humor,  für Denkende (...), für Darwinisten, auf keinen Fall für Kreationisten, weniger für Gläubige, eher für Atheisten, … Fundamentalisten scheiden völlig aus.”&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] communities and the second representing those of [[bonobo]]s. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters.&lt;ref name="gayer" /&gt; She declares that at the time of the ''Australopithecus'', neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but "the author is not interested in [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologic]] precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman.&lt;ref&gt;Gayer, Karin. Online review. "Natürlich gab es zur Zeit der Australopithecinen keine Schimpansen oder Bonobos, wie wir sie heute kennen. Aber dem Autor geht es auch nicht um paläoanthropologische Genauigkeiten, sondern um eine Spiegelung unserer Gesellschaft, um ein satirisches Bloßlegen menschlicher Verhaltensweisen. Und da ähnelt der königsgleiche Costello wohl dem Alphatier einer Schimpansenherde (oder einem klassischen Manager?), und die schlagfertige Akshaya mit ihren sozialen Bindungen erinnert an die Durchsetzungskraft der Bonoboweibchen (oder einer modernen Karrierefrau?)"—“Of course there were no chimpanzees or bonobos at the time of the ''Australopithecus'', but the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses, he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior in a satirical matter. Therefore, king Costello resembles an alpha of a band of chimpanzees (or a classical manager?), and quick-witted Akshaya with her social connections reminds us the assertiveness of female bonobos (or a modern career woman?).”&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human, a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man."&lt;ref&gt;Gayer, Karin. Online review. "Auf einer anderen Ebene fällt die stete begriffliche Vermengung und Durchmischung von Affen- und Menschenartigen auf, eine Verquickung, die nachdenklich stimmt und dem Leser die mitunter berechtigte Frage stellt, wo wir, die wir uns für doppelt sapiens halten, uns eigentlich einordnen sollten."&lt;/ref&gt;

The multitudinous allusions to well-known and lesser-known books, movies and sayings cause contradicting receptions. While Heinz Gerstinger and Ingrid Reichel explicitly highlight the comical effect of the insinuations, the German critic Steffen Roye regards them as sometimes "exaggerated"&lt;ref&gt;Roye, Steffen. Online review. “(...) gehörig übertrieben (...)”&lt;/ref&gt; and says, "As the story develops, it becomes more and more like a revue."&lt;ref&gt;Roye, Steffen. Online review. “Die Erzählung wird mit fortschreitender Handlung dadurch zur Nummernrevue.”&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous expressions in foreign languages, especially in Latin, remain untranslated in the [[edition (book)|first edition]]. In her review, Ingrid Reichel invites the publisher to add a glossary to a new edition.&lt;ref name="reichel" /&gt; The author subsequently released such a glossary on his own website.&lt;ref name="glossary"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">'''Interlinguistics''' is the study of various aspects of linguistic communication. It is concerned with investigating how ethnic and auxiliary languages ([[lingua franca]]) work in such situations and with the possibilities of optimizing interlinguistic communication, for instance by use of [[international auxiliary language]]s, such as [[Esperanto]] or [[Interlingua]]. These are languages that are created by an intentional intellectual effort, usually with the aim of facilitating interlinguistic communication, but there are also interlanguages that have arisen spontaneously. These are called ''[[pidgin|pidgin languages]]''. The term was first coined in French (Interlinguistique) by the Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Jules Meysmans]].&lt;ref&gt;(eo) «Biografio de Jules Meysmans », ''Informilo por interlingvistoj'', 2015, &lt;abbr&gt;p.&lt;/abbr&gt; 14 (ISSN 1385-2191, online ([http://esperantic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IpI-92-93-_1-2-2015_.pdf PDF]) &lt;small&gt;[http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fesperantic.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2FIpI-92-93-_1-2-2015_.pdf archive]&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main historical periods of Interlinguistics are : first, the pioneer era (1879 - 1911), when its basis was put forth; secondly, the foundational era (1911 - 1951), when the interlinguistics wars took place to decide the most appropriate form of an auxiliary language; thirdly, the school era (1951-1990), when independent Interlinguistics schools formed in different countries, mainly Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland, each with particular attention to [[Esperanto]]; lastly, the current era of [[language policy]] (1990 - today), during which interlinguistics is more tightly integrated with other disciplines, mainly linguistics and various social and political sciences, particularly via the topics of [[globalism]], linguistic justice, management of [[multilingualism]], and new forms of mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Gobbo, ''Interlinguistics in the 21st century: new opportunities, new challenges'', in : [http://www.esperantic.org/en/publications/ifi-information-for-interlinguists/ Information for Interlinguists], vol. 2, no. 5 (3/2018), p. 9 | ISSN 2521-7461 ([http://www.esperantic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IfI_105_final.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field of studies ==
The term ''Interlinguistics'' can be interpreted in at least two ways: 
# Study of  ''interlinguae'', i.e., of interlanguages that serve for interlinguistic communication - not to be confused with the [[interlanguage|interim language]]s of language learners, which also came to be called ”interlanguages” by some authors.
# Study of phenomena that can be observed ''inter linguae'' 'between languages'.
Among these interpretations, the first one is by far the most well established, while [[Mario Wandruszka]] had only the second one in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Wandruszka: ''Interlinguistik: Umrisse einer neuen Sprachwissenschaft.'' (’Interlinguistics: Contours of a New Linguistic Discipline’) Piper Verlag, 1982, {{ISBN|3-492-00314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears first to have been used in French (''interlinguistique'') by Jules Meysmans in 1911 in a text concerning [[international auxiliary language]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jules Meysmans (1911-12): Une science nouvelle. In: ''Lingua Internationale'' (Bruxelles). 1, Nr. 8, 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It became more widely accepted subsequent to an address by the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]] to the 2nd International Congress of Linguists in 1931. According to Jespersen, interlinguistics is ”that branch of the science of language which deals with the structure and basic ideas of all languages with the view to the establishing of a norm for interlanguages, ''i.e.'' auxiliary languages destined for oral and written use between people who cannot make themselves understood by means of their mother tongues”.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert N. Shenton, Edward Sapir, Otto Jespersen (eds.): ''International Communication: A Symposium on the Language Problem.'' Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., London 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, investigations that are useful for optimizing interlinguistic communication are central to the discipline, and the purpose may be to develop a new language intended for international use or for use within a multilingual country or union. 
Research of this kind has been undertaken by the International Delegation, which developed [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907), and by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA), which developed [[Interlingua]] (1951).

[[Valter Tauli]] considered interlinguistics as a subdiscipline of [[language planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Valter Tauli (1968): ''Introduction to a theory of language planning''. Uppsala: Almquist &amp; Wiksells, S. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The principles recommended by him for [[language planning]] applied to the guided development of national languages are also, and more liberally so, applicable to constructed interlanguages. It is noteworthy that these principles have close counterparts among Grice’s [[conversational maxims]]. These maxims describe how effective communication in conversation is achieved, and in order to function well, a language must be such that it allows respecting these maxims, which languages not always do.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Traunmüller: [http://www2.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/griceil.htm Conversational Maxims and Principles of Language Planning] ''PERILUS XII'', pp 25-47, Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most publications in the field of interlinguistics are, however, not so constructive, but rather [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]], [[comparative linguistics|comparative]], historic, [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]], or concerned with [[translation]] by humans or machines. As for [[Esperanto]], which is the most widely used constructed interlanguage, there is a relatively abundant literature about the language itself and its [[philology]] (see [[Esperantology]]).

Only a few of the many constructed languages have been applied practically to any noteworthy extent. The most prosperous were [[Volapük]] (1879, [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]), [[Esperanto]] (1887 [[Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]]), [[Latino sine flexione]] (1903, [[Giuseppe Peano]]), [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (1907, [[Louis Couturat]]), [[Interlingue|Occidental]]-Interlingue (1922, [[Edgar de Wahl]]) and [[Interlingua]] (1951, IALA and [[Alexander Gode]]), with Esperanto being the only one still gathering a considerable community of active speakers today. Here, the [[Bliss symbols]] (1949, [[Charles K. Bliss]])&lt;ref&gt;Charles K. Bliss: ''International semantography: a non-alphabetical symbol writing readable in all languages'' Institute of Semantography, Sidney 1949&lt;/ref&gt; deserve also to be mentioned. These were intended for international communication, but have found their field of application elsewhere, namely as an aid for persons who lack an adequate ability of using ordinary language, because of motorical or cognitive handicaps.

Among constructed languages, it is usual to distinguish between ''a priori languages'' and ''a posteri languages''. The latter are based on one or, more often, several source languages, while this is not evident for a priori languages, e.g., the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17th century, [[Solresol]] and the [[logical language]]s of the 20th century, such as [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]].  Spontaneously arisen Interlanguages are necessarily a posteriori or iconic (using imaging or imitating signs).

Politicians and pundits frequently refer to the ability of the [[President of the United States]] to "create jobs" in the U.S. during his term in office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/jobs-deficit-investment-deficit-fiscal-deficit/ NYT-Laura D'Andrea Tyson-Jobs Deficit, Investment Deficit, Fiscal Deficit-July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
The numbers are most often seen during the election season or in regard to a President's economic legacy.  The numbers typically used and most frequently cited by economists are '''total nonfarm payroll employment''' numbers as collected by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] on a monthly and annual basis.  The BLS also provides numbers for private-sector non-farm employment and other subsets of the aggregate that are more useful for making points.

==Methodology==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=September 2014}}
The job numbers are estimates generated via a survey of thousands of businesses.  The sample establishments are drawn from private nonfarm businesses such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as federal, state, and local government entities.  Employees on nonfarm payrolls are those who received pay for any part of the reference pay period (which includes the 12th of the month), including persons on paid leave. 

As of 2005, the sample includes about 160,000 businesses and government agencies covering approximately 400,000 individual worksites.  These monthly job counts are revised (sometimes by 20% or more) within 90 days to reflect additional data, seasonal adjustment models, and annual adjustments resulting from unemployment insurance filings.

The numbers generated by the BLS are actually "total employment," and the "new jobs" numbers cited are simply "the change in total employment."  Thus, they reflect "net new jobs" and do not attempt to estimate the absolute number of new jobs.  In a measurement period, if productivity improvement eliminated the need for 100,000 jobs and business activity caused the need for 100,000 new positions, the BLS numbers would reflect 0 "new jobs." The real unemployment rate is measured by the U-6 figure.

==Controversy==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=September 2014}}
[[File:U.S. Employment Changes - Total Non-Farm 1970 to Present.png|thumb|right|350px|U.S. Changes in Employment for Selected Time Periods]]
The exact usefulness of these numbers is debated. On the one hand, they include only nonfarm payroll employment, which excludes certain types of jobs, notably the self-employed. However, as a semi-balancing factor, they count one person with two jobs as two employed persons. 

Additionally, for at least the first eight months of a President's term, he inherits a budget proposed and implemented by his predecessor (as well as an overall economy which may be in decline or recovery). The data in columns shown for September (in ''italic'') correlate better with the federal fiscal year starting each October, showing the impact of a given president and resulting federal budget on the job count.

Moreover, according to the [[United States Constitution]], the [[United States Congress]] is responsible for government spending and thus, regardless of Presidential advocacy, bears constitutional responsibility for such things as spending and tax policy that have enormous effects upon the economy. Furthermore, it is debatable how much effect any President realistically could have on a system as large, diverse, and complex as the U.S. economy.  Nevertheless, the [[nonfarm payrolls]] number is the one most frequently used in the media and by economists, largely because the alternative (household survey numbers) is thought to drastically overestimate employment.

Another factor to consider is population growth, which provides opportunities for the creation of jobs, rendering these figures less impressive, or in the case of the already subpar, clearly insufficient.

The [[Heritage Foundation]] has pointed to Alan Greenspan's general economic optimism (in 2004) as support for household survey numbers over payroll numbers. However, the subsequent downturn, and Greenspan's admission of having been wrong, may have discredited that view.

'''John King Fairbank'''  (May 24, 1907 &amp;ndash; September 14, 1991), was a prominent American [[historian]] of [[China]]. Considered the doyen of post-war China studies,{{sfnb|CohenGoldman|1992|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_gvAQAAIAAJ v]}} the [[Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies]] at [[Harvard University]] is named after him. Among his most widely read books are ''The United States and China'', which was first published in 1948 and went through revisions in 1958, 1979, and 1983, and his co-edited series, ''[[The Cambridge History of China]]''.

==Early life==
Fairbank was born in [[Huron, South Dakota]], in 1907.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He was educated at [[Sioux Falls]] High School, [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Harvard College]], and [[Oxford University]] ([[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]). As an undergraduate, he was advised by [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Kingsley Webster]], the distinguished British diplomatic historian who was then teaching at Harvard, to choose a relatively-undeveloped field of study. Webster suggested that since the [[Qing dynasty]]'s archives were then being opened, China's foreign relations would be a prudent choice. Fairbank later admitted that he then knew nothing about China itself.

In 1929, when he graduated from Harvard ''[[summa cum laude]]'', he went to Oxford as a [[Rhodes scholar]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

At Oxford, Fairbank began his study of the [[Chinese language]] and sought the counsel of [[H.B. Morse]], retired from the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service|Imperial Maritime Customs Service]]. On Webster's advice, he had read Morse's three-volume study of the Qing dynasty's foreign relations on the ship that was coming to England. Morse became his mentor. The ambitious young scholar decided to go to [[Beijing]] to do research in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;John King Fairbank, ''Chinabound: A Fifty-Year Memoir'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1982), pp. 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Beijing, he studied at [[Tsinghua University]] under the direction of the prominent historian [[Tsiang Tingfu]], who introduced him to the study of newly-available diplomatic sources and the perspectives of Chinese scholarship, which balanced the British approaches he saw at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Ch 7, "T.F. Tsiang and Modernization," in Fairbank, ''Chinabound'', pp. 85-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilma Denio Cannon, a daughter of [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and sister of [[Marian Cannon Schlesinger]], came to China to marry Fairbank and began a career of her own in Chinese art history. He and Wilma came to know to a number of Chinese intellectuals, and they became especially warm friends with [[Liang Sicheng]], the son of the distinguished Chinese reformer [[Liang Qichao]], and his wife, [[Lin Huiyin]], whom they called Phyllis.

The Lins introduced them to [[Jin Yuelin]], a philosopher trained at Columbia University. Fairbank wrote later that he and Wilma began to sense through them that the Chinese problem was the "necessity to winnow the past and discriminate among things foreign, what to preserve and what to borrow...."&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, ''Chinabound'', pp. 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Oxford awarded him a [[D.Phil.]] for his [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f979501b-c1ac-42f6-81f7-49ebf935adae thesis], which he revised and eventually published as ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842-1854'' in 1953.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Early career==
Fairbank returned to Harvard in 1936 to take up a position teaching [[Chinese history]] and was its first full-time specialist at Harvard. He and [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] worked out a year-long introductory survey covering China and Japan and later Korea and Southeast Asia. The course was known as "Rice Paddies," and it became the basis for two influential texts: ''East Asia: The Great Tradition'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1960) and ''East Asia: The Modern Transformation'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1965).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Evans, ''John Fairbank and the American Understanding of Modern China'', pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War]] in 1941, Fairbank was enlisted to work for the [[US government]], which included service in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]] in [[Chongqing]], the temporary capital of [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Nationalist China]].

==Chinese studies==
===Development of field===
When he returned to Harvard after the war, Fairbank inaugurated a master's degree program in [[area studies]], one of several major universities in the United States to do so. That approach at Harvard was multi-disciplinary and aimed to train journalists, government officials, and others who did not want careers in academia. That broad approach, combined with Fairbank's experience in China during the war, shaped his ''United States and China'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, Foreign Policy Library, 1948). That survey went through new editions in 1958 and 1970, each synthesizing scholarship in the field for both students and the general public. In 1972, in preparation for [[Nixon]]'s visit, the book was read by leaders on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Evans,  pp. 106-112, 172-176, 281-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of pro-communism===
In the late 1940s, Fairbank was among the so-called [[China Hands]], who predicted the victory of [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and advocated establishing relations with the new government. Although Fairbank argued that relations with new China would be in the American national interest, the [[China Lobby]] and many other Americans accused the China Hands of selling out an ally and promoting the spread of communism and of Soviet influence; that was during an intensification of the [[Cold War]]. In 1949, Fairbank was targeted for being "soft" on Communism, and he was denied a visa to visit Japan. In 1952, he testified before the [[McCarran Committee]], but his secure position at Harvard protected him. Ironically, many of Fairbank's Chinese friends and colleagues who returned to China after 1949, such as [[Fei Xiaotong]], Ch'ien Tuan-sheng, and [[Chen Han-seng]], would later be attacked for being "pro-American," as the Chinese Communist Party became more rigidly communist.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Critics in Taiwan charged that he was a tool of the Communists.{{sfnb|GordonChang|1970}}

===Scholarship and influence===
Fairbank taught at Harvard until he retired in 1977. He published a number of both academic and non-academic works on China, many of which would reach a wide audience outside academia. He also published an expanded revision of his doctoral dissertation as ''Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast'' in 1953. One of his students, [[Paul Cohen]], noted that the approaches or stages in the development of China studies of the 1950s are sometimes referred to as "the Harvard 'school' of China studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Cohen  |first =  Paul |year = 1984 |title = Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past|publisher = Columbia University Press| location = New York; London: |isbn = 023152546X|ref = none}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzLhbITD4bgC&amp;pg=PT179&amp;dq=Cohen+discovering+history+fairbank+school&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KXtXVfK6GIScyQSKi4DgAw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=school&amp;f=false p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairbank played a major role in developing Harvard as a leading American center for East Asian studies, including establishing the Center for East Asian Research, which was renamed to the [[Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies]] after his retirement.  He was its director from 1955 to 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Suleski, Ronald Stanley. (2005). ''The Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University'', pp. 11-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairbank raised money to support fellowships for graduate students, trained influential China historians at Harvard, and placed them widely in universities and colleges in the US and overseas. He welcomed and funded researchers from all over the world to spend time in Cambridge and hosted a series of conferences, which brought scholars together and yielded publications, many of which Fairbank edited himself. He established the Harvard East Asian Series, which published monographs to enable students to publish dissertations, which was essential for achieving tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Goldman, ''Fairbank Remembered'' includes many reminiscences of students and colleagues.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbank and his colleagues at Harvard, Edwin O. Reischauer and Albert Craig, wrote a textbook on China and Japan, ''A History of East Asian Civilization''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL14886214M/history_of_East_Asian_civilization  ''A History of East Asian Civilization'' infosite], openlibrary.org; accessed June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbank established links to figures in government both by training journalists, government officials, and foundation executives and by giving his thoughts to the government on policy on China.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1966, Fairbank and the [[Sinologist]] [[Denis C. Twitchett]], then at [[Cambridge University]], set in motion plans for ''[[The Cambridge History of China]]''. Originally intended to cover the entire history of China in six volumes, the project grew until it reached a projected 15 volumes. Twitchett and Fairbank divided the history, with Fairbank editing volumes on modern (post-1800) China, and Twitchett and others took responsibility for the period from the Qin to the early Qing dynasties. Fairbank edited and wrote parts of Volumes 10 to 15, the last of which appeared in the year after his death. Martha Henderson Coolidge and Richard Smith completed and published Fairbank's biography of H.B. Morse.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Accusations of US imperialism===
During the [[Vietnam War]] in the late 1960s, Fairbank, who had earlier been criticized as being pro-communist, came under fire from younger scholars and graduate students in the new [[Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars]], which he had helped form but then soon ended his participation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Madsen, "The Academic China Specialists," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tIQOv2vnCFIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Committee%20of%20Concerned%20Asian%20Scholars&amp;f=false American Studies of Contemporary China]'' (New York: ME Sharpe, 1993): 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger scholars charged that Fairbank and other leaders of the area studies movement had helped to justify American imperialism in Asia. By his grounding the study of Asia in [[modernization theory]], Fairbank and other liberal scholars presented China as an irrational country, which needed American tutelage. Since Fairbank rejected revolution, he condoned imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Peck, ''The Roots of Rhetoric,''  ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' [http://criticalasianstudies.org/assets/files/bcas/v02n01.pdf 2.1 (October 1969)], p. 61, reprinted in Edward Friedman and Mark Selden, (ed.),''America's Asia: Dissenting Essays on Asian-American Relations'' (New York: Random House, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; A further charge was that scholars of the Harvard School had put forth a "radical new version" of China's modern history that argued imperialism "was largely beneficial in China." {{sfnb|Esherick|1972| p= 9}}

In December 1969, [[Howard Zinn]] and other members of the Radical Historians' Caucus attempted to persuade the [[American Historical Association]] to pass an anti-Vietnam War resolution. A later report said a "debacle unfolded as Harvard historian (and AHA president in 1968) John Fairbank literally wrestled the microphone from Zinn's hands",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2010/1002/1002tim1.cfm "Forty Years On: Looking Back at the 1969 Annual Meeting" by Carl Mirra in the February 2010 issue of ''Perspectives on History'' published by the American Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; in what Fairbank called "our briefly-famous Struggle for the Mike."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/1970/7006/7006tim1.cfm From the June 1970 AHA Newsletter "Professional Comment and Controversy: An Open Letter to Howard Zinn"], historians.org; accessed June 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Fairbank finished the manuscript of his final book, ''China: A New History'' in the summer of 1991. On September 14, 1991 he delivered the manuscript to [[Harvard University Press]], then returned home and suffered a fatal heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Wilma, and their two daughters, Laura Fairbank Haynes and Holly Fairbank Tuck.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Gonzalez|title=John K.

{{nihongo|'''Julia Chang'''|ジュリア・チャン|Juria Chan|lead=yes}} is a  character in the ''[[Tekken]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s by [[Namco]], where she was introduced in ''[[Tekken 3]]'' in 1997. Julia is an adopted daughter of a part-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], part-Chinese fighter named [[Michelle Chang (Tekken)|Michelle Chang]] and her storyline typically involves saving her tribe's forest. An alternative version of the character is a masked female [[lucha libre]] wrestler known as {{nihongo|'''Jaycee'''|ジェイシー|Jeishī}}, or just '''J.C.''', appearing [[Anonymity|incognito]] in ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]''.

==Design and gameplay==
Julia Chang is a young American woman with brown hair that she usually ties into braids. She made her debut in ''[[Tekken 3]]'' at the age of 18, measuring 165&amp;nbsp;cm and 54&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=cvg/&gt; Julia uses various [[Chinese martial arts]], with many techniques similar to those of her mother.&lt;ref name=psp&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Julia Chang: chico nueovos el barrio|url=|journal=PlayStation Power Especial Trucos: Tekken 3|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like her mother, Julia usually dons a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]-stylized outfit, with a crop top, a short denim skirt, cowboy boots, and a small Native American feathered headdress (this headdress is absent in ''[[Tekken 4]]''). As Julia becomes a member of a reforestation group starting in ''Tekken 4'', she gains a researcher outfit, wearing glasses also.

In ''Tekken 3'', Julia is quite similar to Michelle, but needs more skill and perseverance from the player to achieve best results.&lt;ref name=psp/&gt; According to ''[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]'', "as well as lots of surprisingly powerful wrestling-style throws, Julia also has some fast kick [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Computer_and_Video_Games_Issue_198_1998-05_EMAP_Images_GB#page/n19/mode/1up/ |title=Computer and Video Games - Issue 198 (1998-05) (EMAP Images) (GB) |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CVG'' guide to ''Tekken 3'' states she "relies on quick stabbing attacks and floating combos to gradually wear down her opponent" and the aspect that makes her particularly "annoying to fight against is that she has lots of variations of the same attacks, and it takes some practice before [one] can anticipate her next move," as Julia players can mix these combos up to "really confuse" their opponents.&lt;ref name=cvg&gt;''Computer and Video Games'' issue 202 (9/1998), page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'', Julia is a "raw fury" whose her speed and her many combos might allow her to defeat any opponent. Julia lacks punching power, but she is able to perform quick combos and has many moves to perform juggle combos. She must be played aggressively but cautious and unpredictable, as she is very sensitive to counter-attacks, and as such it might take a lot of work to learn to play her right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallée|first=Aymeric|date=December 2000|title=Guide: Tekken Tag Tournament|url=|journal=PlayPower|volume=HS 8|pages=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, because of her "relatively small move list and her need to juggle to inflict real damage", Julia requires "the right amount of patience" in order to master her in ''Tekken 4''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tekken 4: Prima's Official Strategy Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Tekken 6]]'', [[IGN]] considered her to have particularly many powerful mid-level attacks and to be one of the swiftest characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/748466/page_28.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224185053/http://guides.ign.com/guides/748466/page_28.html |archivedate=2009-12-24 |title=Tekken 6 Guide &amp; Walkthrough - PlayStation 3 (PS3) - IGN |publisher=Guides.ign.com |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==
=== In video games ===
As a baby, Julia was abandoned in Native American lands and was found by [[Michelle Chang (Tekken)|Michelle Chang]], who brought her up with love and taught her martial arts so she too could protect her homeland. Even though she is only an adopted daughter of Michelle, they share very similar appearance to the extent that she becomes the target of [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]]'s affections primarily because of her resemblance to Michelle.

Julia studied [[archaeology]] in Michelle's tribal lands. When she turned eighteen, stories of sudden disappearances of martial artists around the world reached the tribe. The tribe knew that they were caused by the [[Ogre (Tekken)|God of Fighting]] and feared that Michelle's pendant was the cause. Michelle went to Japan to ask [[Heihachi Mishima]] for having pursued the pendant years before, but she did not return. Julia suspected Heihachi and entered [[Tekken 3|the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3]] to seek the truth.

Fearing that the rapidly growing global ecosystem would threaten her homeland, Julia joined a genetic research group headed by Professor T that studied the biological mechanism of reforestation. The group worked closely with G Corporation, whose high-tech computers were being used to store the data of the research. However, the research came to an abrupt halt when Mishima Zaibatsu broke to G Corporation and stole all of their data. Knowing that she needed the data to save her home, Julia entered [[Tekken 4|the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4]] to take back the forest rejuvenation data. She failed to obtain it and tried to resume her research, but was always reminded that without the data, her research was futile. One day, Julia received a letter in a foreign language that announced [[Tekken 5|the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5]]. She signed in, hoping to once again retrieve the data. 

After finally retrieving her stolen data, Julia completed her research and went back to [[Arizona]] to meet with the group that would help her realize her plan. She also met with an old woman who claimed that she could hear the spirits. She helped Julia with the rejuvenation program, but just before the latter left, she gave an ominous warning that [[Jin Kazama]] and [[Kazuya Mishima]] were not allowed to clash, since doing so would resurrect [[List of Tekken characters#Azazel|a great evil]] that would end the world. To prevent this from happening, Julia decided to enter [[Tekken 6|the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6]].

Julia appears as a playable character in the non-canonical games ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'' and ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]'', as well as in ''[[Tekken Card Challenge]]'', and makes a cameo appearance in the spin-off game ''[[Death by Degrees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psxextreme.com/ps2-guides/190.html |title=Death By Degrees Walkthrough |publisher=Psxextreme.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia also appears as a playable character in the crossover game ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'', where her official partner is [[Bob (Tekken)|Bob]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hussain |first=Tamoor |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/318545/street-fighter-x-tekken-video-shows-rufus-zangeif-julia/ |title=News: Street Fighter X Tekken video shows Rufus, Zangeif, Julia |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where [[Chun-Li]] gave her classic outfit after they have become friends through studying [[Shorinji Kempo|Chinese kempo]] together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/sfxtk_en/system.html |title=Capcom：Street Fighter X Tekken｜System |publisher=Capcom.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaycee has been also playable in place of Julia in the free-to-play game ''[[Tekken Revolution]]'' as part of an update.

The ''Tekken'' series' producer [[Katsuhiro Harada]] confirmed that "Jaycee" is actually a pun on the name Julia Chang (removing her mask in the games customization feature changes her name back to Julia in-game).&lt;ref name=details/&gt; In ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'', Julia gains some luchador moves, while still keeping most of the moves she had in ''Tekken 6''. Some of the attacks removed from Julia's move list in the game are given to Michelle.

The '''Fire Mummies''' of the [[Philippines]], also known as the''' [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]] Mummies''', [[Benguet]] Mummies, or [[Ibaloi]] Mummies, are a group of [[mummies]] found along the mountain slopes of  [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when [[Spain]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]]. Today, they remain in natural [[caves]] and a museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]].

== Description ==

[[Scientists]] believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] between 1200 and 1500 [[AD]] in five towns in [[Benguet]] and buried in [[caves]]. Others believe that the process of [[mummification]] began at 2000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="made"/&gt; What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of [[mummification]]. That mummification began shortly before a person [[death|died]], where he would [[digestion|digest]] a very salty drink. After his death, his [[corpse]] was washed and set over a [[fire]] in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. [[Smoke]] from [[tobacco]] was blown into the [[mouth]] to dry the body's inside and [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]]. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mummies-of-the-philippines |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Dylan |author2=Treeswithknees |author3=Nicholas Jackson |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2070/|title = Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves|date = |accessdate = September 13, 2014|website = |publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of that mummification ended, since [[Spaniards]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="made"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |title=Kabayan Mummies |at=When were they made |website=Mummy Tombs |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001028161032/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |archivedate=28 October 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===

When the Fire Mummies were 'discovered' in the early 20th century by Westerners (the mummies have been known to local communities for hundreds of years), many of them were [[Grave robbery|stolen]], because the [[caves]] were mostly unprotected. Because of this, Monument Watch, a [[nonprofit organization]], declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paperdue.com/essay/Fire-Mummies-of-the-6468 |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Paperdue |date=November 2010 |website=PaperDue.com |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==

After [[logging]] operations intensified in the area, the location of many [[caves]] became known. Unfortunately this has led to [[looting]], as unconscientious visitors have been eager to leave their mark, including [[graffiti]], on the Kabayan mummies. The Kabayan Mummies were listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. Funding through [[American Express]] was used for emergency conservation and the creation of a comprehensive management plan. Additionally, local authorities from surrounding municipalities collaborated in cultural awareness campaign to introduce the Mummies to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. [[tourism|Tourist]] facilities were also constructed in order to control visitation and prevent harmful intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/project/kabayan-mummy-caves |website=World Monuments Fund |title=Kabayan Mummy Caves |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fire Mummies remain in natural [[caves]] with relatively small security and have been designated as one of the 100 world's most endangered heritage sites. Officials know 50-80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations because of their fear of [[vandalism]]. A small museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Benguet]] also displays a few mummies.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

== Declarations ==
The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves are listed as National Cultural Treasures by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 374. It is also under consideration as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Scholars are also pushing for the inclusion of the mummy burial caves in neighboring [[Buguias, Benguet|Buguias]] town in the ''Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves'' nomination of the Philippines in the UNESCO Tentative List. The caves in Buguias is home to one of Benguet's folk hero, Apo Anno. The burial caves in Kabayan and Buguias will collectively be called as the Benguet Mummy Burial Caves or Mummy Burial Caves in Kabayan and Buguias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''La Corona''' is the name given by archaeologists to an ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] court residence in Guatemala's [[Petén (department)|Petén]] department that was discovered in 1996, and later identified as the long-sought "'''Site Q'''", the source of a long series of unprovenanced limestone reliefs of exceptional artistic quality. The site's Classical name appears to have been Sak-Nikte' ('White-Flower').

==The search for 'Site Q'==
During the 1960s looted Maya reliefs referring to a then-unknown city surfaced on the international art market. One of these reliefs, showing a ball player, is now in the Chicago Art Institute; another is in the Dallas Museum of Art. [[Peter Mathews (archaeologist) |Peter Mathews]], then a Yale graduate student, dubbed the city "Site Q" (short for ''¿Qué?'' [Spanish for "what?"]). Some researchers believed that the inscriptions referred to [[Calakmul]], but the artistic style of the artifacts was different from anything that had been found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vallartatribune.blogspot.com/2011/03/maya-civilization.html|title=Vallarta Tribune: The Maya Civilization|first=Vallarta|last=Tribune|date=22 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Santiago Billy and Carlos Catalan, environmentalists studying scarlet macaws, came upon the remote ruins in 1996, and [[Ian Graham]] and [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] from [[Harvard University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] investigated the site the following year, naming the new site La Corona. Among the broken sculptures left by looters, Stuart found textual references to a place name and to historical figures that were featured on Site Q artifacts, leading him to believe that La Corona was Site Q. 

In 2005 Marcello A. Canuto, then a [[Yale University|Yale]] professor, found a panel in situ at La Corona that mentioned two Site Q rulers. The panel had been quarried from the same rock as the Site Q artifacts, providing convincing evidence that La Corona was indeed Site Q. [[Image:LaCoronaPanel1-2a-lg R.jpg|right|300px|thumb|SMU graduate student Stanley Guenter cleans a panel of [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] discovered at La Corona. This particular panel helped point to La Corona as the long-sought "Site Q".  The panel's left side depicts king [[K'inich Yook]] of [[Sak Nikte']].]]

==Recent research==
Since 2008, the site has been investigated by the [http://mari.tulane.edu/PRALC La Corona Archaeological Project (PRALC)] co-directed by Marcello A. Canuto (Director, [http://mari.tulane.edu Middle American Research Institute] at Tulane University) and Tomás Barrientos (Director, Dept. of Archaeology, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala). 

In April 2012, PRALC discovered a row of 12 staircase risers with many different relief scenes; another 10 sculpted risers were found looted from their original context but then discarded for being too eroded to be worth selling on the illicit antiquities market. 

The texts of these newly discovered panels contain important historical information about political events in the Classic period; one of the panels (Hieroglyphic Staircase 2, Block 5) contains a reference to 4 Ahau 3 K'ank'in, the notorious 13th baktun-ending.

==La Corona and its history==
Research focuses on the relationship between the powerful kingdom of [[Calakmul]] and La Corona.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 100-113&lt;/ref&gt; 

A famous sculpted panel (now in the Dallas Museum of Art) depicts two large palanquins each carrying a royal woman from Calakmul, one standing in a temple pavilion, the other overshadowed by a supernatural protector; the text, however, refers to three women who came from Calakmul's ruling dynasty to marry the kings of La Corona. [[File:Maya Royal throne effigy DMA 1988-15-McD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Two palanquins, Dallas Museum of Art]]

In AD 721, a daughter of the Calakmul king ([[Yuknoom Took' K'awiil]]) was married off to a king of La Corona.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel and Guenther 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Four decades earlier, in 679 AD, a daughter of Calakmul's powerful [[Yuknoom Ch'een]] had already been given in marriage to a La Corona king. Another, newly discovered relief mentions a visit in between these two dates, in 696, by another Calakmul king ([[Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ahk']]), following Calakmul's defeat by Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Bueche 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Baluschek Peterchens Mondfahrt Einband 1915.jpg|thumb|180px|Original book cover from 1915]]
'''''Little Peter's Journey to the Moon''''' ([[German language|German]] '''''Peterchens Mondfahrt''''') is a [[fairy tale]] written by German author and playwright [[Gerdt von Bassewitz]]. It was first performed as a play in [[Leipzig]] in 1912 and appeared in 1915 as a storybook for children with illustrations by [[Hans Baluschek]]. A 2007 English translation names the book '''''Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bassewitz|first1=Gerdt|title=Peter and Anneli's Journey to the Moon|date=2007|publisher=Bell Pond Books|location=Great Barrington, MA|isbn=978-0880105842|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the story of Little Peter and his sister Anneli, who help a [[Cockchafer|May beetle]] named Mr. Zoomzeman (German: ''Herr Summsemann'') to retrieve his missing sixth leg from the moon. After a fantastic and dangerous overnight adventure they recover the leg and are returned to their beds at home.

== Plot ==
A thief, stealing wood in the forest, had cut off Mr. Zoomzeman’s great-great grandfather's sixth leg many years before. The Night Fairy banished the thief to the moon as punishment, but he took the leg with him, causing later generations of the Zoomzeman family to only have five legs.

The current Mr. Zoomzeman can break the curse and recover his missing leg if he finds two children who are pure of heart and have never been cruel to animals. He enters the house of Little Peter and his younger sister Anneli (''Anneliese'') and tells them the story. They promise to help him retrieve the lost leg. Mr. Zoomzeman teaches them a magical chant that allows them to fly and they set off for the moon.

On the moon they meet the [[Sandman]], who looks after the star children, each corresponding to a child on Earth. As their own stars are untarnished and shine brightly it proves Peter and Anneli are pure of heart. The Sandman is impressed and offers to take the three heroes to the Night Fairy's tea party at her castle.

They travel in Sandman's celestial chariot, along the [[milky way]], where the children learn about cosmic phenomena.

Meanwhile, the Night Fairy has invited lots of celestial guests to her midnight party. These include the thunder man (''Donnermann''), the wind bride (''Windliesel''), the cloud woman (''Wolkenfrau''), the lightning witch (''Blitzhexe''), Rainy Fritz (''Regenfritz''), the gale giant (''Sturmriese''), Hail Hans (''Hagelhans''), [[Mother Hulda]] (''Frau Holle''), Ice Max (''Eismax''), the [[vodyanoy]] (''Wassermann''), Mary-of-the-dew (''Taumariechen''), [[morning glory]] (''Morgenröte''), the [[afterglow]] (''Abendröte''), the [[Sirius|morning star]] (''Morgenstern'') and the [[Venus|evening star]] (''Abendstern''). The Guardian of the Milky Way appears and complains about the chaos caused by the guests travelling to the meeting. The guests apologize and offer the guardian gifts.

Sandman and the adventurers arrive, surprising the guests as he is never usually late and by bringing humans. Mr. Zoomzeman's sad story prompts the celestial spirits to offer help. The Night Fairy asks the Guardian of the Milky Way to summon the [[Ursa major|Great Bear]]. Peter, Anneli and Mr. Zoomzeman are carried by the bear to the moon cannon, via a meadow where gifts and sweets are grown for Christmas and past the nest where a hen lays colourful Easter eggs. The cannon fires the adventurers up onto a hill where the lost sixth leg is nailed to a sacred birch tree.

At the tree the heroes are confronted by the Man in the Moon, a cruel, violent cannibal. In the fight to prevent the children from being eaten the celestial spirits attack the Man in the Moon and Peter battles with his wooden toy sword. Anneli summons her and Peter's stars, who blind the Man in the Moon. The evil giant cannot see and gets lost in the deep moon woods.

Little Peter retrieves the sixth leg and Anneli attaches it to the unconscious beetle. Mr. Zoomzeman wakes and is delighted, but they must return to earth immediately to avoid being stuck on the moon forever. He uses an old charm which creates a hole. The children jump into the hole and fall back into their bedroom on Earth.

Dawn breaks and the children open the window to let Mr. Zoomzeman fly away. Their mother enters the bedroom bringing a gift of gingerbread from Father Christmas.

== Background ==
In 2010 a biography of [[Otto Klemperer]] by Eva Weissweiler published in Germany stated that Peter and Anneli were based on the children of [[Oskar Kohnstamm]], in whose sanatorium von Bassewitz had been a patient.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Weissweiler: ''Otto Klemperer: Ein deutsch-jüdisches Künstlerleben'', Köln, 2010, p.85 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Kohnstamm (1908–1995) was the father of [[Angus Konstam]].

== Film Adaptation ==
It was adapted as a German [[animated film]] [[Peter in Magicland]] ([[German language]] title: '''Peterchens Mondfahrt''') in 1990.

{{Linguistics}}

In some theories of syntax and grammar, in particular in the Chomskyan schools of [[government and binding theory]] and the [[minimalist program]], the '''Logical Form''' (abbreviated '''LF''' and conventionally spelled with capital initial letters) of a linguistic expression is a [[mental representation]] of it, derived solely from [[surface structure]]. In the words of [[Noam Chomsky]], LF captures "those aspects of semantic representation that are strictly determined by grammar, abstracted from other cognitive systems".{{sfn|Collinge|1990}} It functions as the interface between grammar and conceptual-intentional properties of language, analogous to how the '''[[phonetic form]]''' (abbreviated '''PF''') is the interface between grammar and the audio-perceptual properties of utterances.

Logical Form is the level of representation that affects the semantic interpretation of a sentence. LF is sometimes referred to as a [[Covert (linguistics)|covert]] level of representation, because the output of this level is not actually pronounced by the speaker.{{sfn|Ouhalla|1999}}

Many theories of syntax do not acknowledge the concept of Logical Form (e.g. [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Dependency grammar|Dependency Grammars]], [[Tree-Adjoining Grammar]], etc.), at least not in the way it is understood in Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program. The postulation of such a level of representation remains a subject of debate.

== Syntax interfacing with semantics ==
The notion of Logical Form was originally invented for the purpose of determining [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] scope. As the theory around the Minimalist program developed, all output conditions, such as theta-criterion, the case filter, Subjacency and [[binding theory]], are examined at the level of LF. The study of LF is more broad than the study of [[syntax]].{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003|pages=607, 633}}

=== The notion of scope ===

The definition of scope was introduced early in the development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only within its own domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting some aspect of the interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-[[pronoun]], quantifier-[[negative polarity item]].

In instances where a negation has an indefinite article in its scope, the reader's interpretation is affected. The reader is not able to infer the existence of a relevant entity. If negation (or a negation phrase) is within the subject quantifier scope, [[negation]] is not affected by the quantifier.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}
If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in the domain of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are in the domain of the other, the structure is potentially ambiguous. If neither QE is in the domain of the other, they must be interpreted independently.{{sfn|Ioup|1975}} These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, ''that every boy left upset a teacher'', it cannot be interpreted as ''for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset by the fact that the boy left''. The only available interpretation is that ''one single teacher was upset''.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}

[[File:LF-everyone loves someone 2.png|thumb|Everyone loves the same someone]][[File:LF-everyone loves someone.png|thumb|Everyone has someone that they love, not necessarily the same person]]

=== Ambiguity motivation ===

In syntax, LF exists to give a structural account of certain kinds of [[semantics|semantic]] ambiguities.

==== Example ====

: ''Everyone loves someone.''

This sentence is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, it contains a [[Free variables and bound variables|scope]] ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since ''someone'', being within the [[verb phrase]], must be lower in the structure than ''everyone''. This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is ''insufficiently specified'' for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order to account for the ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, [[logical form]] in [[logic]].{{sfn|Hanna|2006|pages=50–51}}

== Quantification ==

=== Key historical developments===
There has been discussion about quantification since the 1970s. In 1974, Montague argued that a grammar for a small fragment of English contains the logicosyntactic and semantic devices to handle practically any scope phenomenon.{{sfn|Montague|1974}} The tool that he mainly relied on is categorical syntax with functional application; in terms of recent formulations, it can be considered Minimalist syntax with [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] only. However, this approach does not make predictions for some examples with inverse scope (wide scope in [[object (grammar)|object]] position).

For example, '''''everyone loves someone'''''.

When there is no scope interaction in the relevant portion of the sentence, making either choice shows no difference in semantics.

A short time later, May suggested a different idea.{{sfn|May|1977}} In contrast to Montague, May did not propose any syntax that generates the surface string. He proposed a rule called Quantifier Raising (QR), which explains that movement operations of [[wh-movement]] continue to operate on the level of LF, and each phrase continues to possess the quantifier in its domain. May suggested that QR applies to all quantifier phrases with no exception.

The study of Quantification carried on in the 1980s. In contrast to May and Montague, it was suggested that independently motivated phrase structure, such as the relative clause, imposes a limitation on scope options.{{sfn|Reinhart|1983}}

This clause boundedness somewhat restricts the QR. May also noticed a subject-object asymmetry with respect to the interaction of wh-words and quantifier phrases.{{sfn|May|1985}} A modified version of his past work that QR determines quantifier scope but does not disambiguate it was brought up. To regulate the interaction, The Scope Principle that if two operators govern each other, they can be interpreted in either scopal order was also brought up. However, this solution has eventually been abandoned.

As [[Minimalism]] showed up in 1990s, more studies have been related to Minimalist syntax.{{sfn|Chomsky|1993}} A strategy to remedy the situation is to eliminate QR and the expected scope would be by-products of entirely independent grammatical processes.{{sfn|Hornstein|1995}} The other strategy is to modify QR and show it can be fitted into a Minimalist structure.{{sfn|Beghelli|1993}}{{sfn|Beghelli|Stowell|1997}}

===Quantificational noun phrases===
Danny Fox discusses syntactic positions of QNPs as a way of introducing and illustrating the basic semantic and syntactic relations found in LF.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} By looking at the meaning of QNPs in relation to the property they are given, or their predicate, we can derive the meaning of the whole sentence.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
a. ''A girl is tall.''

b. ''Many girls are tall.''

c. ''Every girl is tall.''

d. ''No girl is tall.''{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}
To understand the Logical Form of these examples, it is important to identify what the basic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate is tall and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

Each of the examples above will have different conditions that make the statement true according to the quantifier that precedes girl.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
'''Truth Value conditions:'''

Example a. ''A girl'' has a truth value of '''true if and only if''' ([[iff]]) at least one girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example b. ''Many girls'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' there are many girls who are tall.  &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with more than 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example c. ''Every girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' every girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that every instance of a person being female, she must be tall.

Example d. ''No girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' no girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that for all instances of a person being female, she must not be tall.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}

In a syntactic tree, the structure is represented as such: "the [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of a QNP is always the sister of the QNP."{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

== WH-movement ==
In linguistics, wh-phrases are operators binding variables at LF, like other quantifier noun phrases. Scope interpretations can be constrained by syntactic constraints as shown in LF when regarding the scope of wh-phrases and quantifiers. When [[wh-movement]] is from the subject position it is unambiguous, but when wh-movement is from the object position it is ambiguous.{{sfn|May|1985}}

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
1) What did everyone buy for Max?

:''[S’ what&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S everyone&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Two possible interpretations: what did everyone

:'''collectively buy''', versus '''individually buy''')

2) Who bought everything for Max?

:''[S’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Only one possible interpretation.)

|}

This example demonstrates the effect of the Path Containment Condition (PCC). An A'-path is a line of dominating nodes that go from the trace to a c-commanding A'-binder. If two of the A'paths intersect then one must be contained in the other. If the paths are overlapping without having one being contained in the other, then it is ill-formed. (2)'s paths are overlapping, violating PCC, therefore in order to obtain a grammatical LF structure, everything needs to join the VP. The LF structure then becomes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: LF REPRESENTATION:
:[s’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [s e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [vp everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [vp bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]
  |}

== Cross-linguistic examples==

=== Hungarian ===

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The tree to show the Hungarian data in support of Beghelli and Stowell.png|thumb|right|The tree structure has been abbreviated. It is to show the linear relation between three QP: ''Öt orvos'', ''minden betegnek'', and ''kevés új tablettát'']] --&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: Öt orvos minden betegnek kevés új tablettát írt fel.
: five doctor every patient-Dat few new pill-Acc wrote up

|
:  *Öt orvos kevés betegnek minden új tablettát írt fel.
: five doctor few patient-Dat every new pill-Acc wrote up
: ''"There are five doctors x such that for some patient y,x prescribed a new pill to y. "''
|}

In the sentence, ''"Five doctors prescribed few new pills to every patient."'', the scope in Hungarian is largely disambiguated by the linear order of quantifiers on the surface. Two facts that should be kept in mind are (1) the linear order is not obtained by putting quantifiers together in the desired order, which contradicts the predictions made by Montague or May's theory; (2) the linear order is not determined by case or grammatical functions, which supports the prediction of Hornstein's theory. {{sfn|Szabolcsi|2002}}

=== Chinese ===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The syntax tree to clarify the Logical Form in Mandarin data.png|thumb|left|The tree structure is highly abbreviated. It is to show the relative position of two QP in the first Mandarin sentence. QP ''liangge nuren'' takes a higher position, in AgrSP, than QP ''meiben shu'', in AgrOP.]] --&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: 1. Yaoshi liangge nuren  du  guo meiben shu...
:     if      two   women read Asp every book
:  i. ''"if there are two women who read every book..."''
:  ii. ''"*if for every book, there are two women who read it... "''
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: 2. Yaoshi liangge xiansuo bei meigeren zhaodao...
:      if     two     clues  by  everyone  found
:  i. ''"if there are two clues that are found by everyone... "''
:  ii. ''"if for everyone, there are two clues she or he finds... "''
|}

The significance of A-chains has been emphasized in the Chinese language. Scope in Chinese is disambiguated by case positions in some examples. {{sfn|Aoun|Li|1993}} In this example, the active sentence only has subject wide scope, but the passive sentence is ambiguous. The active sentence only has one interpretation: 
if there are two women who read every book, which is in the subject wide scope. According to Aoun and Li, Chinese does not have VP-internal subjects, thus, ''liangge nuren'' cannot be reconstructed in LF. So the sentence has no ambiguous interpretation. However, the passive sentence has two interpretations, 1. everyone finds the same two clues; 2. everyone finds two clues, while two clues can be different ones. That is because ''liangge xiansuo'' is in VP-internal complement position, then in LF, it can be reconstructed. So the passive sentence has two different interpretations.

: ii.For every tree there is a boy, who may be different for each tree, that climbed tree X.
|}

This phrase is ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe be different for each tree takes a narrow scope.

[[File:Parque_Yaxha_Nakum_Naranjo_Templo_Guatemala_03.JPG|right|200px|thumb| Temple E in Nakum;construction dates from the Late Classic period]]
'''Nakum''' ("House of the pot") is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]], and a former ceremonial center and city of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. It is located in the northeastern portion of the [[Petén Basin]] region, in the modern-day [[Guatemala]]n department of [[Petén (department)|Petén]]. The northeastern Petén region contains a good number of other significant [[List of Maya sites|Maya sites]], and Nakum is one of the three sites forming the [[Cultural Triangle Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park|Cultural Triangle]] of  "[[Yaxha]]-Nakum-[[Naranjo]]". Nakum is approximately {{convert|17|km|mi|1}} to the north of Yaxha and some {{convert|25|km|mi|1}} to the east of [[Tikal]], on the banks of the [[Holmul River (Guatemala)|Holmul River]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler (2006, p.374)&lt;/ref&gt; Its main features include an abundance of  visibly restored [[Maya architecture|architecture]], and the [[roof comb]] of the site's main temple structure is one of the best-preserved outside Tikal.

==History==

This city has evidence of occupation dating from the Middle Preclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. For the most part of the Classic period, Nakum appeared to be subordinate to Tikal. Nakum particularly flourished during the Late Classic (c. 8th century—10th century), due to its strategic situation north of Holmul river which was an important [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade and communication route]] during this era. All the visible architecture belongs to this period, there are 15 [[stela]]e, Structure A with a [[Triadic pyramid|triadic top]], form along with structure C an astronomical complex. Structure V has vaults and vertical walls. Outside [[Tikal]], it shows the largest corpus of ancient [[Maya script]] [[graffiti]] in a Classic Maya site. Nakum reached its apogee in the Terminal Classic period and might have achieved political independence around this time. However, it was abandoned soon after its apogee.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ancient Maya" by R. J. Sharer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site description and architecture ==
The site of Nakum may be divided into two main sectors, North and South, connected by a causeway named after Perigny.  The Northern sector contains many impressive buildings, but it has been comparatively little investigated. The Southern sector is larger in extent, and contains the main Acropolis together with 11 patios and several classes of structures, including a 44-room "palace" (known as the D building). In the center of the southern complex is another elevated Acropolis which provides a clear overview of the other important structures.  This latter Acropolis contains the building known as Structure Y, which by its location can be presumed to have served as the main residential complex for the site's main ruler.

The fact that the main Acropolis was such an important and imposing structure clearly sends a message, in this site the political aspects had considerable weight.  In comparison with the religious architecture which is located at a lower level.   The Temples located in the south of sector at the Central Plaza (Temple A, B and C) form a clear triangle pointing to the north.
Like in Tikal the Central Plaza of Nakum is oriented towards the four directions and located at the south there is the complex of palaces of the city.  Since it is the main plaza of the city it is possible that from the Palace D the ruler and the royals observed the rituals and performances that took place at the plaza.  Next is the East Plaza (it holds Temple V) which for some unknown reason was abandoned, since the Temple is located at the East it clearly shows that particular plaza was related to the sun deity.  Finally the South East Plaza (it holds Temple U) and it has a direct relationship with the main Acropolis.

== Discovery ==
The site today known as Nakum was re-discovered in 1905 by Maurice Perigny. Since then several archaeological and restorative expeditions have been conducted at the site, including an official restoration by Guatemalan authorities which commenced in 1990.

A '''national lidar dataset''' refers to a high-resolution [[lidar]] dataset comprising most—and ideally all—of a nation’s terrain. Datasets of this type typically meet specified quality standards and are publicly available for free (or at nominal cost) in one or more uniform formats from government or academic sources. National LiDAR datasets are used primarily in [[LIDAR Contour Mapping]], and also for forestry, urban and rural planning, recreational, environmental, engineering, and geological studies and planning, among others.

Countries with national lidar datasets either completed or in progress include:

'''Paleolinguistics''' is a term used by some linguists for the study of the distant human past by [[Linguistics|linguistic]] means. For most [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] there is no separate field of paleolinguistics. Those who use the term are generally advocates of hypotheses not generally accepted by mainstream historical linguists, a group colloquially referred to as "long-rangers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/309831596|title=In hot pursuit of language in prehistory : essays in the four fields of anthropology : in honor of Harold Crane Fleming|date=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Pub|others=Bengtson, John D., Fleming, Harold Crane, 1926-|isbn=9789027232526|location=Amsterdam|oclc=309831596}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Background ==
The controversial hypotheses in question fall into two categories. Some of them involve the application of standard historical linguistic methodology in ways that raise doubts as to the validity of the hypothesis. A good example of this sort is the Moscow school of Nostraticists, founded by [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and including [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]],  [[Sergei Starostin]], and [[Vitaly Shevoroshkin]], who have argued for the existence of  [[Nostratic]], a language family including the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Elamo-Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], and [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] language families and sometimes other languages. They have established regular phonological correspondences, observed morphological similarities, and reconstructed a proto-language in accordance with the accepted methodology. Nostratic is not generally accepted, in part because critics have doubts about the accuracy of the correspondences and reconstruction.

== Other hypotheses ==
Other hypotheses are controversial because the methods used to support them are considered by mainstream historical linguists to be invalid in principle. Into that category fall proposals based on [[mass comparison]], a technique in which relationships are postulated on basis of sets of words resembling each other in sound and meaning, without establishing phonological correspondences or carrying out a reconstruction.

Prominent examples are the work of [[Joseph Greenberg]] and [[Merritt Ruhlen]]. Most linguists reject that method as unable to distinguish similarities from common ancestry from those from [[loan word|borrowing]] or chance.

== Paleolinguists ==
Other linguists who may be considered paleolinguists due to their advocacy of long-range hypotheses include: 
[[John Bengtson]], [[Knut Bergsland]], [[Derek Bickerton]], [[Václav Blažek]],  [[Robert Caldwell]], [[Matthias Castrén]],  [[Björn Collinder]], [[Albert Cuny]], [[Igor Diakonov]], [[Vladimir Dybo]],  [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]], [[Eugene Helimski]], [[Otto Jespersen]], [[Frederik Kortlandt]],  [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E. Martin]], [[Roy Andrew Miller]], [[Hermann Möller]], [[Susumu Ōno]],  [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]], [[Alexis Manaster Ramer]], [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G.J. Ramstedt]], [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]],  [[Jochem Schindler]], [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]],  [[Georgiy Starostin]], [[Morris Swadesh]], [[Henry Sweet]],  [[Vilhelm Thomsen]], [[Vladimir N. Toporov]], [[Alfredo Trombetti]],  [[C.C. Uhlenbeck]]. 

An entirely different point of view underlies [[Mario Alinei]]'s [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]], which is based on the doctrine of [[Polygenesis (linguistics)|polygenism]] rather than that of [[Proto-Human language|monogenesis]]. 

== In fiction ==
The first novel that dealt with the theme of paleolinguistics and Proto-Nostratic is U.S. author Armen Melikian's award-winning Journey to Virginland, first released in 2010. Melikian's work covers several pages of review of the Proto-Nostratic hypothesis and a putative link to ancient Egyptian and [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] or mythology of the proto-historical layers of an ancient epic, known as The [[Daredevils of Sassoun]], preserved in an ethno-geographic isolate near Lake Van in ancient Armenia.

The mystery novel [[The Ekkos Clan]] written by [[Sudipto Das]] and released in July 2013 used Linguistic Paleontology, perhaps for the first time in popular fiction, as the tool to decipher, supposedly, the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European Language]], linguistic fossils of which were shown to be preserved in the folk-tales in a family through generations for thousands of years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">'''Part–whole theory''' is the name of a loose collection of historical theories, all informal and nearly all unwitting, relating wholes to their parts via inclusion. Part–whole theory has been overtaken by [[mereology]].

[[Metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]], has invoked part–whole concepts ever since [[Aristotle]] founded the subject.

[[Husserl]] (1970) (German original first published in 1901) was the first to consciously elaborate a part–whole theory (on which see Tieszen 1995). However he employed no [[symbolic logic|symbolism]] or logic, even though his doctorate was in mathematics and [[Georg Cantor]] was his friend and colleague; Husserl wrote only for his fellow philosophers.

19th century mathematicians became dimly aware that they were invoking a part–whole theory of sorts only after Cantor and [[Peano]] first articulated [[set theory]]. Before then, mathematicians often confused [[subset|inclusion]] and membership. Grattan-Guinness (2000) appears to have been the first to draw attention to this unwitting part–whole theory.

[[Peano]] was among the first to articulate clearly the distinction between membership in a given set, and being a subset of that set. A subset of a set is usually not also a member of that set. However, the members of a subset are all members of the set. In set theory, a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] cannot be identified with its member. In part–whole theory and mereology, this identification necessarily holds.

The Cantor–[[Peano]] concept of [[set theory|set]] did not become canonical until about 1910, when the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' appeared, and right after [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatization of set theory]] in 1908. 

Starting in 1916, and culminating in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] published several books invoking part–whole concepts of varying degrees of formality; see [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]].

Part–whole theory has been superseded by a collection of fully formal theories called [[mereology]], [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]]'s term for a formal part–whole theory he began expositing in 1912. Over the course of the 20th century, a number of Polish logicians and mathematicians contributed to this "Polish mereology." Even though Polish mereology is now only of historical interest, the word "mereology" endures as the name of a collection of [[first order theory|first order theories]] relating parts to their respective wholes. These theories, unlike set theory, can be proved [[sound]] and [[complete (complexity)|complete]].

Nearly all work that has appeared since 1970 under the heading of [[mereology]] descends from the 1940 calculus of individuals of [[Henry Leonard (philosopher)|Henry Leonard]] and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Simons (1987) is a survey of mereology aimed at philosophers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">'''''Prince Prigio''''' is a literary and comic [[fairy tale]] written by [[Andrew Lang]] in 1889, and illustrated by [[Gordon Browne]].  It draws in Lang's folklorist background for many tropes. 

A sequel was published in 1893, ''Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son''. The two were issued in one 1895 volume as ''My Own Fairy Book: Namely, Certain Chronicles of Pantouflia, As Notably the Adventures of Prigio, Prince of That Country, and of His Son, Ricardo, with an Excerpt from the Annals of Scotland, As Touching Ker of Fairnilee, His Sojourn with the Queen of Faery''. All three books were published by J. W. Arrowsmith of Bristol. ''My Own Fairy Book'' appeared during the run of "[[Coloured Fairy Books]]" edited by Lang and published in London and New York by [[Longmans, Green, and Co.]] from 1890: ''The Blue Fairy Book'', ''The Red Fairy Book'', and so on. Longmans was also the US publisher of the Pantouflia books.

The two stories were also published together as ''The Chronicles of Pantouflia'' by Little, Brown and Company in 1942, with illustrations by Robert Lawson, and by [[David R. Godine]] in 1981. &lt;!-- nothing special about this issue? --&gt;

==Plot summary==

The plot of ''Prince Prigio'' begins with the introduction of a queen who does not believe in [[fairy|fairies]]. After many childless years, she and the king finally had a boy, Prigio. When the queen refused to invite the fairies to the christening, none of the nobles would attend, and so the king and queen were alone when the fairies arrived and presented the child with gifts. Among the gifts were a never-empty purse ([[Fortunatus' purse]]), [[seven-league boots]], a [[cap of invisibility|cap of darkness]] which would make him invisible, a [[wish]]ing cap, a [[magic carpet]], and also beauty, courage, and luck, but the last fairy decreed, "My child, you shall be too clever!"

This would have pleased the queen, but she did not believe it.  She had all the items swept into a lumber room.  

The prince grew up to be too clever.  He would argue with everyone and knew better than everyone.  He had two younger brothers, neither of whom was clever, and both of whom were liked; they fell in love with their cousins.  The king particularly disliked Prigio, fearing he would claim the throne, and wanted to be rid of him.  One day, a [[Firedrake (mythology)|firedrake]] appeared in the country; the king was sorry that it would kill his second son as well as his first before the [[youngest son]] killed it, but he would sacrifice him to be rid of Prigio.  Prigio, like his mother, refused to believe in its existence and reminded him that it was the youngest son who triumphed, so they should send him at once.  

Alphonse, his youngest brother, went and was eaten; Prigio, still not believing in firedrakes, thought he had gone off to travel.  The king sent Enrico, the second, as well, and he also died.  The king tried to send Prigio, who refused because he still disbelieved in the firedrake and also he was the last surviving heir.  The king decided to take the rest of the court and abandon Prigio alone in the castle.  When they did, Prigio found they also stole every piece of clothing except what he wore.  He searched the castle and found the lumber room with the fairies' gifts.  The seven-league boots bore him to an inn to eat, and he thought he dreamed it.  No one paid any attention to him; he did not know that he was wearing an invisibility cap.  He stole food, and when his cap was knocked off, paid from it from the purse -- which he found still full later.  Whenever his cap came on or off, he appeared or vanished, but did not realize it.  

Still invisible, he went to a ball where everyone spoke badly of him except for one lady, who praised his aiding a poor student, and Prigio fell madly in love with her.  At once, he believed in fairies and magic and realized everything that had happened to them.  He used the things to make himself suitable for the ball and went and met the lady, the daughter of the English Ambassador, Lady Rosalind.  When she spoke of the firedrake, he said he would kill it.  He went back and found a magical spyglass, which he knew from [[Arabian Nights]] and spied out the dragon.  He realized that even with his magical gifts, he had no chance, and his brothers had had none.  He went to library to find [[Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon|a book by Cyrano de Bergerac]] about his trip to the moon.  In it, he read of the [[Remora]], which was as cold as the firedrake was hot; he resolved to find one and make the creatures fight.  He found it using the spyglass, and went both creatures, taunting them in the other's name.  The monsters met, fought, and killed each other.  

He went back to the ambassador's house, and found that his father had issued a proclamation offering a reward for him, and another promising to make the Crown Prince, and marry to his niece, whoever brought the king the firedrake's horns and tail.  He also found that his carpet had vanished, a servant having accidentally wished himself to the royal castle, with the firedrake's horns and tail.

Then the carpet reappeared, with the servant, the king, and the queen, who refused to believe it.  The king refused to be reconciled with Prigio.  He tells how the servant claimed the reward, and when they disbelieved him, show them the carpet.

During the night, the prince went back and cut off the firedrake's hooves.  At court, the servant [[quibble (plot device)|claimed]] that the proclamation had promised the reward to whoever brought the horns and tail, not the dragon-slayer.  Prigio pointed out that if this was allowed, the king could not claim to say one thing and have meant another, which was a royal prerogative.  The niece refused to choose between them.  The king finally said that whoever brought its hooves would receive the reward.  Prigio produced them at once.  

The king insisted that he must marry his cousin, the promised niece, at once, or hang.  Prigio prefers to hang, but suggested that if he recovered his brothers, the king could remit his sentence.  The king agreed.  Prigio went back to the castle where he had been abandoned, killed an old cat he found there, burned it, and restored it to life with the water from the Fountain of Lions -- being certain that the fairies would not have neglected it.  Having thus tested it, he went to the firedrake's lair and restored his brothers; he then went to the remora's and restored the knights it had frozen.  

The king was pleased to see his sons but would not restore Prigio to the Crown Princeship.  Prigio pointed out he had the water and the firedrake's head, and the king agreed.

After a triple wedding, Rosalind suggested to Prigio that he could use the wishing cap and make himself no cleverer than anyone else.  Prigio agreed but thought better of it:  he wished himself to {{em|appear}} no more clever than anyone else.

Alonso, the Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor in the Humanities at [[Columbia University]]. The journal is published semiannually by the [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. It is available online through [[Project MUSE]] and [[JSTOR]].

In 2009, the Council of Editors of Learned Journals awarded the ''Revista Hispánica Moderna'' the 2009 Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celj.org/phoenix|title=Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement|publisher=Council of Editors of Learned Journals|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620041839/http://www.celj.org/phoenix|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The description reads as follows: "This award goes to the most improved journal, regardless of its state at the time the renovations began. A weak journal that has become excellent is eligible, but so too is an admired journal that manages to become dramatically better. Submissions must feature significant editorial change and may also feature change in design and other aspects of the journal's publication."

A keen antiquary, he was author of ''Documents Concerned with the History of Ludlow and the Lords Marchers'' (1841), and president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1852.&lt;ref name=compeerage /&gt;

Clive was deputy-chairman of two early railway companies in Shropshire, the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway.  It was at a directors' meeting of the latter, on 30 December 1853, that he was fatally taken ill.&lt;ref name=ShrewsChron /&gt;

==Family==
Clive married [[Harriet Windsor-Clive, 13th Baroness Windsor|Lady Harriet]], daughter of [[Other Windsor, 5th Earl of Plymouth]], in 1819. They had several children, including [[Robert Windsor-Clive (MP)|Robert Windsor-Clive]] and [[George Windsor-Clive (1835–1918)|George Windsor-Clive]]. After falling ill at a railway company directors' meeting, Clive died in [[Shrewsbury]] in January 1854, aged 65, at the nearby home of the Town Clerk.  He was buried at [[St Mary the Virgin's Church, Bromfield|Bromfield Parish Church]], near his Oakley Park home near Ludlow.&lt;ref name=ShrewsChron /&gt; 

The following year the [[Baron Windsor|barony of Windsor]], which had fallen into [[abeyance]] on his brother-in-law's death in 1833, was called out of abeyance in favour of his widow, Harriett, who became the thirteenth Baroness Windsor in her own right.

'''''Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen'''''|るろうに剣心 追憶編|Rurouni Kenshin: Recollection or Reminiscence}}, is a 1999 [[original video animation]] series directed by [[Kazuhiro Furuhashi]], screenplay-written by Masashi Sogo, scored by [[Taku Iwasaki]], and animated by [[Studio Deen]]. Based on the ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' [[manga]] written and illustrated by [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]], ''Trust &amp; Betrayal'' chronicles the story of [[Himura Kenshin]] as the ''Hitokiri Battōsai'' during the final years of the [[Bakumatsu]] era while also revealing the origins of his cross-shaped scar and exploring his relationship with a woman named [[Yukishiro Tomoe]].

The OVA series was first licensed by ADV Films for VHS and DVD releases in North America and the United Kingdom, and by Madman Entertainment for releases in Australasia, under the title '''''Samurai X: Trust &amp; Betrayal'''''. ''Trust &amp; Betrayal'' was later collected into a two-hour feature-length motion picture with new animated sequences and released theatrically in Japan. In 2003, this feature-length motion picture was eventually released in North America on DVD as a director's cut by ADV Films. After ADV Films' closure, Aniplex of America began licensing the OVA series for Blu-ray Disc releases in North America under its original title: ''Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal''. It has received universal critical acclaim from anime critics, with praise directed towards the story, animation, art, music and Japanese voice acting.

==Plot==
While a raid of bandits slay a group of travelers, a young boy named Shinta is saved from death by a passing swordsman. The swordsman, known as [[Hiko Seijūrō]], is a master of the Hiten Mitsurugi, the strongest of all sword forms. After seeing the boy bury the bodies of not only the travelers but also the bandits, Hiko is impressed and takes Shinta as an apprentice, renaming him "[[Himura Kenshin|Kenshin]]", a name which he felt was more appropriate for a swordsman.

After years of training, Kenshin leaves his master following an argument, convinced that the only way to uphold the Hiten Mitsurugi's pledge to help the weak and innocent is to join the revolution poised to upend the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] [[shogunate]]. He joins the [[Chōshū Domain|Choshu clan]] and soon works for their leader, [[List of Rurouni Kenshin characters#Katsura Kogorō and Takasugi Shinsaku|Katsura Kogorō]], as an assassin. Kenshin soon becomes a hardened killer, feared far and wide as the ''Hitokiri Battōsai''. During a successful assassination, he kills a bodyguard named [[List of Rurouni Kenshin characters#Kiyosato Akira|Kiyosato Akira]]. The encounter with Kiyosato leaves Kenshin with the first half of his cross-shaped scar. After killing a skilled assassin, Kenshin meets a woman named [[Yukishiro Tomoe]], unaware of the fact that she is the fiancée of Kiyosato. Kenshin takes her to the inn where he and the men of the Choshu clan are residing. Katsura suspects a spy among the Choshu after Kenshin informs him of the assassin he killed.

After the [[Ikedaya Incident|Ikedaya affair]], Katsura arranges for Kenshin and Tomoe to hide in the village of Otsu as husband and wife, so the two would not be suspected. After a few months, Tomoe's brother [[Yukishiro Enishi|Enishi]] comes to visit and secretly reveals to his sister that the shogunate agents assigned to track down and kill Kenshin are close by, and that her revenge will be complete. Tomoe sends Enishi off, feeling ill at ease. It is here that Tomoe realizes that she has fallen in love with Kenshin. Kenshin, too, is in love with Tomoe. The next morning, Tomoe leaves the house and tries to deceive the shogunate men into giving up their pursuit of Kenshin and unsuccessfully attempts to kill their leader.

After Tomoe's disappearance, Kenshin is visited by a comrade who tells him that the spy was Tomoe and that she is meeting at that moment with her co-conspirators. He also reveals to Kenshin that she is the fiancée of Kiyosato, the man he killed. Kenshin, however, is unaware that it is this man who is the real spy. While heading to Tomoe's location, a heavily-shocked Kenshin faces and kills three of the four shogunate agents but becomes badly injured due to his traumatized state. While Kenshin is fighting with the leader, Tomoe steps in between the two to protect Kenshin from the killing below. This allows Kenshin to kill his opponent but, in doing so, unintentionally impales Tomoe also. Before her death, she gives him the second part of his cross-shaped wound.

Kenshin, blaming himself for Tomoe's death, swears to fight to bring about the age desired by Katsura, but after that to continue fighting to protect the innocent without killing again. Katsura informs Kenshin that he had a [[Shishio Makoto|new assassin]] kill the real spy. As the Tokugawa shogunate is nearing its end, Kenshin has his first encounter with the [[Shinsengumi]] captains [[Okita Sōji#Okita in Fiction|Okita Sōji]] and his future rival, [[Saitō Hajime (Rurouni Kenshin)|Saitō Hajime]]. It is then revealed that once the [[Bakumatsu]] revolution had ended, the ''Hitokiri Battōsai'' had disappeared without a trace. Then Kenshin returns to the graves of the travelers he buried when he was a child and places Tomoe's scarf on them. Sometime afterwards, Hiko Seijūrō passes by the site and notices the scarf, realizing Kenshin had finally learned his lesson.

==Production==
Daryl Surat of ''[[Otaku USA]]'' stated that this series uses a more "realistic" art style than the television series uses, and that the series has "graphic, bloody violence galore" beginning in the opening sequence.&lt;ref name="Surat36"&gt;Surat, Daryl. "Heart of Steel." ''[[Otaku USA]]''. Volume 4, Number 1. August 2010. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major themes of ''Trust'' is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him.&lt;ref name="Animerica"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best of the West Reviews: Samurai X: Vol. 1 Trust |last=Yañez |first=Rio |journal=[[Animerica]] |date=November 2000 |volume=8 |issue=10 |page=69 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Trust &amp; Betrayal'''s story, animation, art, music and Japanese voice acting have all been heavily praised by various critics and, consequently, the series itself has been widely acknowledged as a masterpiece and one of anime's crowning achievements.&lt;ref name="THEManimereviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal|last=Ross|first=Carlos|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=338|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Director's Cut"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/samurai-x-director%27s-cut|title=Samurai X Director's Cut - Review|last=Crandol|first=Mike|date=2003-05-18|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimenewsnetworkOVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rurouni-kenshin-oav|title=Rurouni Kenshin OAV - Review|last=Dong|first=Bamboo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimenewsnetworkBlu-ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rurouni-kenshin/trust-and-betrayal/blu-ray-limited-edition|title=Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal Blu-Ray - Review|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THEM Anime Reviews gave the entire OVA series a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Tim Jones stating, "powerful, evocative, saddening, and heavily charged, ''Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal'' is a series that goes far beyond its comic-book origins, testing the limits of not only its franchise, but the medium of original video animation as a storytelling device. Furthermore, while it surpasses the original television series in many ways, it remains complementary and insightful to why Kenshin becomes the way he is. After all, nothing builds character quite so well as a stirring tragedy. It doesn't get much more tragic or stirring than this." He summarised the series as "dramatic, tragic, beautiful" and "a sterling example of Japanese animation at its finest".&lt;ref name="THEManimereviews"/&gt;

''Trust &amp; Betrayal'' has received significant praise from [[Anime News Network]] reviewers. Mike Crandol noted it as one of the greatest OVA series of all time, celebrating the new characters designs as well as the fights scenes which were also noted to be "terribly bloody" and beautiful at the same time.&lt;ref name="Director's Cut"/&gt; In his review, Carl Kimlinger described the series as "stirring, devastating, smart, redemptive and pure perfection" and gave the series an 'A+' rating for the subbed version and an 'A' rating for the dub.&lt;ref name="AnimenewsnetworkBlu-ray"/&gt; Bamboo Dong claimed that watching this series would benefit the viewer with a "stunning overall experience" before finishing off that "''Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku Hen'' is a masterpiece, with dramatic visuals and beautiful animation".&lt;ref name="AnimenewsnetworkOVA"/&gt;

''[[Animerica]]'' reviewer Rio Yañez praised ''Trust''{{'}}s "introspective take on violence" as well as its being "chock-full of insane samurai sword fights and free-flying appendages" while avoiding stereotypical [[Freeze-frame shot|freeze frame]] animation. While considering the violence "over the top", he felt it was well handled, avoiding being excessive or gratuitous, and that the action scenes were "well balanced by the lavish background paintings and designs". He did criticize ADV Film's English dub as "kung fu style dubbing", noting that the voice actors frequently mispronounced the Japanese names and left the voice track mildly confusing despite the English script's serious take of the material.&lt;ref name="Animerica"/&gt;

To illustrate, [[DVD Talk]] reviewer Don Houston found the OVA's story and music solid. The director's cut version received positive comments by how the four OVAs were arranged with Houston commenting it "seems more like a movie that stands alone, rather than just the precursor to a long lasting series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Houston, Don|url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/6649/samurai-x-trust-betrayal-directors-cut/|title=Samurai X - Trust &amp; Betrayal (Director's Cut)|publisher= [[DVD Talk]]|date=2003-05-20|accessdate= 2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daryl Surat of ''[[Otaku USA]]'' said that, despite what Dave Riley&lt;!--The source does not state who he is (he's from the Fast Karate podcast), but obviously he is important enough for Surat to mention--&gt; said, viewers should watch the television series before watching ''Trust &amp; Betrayal''. Surat explained that the OVA has "great moments" that a viewer unfamiliar with the television series would not "bat an eye toward."&lt;ref name="Surat36"/&gt;

{{Semantics}}

'''Semantics''' (from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:σημαντικός|σημαντικός]]}} ''sēmantikós'', "significant")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|shmantiko/s|σημαντικός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|σημαντικός}} (''semantikos''), "related to meaning, significant", from {{lang|grc|σημαίνω}} ''semaino'', "to signify, to indicate", which is from {{lang|grc|σῆμα}} ''sema'', "sign, mark, token". The plural is used in analogy with words similar to ''physics'', which was in the neuter plural in Ancient Greek and meant "things relating to nature".}} is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]] study of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], in [[language]], programming languages, formal logics, and [[semiotics]]. It is concerned with the relationship between ''signifiers''—like [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[sign]]s, and [[symbol]]s—and what they stand for, their [[denotation]].

In [[international scientific vocabulary]] semantics is also called ''[[semasiology]]''. The word ''semantics'' was first used by [[Michel Bréal]], a French philologist.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Biographical Dictionary, 5e.1990, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; It denotes a range of ideas—from the popular to the highly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem of understanding that comes down to word selection or [[connotation]]. This problem of understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries, over a long period of time, especially in the field of [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]]. In [[linguistics]], it is the study of the interpretation of signs or symbols used in [[agent (grammar)|agents]] or [[community|communities]] within particular circumstances and contexts.&lt;ref name="Neurath1955" /&gt; Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and [[proxemics]] have semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of study. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear semantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content.&lt;ref name="Neurath1955"&gt;{{cite book

The formal study of semantics intersects with many other fields of inquiry, including [[lexicology]], [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], [[etymology]] and others. Independently, semantics is also a well-defined field in its own right, often with synthetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;Cruse, Alan; ''Meaning and Language: An introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics'', Chapter 1, Oxford Textbooks in Linguistics, 2004; Kearns, Kate; ''Semantics'', [[Palgrave MacMillan]] 2000; Cruse, D. A.; ''Lexical Semantics'', Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[philosophy of language]], semantics and [[reference]] are closely connected. Further related fields include [[philology]], [[communication]], and [[semiotics]]. The formal study of semantics can therefore be manifold and complex.

Semantics contrasts with [[syntax]], the study of the combinatorics of units of a language (without reference to their meaning), and [[pragmatics]], the study of the relationships between the symbols of a language, their meaning, and the users of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics as a field of study also has significant ties to various representational theories of meaning including truth theories of meaning, coherence theories of meaning, and correspondence theories of meaning. Each of these is related to the general philosophical study of reality and the representation of meaning. In 1960s psychosemantic studies became popular after [[Charles E. Osgood|Osgood]]'s massive cross-cultural studies using his [[semantic differential]] (SD) method that used thousands of nouns and adjective bipolar scales. A specific form of the SD, Projective Semantics method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimova|first=I|title=Observer bias: how temperament matters in semantic perception of lexical material|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2014|volume=9 |issue=1|pages=e85677|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses only most common and neutral nouns that correspond to the 7 groups (factors) of adjective-scales most consistently found in cross-cultural studies (Evaluation, Potency, Activity as found by Osgood, and Reality, Organization, Complexity, Limitation as found in other studies). In this method, seven groups of bipolar adjective scales corresponded to seven types of nouns so the method was thought to have the object-scale symmetry (OSS) between the scales and nouns for evaluation using these scales. For example, the nouns corresponding to the listed 7 factors would be: Beauty, Power, Motion, Life, Work, Chaos, Law. Beauty was expected to be assessed unequivocally as “very good” on adjectives of Evaluation-related scales, Life as “very real” on Reality-related scales, etc. However, deviations in this symmetric and very basic matrix might show underlying biases of two types: scales-related bias and objects-related bias. This OSS design meant to increase the sensitivity of the SD method to any semantic biases in responses of people within the same culture and educational background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Trofimova |first=I |title= How people of different age sex and temperament estimate the world |journal= Psychological Reports |year=1999 |volume=85/2 |pages= 533–552 |doi=10.2466/pr0.85.6.533-552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trofimova |first=I |title= Understanding misunderstanding: a study of sex differences in meaning attribution |journal= Psychological Research |year=2012 |volume=77/6 |pages= 748–760 |doi= 10.1007/s00426-012-0462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
In [[linguistics]], '''semantics''' is the subfield that is devoted to the study of meaning, as inherent at the levels of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of [[discourse]] (termed ''texts'', or ''narratives''). The study of semantics is also closely linked to the subjects of representation, reference and denotation. The basic study of semantics is oriented to the examination of the meaning of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], and the study of relations between different linguistic units and [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]: [[homonym]]y, [[synonym]]y, [[antonym]]y, [[hypernym]]y, [[hyponym]]y, [[meronymy]], [[metonymy]], [[holonymy]], paronyms. A key concern is how meaning attaches to larger chunks of text, possibly as a result of the composition from smaller units of meaning. Traditionally, semantics has included the study of ''[[word sense|sense]]'' and denotative ''[[reference]]'', [[truth condition]]s, argument structure, [[thematic relation|thematic roles]], [[discourse analysis]], and the linkage of all of these to syntax.

==Montague grammar==

In the late 1960s, [[Richard Montague]] proposed a system for defining semantic entries in the lexicon in terms of the [[lambda calculus]]. In these terms, the syntactic [[parsing|parse]] of the sentence ''John ate every bagel'' would consist of a subject (''John'') and a predicate (''ate every bagel''); Montague demonstrated that the meaning of the sentence altogether could be decomposed into the meanings of its parts and in relatively few rules of combination. The logical predicate thus obtained would be elaborated further, e.g. using truth theory models, which ultimately relate meanings to a set of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarskian]] universals, which may lie outside the logic. The notion of such meaning atoms or primitives is basic to the [[language of thought]] hypothesis from the 1970s.

Despite its elegance, [[Montague grammar]] was limited by the context-dependent variability in word sense, and led to several attempts at incorporating context, such as:
* [[Situation semantics]] (1980s): [[truth-value]]s are incomplete, they get assigned based on context
* [[Generative lexicon]] (1990s): categories (types) are incomplete, and get assigned based on context

==Dynamic turn in semantics==

{{linguistics}}
In [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] linguistics there was no mechanism for the learning of semantic relations, and the [[psychological nativism|nativist]] view considered all semantic notions as inborn. Thus, even novel concepts were proposed to have been dormant in some sense. This view was also thought unable to address many issues such as [[metaphor]] or associative meanings, and [[semantic change]], where meanings within a linguistic community change over time, and [[qualia]] or subjective experience. Another issue not addressed by the nativist model was how perceptual cues are combined in thought, e.g. in [[mental rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L.; ''Perceptual Symbol Systems'', Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(4), 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of semantics, as an innate finite meaning inherent in a [[lexical unit]] that can be composed to generate meanings for larger chunks of discourse, is now being fiercely debated in the emerging domain of [[cognitive linguistics]]&lt;ref name="Langacker:1999"&gt;{{cite book

The main challenge is motivated by:
* factors internal to language, such as the problem of resolving [[indexical]] or [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] (e.g. ''this x'', ''him'', ''last week''). In these situations ''context'' serves as the input, but the interpreted utterance also modifies the context, so it is also the output. Thus, the interpretation is necessarily dynamic and the meaning of sentences is viewed as contexts changing potentials instead of [[proposition]]s.
* factors external to language, i.e. language is not a set of labels stuck on things, but "a toolbox, the importance of whose elements lie in the way they function rather than their attachments to things."&lt;ref name="Peregrin:2003" /&gt; This view reflects the position of the later [[Wittgenstein]] and his famous ''game'' example, and is related to the positions of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and others.

A concrete example of the latter phenomenon is semantic [[underspecification]]&amp;nbsp;– meanings are not complete without some elements of context. To take an example of one word, ''red'', its meaning in a phrase such as ''red book'' is similar to many other usages, and can be viewed as compositional.&lt;ref name="Gardenfors:2000"&gt;{{cite book

Indeed, these colours by themselves would not be called ''red'' by native speakers. These instances are contrastive, so ''red wine'' is so called only in comparison with the other kind of wine (which also is not ''white'' for the same reasons). This view goes back to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|de Saussure]]:

{{quote|Each of a set of synonyms like ''redouter'' ('to dread'), ''craindre'' ('to fear'), ''avoir peur'' ('to be afraid') has its particular value only because they stand in contrast with one another. No word has a value that can be identified independently of what else is in its vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

and may go back to earlier [[vyākaraṇa|Indian]] views on language, especially the [[Nyaya]] view of words as indicators and not carriers of meaning.&lt;ref name="Matilal"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Matilal
|first=Bimal Krishna
|authorlink=Bimal Krishna Matilal
|title=The Word and the World: India's Contribution to the Study of Language
|publisher=Oxford
|year=1990}} The [[Nyaya]] and [[Mimamsa]] schools in Indian [[vyākaraṇa]] tradition conducted a centuries-long debate on whether sentence meaning arises through composition on word meanings, which are primary; or whether word meanings are obtained through analysis of sentences where they appear. (Chapter 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to defend a system based on propositional meaning for semantic underspecification can be found in the [[generative lexicon]] model of [[James Pustejovsky]], who extends contextual operations (based on type shifting) into the lexicon. Thus meanings are generated "on the fly" (as you go), based on finite context.

==Prototype theory==

Another set of concepts related to fuzziness in semantics is based on [[prototype theory|prototypes]]. The work of [[Eleanor Rosch]] in the 1970s led to a view that natural categories are not characterizable in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, but are graded (fuzzy at their boundaries) and inconsistent as to the status of their constituent members. One may compare it with [[Jung]]'s [[archetype]], though the concept of [[archetype]] sticks to static concept. Some [[post-structuralists]] are against the fixed or static meaning of the [[words]]. [[Derrida]], following [[Nietzsche]], talked about slippages in fixed meanings.

Systems of categories are not objectively ''out there'' in the world but are rooted in people's experience. These categories evolve as [[learning theory (education)|learned]] concepts of the world&amp;nbsp;– meaning is not an objective truth, but a subjective construct, learned from experience, and language arises out of the "grounding of our conceptual systems in shared [[embodied philosophy|embodiment]] and bodily experience".&lt;ref name="LakoffJohnson"&gt;{{cite book

A corollary of this is that the conceptual categories (i.e. the lexicon) will not be identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture. This leads to another debate (see the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] or [[Eskimo words for snow]]).
&lt;!-- ==Logic and mathematics==

Many of the formal approaches to semantics in [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] originated in the study of [[philosophy of language]]. Initially, the most influential semantic theory stemmed from [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Frege and Russell are seen as the originators of a tradition in [[analytic philosophy]] to explain meaning via syntax and mathematical functionality. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], a former student of Russell, is also seen as one of the seminal figures in the analytic tradition. All three of these early philosophers of language were concerned with how sentences expressed information in the form of [[proposition]]s and with the truth values or [[truth conditions]] a given sentence has in virtue of the proposition it expresses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
--&gt;

==Theories in semantics==

===Formal semantics===

{{main|Formal semantics (linguistics)}}
Originates from Montague's work (see above). A highly formalized theory of natural language semantics in which expressions are assigned denotations (meanings) such as individuals, truth values, or functions from one of these to another. The truth of a sentence, and its logical relation to other sentences, is then evaluated relative to a model.

===Truth-conditional semantics===

{{main|Truth-conditional semantics}}
Pioneered by the philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], another formalized theory, which aims to associate each natural language sentence with a meta-language description of the conditions under which it is true, for example: 'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. The challenge is to arrive at the truth conditions for any sentences from fixed meanings assigned to the individual words and fixed rules for how to combine them. In practice, truth-conditional semantics is similar to model-theoretic semantics; conceptually, however, they differ in that truth-conditional semantics seeks to connect language with statements about the real world (in the form of meta-language statements), rather than with abstract models.

===Conceptual semantics===

{{main|Conceptual semantics}}
This theory is an effort to explain properties of argument structure. The assumption behind this theory is that syntactic properties of phrases reflect the meanings of the words that head them.&lt;ref name="Levin, Beth 1991"&gt;Levin, Beth; Pinker, Steven; ''Lexical &amp; Conceptual Semantics'', Blackwell, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; With this theory, linguists can better deal with the fact that subtle differences in word meaning correlate with other differences in the syntactic structure that the word appears in.&lt;ref name="Levin, Beth 1991" /&gt; The way this is gone about is by looking at the internal structure of words.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff, Ray 1990"&gt;Jackendoff, Ray; ''Semantic Structures'', MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; These small parts that make up the internal structure of words are termed ''semantic primitives''.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff, Ray 1990" /&gt;

===Lexical semantics===

{{main|Lexical semantics}}
A linguistic theory that investigates word meaning. This theory understands that the meaning of a word is fully reflected by its context. Here, the meaning of a word is constituted by its contextual relations.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986"&gt;Cruse, D.; ''Lexical Semantics'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a distinction between degrees of participation as well as modes of participation are made.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986" /&gt; In order to accomplish this distinction any part of a sentence that bears a meaning and combines with the meanings of other constituents is labeled as a semantic constituent. Semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents.&lt;ref name="Cruse, D. 1986" /&gt;

===Computational semantics===

{{main|Computational semantics}}
Computational semantics is focused on the processing of linguistic meaning. In order to do this concrete algorithms and architectures are described. Within this framework the algorithms and architectures are also analyzed in terms of decidability, time/space complexity, data structures that they require and communication protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Nerbonne, J.; ''The Handbook of Contemporary Semantic Theory'' (ed. Lappin, S.), Blackwell Publishing, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
{{main|Semantics (computer science)}}
In [[computer science]], the term ''semantics'' refers to the meaning of language constructs, as opposed to their form ([[syntax (logic)|syntax]]). According to Euzenat, semantics "provides the rules for interpreting the syntax which do not provide the meaning directly but constrains the possible interpretations of what is declared."&lt;ref&gt;Euzenat, Jerome. ''Ontology Matching.'' Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2007, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In ontology engineering, the term ''semantics'' refers to the meaning of concepts, properties, and relationships that formally represent real-world entities, events, and scenes in a logical underpinning, such as a [[description logic]], and typically implemented in the [[Web Ontology Language]]. The meaning of [[description logic]] concepts and roles is defined by their model-theoretic semantics, which are based on interpretations.&lt;ref name="Sikos 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts, properties, and relationships defined in [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] ontologies can be deployed directly in the web site markup as [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|HTML5 Microdata]], or [[JSON-LD]], in [[graph databases]] as [[Semantic triple|RDF triples]] or [[Named graph|quads]], and dereferenced in [[Linked Open Data|LOD]] datasets.

===Programming languages===
The semantics of [[programming language]]s and other languages is an important issue and area of study in computer science. Like the [[syntax]] of a language, its semantics can be defined exactly.

For instance, the following statements use different syntaxes, but cause the same instructions to be executed, namely, perform an arithmetical addition of 'y' to 'x' and store the result in a variable called 'x':
{| class="wikitable sortable" style="font-size:90%; text-align: left; width: auto;"
|-
! Statement
! Programming languages
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x += y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]],  [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], etc.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;$x += $y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Perl]], [[PHP]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x := x + y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[ALGOL]], [[ALGOL 68]], [[BCPL]], [[Dylan (programming language)|Dylan]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Modula-2]], [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]], [[OCaml]], [[Object Pascal]] (Delphi), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[SETL]], [[Simula]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Standard ML]], [[VHDL]], etc.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;MOV EAX,[y]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;ADD [x],EAX&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Assembly language]]s: [[Intel 8086]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;LET X = X + Y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[BASIC]]: early
|-
| &lt;code&gt;x = x + y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[BASIC]]: most dialects; [[Fortran]], [[MATLAB]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;Set x = x + y&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Caché ObjectScript]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;ADD Y TO X.&lt;/code&gt;
| [[ABAP]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;ADD Y TO X GIVING X&lt;/code&gt;
| [[COBOL]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;set /a x=%x%+%y%&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Batch file|Batch]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;(incf x y)&lt;/code&gt;
| [[Common Lisp]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;/x y x add def&lt;/code&gt;
| [[PostScript]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;y @ x +! &lt;/code&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Operational semantics]]: The meaning of a construct is specified by the computation it induces when it is executed on a machine. In particular, it is of interest ''how'' the effect of a computation is produced.
* [[Denotational semantics]]: Meanings are modelled by mathematical objects that represent the effect of executing the constructs. Thus ''only'' the effect is of interest, not how it is obtained.
* [[Axiomatic semantics]]: Specific properties of the effect of executing the constructs are expressed as ''assertions''. Thus there may be aspects of the executions that are ignored.

===Semantic models===
The [[Semantic Web]] refers to the extension of the [[World Wide Web]] via embedding added semantic [[metadata]], using semantic data modeling techniques such as [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) and [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).
On the [[Semantic Web]], terms such as ''[[semantic network]]'' and ''[[semantic data model]]'' are used to describe particular types of data model characterized by the use of [[directed graph]]s in which the vertices denote concepts or entities in the world and their properties, and the arcs denote relationships between them. These can formally be described as [[description logic]] concepts and roles, which correspond to [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] classes and properties.&lt;ref name="Sikos 2017"/&gt;

==Psychology==
In [[psychology]], ''[[semantic memory]]'' is memory for meaning&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the aspect of memory that preserves only the ''gist'', the general significance, of remembered experience&amp;nbsp;– while [[episodic memory]] is memory for the ephemeral details&amp;nbsp;– the individual features, or the unique particulars of experience. The term 'episodic memory' was introduced by Tulving and Schacter in the context of 'declarative memory' which involved simple association of factual or objective information concerning its object. Word meaning is measured by the company they keep, i.e. the relationships among words themselves in a [[semantic network]]. The memories may be transferred intergenerationally or isolated in one generation due to a cultural disruption. Different generations may have different experiences at similar points in their own time-lines. This may then create a vertically heterogeneous semantic net for certain words in an otherwise homogeneous culture.&lt;ref&gt;Giannini, A. J.; ''Semiotic and Semantic Implications of "Authenticity"'', Psychological Reports, 106(2):611–612, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a network created by people analyzing their understanding of the word (such as [[Wordnet]]) the links and decomposition structures of the network are few in number and kind, and include ''part of'', ''kind of'', and similar links. In automated [[ontologies]] the links are computed vectors without explicit meaning. Various automated technologies are being developed to compute the meaning of words: [[latent semantic indexing]] and [[support vector machines]] as well as [[natural language processing]], [[artificial neural network]]s and [[predicate calculus]] techniques.

[[Ideasthesia]] is a psychological phenomenon in which activation of concepts evokes sensory experiences. For example, in synesthesia, activation of a concept of a letter (e.g., that of the letter ''A'') evokes sensory-like experiences (e.g., of red color).

'''''Social Text''''' is an [[academic journal]] published by [[Duke University Press]]. Since its inception by an independent editorial collective in 1979, ''Social Text'' has addressed a wide range of social and cultural phenomena, covering questions of gender, sexuality, race, and the environment. Each issue covers subjects in the debates around [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[postmodernism]], [[queer theory]], and [[popular culture]]. The journal has since been run by different collectives over the years, mostly based at New York City universities. It has maintained an avowedly progressive political orientation and scholarship over these years, if also a less and less socialist or Marxist one. Since 1992, it is published by Duke University Press.&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Mystery Science Theater |work=Lingua Franca |accessdate=2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal gained notoriety in 1996 for the [[Sokal affair]], when it published a [[Nonsense|nonsensical]] article that physicist [[Alan Sokal]] had deliberately written as a hoax. The editors of the journal were in 1996 awarded the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for literature by "eagerly publishing research that they could not understand, that the author said was meaningless, and which claimed that reality does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig1996|title=The 1996 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |publisher=Improbable Research |accessdate= 15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the journal did not practice academic [[peer review]], and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate=April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| date=November 28, 1994| work = [[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Life of Henry Brulard''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Vie de Henri Brulard'''}}) is an unfinished autobiography by [[Stendhal]]. It was begun on November 23, 1835 and abandoned March 26, 1836 while the author was serving as the French [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Civitavecchia]]. Stendhal had severe doubts about contemporary interest in his autobiography, so he bequeathed it to the reader of 1880, or of 1935, or 2000. The manuscript, including Stendhal's numerous diagrams and illustrations, was published in 1890. Stendhal primariliy discusses his unhappy and dull childhood, touching briefly on his time as a soldier. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is considered a masterpiece of  autobiographical writing and ironic self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Life-of-Henry-Brulard |title=The Life of Henry Brulard  |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/13/classics.nicholaslezard |title=Witty once a week:Nicholas Lezard on ''The Life of Henry Brulard'', Stendhal's rambunctious memoir |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 13, 2002 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''The Life of Henry Brulard'' begins in 1832, with Stendhal on the [[Janiculum]] (named for [[Janus]], the two-faced god of beginnings) looking down at [[Rome]]. He begins questioning his accomplishments as he approaches 50 years of age. He reflects on the churches and monuments of the city and how much they have changed since he was a young man. He heads home through a cold mist at night and decides he will reflect upon his past until its truth emerges. He also decides to write as fast as he can without revising, to avoid lies. He believes a quickly-written rough draft would, like [[automatic writing]], disclose the truth about himself. Stendhal explicitly compares himself with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and calls ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' his own ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=97 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Stendhal was 52 years old when he began the memoir and the first scene is a small fiction. The  first chapter was written in two days in November 1835, and Stendhal also claims that ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' is an imitation of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Oliver Goldsmith's]] novel ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=103–104 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stendhal notes at the start that other men's biographies naturally focus on their public career. Stendhal himself campaigned with Napoleon in Russia and became consul at [[Civitavecchia]]. But Stendhal asserts that his real life can be found in a list of names: Virginie, Angela, Adele, Melanie, Mina, Alexandrine, Angelina, Metilde, Clementine, Giulia, Madame Azur, Amalia. Stendhal says that none of these women ever honored him with her favors and, despite others who did, the “habitual condition of my life is that of an unhappy lover.”

Stendhal forthrightly admits to wanting to sleep with his mother, who died when he was seven. While discussing his childhood in [[Grenoble]], Stendhal describes how Eighteenth-century French society habitually crushed his natural feelings. He often compares his father to a tyrant or king, on slender pretenses: young Henry is not allowed to play with other kids, not allowed to leave home at age 10, and must accompany his father on walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=146 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal's descriptions of scenes from his youth often provoke present-moment commentaries, blurring together the feelings of a young boy and the reflections of a middle-aged man. 

Stendhal only found happiness when he crossed the Alps into Italy as a 17-year-old in Napoleon's army. Stendhal describes the first time in his life that he mounted a horse, which went berserk and ran towards the willows on the shore of [[Lake Geneva]]. For a quarter of an hour he was in fear of breaking his neck. This became a favorite motif of Stendhal's; the heroes of ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[Lucien Leuwen]]'', and ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'' all fall off their horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vizinczey |first=Stephen  |date=February 20, 1986 |title=Lucky Lucien |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v08/n03/stephen-vizinczey/lucky-lucien |journal=The London Review of Books |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=17–18 |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stendhal loved Italy, which he considered a land where his truest self could be freely expressive without fear of reprisals. ''The Life of Henry Brulard'' ends with the beginning Stendhal's love for Italy and his mistress Angela Pietragrua, countess Simonetta. Stendhal asks, "How can I talk reasonably about those times? I prefer to put it off until another day...What does one do? How does one describe one's wildest happiness?" Stendhal ends the work by saying, "One spoils such tender feelings by recounting them in detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Michael |date=1971 |title=Stendhal |url= |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=98 |isbn=978-0801491245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/the-life-of-henry-brulard|title=The Life of Henry Brulard, Essay by Michael Dirda|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Review |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winifred Mabel Brunton''' ''née Newberry'' (6 May 1880 – 29 January 1959&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1820settlers.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Genealogy&amp;file=getperson&amp;personID=I56845&amp;tree=1 "Winifred Mabel Newberry" ''British 1820 Settlers to South Africa''] 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) was a South African painter, illustrator and [[Egyptologist]].

==Early years==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Brunton was born in 1880 in the [[Orange Free State]] South Africa. Her father, Charles Newberry, a millionaire who made his money in Kimberly, was the builder of [[Prynnsberg Estate]]. Her mother Elizabeth was the daughter of a missionary to [[Moshoeshoe I]] and was herself intensely artistic. Winifred was presented at court in 1898 in London when she presumably met Guy Brunton, an Egyptologist who later became her husband.

==Later years==

They built the house in [[Berea, Gauteng|Berea]], Johannesburg, in 1906, the same year they were married. She became best known for her portraits of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]s, published as ''Kings and Queens of Ancient Egypt'' (1926)&lt;ref name="saturdayreview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1926dec04-00368 |last=Sanborn |first=Ashton |title=Kings and Queens of Ancient Egypt, by Winifred Brunton |newspaper=The Saturday Review |date=4 December 1926 |page=368 |accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Great Ones of Ancient Egypt'' (1929).  She married Egyptologist [[Guy Brunton]] on 28 April 1906 and together they studied at University College London, during which time she painted a portrait of [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1912, which is now in the collection of [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/uclart UCL Art Collection]. At UCL they trained with [[Margaret Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, K.L. 2013. The Life of Margaret Alice Murray. A Woman's Work in Archaeology. New York: Lexington Books, pp. 91-94.&lt;/ref&gt; before travelling to [[Lahun]] in Egypt to join Flinders Petrie for fieldwork in 1912-14.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, H. 1914. The British School of Archaeology in Egypt. Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 1(3): 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with her husband on the archaeological digs, she studied the evidence of the various painting, sculptures and even the mummies to develop her final portraits. Guy and Winifred both continued to contribute to excavations organised by [[Flinders Petrie]]'s British School of Archaeology in Egypt in the 1920s at sites like Badari,&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, G. and Caton-Thompson, G. 1928. The Badarian Civilisation. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt.&lt;/ref&gt; with Winifred drawing many of the objects discovered.  Brunton died, aged 78, in [[Clocolan]], [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], [[South Africa]].

==Popular culture==
Her portraits have been hugely influential and defined the faces of the Pharaohs and the Queens in Popular culture and have been adopted in many films and documentaries.

==Publications==

'''Zihar''' ({{Lang-ar| ظھار }}) is a term used in [[Fiqh|Islamic Jurisprudence]], which literally means “you are like my mother”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/Z/Zihar.aspx |title=Zihar Definition |website=www.duhaime.org |language=en-US |access-date=2018-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230405/http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/Z/Zihar.aspx |archivedate=2017-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/553888895 |title=Taḥrīr ar-Rauḍa fī šarḥ al-Lumʻa.

== Background ==

Zihar was accepted as a declaration of [[divorce]] among [[pagan]] [[Arabs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=Be49BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=zihar+encyclopedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sKidk1zmep&amp;sig=1ZJxNWN5diGiRC-QHqxMoS9hgrw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt5LLDg4LZAhUPEVAKHcPYAmAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=zihar+encyclopedia&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Law and Local Tradition:: A Socio-Historical Approach|first=Prof Drs H. Akh Minhaji, M. A.|last=Ph.D|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Kurnia Kalam Semesta|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is mentioned in the [[Quran]] in reference to [[Khawla bint Tha'labah]], who was divorced by this formula in the chapter 58, verses 1-4:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quran.com/58/1-4|title=Surah Al-Mujadila [58:1-4]|website=Surah Al-Mujadila [58:1-4]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230437/https://quran.com/58/1-4|archivedate=2017-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''God has surely heard the words of her who pleaded with you against her husband and made her plaint to God. God has heard what you two said to each other. Surely God hears all and observes all.''&lt;br&gt;
''Those of you who divorce their wives by declaring them to be their mothers' backs should know that they are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those who bore them. The words they utter are unjust and false: but God pardons and forgives.''&lt;br&gt;

''Those that divorce their wives by so saying, and afterwards retract their words, shall free a slave before they touch each other again. This you are enjoined to do: God is cognizant of what you do. He that has no slave shall fast two successive months before they touch one another. He that cannot shall feed sixty of the destitute. Thus it is, so that you may believe in God and His apostle. Such are the bounds set by God. Woeful punishment awaits the unbelievers.''}}

== Legality ==

Zihar is [[Haram|illegal]] and considered an insult in the [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. It implies that the man, declaring his wife akin to his mother or sister, is guilty of the sin of forbidding the [[Halal|lawful]] things. It has been proscribed by law and the act does not ensue in divorce. It is detested and condemned in the law. Thus, penalties in the form of setting free a slave, fasting, or feeding the poor people have been imposed.
