In [[Hungary]], a 5-point [[Academic grading|grade system]] is used. There are only whole numbers in report cards, but for grading exams, there are also [[fractions]] (such as 3/4, which is between 3 and 4). Some teachers use lines above (rarely) or under (more commonly) the numbers to draw a clearer distinction: e.g., 4- is worse than a 4 but better than a 3, a 3' (3-plus), or a 3/4 (3 &lt; 3' &lt; 3/4 &lt; 4, &lt; 4); sometimes they even use multiple lines. For unusually good performance, the grade 5* can be awarded, but 
is less frequently used in [[secondary education|secondary schools]]. 1 is the only failing grade. When grading a student's attitude or diligence, only the grades 2-5 are used.

* 5 ("Kitűnő") - (excellent)
* 4 ("Jó") - (good)
* 3 ("Megfelelő") - (satisfactory)
* 2 ("Elégséges") - (sufficient)
* 1 ("Elégtelen") - (insufficient)

'''Anežka Drahotová''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈanɛʃka ˈdraɦotovaː}}; born 22 July 1995, [[Rumburk]]) is a Czech [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] competitor in [[racewalking]], [[middle-distance running]], and [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as well an international level [[cycling|cyclist]]. She is the [[Czech records in athletics|Czech record]] holder for the [[20 kilometres walk]] (1:29:05 – equal with [[Barbora Dibelková]]) and the [[10 kilometres race walk|10 km track walk]] (44:15.87 minutes).

In her first major international competitions, she placed seventh in the junior category at the [[2011 European Race Walking Cup]] and sixth in the 5000&amp;nbsp;m walk at the [[2011 World Youth Championships in Athletics]]. The following year she ranked sixth in the 10&amp;nbsp;km walk at the [[2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics]], where she also placed 25th overall in the [[1500 metres]]. The [[2013 European Race Walking Cup]] saw her take the bronze medal in the 10&amp;nbsp;km walk event. She won the 20&amp;nbsp;km walk gold medal in the [[2013 European Athletics Junior Championships]], while her twin sister [[Eliška Drahotová]] took the bronze. In an unusual event combination, she also entered the [[3000 metres steeplechase]] and placed ninth.&lt;ref name=rietiOfficial&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening honours to the Drahotová twins |url=http://www.european-athletics.org/rieti-2013-news/12097-opening-honours-to-the-drahotova-twins.html |work=22nd European Athletics Junior Championships, Rieti/ITA, 18–21 July 2013 |publisher=European Athletics |accessdate=13 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720010122/http://www.european-athletics.org/rieti-2013-news/12097-opening-honours-to-the-drahotova-twins.html |archivedate=20 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She placed outside the medals, taking seventh place, in the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics]] held in [[Moscow]] in the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics – Women's 20 kilometres walk|20 km walk]] despite leading the race for some kilometers and notching a personal best time of 1:29:05.&lt;ref name=MoscowIAAFOfficialResults20km&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Kilometres Race Walk Result - 14th IAAF World Championship|url=http://www.iaaf.org/competitions/iaaf-world-championships/14th-iaaf-world-championships-4873/results/women/20-kilometres-race-walk/final|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=13 August 2013 &lt;!-- 09:35 --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAAFProfile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/athletes/biographies/country=cze/athcode=255370/index.html |title=Anežka Drahotova|work=IAAF Profile|publisher=[[IAAF]]|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proved adept at running by finishing as the first Czech athlete at the [[Prague Grand Prix]] [[10K run]] that year.

'''B'Avarija''' is a musical band in [[Lithuania]], [[Klaipėda]], which was formed in 1996. 

They won a lot of awards for best songs.  They have made several attempts to win the Lithuanian national finals in order to represent the country in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] but no attempt was successful.  

In 2002, they won the finals with their song "We All", however this win had to be disqualified, just over a month later as the song had been released the previous year in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], under the title "Mes čia!" (We Are Here).  Under the rules, a song may not be released before 1 January of the year of the relevant contest.  

Officials argued that the lyrics were different (as it was in a different language) and therefore a different song, however the [[EBU]] rules that the song was not different enough and therefore could not be used in the main [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002]].   

It is thought that the Lithuanian broadcasters had not fully understood the rules as a number of the songs competing in the final had also been released earlier.  [[Aivaras Stepukonis|Aivaras]], who was second in the national finals, went to the contest for [[Lithuania]] instead.

'''K731 Baek Sang Eo (White Shark) torpedo''' ([[Hangul]]: 백상어 어뢰) is a submarine-launched torpedo developed by the [[Republic of Korea Navy]] in 2004. Production was delayed for a year after a program error in the guidance system resulted in 2 failed tests in 2003. This glitch was fixed while developing the [[Chung Sang Eo (Blue Shark) torpedo|Blue Shark]] torpedo; a more lightweight variant. Production cost for each torpedo is at about 950 million [[South Korean won|won]] (US$790,000).

'''Dewi Ratih''', also known as ''Sang Hyang Ratih'' or ''Sang Hyang Semara Ratih'', is a Hindu lunar goddess worshipped in Java and Bali. She is well known for her beauty and grace, thus she was also known as the Goddess of Beauty. Her myth is linked to [[lunar eclipse]]s.

==Lunar eclipses==
Due to Dewi Ratih rejecting him, Kala Rau the giant planned to attack [[Vaikuntha|Vishnuloka]]. When Kala Rau reached heaven on the form of Kuwera, a leading [[rakshasa]] who served the Gods, Ratih warned [[Vishnu]] that Kuwera was actually Kala Rau. Vishnu beheaded Kala Rau without knowing he had consumed the ''[[amrita|tirta amerta]]'', a drink of gods that could make him immortal. 

Because only his throat touched the ''tirta amerta'', Kala Rau survived with his floating head. When the moon came, Kala Rau would chase the goddess, and swallow Dewi Ratih in whole. But because he does not have his body, Dewi Ratih would soon emerge from his neck. In Bali and Java, this story is believed to be the origin of lunar eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;Made Taro. ''Cerita Rakyat Dari Bali 3 (Indonesian).'' 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
In Bali, a ceremony is held every ''[[purnama]]'', or full moon, to celebrate the beauty of the moon. This ceremony also honours [[Chandra]], another lunar god.

The '''Documento nacional de identidad''' (DNI) or ''carné de identidad'' is Spanish national identity card. It is a laminated card or [[polycarbonate]], which details the name and surnames of the holder, date of birth, address, parents, sex, residential address, city and province of birth, and contains a photograph (size 32 by 26&amp;nbsp;mm, with plain white uniform background, taken from the front with the head completely uncovered and without dark glasses and any items which may prevent or hinder the identification of the person) and an identification number consisting of 8 digits plus a control letter. This number is also used for tax purposes, receiving the name of ''Número de identificación fiscal'' (NIF).

They used to contain a fingerprint from the holder's right-hand forefinger, but they no longer do. 

The DNI is enough to visit and register as a resident in the member countries of the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and Switzerland. It can also be used for short-term visits in the rest of Europe (except Belarus, Russia and Ukraine) as well as Georgia, Montserrat (max. 14 days), Turkey and organized tours to Tunisia.

The ID card is issued at offices of the [[National Police Corps of Spain|National Police]]. To apply for a DNI, it is necessary to have Spanish nationality and permission for the Spanish consulate. Foreigners legally resident in Spain or who intend to purchase property are issued with a ''Número de identificación de extranjero'' (NIE) or Foreign Identification Number.

To receive Dream's broadcasting signals, subscribers must acquire a {{convert|60|cm}} in diameter [[satellite dish]] [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], an Integrated Receiver-Decoder (IRD) and a Dream Conditional Access Card ([[Smart Card]]). To provide security and protection, the satellite signals of Dream shall be encrypted using a Conditional Access System. Thus, exclusive use of Dream programs and services will only be available to Dream subscribes.

==History==
===1996-2001: Incorporation and launch===
In April 1996, Dream was incorporated to the Philippine Multi-Media System, Inc. (PMSI). On February 6, 1998, the [[Philippine Congress]] passed into law Republic Act No. 8630 which granted PMSI a franchise to construct, install, maintain and operate for commercial purposes and in the public interest, television and radio broadcasting in the Philippines. The franchise term is 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_10/RA08630.pdf | title=Republic Act No. 8630: An Act granting the Philippine Multi-Media System, Inc., a franchise to construct, install, establish, operate and maintain radio And television stations in the Philippines | publisher=''[[Congress of the Philippines]]'' | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111094243/http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_10/RA08630.pdf | archivedate=November 11, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 2000, The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) granted a provisional authority to engage in Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellite services. On February 7, 2001, the PMSI inaugurates its Dream Broadcasting Center at Clark Development Center, and on April 22, 2001, the commercial launch of Dream Broadcasting System, the first DTH system in the Philippines, took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dream.com.ph/aboutus/about_history.asp?npage=66 | title=Historical Highlights | publisher=''Dream Satellite TV'' | accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Dream Broadcasting System was renamed as "'''Dream Satellite TV'''".

===2006-2011: Koreasat 5 secondary broadcast and Agila II closedown===
On 2006, Dream began to use Koreasat 5 as an additional additional main broadcast to the

Starting 2010 until 2011, Dream closed all of the transponders of Agila II (ABS-5/ABS-3) for its main broadcast, due to the fact that it was only 2 years left in the orbit. When all of the Dream Satellite channels were transferred to Koreasat 5, Dream announced customers to migrate their receivers (which uses Nagravision 3/Conax CAS7) to Koreasat 5 as the replacement for ABS-5/ABS-3 satellite.

In 2011, Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr., owner of PMSI, has plans to sell the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rp1.abs-cbnnews.com/business/07/06/11/cojuangco-talks-sell-dream-tv | title=Cojuangco in talks to sell Dream TV | publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News]]'' | work=[[BusinessMirror]] | date=July 6, 2011 | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114191551/http://rp1.abs-cbnnews.com/business/07/06/11/cojuangco-talks-sell-dream-tv | archive-date=2013-11-14 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, it was revealed that [[SkyCable]] was in the advanced stages of negotiations of acquisition of PMSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/companies/17788-skycable-on-the-lookout-for-possible-acquisitions | title=SkyCable on the lookout for possible acquisitions | publisher=''[[BusinessMirror]]'' | date=August 11, 2013 | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | author=Lenie Lectura | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111100208/http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/business/companies/17788-skycable-on-the-lookout-for-possible-acquisitions | archivedate=November 11, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nextvasia.com/1-cable-dth/philippines-based-telecom-company-sky-cable-looks-to-acquire-another-cable-operator/ | title=Philippines-based telecom company Sky Cable looks to acquire another DTH player | publisher=''NexTV Asia'' | date=August 12, 2013 | accessdate=November 11, 2013 | author=Aishwariya S | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111093502/http://nextvasia.com/1-cable-dth/philippines-based-telecom-company-sky-cable-looks-to-acquire-another-cable-operator/ | archive-date=2013-11-11 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017: Koreasat 7 third broadcast===

In 2017 Dream stated that it is planning to sign a multi-year, multi-transponder capacity agreement with [[South Korea|Korea]]-based [[KT Corporation]] to broadcast DTH television channels via Koreasat 7 satellite at 116.0 degrees East &amp; upgrade to [[DVB-S2]]. Koreasat 7 is expected to be operational by middle of 2017 to compete among 3 dth operators in the Philippines.

===The end of Dream Satellite TV===

Effective December 31, 2017, Dream Satellite TV will cease their operations after 16 years due to bankruptcy, and stiff competition from Direct-to-Home Satellite TV providers such as [[Cignal]], [[Sky Direct]] and [[G Sat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/DTVPilipinas/videos/2277361448956053/|title=Dream Satellite TV public service announcement|publisher=DTV Pilipinas FB Page|date=December 29, 2017|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
===Receivers===
Early receivers were made by Nokia (Nokia MediaMaster 8830S/8630S), Digital AllWorld (DAW951 and DAW-SNA4400), ViStar and Crystal. Those receivers were already phased out by Dream (except for DAW-SNA4400 and Crystal), due to the lack of Nagravision 3/Conax support. The later receivers, such as Homecast eM-152USNA, KAON K-270 and the Arion AF-5102S (both of them were still offered by Dream). Both of these receivers are only capable of receiving standard definition broadcasts.

==Smart cards==
At the time when the first DVB-version of Nagravision is not yet introduced, Dream Satellite used Conax CAS3 for the main broadcast until they switch to Nagravision 2 and Conax CAS7 encryption on 2006. In 2009, following the Dish Network anti-piracy upgrade, a conditional access swap to the smart card has been completed. This also made the smart card system transitioned to Nagravision Merlin and Conax CAS7.5. 

==Status of competition and controversy==
Dream Satellite TV filed a complaint with the [[National Telecommunications Commission (Philippines)|National Telecommunications Commission]] (NTC) against Global Broadcasting and Multimedia, Inc. ([[G Sat]]) for offering A DTH service in the Philippines without a franchise and a license from Philippine authorities, namely the Philippine Congress for a broadcast franchise and the NTC for a Certificate of Public Convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abs-cbnnews.com/business/01/19/09/dreamtv-operator-seeks-regulator-help-over-satellite-tv-dispute | title=Dream TV operator seeks regulator help over satellite TV dispute | publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News]]'' | date=January 1, 2009 | accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Dream, the Lopez-owned [[Sky Cable Corporation]] also filed a similar complaint against GBMI. It argued that GBMI's illegal entry into the industry will result in the unnecessary duplication of an existing service that existing cable TV and DTH-TV service providers already adequately provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yehey.com/finance/level3.aspx?id=221433&amp;p=3 | title=SkyCable sues DTH competitor | publisher=''Yehey!'' | date=January 19, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea''' ('''Joson Trade Bank''') is [[North Korea]]'s primary [[Foreign-exchange reserves|foreign exchange]] [[bank]], and is owned and run by the [[North Korean government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl1876.aspx|title=Treasury Sanctions Bank and Official Linked to North Korean Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs|publisher=US Department of the Treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2013, the United States designated the bank as falling under US [[executive order]] 13382, which applies to "proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their supporters". The order freezes all assets, and prohibits any transactions between US entities and the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/c22080.htm|title=Executive Order 13382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2013, the state-controlled [[Bank of China]] announced that they would stop all dealings with the Foreign Trade Bank. China has in the past been reluctant to sanction North Korea, even though China has been very unsatisfied with North Korea's aggressive stance and pursuit of nuclear weapons. Stopping the dealing with the Foreign Trade Bank is seen as a significant signal by China to put pressure on North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/world/asia/china-cuts-ties-with-north-korean-bank.html|title=China Cuts Ties With Key North Korean Bank|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2017 the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371|Resolution 2371]] expanding financial sanctions&lt;ref name="UNSC Res 1718 (2006)"/&gt; to include the bank.&lt;ref name="S/RES/2371"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Aug 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US mission to UN August 5 2017"/&gt;

After [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094|UN Security Council Resolution 2094]] was adopted in March 2013, several Chinese banks will not deal with the Foreign Trade Bank.&lt;ref name="Beijing orders banks to close accounts for North Koreans"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=14709 | title=Beijing orders banks to close accounts for North Koreans | publisher=Daily NK | date=2017-09-09 | accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of the Treasury has designated Dandong Zhongsheng Industry &amp; Trade Co Ltd and Korea Ungum Corporation as FTB [[Front organization|front companies]], and sanctioned the Moscow-based Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank for facilitating transactions for the FTB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/US-hits-Russian-bank-with-sanctions-for-North-Korea-related-activity |publisher=''[[Nikkei Asian Review]]'' |title=US hits Russian bank with sanctions for North Korea-related activity |author=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French Confederation of Christian Workers''' ({{lang-fr|Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens}}; '''CFTC''') is one of the five major [[France|French]] [[confederation]] of [[trade unions]], belonging to the [[Christian socialism|social Christian]] tradition.

It was founded in 1919 as the Trade Union of Employees of Industry and Commerce under the inspiration of [[Exupérien Mas]] with the goal of safeguarding the material as well as the spiritual interests of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasalle.org/en/who-are-we/lasallian-holiness/ven-exuperien-mas/|work=LaSalle.org|title=Lasallian Holiness: Ven. Exupérien Mas|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the union split, a majority founding the [[French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (CFDT), a non-confessional trade-union.

The CFTC is a member of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and the [[European Trade Union Confederation]]. Its leader is Jacques Voisin.

==Professional elections==

The CFTC won 8.69 per cent of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections. This result, however, is below the CFTC's 9.65 per cent result in 2002, its best showing to date.

'''''HD-4''''' or '''''Hydrodome number 4''''' was an early research [[hydrofoil]] watercraft developed by the scientist [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. It was designed and built at the [[Bell Boatyard]] on Bell's [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. In 1919, it set a [[water speed record|world marine speed record]] of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h}}.

== History ==

The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham, explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]]s. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane a very significant achievement. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models based on his designs, which led them to the development of hydrofoil watercraft. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell, with his chief engineer [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Casey Baldwin]], began hydrofoil experiments in the summer of 1908. During Bell's world tour of 1910–1911, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in Italy, where they rode in his hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying.

On returning to Bell's large laboratory and boatyard at his [[Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia|Beinn Bhreagh]] estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], they experimented with a number of designs, culminating in ''HD-4''. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia|Westmount]] to work on the pontoons of ''HD-4''. Pinaud soon took over the [[Bell Boatyard]] at Beinn Bhreagh. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to ''HD-4''. After the [[First World War]], work began again on ''HD-4''. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|bhp|kW}} [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V-12]] engines in July 1919.

Bell and associate [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908, as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. On September 9, 1919, on the [[Bras d'Or Lakes]], at Baddeck, ''HD-4'' set a [[water speed record|world marine speed record]] of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h}}, that stood for almost a year until being beaten by [[Gar Wood]] in ''Miss America''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h1unlimited.com/2009/03/the-gar-wood-story/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue''' is a report issued by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]]. 

In the report, the OECD groups countries into three categories: member country preferential regimes, [[tax havens]], and non-member economies, and establishes criteria for identifying each.&lt;ref&gt; “More Information on the Harmful Tax practices Work,” &lt;u&gt;OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 17 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/document/49/0,3343,en_2649_33745_33995569_1_1_1_1,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax havens are characterised by having only nominal or no taxes, impeding the free [[exchange of information]] on taxpayers with other governments through administrative practices or laws, non-[[Transparency (social)|transparency]], and a lack of substantial activities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue&lt;/u&gt; (Paris: OECD Publications, 1998) 22, OECD.org, 17 July 2007 &lt; http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/33/1/1904184.pdf &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Harmful preferential regimes, whether in member or non-member countries, are identified by four main traits. Like tax havens, their legal or administrative systems hamper the exchange of information and create an absence of transparency, and have effectively low or no taxes. Finally, the regime may partially isolate itself from the taxpayers and bear little to none of the tax burden, a practice known as “ring-fencing.”&lt;ref&gt;&lt;u&gt;Harmful Tax Competition: An Emerging Global Issue&lt;/u&gt; (Paris: OECD Publications, 1998) 26, OECD.org, 17 July 2007 &lt; http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/33/1/1904184.pdf &gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International OCD Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that aims to "help everyone affected by obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders to live full and productive lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iocdf.org/about/|title=About Us|date=11 June 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History and overview==

Best estimates are that about 1 in 100 adults – or between 2 and 3 million adults in the [[United States]] – currently have [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] or OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/anxiety-disorders/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.shtml|work=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruscio|first=AM|author2=Stein DJ |author3=Chiu WT |author4=Kessler RC |title=The epidemiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication|journal=Molecular Psychiatry|pmid=18725912|pmc=2797569|year=2010|volume=15|issue=1|pages=53–63|doi=10.1038/mp.2008.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also at least 1 in 200 – or 500,000 – kids and teens that have OCD. That means four or five kids with OCD are likely to be enrolled in any average size elementary school.  In a medium to large high school, there could be 20 students struggling with the challenges caused by OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=March|first=J.|title=Talking Back to OCD|year=2007|publisher=The Guilford Press|pages=10–11|author2=Benton, C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the International OCD Foundation – originally the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation – was created by a small, dedicated group of individuals who had OCD.  They were all participating in research studies at the Connecticut Mental Health Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/dmhas/cwp/view.asp?a=2906&amp;q=334596|title=The Connecticut Mental Health Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; in New Haven, CT.  The principal investigator on the studies was Wayne Goodman, M.D., a junior faculty psychiatrist who started the OCD program at Yale University School of Medicine during his residency training there.  It was also Dr. Goodman's idea to bring the group together.
  
Originally the plan had been to just form a self-help group, but as soon as they got together they realized that there was a great deal of work to be done to defeat OCD.  So in November 1986, they started the Foundation as a way to get the word out about OCD and its treatment.  This was the first time for many of them to find some relief from OCD and to meet others who were also suffering from OCD.  Being together inspired them to start working together to help others suffering from OCD.

Before the first meeting, some of the members sent a letter to ABC's [[20/20]] describing OCD and suggesting that the producers do a segment on it.  As soon as the group got together in 1986, they drafted a brochure explaining OCD with  the help of Dr. Goodman and put together notices giving the locations of the 22 locations around the country where the trials were taking place.

In March 1987, John Stoessel of ABC's 20/20 featured a segment with Dr. Goodman and one of his patients, another Foundation founder.  The reaction was immediate and overwhelming. The network television show opened the door for thousands of people to step forward and put a name on their illness.  The small corps of founders were flooded with 20,000 inquiries in the days following the 20/20 segment.  While they recognized their own need for support and more information, they were not prepared for the tremendous need throughout the country.  A PO box, a small grant for long distance phone calls, and weekly meetings were used to answer all inquiries and to match patients with the 22 clinical trial sites throughout the country.

Within the year, the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation – now the International OCD Foundation – was formalized as a not-for-profit corporation and the group began mailing out the locations of the 22 sites where treatment was being provided, its new brochure and a newsletter to spread the word on OCD and its possible treatments.  A Scientific Advisory Board, composed of researchers and treatment providers from the 22 clinical trial sites, was organized and led by Dr. Goodman.

By 1988, the Foundation was ready to bring information to the psychotherapy community.  Board members set up an information booth and attended the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.  The founders attended other meetings and conventions, and they realized the need to provide information not only to people seeking treatment, but also to the mental health community so that treatment was appropriate and accessible.

In 1989, the Foundation hired its first paid staff.  Funding came first from pharmaceutical companies, but membership grew rapidly providing operating funds and a national network.  The Foundation provided guidance on creating OCD support groups and 52 were established across the country.

The clarity of the vision of the founding members facilitated the depth and breadth of the Foundation's growth.  Within a decade, the Foundation established the Behavior Therapy Training Institutes (BTTI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/BTTI.aspx|title=Behavior Therapy Training Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; which train therapists across the country, research awards for studies on OCD, an Annual Conference, publications and videos, comprehensive educational materials about OCD in children for teachers, a website and a bi-monthly newsletter.

==Present activities==
In 2007, the Board of Directors voted to move the Foundation from [[New Haven|New Haven, CT]] to [[Boston|Boston, MA]].  With a 100% turn over in staff, this marked a significant transition for the 20-plus year old organization.  Today, the Foundation has 12 individuals serving on the Board of Directors, 9 full-time paid staff, 47 Scientific Advisory Board members, 22 affiliates, 6,000 members/financial supporters, 32 Institutional Members and an operating budget of 1 million dollars.  Funding for the Foundation's programs come from donations, membership fees, and grants.  The International OCD Foundation no longer accepts money from pharmaceutical or biomedical companies.

The mission of the organization at its founding is much the same as today: education, awareness, training, accessing resources and research.  In 2009, the IOCDF hired [[Teak Media]] to help promote awareness about OCD and effective treatments.  The collaboration between Teak and the IOCDF resulted in almost 100 media hits in newspapers, online, in magazines, and has been featured on [[Nightline]] and [[CNN]].  Teak regularly accesses the IOCDF's Speakers Bureau.  The Speakers Bureau members include people with OCD who understand firsthand the challenges of this disorder in addition to well-known clinical and research experts who have treated people with OCD.

Late in 2009, a newly designed website was launched with links to social networking sites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[YouTube]].  The website also continues to be a source of information about OCD and related disorders, effective treatment, a database of 250 support groups, 1,000 treatment providers, and 30-plus OCD intensive treatment programs.  Additionally, in Spring of 2010, the IOCDF launched a virtual Hoarding Center.
In 2010, the Foundation hosted its 17th Annual Conference.  Over 1,000 individuals attended this year including those with OCD, their family members, treatment professionals and researchers.  The organization continues to distribute quarterly newsletters, provide three Behavior Therapy Training Institutes around the country annually, and continues to fund OCD related research.

Additional initiatives the IOCDF has prioritized this year include revamping and updating the “OCD in the Classroom” program, launching a Pediatric OCD website, promoting awareness through OCD Awareness Week events, and building and developing international resources for individuals suffering with OCD around the world.

'''''January''''' ({{lang-bg|Януари}} is an [[Play (theatre)|allegorical play]] by [[Yordan Radichkov]] written in 1974.

''January'' is distinguished by its wealth of characters and intertwined elements of the folklore of Northwestern [[Bulgaria]] with biblical allusions. It highlights the major conflict clash between the past and modernity in an aging village and those in it when innovation enters and opposition ensues over communication versus isolation.

''January'' was translated into English by Judith Sprostranov and is included in the collection ''Contemporary Bulgarian Plays'', issued by Tantalus Books in 2002.&lt;ref name="Jacobson (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobson|first1=Josepha|title=Contemporary Bulgarian plays|date=2002|publisher=Tantalus Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-954-29440-3|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=zKwXAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jinx''' is a Croatian [[Pop music|pop]] band from Zagreb which was formed in 1993.

They began their career under the name "High Jinx" coming from a concert in a Zagreb night-club Saloon.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;[http://www.mtv.com.hr/artisti/jinx Jinx – Artisti — MTV Hrvatska] {{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of Jinx are guitarist [[Coco Mosquito]], vocalist Jadranka Bastajic Yaya, drummer Berko Muratovic, keyboardist Mr. Goody, trumpet player Igor Pavlica and bassist Adam Matijasevic. Former members of the band are Goony, Kiky the Kid, bassist Samir Kadribasic, trumpet player Rudi and saxophone player Jordes.

The prefix "High" was dropped in 1995,&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; since all fans who attended their first gigs referred to them solely as Jinx. Their first album, ''Sextasy'', was released in English. Berko and Samir  joined the band in 1996. In 1997, Jinx signed their first record contract with [[Aquarius Records (Croatia)|Aquarius Records]] and released their second album called ''Second Hand''. In 2001, Percussionist Boris Popov joined the band.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;

Jinx disbanded in 2002 and made a comeback in 2007 with the album ''Na zapadu'' (In the West), having signed with [[Dallas Records]].&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;

The '''Lhop''' or '''Doya people''' are a little-known tribe of southwest [[Bhutan]]. The Bhutanese believe them to be the [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] inhabitants of the country. The Lhop are found in the low valleys of [[Dorokha gewog , Samtse]] and near [[Phuntsholing]] in the [[Duars]]. 
The dress of the Lhop resembles the [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]], but they bear little similarity with the [[Bhutia]] in the North and the [[Toto tribe|Toto]] in the west. The Doya trace their descent [[matrilineality|matrilineally]], marry their [[cross cousin]]s, and embalm the deceased who are then placed in a foetal position in a circular sarcophagus above the ground. They follow a blend of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] mixed with [[animism]].

The '''{{nihongo|Republic of [[Ezo]]|蝦夷共和国|Ezo Kyōwakoku}}''' was a short-lived state established in 1869 by a part of the former [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawa]] military in what is now known as [[Hokkaido]], the large but sparsely populated northernmost island in modern Japan. Ezo is notable for being the first government to attempt to institute [[democracy]] in Japan.

==Background==
After the defeat of the forces of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in the [[Boshin War]] (1869) of the [[Meiji Restoration]], a part of the former ''[[shōgun]]''{{'}}s navy led by Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] fled to the northern island of [[Ezo]] (now known as [[Hokkaido]]), together with several thousand soldiers and a handful of [[France|French]] military advisers and their leader, [[Jules Brunet]]. Enomoto made a last effort to petition the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|Imperial Court]] to be allowed to develop Hokkaido and maintain the traditions of the samurai unmolested, but his request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Hillsborough, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
[[File:GoryokakuMainHall.jpg|thumb|left|The governmental hall of the Republic of Ezo, inside the fortress of [[Goryōkaku]]]]
On January 27, 1869 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Japan|New Style]])&lt;!--old style December 15, 1868--&gt;, the independent "Republic of Ezo" was proclaimed, with a government organisation based on that of the [[United States]], with Enomoto elected as its first president (''[[sosai]]''). Elections were based on [[universal suffrage]] among the samurai class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hübner |first=Joseph Alexander |authorlink=Count Joseph Alexander Hübner |translator=Mary Elizabeth Herbert Herbert |title=A Ramble Round the World, 1871: Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0sSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138 |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |year=1874 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first [[election]] ever held in Japan, where a feudal structure under an Emperor with military [[Daimyō|warlords]] was the norm. Through Hakodate Magistrate [[Nagai Naoyuki]], attempts were made to reach out to foreign legations present in [[Hakodate]] to obtain international diplomatic recognition.

The treasury included 180,000 gold ''[[Ryō (Japanese coin)|ryō]]'' coins Enomoto retrieved from [[Osaka Castle]] following ''[[Shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]]'s precipitous departure after the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]] in early 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Onodera, 2004, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1868–1869, the defences around the southern peninsula of [[Hakodate]] were enhanced, with the [[star fortress]] of [[Goryōkaku]] at the centre. The troops were organised under a joint Franco-Japanese command, [[commander-in-chief]] [[Ōtori Keisuke]] being seconded by the French captain [[Jules Brunet]], and divided into four [[brigades]], each commanded by a French officer ([[Arthur Fortant|Fortant]], [[Jean Marlin|Marlin]], [[André Cazeneuve|Cazeneuve]] and [[François Bouffier|Bouffier]]). The brigades were themselves divided into two half-brigades each, under Japanese command.

Brunet demanded (and received) a signed personal pledge of loyalty from all officers and insisted they assimilate French ideas. An anonymous French officer wrote that Brunet had taken charge of everything:

{{cquote|...&amp;nbsp;customs, municipality, fortifications, army; everything passed through his hands. The simple Japanese are puppets whom he manipulates with great skill&amp;nbsp;... he has carried out a veritable 1789 [[French Revolution]] in this brave new Japan; the election of leaders and the determination of rank by merit and not birth&amp;nbsp;— these are fabulous things for this country, and he has been able to do things very well, considering the seriousness of the situation&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Sims, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Defeat by Imperial forces==
Imperial troops soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan, and in April 1869 dispatched a fleet and an [[infantry]] force of 7,000 men to Hokkaido. The Imperial forces progressed swiftly, won the [[Battle of Hakodate]], and surrounded the fortress at Goryōkaku. Enomoto surrendered on June 26, 1869, turning the Goryōkaku over to [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] staff officer [[Kuroda Kiyotaka]] on June 27, 1869.&lt;ref name="Onodera196"&gt;Onodera, 2004, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Kuroda is said to have been deeply impressed by Enomoto's dedication in combat, and is remembered as the one who spared the latter's life from execution. &lt;!--As per the arrangements for the surrender, the Ezo Republic ceased to exist on June 27, 1869. --&gt;On September 20&lt;!--old style August 15--&gt; of the same year, the island was given its present name, Hokkaido (''Hokkaidō'', literally "Northern Sea Region").&lt;ref name="Onodera196"/&gt;

While later history texts were to refer to May 1869 as being when Enomoto accepted [[Emperor Meiji]]'s rule, the Imperial rule was never in question for the Ezo Republic, as made evident by part of Enomoto's message to the {{Nihongo|[[Daijō-kan]]|太政官|''Dajōkan''}} at the time of his arrival in Hakodate:

{{quote|The farmers and merchants are unmolested, and live without fear, going their own way, and sympathising with us; so that already we have been able to bring some land into cultivation. We pray that this portion of the Empire may be conferred upon our late lord, Tokugawa Kamenosuke; and in that case, we shall repay your beneficence by our faithful guardianship of the northern gate.&lt;ref&gt;Black, 1881, pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus from Enomoto's perspective, the efforts to establish a government in Hokkaido were not only for the sake of providing for the [[Tokugawa clan]] on the one hand (burdened as it was with an enormous amount of redundant retainers and employees), but also as developing Ezo for the sake of defence for the rest of Japan, something which had been a topic of concern for some time. Recent scholarship has noted that for centuries, Ezo was not considered a part of Japan the same way that the other "main" islands of modern Japan were, so the creation of the Ezo Republic, in a contemporary mindset, was not an act of secession, but rather of "bringing" the politico-social entity of "Japan" formally to Ezo.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, 1998, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enomoto was sentenced to a brief prison sentence, but was freed in 1872 and accepted a post as a government official in the newly renamed Hokkaido Land Agency. He later became ambassador to [[Russia]], and held several ministerial positions in the [[Meiji Government]].

'''''Root Into Europe''''' is an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] comedy-drama based on the character from [[William Donaldson]]'s book ''[[The Henry Root Letters]]''. Five episodes Written by Donaldson and Mark Chapman and produced by Aspect Film &amp; TV  for [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]], were first broadcast in May and June 1992. The series starred [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Henry Root, and [[Pat Heywood]] as his wife, Muriel.

Henry Root, a fish dealer who disapproves of the impending [[European Union]], declares himself England's 'European regulator' in a letter to the [[British Prime Minister]], then [[John Major]]. He takes his wife Muriel ([[Pat Heywood]]) on a tour of Europe to represent English values to mainland Europe. His adventures are captured on a [[camcorder]] by his wife to be sent to the BBC upon his return for a future documentary, which one expects will never be made. The episodes bring him to [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and [[The Netherlands]].

'''''Senegalia montis-salinarum''''', is a species of thorn tree that is native to two separate localities in the [[Soutpansberg]] range in [[Limpopo]], South Africa. The total population is estimated at no more than 250 adult trees. Based on its morphology, it is assigned to the ''[[Senegalia burkei|S. burkei]]'' [[species complex]].&lt;ref name="vzyl"&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Zyl|first1=Andries|title=Newly described endemic tree for Soutpansberg |url=http://zoutpansberger.co.za/articles/news/35211/2016-01-29/newly-described-endemic-tree-for-soutpansberg|accessdate=23 October 2016 |agency=Zoutpansberger |date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vhembebiosphere.org/sarchi/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Hahn_Senegalia-montis-salinarum.pdf Hahn ''Senegalia montis-salinarum'' vhembebiosphere.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
It grows on rocky scree slopes in the hot [[rain shadow]] of the Soutpansberg range.&lt;ref name="vzyl"/&gt;

==Description==
It is a multi-stemmed tree. It has smaller flowers than ''A. burkei'' and produces more seeds. The wood is soft and semi-succulent, and dead wood decays quickly.&lt;ref name="vzyl"/&gt;

==Status==
It may qualify as [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to the small population size and the proximity of the type locality to Coal of Africa’s Makhado Colliery project.&lt;ref name="vzyl"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">'''Squeaky Dolphin''' is a program developed by the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), a British [[intelligence agency|intelligence]] and [[security agency|security]] organization, to collect and analyze data from [[social media]] networks. The program was first revealed to the general public on [[NBC]] on 27 January 2014 based on documents previously leaked by [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name=NBCJan14&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/27/22469304-snowden-docs-reveal-british-spies-snooped-on-youtube-and-facebook?lite|title=Snowden docs reveal British spies snooped on YouTube and Facebook|date=27 January 2014|publisher=NBC News|author1=Richard Esposito |author2=Matthew Cole |author3=Mark Schone |author4=Glenn Greenwald |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope of surveillance ==
According to a document of the GCHQ dated August 2012, the program enables broad, [[Real-time data|real-time]] surveillance of the following items:

* [[YouTube]] video views&lt;ref name=NBCJan14/&gt;&lt;ref name=zdnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Dignan|first=Larry|title=Snowden's Squeaky Dolphin leak: Brits spy on YouTube, Facebook behavior|url=http://www.zdnet.com/snowdens-squeaky-dolphin-leak-brits-spy-on-youtube-facebook-behavior-7000025641/|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Like button]] on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=zdnet/&gt; Facebook has since then encrypted the data.&lt;ref name=NBCJan14/&gt;

The program can be supplemented with commercially available analytic software to determine which videos are popular among residents of specific cities.&lt;ref name=NBCJan14/&gt; The dashboard software chosen was made by [[Splunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/blogs/2014/01/28/splunk-and-the-squeaky-dolphin-when-big-data-goes-rogue/ |title=Splunk and the Squeaky Dolphin: when Big Data goes rogue &amp;#124; PC Pro blog |publisher=Pcpro.co.uk |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation, which was originally shown to an [[NSA]] audience and was made public by the NBC, contains a note saying the program was "Not interested in individuals just broad trends!". However, "according to other Snowden documents" obtained by NBC, in 2010, "GCHQ exploited unencrypted data from Twitter to identify specific users around the world and target them with propaganda."&lt;ref name=NBCJan14/&gt;

Most tourists who visit San Marino are [[Italy|Italian]], usually consisting of people who come to spend holidays in the Romagna riviera and decide to spend a half-day or at most a night in the country.&lt;ref name="rtv"/&gt; Even though there are only a small number of non-Italian foreigners who visit the country, they still are vital to the Sammarinese economy.

There are no border formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase souvenir stamps which are officially canceled inside their [[passport]]s.

The [[City of San Marino]] itself contains most attractions.  The City is perched on a hill with regular parking areas for cars and buses.  The City historic center itself is only a pedestrian zone that has mostly gift shops and food venues on both sides.  

== Visitor attractions ==
The main tourist attractions in the most popular destination in the country, the City of San Marino, and the rest of the nation are:

* [[The Three Towers of San Marino]] (The First Guita Tower, The Second Cesta Tower, and the Third Montale Tower)
* The Cathedral of San Marino
* The medieval [[Palazzo Pubblico (San Marino)|Palazzo Pubblico]]
* The Piazza della Libertà, including the Statua della Libertà
* The Museo di stato di San Marino, or the State Museum of San Marino
* The Museo San Francesco
* The small medieval alleyways, shop-lined streets, scenic terraces and little churches all dispersed around the city and the country.

=== Medieval Days festival ===
Once a year, the world's smallest Republic revives its history when it turns into a theatrical spectacle of the Medieval Days festival. Every July, San Marino entices people within its ancient walls to experience the microstate's centuries-old stories in its medieval village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographs of the Medieval Days festival in San Marino|url=https://independent-travellers.com/san_marino/|work=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ungnyeo''' (웅녀 / 熊女), [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] for "[[bear]] woman," was a [[bear]] that became a [[woman]].  She was featured prominently in the [[creation myth]] of the [[Korea|Korean nation]].

==Story==
In the tale, a [[tiger]] and a bear (Ungnyeo) lived together in a cave and prayed to the divine king [[Hwanung]] to be made [[human]].  Hwanung heard their prayers and gave them 20 cloves of [[garlic]], a bundle of [[mugwort]] and ordered them to stay out of the sunlight and eat only this food for 100 days.  Due to hunger, the tiger left the cave after roughly 20 days, but the bear remained inside.  After 21 days, she was transformed into a woman.

Ungnyeo was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. Her lack of a husband drove her to depression, and she began to pray beneath a sacred [[betula|betula tree]] (신단수 / 神檀樹) to be blessed with a child.  Hwanung heard her prayers and was deeply moved.  He took Ungnyeo as his wife and soon after, she gave birth to a son, [[Dangun]], who would go on to found the nation of Korea.

== Interpretation of the story ==
There are two main characteristics of Ungnyeo. The founding myth of the Korean ancient nation generally sets the founder's paternal blood line as the Chensin(天神, The God of sky) and the mother line as the JIsin(地神, The God of ground). As a result, Ungnyeo is regarded as a type of totem deified by [[Dangun]]({{ill|단군|ko||WD=}})'s mother lineage.

On the other hand, The bear itself has religious implications. The bear is the god of the land and symbolizes the uterus that produces products in farming culture. Thus, bears are interpreted female predominantly. Ungnyeo is also interpreted as a kind of female god.

The '''flora and fauna of Andorra''' are similar to that found elsewhere in the [[Pyrenees]].

==Flora==
[[Chestnut]] and [[walnut]] trees grow only in the area around [[Sant Julià de Lòria]], the lowest settlement. Elsewhere, [[evergreen oak]]s are still common. Higher regions and many valleys have [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and various forms of subalpine and alpine plant life. At the highest altitudes there are no trees, but grass is plentiful during the summer. There are [[carnation]]s, [[Viola (plant)|violet]]s, [[Campanula|bellflowers]], and [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], as well as [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[Fragaria|wild strawberries]], and moss. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Fauna==
[[Bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[marten]]s, [[Pyrenean chamois]], [[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[vulture]]s, [[Mallard|wild ducks]], and [[goose|geese]] may be found in isolated areas. The mountain streams contain [[trout]], [[Esox|pike]], and [[crayfish]].  {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Windmill Redoubt''' ({{lang-mt|Ridott tal-Mitħna}}) was a [[redoubt]] in [[Żabbar]], [[Malta]]. It was built by Maltese insurgents during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|French blockade]] of 1798-1800. It was part of [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments]] encircling the French positions in [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]].

The redoubt was built around a windmill known as Bir Għeliem, or Ta' Buleben, which had been built by [[Ramon Perellos y Roccaful]] in around 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bir Gheliem Windmill / Ta ' Buleben Windmill|url=http://www.windmillsofmalta.nl/db.cgi?p=detail&amp;r=34|website=The Malta Windmill Database|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redoubt was located on the road between [[Żabbar]] and [[Tarxien]], and was also linked to the road to [[Żejtun]]. The redoubt was built using rubble walls, and had a triangular shape, and was built in a way so as to block the roads between the three villages. The windmill occupied the south side of the redoubt, and was used as a blockhouse. The windmill's tower served as a lookout post. No details are known about the size of the garrison and the armament of the redoubt.

The Windmill Redoubt was probably demolished soon after the end of the blockade since it blocked important roads. The windmill itself still exists, with some modifications, and it now stands on the middle of a [[roundabout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798-1800|journal=Arx - Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|pages=30–31|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
