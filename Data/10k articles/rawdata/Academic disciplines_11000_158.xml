      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">The '''American Posture League''' of the [[United States]] was established and initially funded by educator [[Jessie H. Bancroft]], Henry Ling Taylor, an orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. [[Eliza Mosher]]. The idea of the league was to combine scientific research with business: based on research in posture, they gave recommendations to businesses (manufacturers of footwear, furniture, etc.) and charging fees for contractual use the League labels. To the latter end, the '''Posture Standards Company''' was formed, to keep business separate from science, since the commercialization of science was one of the criticisms of the League. The enterprise was not a commercial success, but [[George J. Fisher]] (a former President of the League) notes that the founder trio were repaid all their investments, with the exception of the founding free gifts. &lt;ref&gt;[[George J.

}}'''AFROMET''' (Association For the Return of the Magdala Ethiopian Treasures) is an organization seeking the return of looted treasures to Ethiopia.

==History==
After the [[Battle of Magdala]] in 1868, the victorious British expedition looted a great many books and artifacts not only from the city of Maqdala but also from the Ethiopian Christian church of [[Medhane Alem]].&lt;ref name=pankhurst&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.afromet.org/history/
|title=Maqdala and its loot  
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|accessdate=July 8, 2008|publisher=[[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Henry M. Stanley]], the loot included "an infinite variety of gold, and silver and brass crosses", as well as "heaps of parchment royally illuminated". Fifteen elephants and almost two hundred mules were required to bear the loot to the nearby Dalanta Plain for auction. Richard Holmes, then Assistant in the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts, purchased 350 manuscripts and various solid goods, such as the crown of the [[Abun]] (Head of the Ethiopian Church).

Most of the loot is still missing; some of it is known to be held in public collections such as the [[British Museum]]. For example, a manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] bears a pencil note: ''"taken from a church at Maqdala in 1868"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the mid-20th century, world law and opinion gradually came to ban [[looting]], most notably codified in the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. A problem remained as to the status of goods looted previously. A number of efforts to return cultural items grew up around the world, of which AFROMET is one.

==Progress==
The Ethiopian government started requesting the return of the looted goods within three years of the battle, with some small success.&lt;ref name=pankhurst_2&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2004/06/04-06-04/An.htm
|title=Ethiopian Cultural Restitution
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|year=2006
|accessdate=February 4, 2007
|publisher=Addis Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, progress in general was slow.

Lady [[Valerie Meux]] bequeathed her collection of Ethiopian manuscripts to Emperor [[Menilek II]], but her will was overturned shortly after her death in 1910, on the grounds that Menilek was dead when Lady Meux died (which, in fact, was untrue; he died in 1913 and in any case he had heirs).

The British Government occasionally returned some of the looted items. In 1965, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] returned to Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] the royal cap and seal of [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]].

AFROMET was formed to lobby systematically for the repatriation of the objects, using legal means and public pressure. So far 10 items have been returned by private donors including a hand-written [[Book of Psalms]], two [[Tabot]]s and a shield. More than 460 items are still being claimed.

A '''branch''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|n|tʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|r|æ|n|tʃ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|r|æ|n|tʃ}}) or '''tree branch''' (sometimes referred to in [[botany]] as a '''ramus''') is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]] (or sometimes a [[shrub]]). Large branches are known as '''boughs''' and small branches are known as '''twigs'''.&lt;ref name="IntrotoPoetry"&gt;{{cite book|last=Driscoll|first=Michael|author2=Meredith Hamiltion|author3=Marie Coons|title=A Child's Introduction Poetry|publisher=Black Dog &amp; Leventhal Publishers|location=151 West 19th Street New York, NY 10011|date=May 2003|pages=10|isbn=1-57912-282-5|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a broad range of species of trees, branches and twigs can be found in many different shapes and sizes.

While branches can be nearly [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[Vertical direction|vertical]], or [[diagonal]], the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches.

The term "[[twig]]" often refers to a terminus, while "bough" refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk.

==Words==
Because of the enormous quantity of branches in the world, there are a variety of names in [[English language|English]] alone for them. In general however, unspecific words for a branch (such as '''rise''') have been [[archaism|replaced]] by the word branch itself.

===Specific terms===
A bough can also be called a '''limb''' or '''arm''', and though these are arguably [[metaphor]]s, both are widely accepted [[synonym]]s for bough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=limb "limb" on Merriam-Webster.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=arm "arm" on Merriam-Webster.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crotch''' or [[Tree forks|'''fork''']] is an area where a trunk splits into two or more boughs.

A [[twig]] is frequently referred to as a '''sprig''' as well, especially when it has been plucked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861712698 "sprig" on Encarta.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other words for twig include '''branchlet''', '''spray''', and '''surcle''', as well as the technical terms '''surculus''' and '''ramulus'''.

Branches found under larger branches can be called '''underbranches'''.

Some branches from specific trees have their own names, such as '''osiers''' and '''withes''' or '''[[withy|withies]]''', which come from [[willow]]s. Often trees have certain words which, in English, are naturally [[collocation|collocated]], such as [[holly]] and [[mistletoe]], which usually employ the phrase "sprig of" (as in, a "sprig of mistletoe"). Similarly, the branch of a [[cherry|cherry tree]] is generally referred to as a "cherry branch", while other such formations (i.e., "[[acacia]] branch" or "[[orange (fruit)|orange]] branch") carry no such alliance. A good example of this versatility is [[oak]], which could be referred to as variously an  "oak branch", an "oaken branch", a "branch of oak", or the "branch of an oak [tree]".

Once a branch has been cut or in any other way removed from its source, it is most commonly referred to as a '''stick''', and a stick employed for some purpose (such as [[walking]], [[spanking]], or [[beating up|beating]]) is often called a '''rod'''. Thin, flexible sticks are called '''[[Switch (rod)|switch]]es''', '''wands''', '''shrags''', or '''vimina''' (singular '''vimen''').

===History and etymology===

In [[Old English]], there are numerous words for branch, including ''{{lang|ang|seten}}'', ''{{lang|ang|stofn}}'', ''{{lang|ang|telgor}}'', and ''{{lang|ang|hrīs}}''. 
There are also numerous descriptive words, such as ''{{lang|ang|blēd}}'' (that is, something that has bled, or "bloomed", out), ''{{lang|ang|bōgincel}}'' (literally "little bough"), ''{{lang|ang|ōwæstm}}'' (literally "on growth"), and ''{{lang|ang|tūdornes}}'' (literally "offspringing"). Numerous other words for twigs and boughs abound, including ''{{lang|ang|tān}}'', which still survives as the "-toe" in ''mistletoe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/M0346400.html "mistletoe" on American Heritage.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502092508/http://www.bartleby.com/61/64/M0346400.html |date=May 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin words for branch are ''ramus'' or ''cladus''. The second term is an affix found in other modern words such as [[cladodonts]] (prehistoric sharks with branched teeth) or [[cladogram]].

In the late 1950s a number of European countries (most notably [[West Germany]] and France) decided on a migration policy known as the '''buffer theory'''.

Owing to rapid economic recovery in the post World War II period (aided by the American [[Marshall Plan|Marshall plan]]) there were many more job vacancies than people who were available or becoming available in the workforce to fill them. To resolve this situation they decided to "import" workers from the southern Mediterranean basin (including North Africa) on a temporary capacity to fill this labour shortfall.

These workers were invitees of the governments and came to Europe initially on the understanding that they could at any point in time in the future be repatriated if and when economic circumstances changed. These [[Gastarbeiter]] as they became known in Germany were mainly young unskilled males who very often left their families behind in their country of origin and migrated alone as 'Economic Migrant'. They worked predominantly in certain areas of the economy where working conditions were poorer than those of indigenous Germans and where the rates of pay were considerably lower. Ultimately they came to predominate in low paid service rated employment. The situation remained unchanged until the 1970s [[economic recession]].

Jobs were being lost in manufacturing and industry in particular but not necessarily in the occupational types in which the migrants worked. In 1974 the then West German government imposed a ban restricting any future economic migrants and offered the possibility of returning to their country of origin to many others, few migrants took up the offer and stayed at their jobs or began to receive unemployment assistance from the state. This led to increased tensions and feeling of resentment from many German people.

==Second wave of migration==

Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s [[family reunification]] took place between Turkish migrants workers and their families. This reunification however took place in Germany rather than in Turkey. In a difficult economic climate after the [[1973 oil crisis]] it was generally believed by most Turks already in Germany that their economic circumstances would be measurably better there than back in Turkey at such a difficult time. The [[welfare state]] offered considerable financial support to all people within Germany including immigrants communities. The number of foreign residents therefore increased in absolute terms during this time period.

The German government's offer to repatriate people back to their home country was not very successful. This created a difficult situation for the German government which became increasingly worse as the number of immigrants swelled to their highest levels ever. Any resentment, hostility and bitterness already present between indigenous Germans and the Turkish community became progressively worse. This often culminated in physical attacks on immigrants, arson and overt racial discrimination. There was a feeling amongst Germans that "they have taken our jobs", but this situation only arose because of Germans themselves losing their jobs in industry and manufacturing in particular in the difficult economic situation post 1973. (NB This 'family reunification' corresponds with the second wave on the [[Everett S. Lee model of migration]]).

==Third wave of migration==
Dates to the period from 1989 onwards with the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. East Germans flooded into West Germany along with many ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe. Germany accepted them as they were political refugees and very often [[asylum seekers]].

&lt;!-- {{PBB|geneid=1266}} --&gt;

'''Calponin 3. acidic''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CNN3'' [[gene]].

The ''CNN3'' gene is located at 1p22-p21&lt;ref name="pmid8526917"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maguchi M, Nishida W, Kohara K, Kuwano A, Kondo I, Hiwada K | title = Molecular cloning and gene mapping of human basic and acidic calponins | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 217 | issue = 1 | pages = 238–44 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8526917 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1995.2769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the human chromosomal genome. ''CNN3'' gene contains 7 exons and encodes calponin 3, a 36.4-kDa protein consisting of 329 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 5.84. Calponin 3 is known as acidic calponin. Among three isoforms of calponin, less is known for the gene regulation and function of calponin 3. Nonetheless, much has been learned from extensive studies on the homologous genes ''CNN1'' and ''CNN2'' that encode [[calponin 1]] and [[calponin 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu R, Jin JP | year =  2016 | title = Calponin Isoforms CNN1, CNN2 and CNN3: Regulators for Actin Cytoskeleton Functions in Smooth Muscle and Non-Muscle Cells. | journal = Gene | doi=10.1016/j.gene.2016.02.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
[[File:CNN3 wikipage.jpg|thumb|382x382px|
'''Figure 1.''' Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 3 isoforms deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences.
]]''CNN3'' is one of the three homologous calponin isoform genes. Calponin 3 is significantly diverged from calponin 1 and calponin 2 in the C terminal variable region. The higher degree of divergence among vertebrate ''CNN3'' genes than that in the ''CNN1'' and ''CNN2'' gene families suggests possibly earlier emergence of ''CNN3'', indicating that calponin 3 may represent a prototype of calponin ancestral of the three present-day isoforms (Fig. 1).

== Structure-function relationships ==

The primary structure of calponin 3 is similar as that of calponin 1 and calponin 2, consisting of a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region. The unique length amino acid sequence of the C-terminal segment of the three calponin isoforms are responsible for their size and overall charge differences.

Calponin 3 has been shown to participate in actin cytoskeleton-based activities such as that in embryonic development&lt;ref name="Shibukawa_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shibukawa Y, Yamazaki N, Kumasawa K, Daimon E, Tajiri M, Okada Y, Ikawa M, Wada Y | title = Calponin 3 regulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in trophoblastic cell fusion | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 21 | issue = 22 | pages = 3973–84 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20861310 | pmc = 2982094 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E10-03-0261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and myogenesis.&lt;ref name="Daimon_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daimon E, Shibukawa Y, Wada Y | title = Calponin 3 regulates stress fiber formation in dermal fibroblasts during wound healing | journal = Archives of Dermatological Research | volume = 305 | issue = 7 | pages = 571–84 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23545751 | doi = 10.1007/s00403-013-1343-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike calponin 1, calponin 3 has little effect on actomyosin Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity and does not cause actin filaments bundling at the same condition as calponin 1 does.&lt;ref name="pmid12033495"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujii T, Yabe S, Nakamura K, Koizumi Y | title = Functional analysis of rat acidic calponin | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 573–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12033495 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.25.573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8757">In [[biology]], '''co-adaptation''' is the process by which two or more species, genes or [[phenotypic trait]]s undergo [[adaptation]] as a pair or group. This occurs when two or more interacting characteristics undergo [[natural selection]] together in response to the same [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] or when selective pressures alter one characteristic and consecutively alter the interactive characteristic. These interacting characteristics are only beneficial when together, sometimes leading to increased interdependence. Co-adaptation and [[coevolution]], although similar in process, are not the same; co-adaptation refers to the interactions between two units, whereas co-evolution refers to their evolutionary history. Co-adaptation and its examples are often seen as evidence for co-evolution.&lt;ref name="Juan2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Juan |first1=David |last2=Pazos |first2=Florencio |last3=Valencia |first3=Alfonso |title=Co-evolution and co-adaptation in protein networks |journal=FEBS Letters |date=2008 |volume=582 |pages=1225–1230 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2008.02.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genes and Protein Complexes ==

At genetic level, co-adaptation is the accumulation of interacting genes in the gene pool of a population by selection. Selection pressures on one of the genes will affect its interacting proteins, after which compensatory changes occur.&lt;ref name="Blier2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blier |first1=Pierre U. |last2=Dufresne |first2=France |last3=Burton |first3=Ronald S. |title=Natural selection and the evolution of mtDNA-encoded peptides: evidence for intergenomic co-adaptation |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=2001 |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=400–406 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-9525(01)02338-1 |doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(01)02338-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juan2008" /&gt;

Proteins often act in complex interactions with other proteins and functionally related proteins often show a similar evolutionary path.&lt;ref name="Juan2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greiner2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greiner |first1=Stephan |last2=Bock |first2=Ralph |title=Tuning a menage a trois: Co-evolution and co-adaptation of nuclear and organellar genomes in plants |journal=BioEssays |date=2013 |volume=35 |pages=354–365 |doi=10.1002/bies.201200137}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation is co-adaptation.&lt;ref name="Juan2008" /&gt; An example of this is the interaction between proteins encoded by [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and [[nuclear DNA]] (nDNA). MtDNA has a higher rate of evolution/mutation than nDNA, especially in specific coding regions.&lt;ref name="Blier2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="greiner2013" /&gt; However, in order to maintain physiological functionality, selection for functionally interacting proteins, and therefore co-adapted nDNA will be favourable.&lt;ref name="Blier2001" /&gt;

Co-adaptation between mtDNA and nDNA sequences has been studied in the copepod ''[[Tigriopus californicus]]''.&lt;ref name="Blier2001" /&gt; The mtDNA of [[COII]] coding sequences among conspecific populations of this species diverges extensively.&lt;ref name="Blier2001" /&gt; When mtDNA of one population was placed in a nuclear background of another population, [[cytochrome c oxidase]] activity is significantly decreased, suggesting co-adaptation. Results show an unlikely relationship between the variation in mtDNA and environmental factors. A more likely explanation is the neutral evolution of mtDNA with compensatory changes by the nDNA driven by neutral evolution of mtDNA (random mutations over time in isolated populations).&lt;ref name="Blier2001" /&gt;

== Organs ==
Similar to traits on a genetic level, aspects of organs can also be subject to co-adaptation. For example, slender bones can have similar performance in regards to bearing daily loads as thicker bones, due to slender bones having more [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralized tissue]]. This means that slenderness and the level of mineralization have probably been co-adapted. However, due to being harder than thick bones, slender bones are generally less pliant and more prone to breakage, especially when subjected to more extreme load conditions.&lt;ref name="Tommasini2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tommasini|first1=Steven M.|last2=Nasser|first2=Philip|last3=Hu|first3=Bin|last4=Jepsen|first4=Karl J.|title=Biological Co-Adaptation of Morphological and Composition Traits Contributes to Mechanical Functionality and Skeletal Fragility|journal=Journal of Bone and Mineral Research|date=2007|volume=23|issue=2|pages=236–246|doi=10.1359/jbmr.071014|pmc=2665697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric fish|Weakly electric fish]] are capable of creating a weak electric field using an [[Electric organ (biology)|electric organ]]. These electric fields can be used to [[Electrocommunication|communicate]] between individuals through [[Electric organ (biology)#Electric organ discharge|electric organ discharges]] (EOD), which can be further modulated to create context-specific signals called ‘chirps’. Fish can sense these electric fields and signals using [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]]. Research on [[Apteronotidae|ghost knifefish]]&lt;ref name="Petzold2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petzold|first1=Jacquelyn|last2=Marsat|first2=Gary|last3=Smith|first3=G. Troy|title=Co-adaptation of electric organ discharges and chirps in South American ghost knifefishes (Apteronotidae)|journal=Journal of Physiology-Paris|date=2016|volume=110|issue=2|pages=200–215|doi=10.1016/j.jphysparis.2016.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the signals produced by electric fish and the way they are received might be co-adapted, as the environment in which the fish resides (both physical and social) influences selection for the chirps, EODs, and detection. Interactions between territorial fish favour different signal parameters than interactions within social groups of fish.

== Behaviour ==
The behaviour of parents and their offspring during feeding is influenced by one another. Parents feed depending on how much their offspring begs, while the offspring begs depending on how hungry it is. This would normally lead to a conflict of interest between parent and offspring, as the offspring will want to be fed as much as possible, whereas the parent can only invest a limited amount of energy into parental care. As such, selection would occur for the combination of begging and feeding behaviours that leads to the highest fitness, resulting in co-adaptation.&lt;ref name="Kölliker2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kölliker|first1=Mathias|last2=Brodie III|first2=Edmund D.|last3=Moore|first3=Allen J.|title=The Coadaptation of Parental Supply and Offspring Demand|journal=The American Naturalist|date=2005|volume=166|issue=4|pages=506–516|doi=10.1086/491687|url=http://edoc.unibas.ch/8076/1/20091201155908_4b152f3c74e00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parent-offspring co-adaption can be further influenced by information asymmetry, such as female [[Eurasian blue tit|blue tits]] being exposed more to begging behaviour in nature, resulting in them responding more than males to similar levels of stimuli.&lt;ref name="Lucass2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucass|first1=Carsten|last2=Fresneau|first2=Nolwenn|last3=Eens|first3=Marcel|last4=Müller|first4=Wendt|title=Sex roles in nest keeping – how information asymmetry contributes to parent-offspring co-adaptation|journal=Ecology and Evolution|date=2016|volume=6|issue=6|pages=1825–1833|doi=10.1002/ece3.1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partial and antagonistic co-adaptation ==
It is also possible for related traits to only partially co-adapt due to traits not developing at the same speed, or contradict each other entirely. Research on [[Lygosominae|Australian skinks]]&lt;ref&gt;Huey, R. B., and A. F. Bennett. 1987. Phylogenetic studies of coadaptation: preferred temperatures versus optimal performance temperatures of lizards. Evolution 41:1098–1115.&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that diurnal skinks have a high temperature preference and can sprint optimally at higher temperatures, while nocturnal skinks have a low preferred temperature and optimum temperature. However, the differences between high and low optimal temperatures were much smaller than between preferred temperatures, which means that nocturnal skinks sprint slower compared to their diurnal counterparts. In the case of ''[[Eremiascincus]]'', the optimum temperature and preferred temperature diverged from one another in opposite directions, creating antagonistic co-adaptation.

[[Lattice multiplication]], a similar concept from decimal math.
]]The '''Dadda multiplier''' is a hardware multiplier design invented by computer scientist [[Luigi Dadda]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="Dadda_1965"/&gt; It is similar to the [[Wallace multiplier]], but it is slightly faster (for all operand sizes) and requires fewer gates (for all but the smallest operand sizes).&lt;ref name="Townsend_2003"/&gt;

In fact, Dadda and Wallace multipliers have the same three steps for two bit strings &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; of lengths &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively:

# Multiply ([[Logical conjunction|logical AND]]) each bit of &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;, by each bit of &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt;, yielding &lt;math&gt;\ell_1\cdot\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; results, grouped by weight in columns 
# Reduce the number of partial products by stages of [[Adder (electronics)|full and half adders]] until we are left with at most two bits of each weight.
# Add the final result with a conventional adder.

As with the Wallace multiplier, the multiplication products of the first step carry different weights reflecting the magnitude of the original bit values in the multiplication. For example, the product of bits &lt;math&gt;a_n b_m&lt;/math&gt; has weight &lt;math&gt;n+m&lt;/math&gt;.

Unlike Wallace multipliers that reduce as much as possible on each layer, Dadda multipliers attempt to minimize the number of gates used, as well as input/output delay. Because of this, Dadda multipliers have a less expensive reduction phase, but the final numbers may be a few bits longer, thus requiring slightly bigger adders.

== Description ==
[[File:Full-adder.svg|thumb | An example of a full-adder circuit.]]To achieve a more optimal final product, the structure of the reduction process is governed by slightly more complex rules than in Wallace multipliers. 

The progression of the reduction is controlled by a maximum-height sequence &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;, defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;d_1 = 2 \text{ and } d_{j+1} = \operatorname{floor}(1.5 d_j).&lt;/math&gt;

This yields a sequence like so:

: &lt;math&gt;d_1=2, d_2=3, d_3=4, d_4=6, d_5=9, d_6=13, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

The initial value of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is chosen as the largest value such that &lt;math&gt;d_j &lt; min(n_1, n_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_2&lt;/math&gt; are the number of bits in the input multiplicand and multiplier. The lesser of the two bit lengths will be the maximum height of each column of weights after the first stage of multiplication. For each stage &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of the reduction, the goal of the algorithm is the reduce the height of each column so that it is less than or equal to the value of &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. 

For each stage from &lt;math&gt;,\ldots,1&lt;/math&gt;, reduce each column starting at the lowest-weight column, &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; according to these rules:
# If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_i) \leqslant d_j&lt;/math&gt; the column does not require reduction, move to column &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;
# If &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_i) = d_j + 1&lt;/math&gt; add the top two elements in a half-adder, placing the result at the bottom of the column and the carry at the top of column &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;, then move to column &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;
# Else, add the top three elements in a full-adder, placing the result at the bottom of the column and the carry at the top of column &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;, restart &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;at step 1

== Algorithm example ==
[[File:dadda tree 8x8.svg|thumb | Example of Dadda reduction on 8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;8 multiplier. Bits with lower weight are rightmost.]]
The example in the adjacent image illustrates the reduction of an 8&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;8 multiplier, explained here.

The initial state &lt;math&gt;j = 4&lt;/math&gt; is chosen as &lt;math&gt;d_4 = 6&lt;/math&gt;, the largest value less than 8.

'''Stage &lt;math&gt;j=4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_4 = 6&lt;/math&gt;'''
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_0\cdots c_5)&lt;/math&gt; are all less than or equal to six bits in height, so no changes are made
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_6) = d_4 + 1 = 7&lt;/math&gt;, so a half-adder is applied, reducing it to six bits and adding its carry bit to &lt;math&gt;c_7&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_7) = 9&lt;/math&gt; including the carry bit from &lt;math&gt;c_6&lt;/math&gt;, so we apply a full-adder and a half-adder to reduce it to six bits
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_8) = 9&lt;/math&gt; including two carry bits from &lt;math&gt;c_7&lt;/math&gt;, so we again apply a full-adder and a half-adder to reduce it to six bits
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_9) = 8&lt;/math&gt; including two carry bits from &lt;math&gt;c_8&lt;/math&gt;, so we apply a single full-adder and reduce it to six bits
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{height}(c_{10}\cdots c_{14})&lt;/math&gt; are all less than or equal to six bits in height including carry bits, so no changes are made

[[Massimo Stanzione]]'s '''''David with the Head of Goliath''''' is exhibited at the [[San Diego Museum of Art]].

== History ==
In 1947, Mrs. Harry Turpin gifted a Stanzione original painting titled ''David With the Head of Goliath'' to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the [[San Diego Museum of Art]]); the work was then attributed to [[Jusepe Ribera|Ribera]], but was reattributed to Stanzione by Mario Modestini in 1951, an attribution confirmed by Schleier, Felton, Zeri, and Spinosa. The painting is dated to approximately 1630. [[Caravaggio]] was an important influence in Stanzione’s artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio’s brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of [[Goliath]]. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. [[Guido Reni]] and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione’s interpretation of [[chiaroscuro]]; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath’s forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath’s full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath’s dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.

Prof. '''Davor Džalto''' (Давор Џалто: born May 17, 1980) is an [[artist]], [[art historian]], [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Liberalism|liberal]] orientation born in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is also known as one of the most important [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christian]] thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.svspress.com/the-human-work-of-art-a-theological-appraisal-of-creativity-and-the-death-of-the-artist/)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davor-dzalto.jpg|thumb|Davor Džalto]]

He graduated from the School of Art in [[Niš]]. His academic career started in [[Belgrade]] where he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in the [[history of art]]. In 2004 he began writing his PhD thesis at the [[Albert-Ludwigs Universitaet]] in Freiburg, Germany (mentor Professor Dr. Angeli Janhsen), where he defended it successfully in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and the South-East European region.&lt;ref&gt;(Ksenija Pavlovic, ''10/30 Exhibition Catalogue'', Belgrade: 2010, 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a [[university professor]] of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and [[religious studies]]. As a visiting and honorary professor he has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], [[Indiana University]], [[Fordham University]] of New York and [[The American University of Rome]]. He is also the [[president]] of The [[Institute]] for the Study of [[Culture]] and [[Christianity]].

His work is based on examination of the relations between [[personhood]] and [[authorship]], especially in the [[postmodern]] and [[globalization]] context. He has formulated a theory according to which art represents an [[Symbolic expression|expression]] of the [[personal identity]] of the human being, having an [[Existentialism|existential]] importance. That way he contributed to the revision of the [[postmodernism]], actualizing the question of possibility and meaning of the art creation. He continued to further develop theological concepts of [[John Zizioulas]] and philosophical statements given by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], implementing them on the contemporary historical and cultural context. He also examines the concept of "[[simulacrum]]" in relation to the human person and its ability to create.

He also works in various media artistically including [[video art]], performance, painting, and sculpture.

His work has been presented at numerous exhibitions internationally. He has taken part in many conferences and seminars, having [[peace]] and inter-religious backgrounds. It is also held that he played an important role in [[South Eastern Europe]] in promoting peace, reconciliation and cooperation between religious communities, primarily because he has contacts among all important religions and religious leaders in the [[Balkans]] and in Europe. He was directly involved in many initiatives during his engagement in the [[Pax Christi]] office in Belgrade. He has written a number of articles and theoretical texts. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book, ''On Writings as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon''. He is a founding member and the art director of the [[Flexible Art Network]] and vice president of the Christian Cultural Center. He lives and works in [[Freiburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Belgrade]]. Based on the ''Aesthetik der Absenz'', formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of "absence of body" in twentieth-century art. In 2007 his name was added to the list of 100 most influential people in the world, originating from the South Eastern European region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23841">The '''dear enemy effect''' or '''dear enemy recognition''' is an [[ethological]] phenomenon in which two neighbouring [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] [[animals]] become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83&lt;/ref&gt; As territory owners become accustomed to their neighbours, they expend less time and energy on defensive behaviors directed toward one another. However, aggression toward unfamiliar neighbours remains the same.&lt;ref name="Alcock" &gt;{{cite book | last = Alcock | first = John | title = Animal Behavior, 9th Ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | pages = 281–282 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-87893-225-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors have suggested the dear enemy effect is territory residents displaying lower levels of aggression toward familiar neighbours compared to unfamiliar individuals who are non-territorial "floaters".&lt;ref name="Bee"&gt;Bee, M.A., (2003).  A test of the "dear enemy effect" in the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio''). Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54: 601-610&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli" /&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been observed in a wide range of animals including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.

The behavioural effect can be modulated by factors such as the location of the familiar and unfamiliar animal, the season, and the presence of females.

The dear enemy effect is the converse of the [[nasty neighbour effect]] in which some species are more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards unfamiliar strangers.

==Function==
The ultimate function of the dear enemy effect is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the animal expressing the behaviour.  This increase in fitness is achieved by reducing the time, energy or risk of injury unnecessarily incurred by defending a territory or its resources (e.g. mate, food, space) against a familiar animal with its own territory; the territory-holder already knows about the abilities of the neighbour, and also knows that the neighbour is unlikely to try to take over the territory because it already has one.

==Mechanism==
The interaction between two neighbours can be modelled as an iterated [[Prisoner’s dilemma|prisoner's dilemma]] game. In this view, a territory owner that acts non-aggressively towards a neighbour can be thought of as [[Cooperation|cooperating]], while a territory owner that acts aggressively towards its neighbour can be considered to have defected. A necessary condition for the prisoner’s dilemma game to hold is that an aggressive individual should enjoy greater benefits than a non-aggressive individual when each is faced with a non-aggressive opponent. This stipulation is plausible, as an aggressive individual might enlarge their territory or steal food or matings from a non-aggressive individual.&lt;ref name="Akçay" /&gt;  When cooperation involves a cost, a possible mechanism for achieving stable co-operation is [[reciprocal altruism]], where pairs of individuals trade bouts of cooperative behaviour with one another.  Dear enemy cooperation could be explained by reciprocal altruism if territorial neighbours use conditional strategies such as [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]]. In the tit-for-tat strategy, a subject will cooperate when its partner (neighbour) cooperates and defect when the partner defects.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, J., (2002).  Conditional strategies in territorial defense: do Carolina wrens play tit-for-tat?  Behavioral Ecology, 13: 664-669. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/13.5.664&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==

===In mammals===
[[File:Badger-badger.jpg|right|thumb|Eurasian badgers respond less aggressively to the scent of familiar conspecifics than unfamiliar]]
Territorial [[Eurasian beaver]]s (''Castor fiber'') presented with a two-way [[Preference tests (animals)|choice]] sniffed both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger longer than from a neighbour.  Furthermore, beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) longer to castoreum, but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour. When the mounds containing the scents were allowed to remain overnight and the beavers' responses measured the following morning, the beavers' responses were stronger to both castoreum and anal gland secretion from a stranger than from a neighbour.&lt;ref name="Rosell and Bjørkøyli"&gt;Rosell, F. and Bjørkøyli, T. (2002). A test of the dear enemy phenomenon in the Eurasian beaver. Animal Behaviour, 63: 1073–1078&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurasian badger]]s (''Meles meles'') can discriminate between self-, neighbour- and unfamiliar- group faeces near their main [[sett]]. Badgers show heightened behavioural responses towards unfamiliar- compared with self-group scents, but there is no difference in response to neighbour- relative to self-group scents. The relative responses towards unfamiliar-group scents are greatest during the breeding seasons, but there is no seasonal differences in the responses to neighbour-group versus self-group scents. In badger populations, levels of aggression between neighbouring territory-holders are likely to be kept relatively low through neighbour recognition. However, increased levels of aggression will be shown towards dispersing or itinerant (alien) badgers, especially during periods such as the breeding season when the potential threats to the long-term fitness of territory owners are greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Palphramand1, K.L. and White, P.C.L., (2007).  Badgers, Meles meles, discriminate between neighbour, alien and self scent.  Animal Behaviour, 74: 429–436&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red squirrels]] are able to discriminate the odours of familiar neighbours and strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Vaché, M., Ferron, J. and Gouat, P., (2001). The ability of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to discriminate conspecific olfactory signatures. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 79: 1296-1300&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this discrimination may be used by males to avoid unnecessary chases and fights by becoming known to their neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Tamiasciurus_hudsonicus/|title=Animal Diversity Web -''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'' red squirrel|author=Rubin, C.|year=2012|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===

Audio playback studies are often used to test the dear enemy effect in birds.  These studies have demonstrated several bird species respond more aggressively to played back songs of strangers than to songs of neighbours including the [[alder flycatcher]] (''Empidonax alnorum''),&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, S.F. (2004). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in a suboscine bird, the alder flycatcher, ''Empidonax alnorum''. Behavioral Ecology, 15: 799-804  DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arh082&lt;/ref&gt; male [[Dendragapus|blue grouse]],&lt;ref&gt;Falls, J.B. and McNicholl, M.K., (1979). Neighbor-stranger discrimination by song in male blue grouse. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 57: 457-462&lt;/ref&gt; [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula''),&lt;ref&gt;Brindley, E.L., (1991). Response of European robins to playback of song: neighbor recognition and overlapping. Animal Behaviour, 41: 503-512&lt;/ref&gt; and male [[banded wren]] (''Thryothorus pleurostictus'').&lt;ref&gt;Mollesf, L.E. and Vehrencamp, S.L., (2001). Neighbour recognition by resident males in the banded wren, Thryothorus pleurostictus, a tropical songbird with high song type sharing.  Animal Behaviour, 61: 119–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring male [[song sparrow]]s (''Melodia melospiza'') differ individually in their aggressiveness. Increased aggression by residents towards intruders indicates that residents not only respond to intrinsic aggressiveness of their neighbours, but also to short-term changes in aggression levels.&lt;ref name="Akçay"&gt;Akçay, C. et al., (2009). Good neighbour, bad neighbour: song sparrows retaliate against aggressive rivals. Animal Behaviour, 78: 97–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Although neighbour–stranger discrimination has been reported in many [[passerine]] birds, it has seldom been investigated in territorial non-passerine species. The nocturnal [[Bird of prey|raptor]], the [[little owl]] (''Athene noctua''), hoots to defend its territory.  Male little owls respond less to their neighbour's hoots played back from the usual location. However, responses to playback of a neighbour from an unusual location are similar to responses to playback of a stranger's hoots from either location.&lt;ref&gt;Hardouin, L.A., Tabel, P. and Bretagnolle, V., (2006).  Neighbour–stranger discrimination in the little owl, ''Athene noctua''. Animal Behaviour, 72: 105–112&lt;/ref&gt;

During the breeding season of the [[skylark]] (''Alauda arvensis''), particular common sequences of syllables (phrases) are produced by all males established in the same location (neighbours), whereas males of different locations (strangers) share only few syllables. Playback experiments provided evidence for neighbour–stranger discrimination consistent with the dear enemy effect, indicating that shared sequences were recognized and identified as markers of the group identity.&lt;ref name="Briefer"&gt;Briefer, E., Aubin, T., Lehongre, K. and Rybak, F., (2008).  How to identify dear enemies: the group signature in the complex song of the skylark ''Alauda arvensis''. Journal of Experimental Biology, 211: 317-326. DOI: 10.1242/jeb.013359&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that the dear enemy effect changes during the breeding season of the skylark.  Playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. In song sparrows, where neighbours are most often the sires of extra-pair offspring&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=C |title=Extra-pair paternity, song, and genetic quality in song sparrows. |journal=Behavioural Ecology |date=2011 |volume=22 |page=73-81}}&lt;/ref&gt;, males will alter their aggression toward neighbouring males with their female's fertility status. When presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's pre-fertile and post-fertile periods, males displayed the dear enemy effect&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, when presented with simulated stranger and neighbour intruders during their female's fertile period, males exhibited an equal response to both stimuli, likely in order to protect their paternity&lt;ref name="Moser-Purdy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moser-Purdy |first1=C |last2=MacDougall-Shackleton |first2=E |last3=Mennill |first3=D. J. |title=Enemies are not always dear: male song sparrows adjust dear enemy effect expression in response to female fertility |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2017 |volume=126 |page=17-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the dear enemy relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Briefer, E., Rybak, F. and Aubin, T., (2008).  When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis.  Animal Behaviour, 76: 1319–1325&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reptiles===
[[File:Anolis sagrei sagrei (displaying).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A brown anole displaying with its [[dewlap]]]]
Males of a territorial lizard, the tawny dragon (''[[Ctenophorus]] decresii''), reduced their aggression levels in repeat interactions with familiar rivals and increased their aggression levels towards unfamiliar males. The time taken for interactions to be settled was also lower towards familiar than unfamiliar males.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, L., (2005).  Rival recognition in the territorial tawny dragon (Ctenophorus decresii).  Acta Ethologica, 8: 45-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Another territorial lizard, the [[common collared lizard]] (''Crotaphytus collaris''), can individually recognize neighbours and will increase aggression towards them as the threat to territorial ownership increases. Resident males treat familiar neighbours that had been moved to the opposite boundary to the shared boundary as equally aggressive as strangers. However, residents responded more aggressively towards strangers than towards neighbours on natural territories and also in neutral arena encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Husakf, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Adult male collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris, increase aggression towards displaced neighbours.  Animal Behaviour, 65: 391–396&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[brown anole]] lizard (''Anolis sagrei''), dyads of males behave differently
depending on whether the lizards are prior neighbours, with prior neighbours exhibiting fewer bobbing relative to nodding forms of headbob displays than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;McMann, S. and Paterson, A.V., (2012).  Display behavior of resident brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) during close encounters with neighbors and nonneighbors. Herpetological Conservation and Biology, 7(1): 27−37&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===

Males of the territorial breeding [[agile frog]] (''Rana dalmatina''), have a large variability in call characteristics and are able to discriminate between neighbouring and unfamiliar conspecifics. Calling is of the longest duration in response to an unfamiliar acoustic stimulus; in contrast, the response to a familiar conspecific call does not show any difference from solitary vocalisations.&lt;ref&gt;Lesbarrèresa, D. and Lodéa, T., (2002). Variations in male calls and responses to an unfamiliar advertisement call in a territorial breeding anuran, Rana dalmatina: evidence for a “dear enemy” effect. Ethology, Ecology &amp; Evolution, 14: 287-295. DOI:10.1080/08927014.2002.9522731&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial red-backed salamanders, ''Plethodon cinereus'', defend territories under rocks and logs on the forest floor in the eastern USA.  Individuals are more aggressive to unfamiliar salamanders than to familiar individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, R. G., (1981).  Dear enemy recognition and the costs of aggression between salamanders.  American Naturalist 117: 964-972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fish===

The dear enemy effect in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.  Reduced aggression consistent with dear enemy recognition occurs between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, but the presence of a female in a male's territory instigates comparably greater aggression between the neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K., (2003). When are neighbours ‘dear enemies’ and when are they not? The responses of territorial male variegated pupfish, Cyprinodon variegatus, to neighbours, strangers and heterospecifics. Animal Behaviour, 65: 453–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have staged three-way contests between male [[convict cichlid]]s (''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum'') to examine the dear enemy effect. When faced with a familiar neighbour and an unfamiliar intruder simultaneously, residents preferentially confronted the unfamiliar opponent. That is, the establishment of dear enemy recognition between a resident and a neighbour allowed the resident to direct his aggression to the greater competitive threat, i.e. the intruder.&lt;ref&gt;Leiser, J.K. and Itzkowitz, M., (1989).  The benefits of dear enemy recognition in three-contender convict cichlid (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) contests. Behaviour, 136: 983-1003&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual recognition of noises produced males of the bicolor [[damselfish]] (''Pomacentrus partitus'') have been demonstrated in the field. Playbacks of non-resident sounds from a given fish's territory elicit a greater response from its nearest neighbour than playbacks of the resident's sound. Testing also included switching the sounds of the two nearest neighbours relative to each respective male's territory. Results demonstrated that all males in the colony individually recognize the sounds of their two nearest neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Myrberg, A.A. and Riggio, R.J., (1985).  Acoustically mediated individual recognition by a coral reef fish (Pomacentrus partitus). Animal Behaviour, 33: 411–416&lt;/ref&gt;

===In invertebrates===

The home ranges of colony living ants often overlap the ranges of other conspecific colonies and colonies of other species. In laboratory experiments, the frequency and severity of agonistic interactions among workers from different colonies increases with the distance between their nests; this has been reported for ''[[Leptothorax nylanderi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hkinzk, J., Foitzik, S., Hippert, A. and Hölldobler, B., (1996).  Apparent dear-enemy phenomenon and environment-based recognition cues in the ant Leptothorax nylanderi. Ethology, 102: 510–522. DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1996.tb01143.x&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pheidole]]'' ants.&lt;ref&gt;Langen, T.A., Tripet, F. and Nonacs, P., (2000).  The red and the black: habituation and the dear-enemy phenomenon in two desert ''Pheidole'' ants.  Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48: 285-292&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild, male bees of the species ''[[Xylocopa micans]]'' have been known to slowly fly into the territory of an adjacent male territory holder in order to test and establish the mutual boundary of their two territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Territorial Behavior in Male Xylocopa micans (Hymenoptera: Anthophoridae)|jstor = 25083909|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1979-04-01|pages = 313–323|volume = 52|issue = 2|first = Gordon W.|last = Frankie|first2 = S. B.|last2 = Vinson|first3 = Alcinda|last3 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dear enemy effect has been reported in colonies of the fungus-growing termite [[Macrotermitinae|''Macrotermes falciger'']]. Behavioural tests with workers reveal no alarm behaviour or mortality in pairings of workers from the same colony but a full range from no alarm to overt aggression, with associated death, when individuals were paired from different colonies. The level of mortality increases with differences in the composition of [[Cuticle|cuticular]] [[hydrocarbons]] between colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Kaib1, M., Franke, S., Francke, W. and Brand, R., (2002).  Cuticular hydrocarbons in a termite: phenotypes and a neighbour–stranger effect. Physiological Entomology, 27, 189–198. DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-3032.2002.00292.x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crabby Fiddler - Flickr - Andrea Westmoreland.jpg|thumb|right|Male sand fiddler crabs attract mates by waving]]Male sand fiddler crabs (''[[Uca pugilator]]'') defend territories that consist of a breeding burrow and a display area where they wave their claw to attract females. Burrow-holding males engage in agonistic contests with both intruding males that attempt burrow take-overs and with other territory-holding neighbours that apparently attempt to limit waving or other surface activities of rivals. Contests consist of one or more behavioural elements that range from no claw contact to use of the claw to push, grip, or flip an opponent.  In the field, contests with intruders begin at higher intensities and escalate more rapidly than those with neighbours. However, resident-resident contests increase in intensity when burrows are close, neighbours faced each other when exiting burrows, and neighbours were of similar size. Proximity and orientation determine the ease with which a neighbour may be engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, A.E. and McLain, D.K., (2006).  How dear is my enemy: Intruder-resident and resident-resident encounters in male sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator). Behaviour, 143: 597-617&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nasty neighbour effect or no effect==

A range of studies have found evidence of an effect opposite to the dear enemy effect, i.e. more aggression is shown toward neighbours than strangers.  This has been termed the "nasty neighbour" effect.

[[File:Oophaga pumilio Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Strawberry dart-poison frog]]
{{Listen|filename=Oophaga_pumilio_call.ogg|left|title=Listen to the strawberry dart-poison frog|description=Male advertisement call|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Colonies of the [[weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla smaragdina'') are able to recognize a greater proportion of workers from neighbouring colonies as non-colony members.  When recognized as non-colony members, more aggression is exhibited toward neighbours than non-neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Newey, P.S., Robson, S.K. and Crozier, R.H., (2010).  Weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina encounter nasty neighbors rather than dear enemies.  Ecology, 91(8):2366-72&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banded mongoose]] (''Mungos mungo'') groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, C.A. and Manser, M.B., (2007). ‘Nasty neighbours’ rather than ‘dear enemies’ in a social carnivore. Proc. R. Soc. B., 274: 959-965&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species.  Furthermore, animals may respond in this way when encounters with intruders from non-neighbouring colonies are rare and of little consequence.

Female [[New Zealand bellbird]]s (''Anthornis melanura'') are more aggressive toward the songs of neighbouring females. This is opposite to the dear enemy phenomenon and suggests that neighbouring females pose a greater threat than strangers in his species.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, D.H., Evans, B., Cope, T. and Ji, W. (2008).  A test of the dear enemy hypothesis in female New Zealand bellbirds (Anthornis melanura): female neighbors as threats. Behavioral Ecology, 19 (4): 791-798. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arn027 [http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/arn027v1]&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of studies have found no evidence of the dear enemy effect showing the effect is not universal. Territorial males of the strawberry dart-poison frog (''Dendrobates pumilio'')&lt;ref name="Bee" /&gt; and the [[spotted antbird]] (''Hylophylax naevioides'')&lt;ref&gt;Bard, S., Hau, M., Wikelski, M. and Wingfield, J.C. (2002).  Vocal distinctiveness and response to conspecific playback in the spotted antbird. Condor, 104: 387-394&lt;/ref&gt; do not discriminate behaviourally between the calls of neighbours and strangers, and female collared lizards show no difference in their behaviour to neighbouring or unfamiliar females.&lt;ref&gt;Husak, J.F. and Fox, S.F., (2003).  Spatial organisation and the dear enemy phenomenon in adult female collared lizards.,  Journal of Herpetology, 37, 211-215 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1565856?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102326133101]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guinea baboon]] (''Papio papio'') males which live in gangs do not differ in their response behaviour toward neighbouring and stranger males and largely ignore any non-gang member, irrespective of familiarity; that is, they neither show a “dear enemy” nor “nasty neighbour” effect.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej, P., Patzelt, A., Ndao, I., Hammerschmidt, K. and Julia Fischer, J., (2013).  Social monitoring in a multilevel society: a playback study with male Guinea baboons. Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 67(1): 61–68. DOI: 10.1007/s00265-012-1425-1&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' Der Bäbu ''''' (''The Baboo'') is a [[Comic opera]] in three acts by [[Heinrich Marschner]]. The German libretto by Wilhelm August Wohlbrück (Marschner's brother-in-law) is based on the book ''The Baboo and Other Tales Descriptive of Society in India. Smith, Elder, and Co., London 1834'' by [[Augustus Prinsep]]. The first performance took place on 19 February 1838 in [[Hanover]].

'''Digital sociology''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that focuses on understanding the use of [[digital media]] as part of everyday life, and how these various technologies contribute to patterns of human behavior, social relationships and [[Self-concept|concepts of the self]].

The first scholarly article to have the term 'digital sociology' in the title appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, J. (2009) Digital sociology: emergent technologies in the field and the classroom. ''Sociological Forum'', 24(2), 448--456&lt;/ref&gt; The author reflected on the ways in which digital technologies may influence both sociological research and teaching. In 2010, 'digital sociology' was described, by [https://about.me/rrneal Richard Neal], in terms of bridging the growing academic focus with the increasing interest from global business through the publication of the book, ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization''.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, R. (2010) ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization.'' Lulu&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2013 that the first purely academic book tackling the subject of 'digital sociology' was published. The edited collection of review chapters addressed a range of topics, including concepts and experiences of space, community, intimacy, the role played by gender and social inequalities in people's use of digital technologies and the impact of these technologies in education, health, finance and war reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Orton-Johnson, K. and Prior, N. (eds) (2013) ''Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives''. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; The first sole-authored book entitled ''Digital Sociology'' was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2015) ''Digital Sociology''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The first academic conference on "Digital Sociology" was held in New York, NY in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J., Gregory, K., Cottom, T.M. Digital Sociology MiniConference, organized in conjunction with the Eastern Sociological Society meetings, February 27–28, 2015. http://digsoc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/conference-papers-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ‘digital sociology’ has not yet fully entered the cultural lexicon, sociologists have engaged in research related to the internet since its inception. These sociologists have addressed many social issues relating to [[online communities]], [[cyberspace]] and cyber-identities. This and similar research has attracted many different names such as 'cybersociology', [[sociology of the Internet|'the sociology of the internet']], 'the sociology of online communities', 'the sociology of social media', 'the sociology of cyberculture' or something else again.

Digital sociology differs from these terms in that it is wider in its scope, addressing not only the internet or [[cyberculture]] but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century. Since the internet has become more pervasive and linked with everyday life, references to the 'cyber' in the social sciences seems now to have been replaced by the 'digital'. 'Digital sociology' is related to other sub-disciplines such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital anthropology]]. It is beginning to supersede and incorporate the other titles above, as well as including the newest [[Web 2.0]] digital technologies into its purview, such as [[wearable technology]], [[augmented reality]], [[smart objects]], the [[Internet of Things]] and [[big data]].

== Aspects ==

Four aspects of digital sociology have been identified:&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/8621 "Digital sociology: an introduction"]. Sydney: University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Professional digital practice''': using digital media tools for professional purposes: to build networks, construct an e-profile, publicise and share research and instruct students.
# '''Sociological analyses of digital use''': researching the ways in which people's use of digital media configures their sense of selves, their embodiment and their social relations.
# '''Digital data analysis''': using digital data for social research, either quantitative or qualitative.
# '''Critical digital sociology''': undertaking reflexive and critical analysis of digital media informed by social and cultural theory.

=== Professional digital practice ===
Although they have been reluctant to use social and other digital media for professional academics purposes, sociologists are slowly beginning to adopt them for teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;Carrigan, M. (2013) [http://markcarrigan.net/2013/06/06/is-the-use-of-sociological-media-becoming-mainstream-within-uk-sociology/ "The emergence of sociological media? Is social media becoming mainstream within UK sociology?"]. Mark Carrigan.net&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of sociological blogs are beginning to appear and more sociologists are joining Twitter, for example. Some are writing about the best ways for sociologists to employ social media as part of academic practice (see the [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/ LSE Impact of the Social Sciences website]) and the importance of [[self-archiving]] and making sociological research open access,&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/opening-up-your-research-self-archiving-for-sociologists/ "Opening up your research: self-archiving for sociologists"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing for [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wadewitz, A. (2013) [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/04/09/change-the-world-edit-wikipedia/ "Wikipedia is pushing the boundaries of scholarly practice but the gender gap must be addressed"]. LSE Impact of the Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociological analyses of digital media use ===
Digital sociologists have begun to write about the use of wearable technologies as part of quantifying the body&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09581596.2013.794931#.UbrhSpN--V4 "Quantifying the body: monitoring and measuring health in the age of mHealth technologies"]. ''Critical Public Health''&lt;/ref&gt; and the social dimensions of big data and the algorithms that are used to interpret these data.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney-Lippold, J. (2011) [http://lass312a14.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/89244152/A-New-Algorithmic-Identity-Soft-Biopolitcs.pdf "A new algorithmic identity: soft biopolitics and the modulation of control"]. ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'', 28(6), 164-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have directed attention at the role of digital technologies as part of the surveillance of people's activities, via such technologies as [[CCTV cameras]] and customer loyalty schemes&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Wood, D. (2003) [http://csp.sagepub.com/content/23/2/227.full.pdf+html "Digitizing surveillance: categorization, space, inequality"]. ''Critical Social Policy'', 23(2),227-48.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[mass surveillance]] of the internet that is being conducted by secret services such as the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;!-- [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]] --&gt;

The '[[digital divide]]', or the differences in access to digital technologies experienced by certain social groups such as the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those of lower education levels, women and the elderly, has preoccupied many researchers in the social scientific study of digital media. However several sociologists have pointed out that while it is important to acknowledge and identify the [[Structural inequality|structural inequalities]] inherent in differentials in digital technology use, this concept is rather simplistic and fails to incorporate the complexities of access to and knowledge about digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, S. and Tranter, B. (2006) [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/chaston/Chaston%20Web%20readings%20chapters%201-12/Chapter%205%20-%2026%20Willis%20&amp;%20Tranter.pdf "Beyond the 'digital divide': Internet diffusion and inequality in Australia"]. Journal of Sociology, 42(1), 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the ways in which social media contribute to the development of intimate relationships and concepts of the self. One of the best-known sociologists who has written about social relationships, selfhood and digital technologies is [[Sherry Turkle]].&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1984) [http://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Turkle_Sherry_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit_20th_ed.pdf "The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit"]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1995) [[Life on the Screen|"Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet"]]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; In her most recent book Turkle addresses the topic of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011) ''Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that relationships conducted via these platforms are not as authentic as those encounters that take place "in real life".

Visual media allows the viewer to be a more passive consumer of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynn|first=Jonathan R|title=Digital Sociology: Emergent Technologies in the Field and the Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/26473501/Digital_Sociology_Emergent_Technologies_in_the_Field_and_the_Classroom|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are more likely to develop online personas that differ from their personas in the real world. This contrast between the digital world (or 'cyberspace') and the 'real world', however, has been critiqued as ''''digital dualism'''', a concept similar to the '[[The Aura of the Digital|aura of the digital]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, M. (2006) [http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=519 "The Aura of the Digital"], CTheory&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists have argued that relationships conducted through digital media are inextricably part of the 'real world'.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N. (2012) [http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/83 "When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution"]. ''Future Internet'', 4, 83-91&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'augmented reality' has been used as an alternative, to denote the concept of reality as being altered in some way by the use of digital media but not replaced.

The use of social media for [[social activism]] have also provided a focus for digital sociology. For example, numerous sociological articles,&lt;ref&gt;Maireder, A. and Schwartzenegger, C. (2011) A movement of connected individuals: social media in the Austrian student protests 2009. ''Information, Communication &amp; Society'', 15(2), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, M. (2012) [http://cspo.org/legacy/library/1207150932F24192826YK_lib_LimJoC2012Egypt.pdf "Clicks, cabs, and coffee houses: social media and oppositional movements in Egypt"], 2004-2011. ''Journal of Communication'', 62(2), 231-248.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one book&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, D. (2013) ''Twitter: Social Communication in the Twitter Age''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared on the use of such social media platforms as Twitter, [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] as a means of conveying messages about activist causes and organizing political movements.&lt;!-- [[Social movement theory]] / Digital social movement theory --&gt;

Research has also been done on how racial minorities and the use of technology by racial minorities and other groups.  These "'''digital practice'''" studies explore the ways in which the practices that groups adopt when using new technologies mitigate or reproduce social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2014) ''The Digital Practices of African Americans: An Approach to Studying Cultural Change in the Information Society''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2016) "The Content of Our #Characters: Black Twitter as Counterpublic". ''Sociology of Race and Ethnicity'', 2(4) 433 – 449&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital data analysis ===
Digital sociologists use varied approaches to investigating people's use of digital media, both qualitative and quantitative. These include [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]], interviews and surveys with users of technologies, and also the analysis of the data produced from people's interactions with technologies: for example, their posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, [[Reddit]], [[4chan]], [[Tumblr]] and Twitter or their consuming habits on online shopping platforms. Such techniques as [[data scraping]], [[social network analysis]], [[time series analysis]] and [[textual analysis]] are employed to analyse both the data produced as a byproduct of users' interactions with digital media and those that they create themselves. 
For Contents Analysis, in 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries." The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl’s imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.

The emergence of social media has provided sociologists with a new way of studying social phenomenon. Social media networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], are increasingly being mined for research. For example, Twitter data is easily available to researchers through the Twitter API. Twitter provides researchers with demographic data, time and location data, and connections between users. From these data, researchers gain insight into user moods and how they communicate with one another. Furthermore, social networks can be graphed and visualized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murthy|first=Dhiraj|last2=Bowman|first2=Sawyer A|date=2014-11-25|title=Big Data solutions on a small scale: Evaluating accessible high-performance computing for social research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951714559105|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|doi=10.1177/2053951714559105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using large data sets, like those obtained from Twitter, can be challenging. First of all, researchers have to figure out how to store this data effectively in a database. Several tools commonly used in [[Big data|Big Data]] analytics are at their disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since large data sets can be unwieldy and contain numerous types of data (i.e. photos, videos, GIF images), researchers have the option of storing their data in non-relational databases, such as [[MongoDB]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Processing and querying this data is an additional challenge. However, there are several options available to researchers. One common option is to use a querying language, such as [[Apache Hive|Hive]], in conjunction with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] to analyze large data sets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The internet and social media have allowed sociologists to study how controversial topics are discussed over time—otherwise known as Issue Mapping.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marres|first=Noortje|last2=Gerlitz|first2=Carolin|date=2015-08-14|title=Interface Methods: Renegotiating Relations between Digital Social Research, STS and Sociology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12314|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=64|issue=1|pages=21–46|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists can search social networking sites (i.e. Facebook or Twitter) for posts related to a hotly-debated topic, then parse through and analyze the text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sociologists can then use a number of easily accessible tools to visualize this data, such as MentionMapp or Twitter Streamgraph. MentionMapp shows how popular a hashtag is and Twitter Streamgraph depicts how often certain words are paired together and how their relationship changes over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Critical digital sociology ===
This aspect of digital sociology is perhaps what makes it distinctive from other approaches to studying the digital world. In adopting a critical reflexive approach, sociologists are able to address the implications of the digital for sociological practice itself. It has been argued that digital sociology offers a way of addressing the changing relations between social relations and the analysis of these relations, putting into question what social research is, and indeed, what sociology is now as social relations and society have become in many respects mediated via digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Marres. N. (2013) [http://www.csisponline.net/2013/01/21/what-is-digital-sociology "What is digital sociology?"] CSISP Online&lt;/ref&gt;

How should sociology respond to the emergent forms of both 'small data' and 'big data' that are collected in vast amounts as part of people's interactions with digital technologies and the development of data industries using these data to conduct their own social research? Does this suggest that a "coming crisis in empirical sociology" might be on the horizon?&lt;ref&gt;Savage, M. and Burrows, R. (2007) [https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/coming-crisis-empirical-sociology.pdf "The coming crisis of empirical sociology"]. ''Sociology'', 41(5),885-889&lt;/ref&gt; How are the identities and work practices of sociologists themselves becoming implicated within and disciplined by digital technologies such as [[Citation impact|citation metrics]]?&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, R. (2012) Living with the h-index? Metric assemblages in the contemporary academy. ''The Sociological Review'', 60(2), 355—72.&lt;/ref&gt;

These questions are central to critical digital sociology, which reflects upon the role of sociology itself in the analysis of digital technologies as well as the impact of digital technologies upon sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/category/digital-sociology/page/2/ "Digital sociology part 3: digital research"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public digital sociology ===
{{main|Public sociology}}
Public sociology using digital media is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces. This has been referred to as "e-public sociology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher J. Schneider]] (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and Christopher J. Schneider, editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has changed the ways the public sociology was perceived and given rise to digital evolution in this field. The vast open platform of communication has provided opportunities for sociologists to come out from the notion of small group sociology or publics to a vast audience.

Blogging was the initial social media platform being utilized by sociologists. Sociologists like Eszter Hargittai, Chris Bertram, and Kieran Healy were few amongst those who started using blogging for sociology. New discussion groups about sociology and related philosophy were the consequences of social media impact. The vast number of comments and discussions thus became a part of understanding sociology. One of such famous groups was [http://crookedtimber.org/ Crooked Timber]. Getting feedback on such social sites is faster and impactful. Disintermediation, visibility, and measurement are the major effects of e-public sociology. Other social media tools like Twitter and Facebook also became the tools for a sociologist. [https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/soc-social-media.pdf "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media"].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Kieran. "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media." Berkeley Sociology Journal (2015): 1-16. APA&lt;/ref&gt;

{{outline|Outline of academic disciplines}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2017}}
An '''academic discipline''' or '''academic field''' is a [[Branch (academia)|branch]] of [[knowledge]]. It incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with a given scholastic subject area or college department. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines, e.g. [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[biology]].

Individuals associated with academic disciplines are commonly referred to as ''[[expert]]s'' or ''specialists''. Others, who may have studied [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]] or [[systems theory]] rather than concentrating in a specific academic discipline, are classified as ''generalists''.

While academic disciplines in and of themselves are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinarity]], [[interdisciplinarity]], [[transdisciplinarity]], and [[cross-disciplinarity]] integrate aspects from multiple academic disciplines, therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. For example, professionals may encounter trouble communicating across academic disciplines because of differences in language or specified concepts.

Some researchers believe that academic disciplines may be replaced by what is known as [[Mode 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott, &amp; Martin Trow (1994). ''The New Production of Knowledge: The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies''. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; or "post-academic science",&lt;ref&gt;Ziman, John (2000). ''Real Science: What It Is, and What It Means''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which involves the acquisition of cross-disciplinary knowledge through collaboration of specialists from various academic disciplines.

==History of the concept==
The [[University of Paris]] in 1231 consisted of four [[Faculty (division)|faculties]]: [[Theology]], [[Medicine]], [[Canon Law]] and [[Liberal Arts|Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Education'', Encyclopædia Britannica (1977, 15th edition), Macropaedia Volume 6, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions originally used the term "discipline" to catalog and archive the new and expanding body of information produced by the scholarly community. Disciplinary designations originated in German Universities during the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Most academic disciplines have their roots in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century [[secularization]] of universities, when the traditional [[curriculum|curricula]] were supplemented with non-classical languages and [[literatures]], [[social sciences]] such as [[political science]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[public administration]], and [[natural science]] and [[technology]] disciplines such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[engineering]].

In the early twentieth century, new academic disciplines such as [[education]] and [[psychology]] were added. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an explosion of new academic disciplines focusing on specific themes, such as [[media studies]], [[women's studies]], and [[Africana studies]]. Many academic disciplines designed as preparation for careers and professions, such as [[nursing]], [[Hospitality management studies|hospitality management]], and [[corrections]], also emerged in the universities. Finally, interdisciplinary scientific fields of study such as [[biochemistry]] and [[geophysics]] gained prominence as their contribution to knowledge became widely recognized.

As the twentieth century approached, these designations were gradually adopted by other countries and became the accepted conventional subjects. However, these designations differed between various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jacques Revel |authorlink1=History and the Social Sciences |editor1-last=Porter |editor1-first=Theodore |editor2-last=Ross |editor2-first=Dorothy |title=Cambridge History of Science: The Modern Social Sciences |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521594421 |pages=391–404 |chapter=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, the natural science disciplines included: [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[astronomy]]. The social science disciplines included: [[economics]], [[politics]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

Prior to the twentieth century, categories were broad and general, which was expected due to the lack of interest in science at the time. With rare exceptions, practitioners of science tended to be amateurs and were referred to as "natural historians" and "natural philosophers"—labels that date back to Aristotle—instead of "scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How The Word 'Scientist' Came To Be |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417 |website=npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history referred to what we now call life sciences and natural philosophy referred to the current physical sciences.

Few opportunities existed for science as an occupation outside the educational system. Higher education provided the institutional structure for scientific investigation, as well as economic support. Soon, the volume of scientific information rapidly increased and people realized the importance of concentrating on smaller fields of scientific activity. Because of this, scientific specializations emerged. As these specializations developed, modern scientific disciplines in universities also improved. Eventually, academia's identified disciplines became the foundations for people of specific specialized interests and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=E |last2=Lloyd |first2=S |title=Disciplinary Evolution and the Rise of Transdiscipline |url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol17/ISJv17p189-215Cohen0702.pdf |publisher=Informing Science: the International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and criticism==
A very influential critique of the concept of academic disciplines came from [[Michel Foucault]] in his 1975 book, ''Discipline and Punish''. Foucault asserts that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth-century [[France]], and that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common: "The disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate." (Foucault, 1975/1979, p 223.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1977). Discipline and Punish: The birth of the prison. Trans. Alan Sheridan. New York: Vintage.(Translation of: Surveiller et punir; naissance de la prison. [Paris] : Gallimard, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Communities of academic disciplines==
'''Communities of academic disciplines''' can be found outside academia within corporations, government agencies, and independent organizations, where they take the form of associations of professionals with common interests and specific knowledge. Such communities include corporate [[think tanks]], [[NASA]], and [[IUPAC]]. Communities such as these exist to benefit the organizations affiliated with them by providing specialized new ideas, research, and findings.

Nations at various developmental stages will find need for different academic disciplines during different times of growth. A newly developing nation will likely prioritize government and political matters over those of the arts and sciences. On the other hand, a well-developed nation may be capable of investing more into the arts and sciences. Communities of academic disciplines would contribute at varying levels of importance during different stages of development.

==Interactions==
These categories explain how the different academic disciplines interact with one another.

===Multidisciplinary===
{{main|Multidisciplinary approach}}
'''Multidisciplinary''' knowledge is associated with more than one existing academic discipline or profession.

A multidisciplinary community or project is made up of people from different academic disciplines and professions. These people are engaged in working together as equal stakeholders in addressing a common challenge. A multidisciplinary person is one with degrees from two or more academic disciplines. This one person can take the place of two or more people in a multidisciplinary community. Over time, multidisciplinary work does not typically lead to an increase or a decrease in the number of academic disciplines. One key question is how well the challenge can be decomposed into subparts, and then addressed via the distributed knowledge in the community. The lack of shared vocabulary between people and communication overhead can sometimes be an issue in these communities and projects. If challenges of a particular type need to be repeatedly addressed so that each one can be properly decomposed, a multidisciplinary community can be exceptionally efficient and effective.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

There are many examples of a particular idea appearing in different academic disciplines, all of which came about around the same time. One example of this scenario is the shift from the approach of focusing on sensory awareness of the whole, "an attention to the 'total field{{'"}}, a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in art (in the form of cubism), physics, poetry, communication and educational theory. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this paradigm shift was due to the passage from the era of mechanization, which brought sequentiality, to the era of the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=McLuhan: Understanding Media |authorlink=Marshall McLuhan |year=1964 |work=[[Understanding Media]] |page=13 |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208070250/http://georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary approaches also encourage people to help shape the innovation of the future. The political dimensions of forming new multidisciplinary partnerships to solve the so-called societal Grand Challenges were presented in the Innovation Union and in the European Framework Programme, the [[Horizon 2020]] operational overlay. Innovation across academic disciplines is considered the pivotal foresight of the creation of new products, systems, and processes for the benefit of all societies' growth and wellbeing. Regional examples such as Biopeople and industry-academia initiatives in translational medicine such as SHARE.ku.dk in Denmark provides the evidence of the successful endeavour of multidisciplinary innovation and facilitation of the paradigm shift.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Interdisciplinary===
{{main|Interdisciplinarity}}
"Interdisciplinary activity on a campus is a day-to-day mode of research (or study) where, in order to do the best work, each researcher's work demands the use of ideas, concepts, materials or instruments from one or more other disciplines. Such research is usually directed to a specified goal or mission."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) "Interdisciplinary science on campus", pp. 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[The Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcedisciplinary===
{{main|Transdisciplinarity}}
In practice, '''transcedisciplinary''' can be thought of as the union of all interdisciplinary efforts. While interdisciplinary teams may be creating new knowledge that lies between several existing disciplines, a transcedisciplinary team is more holistic and seeks to relate all disciplines into a coherent whole.

===Cross-disciplinary===
'''Cross-disciplinary''' knowledge is that which explains aspects of one discipline in terms of another. Common examples of cross-disciplinary approaches are studies of the [[physics]] of [[music]] or the [[politics]] of [[literature]].

==Bibliometric studies of disciplines==
[[Bibliometrics]] can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines, for example the flow of ideas within and among disciplines (Lindholm-Romantschuk, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y. (1998). Scholarly book reviewing in the social sciences and humanities. The flow of ideas within and among disciplines. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or the existence of specific national traditions within disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, H. (1999). Is there a Scandinavian psychology? A bibliometric note on the publication profiles of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]], 40, 235–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly impact and influence of one discipline on another may be understood by analyzing the flow of citations.&lt;ref&gt;Serenko, A. &amp; Bontis, N. (2013). [http://aserenko.com/papers/Serenko_Bontis_2013_JKM_KM_Core.pdf The intellectual core and impact of the knowledge management academic discipline.] Journal of Knowledge Management, 17(1), 137–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bibliometrics approach is described as straightforward because it is based on simple counting. The method is also objective but the quantitative method may not be compatible with a qualitative assessment and therefore manipulated. The number of citations is dependent on the number of persons working in the same domain instead of inherent quality or published result’s originality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidelines.kaowarsom.be/bibliometrics|title=Bibliometrics {{!}} The Guidelines project|website=www.guidelines.kaowarsom.be|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

"'''Do it yourself'''" ("'''DIY'''") is the method of building, modifying, or [[repair]]ing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research describes DIY as behaviors where "individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf &amp; McQuitty (2011). Understanding the Do-It-Yourself Consumer: DIY Motivation and Outcomes. ''Academy of Marketing Science Review''&lt;/ref&gt; DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as [[market economy|marketplace]] motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and [[identity (social science)|identity]] enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).&lt;ref&gt;Wolf &amp; McQuitty (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "do-it-yourself" has been associated with consumers since at least 1912 primarily in the domain of home improvement and maintenance activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber (1997). Do-It-Yourself: Construction, Repairing and Maintaining Domestic Masculinity. ''American Quarterly''. doi:[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/american_quarterly/v049/49.1gelber.html 10.1353/aq.1997.0007]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "do it yourself" had come into common usage (in standard English) by the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Constructing Contemporary: Common sense approaches to 'going modern in the 1950s"&gt;{{cite book|editors=McKellar, S.; Sparke, P. |title=Interior Design and Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the emergence of a trend of people undertaking [[home improvement]] and various other [http://cradiori.com/guide-to-paper-quilling-everything-you-need-to-know-get-started/ small craft] and construction projects as both a creative-recreational and cost-saving activity.

Subsequently, the term DIY has taken on a broader meaning that covers a wide range of skill sets. DIY is associated with the international [[alternative rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[indie rock]] music scenes; [[indymedia]] networks, [[pirate radio]] stations, and the [[zine]] community. In this context, DIY is related to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in that it offers an alternative to modern [[consumer culture]]'s emphasis on relying on others to satisfy needs. It has also become prevalent in the personal finance. When investing in the stock one can utilize a professional advisor or partake in [[do-it-yourself investing]].

==History==
Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an "ancient [[IKEA]] building". The structure was a [[Greek temple|temple-like]] building discovered at [[Tito, Basilicata|Torre Satriano]], near the southern city of [[Potenza]], in [[Basilicata]], a region where local people mingled with [[Greeks]] who settled along the southern coast known as [[Magna Graecia]] and in [[Sicily]] from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the [[British School at Rome]], said that the discovery was "the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the [[Sparta]]n colony of [[Taranto]] in [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter of the Hellenic Society of Archaeometry, N.110, May 2010, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-came-with-diy-instructions.html Ancient Building Came With DIY Instructions], Discovery News, Mon Apr 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/ancient-building-greek-temple-do-it-yourself-photos.html Ancient Building Comes with Assembly Instructions, (photos)], Discovery News&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, there was a DIY magazine publishing niche in the first half of the twentieth century. Magazines such as ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' (founded in 1902) and ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]'' (founded in 1928) offered a way for readers to keep current on useful practical skills, techniques, tools, and materials. As many readers lived in rural or semi-rural regions, initially much of the material related to their needs on the farm or in a small town.

[[File:Movable shelves built on discarded toy vehicle.jpg|thumb|150px|Shelves attached to a toy vehicle]]
The DIY movement is a re-introduction (often to urban and suburban dwellers) of the old pattern of personal involvement and use of skills in the upkeep of a house or apartment, making clothes; maintenance of cars, computers, websites; or any material aspect of living. The philosopher [[Alan Watts]] (from the "[[Houseboat Summit]]" panel discussion in a 1967 edition of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'') reflected a growing sentiment:

{{Quotation|Our educational system, in its entirety, does nothing to give us any kind of material competence. In other words, we don't learn how to cook, how to make clothes, how to build houses, how to make love, or to do any of the absolutely fundamental things of life. The whole education that we get for our children in school is entirely in terms of abstractions. It trains you to be an insurance salesman or a bureaucrat, or some kind of cerebral character.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan et al. "Houseboat Summit" in ''The San Francisco Oracle'', issue #7.  San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1970s, DIY spread through the North American population of college- and recent-college-graduate age groups. In part, this movement involved the renovation of affordable, rundown older homes. But it also related to various projects expressing the social and environmental vision of the 1960s and early 1970s. The young visionary [[Stewart Brand]], working with friends and family, and initially using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, published the first edition of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' (subtitled ''Access to Tools'') in late 1968.

[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|thumb|left|Fiberglass dome house, California, in style of the Whole Earth Catalog building techniques]]

The first ''Catalog'', and its successors, used a broad definition of the term "tools". There were informational tools, such as books (often technical in nature), professional journals, courses, classes, and the like. There were specialized, designed items, such as [[carpenters]]' and [[Stonemasonry|masons]]' tools, [[garden tools]], [[welding]] equipment, [[chainsaws]], fiberglass materials and so on; even early personal computers. The designer [[J. Baldwin]] acted as editor to include such items, writing many of the reviews. The ''Catalog'''s publication both emerged from and spurred the great wave of experimentalism, convention-breaking, and do-it-yourself attitude of the late 1960s. Often copied, the ''Catalog'' appealed to a wide cross-section of people in North America and had a broad influence.

DIY home improvement books burgeoned in the 1970s, first created as collections of magazine articles. An early, extensive line of DIY how-to books was created by [[Sunset Books]], based upon previously published articles from their magazine, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'', based in California. [[Time-Life]], [[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]], [http://balconygardenweb.com/ Balcony Garden Web] and other publishers soon followed suit.

[[File:Electronics World Sep 1959.jpg|thumb|150px|''Electronics World'' 1959, home assembled amplifier]]
In the mid-1990s, DIY [[home-improvement]] content began to find its way onto the [[World Wide Web]]. HouseNet was the earliest bulletin-board style site where users could share information. HomeTips.com, established in early 1995, was among the first Web-based sites to deliver free extensive DIY home-improvement content created by expert authors.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Since the late 1990s, DIY has exploded on the Web through thousands of sites.

In the 1970s, when home video ([[VCR]]s) came along, DIY instructors quickly grasped its potential for demonstrating processes by audio-visual means.  In 1979, the [[PBS]] television series ''[[This Old House]]'', starring [[Bob Vila]], premiered and this spurred a DIY television revolution. The show was immensely popular, educating people on how to improve their living conditions (and the value of their house) without the expense of paying someone else to do (as much of) the work. In 1994, the [[HGTV]] Network cable television channel was launched in the United States and Canada, followed in 1999 by the [[DIY Network]] cable television channel. Both were launched to appeal to the growing percentage of North Americans interested in DIY topics, from [[home renovation|home improvement]] to [[knitting]]. Such channels have multiple shows showing how to stretch one's budget to achieve professional-looking results (''[[Design Cents]]'', ''[[Design on a Dime]]'', etc.) while doing the work yourself. ''[[Toolbelt Diva]]'' specifically caters to female DIYers.

Beyond magazines and television, the scope of home improvement DIY continues to grow online where most mainstream media outlets now have extensive DIY-focused informational websites such as ''[[This Old House]]'', [[Martha Stewart]], [[Hometalk]], and the [[DIY Network]]. These are often extensions of their magazine or television brand. The growth of independent online DIY resources is also spiking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119074337787638918 ''Wall Street Journal'', September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of homeowners who [[blog]] about their experiences continues to grow, along with DIY websites from smaller organizations.

==Fashion==
[[File:Mennonite Women Dressmaking Pennsylvania 1942.jpg|thumb|180px|Mennonite farmer's wife [[dressmaking]] (1942)]]
DIY amongst the [[fashion]] community is popular, with ideas being shared on social media such as [[YouTube]] about clothing, jewellery, makeup and hair styles. Techniques include [[distressing]] jeans, bleaching jeans, redesigning an old shirt, and studding [[denim]]. This trend is becoming popular.

== Subculture ==
{{main|DIY ethic|Maker culture}}

The terms "DIY" and "do-it-yourself" are also used to describe:
[[File:Zines-fromlondonsymp07.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Zine]]s, London]]
* [[Self-publishing]] books, [[zines]], and [[alternative comics]]

DIY as a subculture could be said to have begun with the [[punk movement]] of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote = "Yet, it remains within the subculture of punk music where the homemade, A4, stapled and photocopied fanzines of the late 1970s fostered the "do-it-yourself" (DIY) production techniques of cut-n-paste letterforms, photocopied and collaged images, hand-scrawled and typewritten texts, to create a recognizable graphic design aesthetic."|url = http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/1/69|title = Triggs, Teal (2006) Scissors and Glue: Punk Fanzines and the Creation of a DIY Aesthetic, in "Journal of Design History", vo. 19, n. 1, pp. 69-83.|accessdate = 2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional means of bands reaching their audiences through large music labels, bands began recording, manufacturing albums and merchandise, booking their own tours, and creating opportunities for smaller bands to get wider recognition and gain cult status through repetitive low-cost DIY touring. The burgeoning [[zine]] movement took up coverage of and promotion of the [[Underground music|underground]] punk scenes, and significantly altered the way fans interacted with musicians. Zines quickly branched off from being hand-made music magazines to become more personal; they quickly became one of the youth culture's gateways to [[DIY culture]]. This led to tutorial zines showing others how to make their own shirts, posters, zines, books, food, etc.

A '''drainage basin''' is any area of land where [[precipitation]] collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a [[river]], [[bay]], or other [[body of water]]. The drainage basin includes all the [[surface water]] from [[surface runoff|rain runoff]], [[snowmelt]], and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet, as well as the [[groundwater]] underneath the earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html |title=drainage basin |work=The Physical Environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321033433/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html|archivedate=March 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a [[Strahler number|hierarchical pattern]], with smaller '''sub-drainage basins''', which in turn drain into another common outlet.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web |author= |year= |url=http://www.wr.udel.edu/cb/whatwhycare.html |title=What is a watershed and why should I care? |publisher=university of delaware |accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used interchangeably with ''drainage basin'' are '''catchment area''', '''catchment basin''', '''drainage area''', '''river basin''', and '''water basin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|authorlink=|title=The Field Guide to Geology|publisher=Checkmark Books|series=|year=1998| pages=130–13|doi=|isbn=0-8160-3823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the term '''''watershed''''' is commonly used to mean a drainage basin, though in other English-speaking countries, it is used only in its original sense, that of a [[drainage divide]].

In a closed drainage basin, or [[endorheic basin]], the water converges to a single point inside the basin, known as a [[sink (geography)|sink]], which may be a permanent lake, a [[dry lake]], or a point where surface water is [[Losing stream|lost underground]].&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |title= Hydrologic Unit Geography |publisher= Virginia Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation |accessdate= 21 November 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20121214100316/http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |archivedate= 14 December 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drainage basin acts as a [[funnel]] by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the [[drainage divide]], making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a [[ridge]], [[hill]] or [[mountain]]s) forming a barrier.

Drainage basins are similar but not identical to [[Hydrological code|hydrologic units]], which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;

[[File:Ocean drainage.png|frameless|center|upright=3.1|Major [[continental divide]]s, showing drainage into the major oceans and seas of the world.]]
&lt;center&gt;Drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world. Grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the oceans.&lt;/center&gt;

=== Ocean basins ===
The following is a list of the major ocean basins:
* About 48.7% of the world's land drains to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} In [[North America]], surface water drains to the Atlantic via the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and [[Great Lakes]] basins, the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] of the United States, the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], and most of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Nearly all of [[South America]] east of the [[Andes]] also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and the greatest portion of western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as [[Western Sahara]] and part of [[Morocco]]. The two major [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean seas]] of the world also flow to the Atlantic:
** The [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], a small part of the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], eastern [[Central America]], the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America.
** The [[Mediterranean Sea]] basin includes much of [[North Africa]], east-central [[Africa]] (through the [[Nile River]]), [[Southern Europe|Southern]], Central, and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Turkey]], and the coastal areas of [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].
* The [[Arctic Ocean]] drains most of [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Northern Canada]] east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], northern [[Alaska]] and parts of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Montana]] in the United States, the north shore of the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Asia]], which totals to about 17% of the world's land.&lt;!-- Roughly (+/-0,7% error), computed. --~~~~ --&gt; 
* Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the [[Korean Peninsula]], most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the [[Pacific Islands]], the northeast coast of [[Australia]], and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.
* The [[Indian Ocean]]'s drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth's land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], Burma, and most of Australia.
* The [[Southern Ocean]] drains [[Antarctica]]. Antarctica comprises approximately eight percent of the Earth's land.

=== Largest river basins ===

The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are the basins of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (7M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Congo River|Congo]] (4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Nile River|Nile]] (3.4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Río de la Plata]] (3.2M km{{sup|2}}), and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (3M km{{sup|2}}). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, [[Ganga River|Ganga]], and Congo rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Encyclopedia articles on [[Amazon River]], [[Congo River]], and [[Ganges]] Published by Microsoft in computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorheic drainage basins ===
[[File:Uureg Nuur.jpg|thumb|[[Endorheic basin]] in [[Central Asia]]]]
{{Main article|Endorheic basin}}
[[Endorheic basin|Endorheic drainage basins]] are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Around 18% of all land drains to endorheic lakes or seas or sinks. The largest of these consists of much of the interior of [[Asia]], which drains into the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Aral Sea]], and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the [[Great Basin]] in the United States, much of the [[Sahara Desert]], the drainage basin of the [[Okavango River]] ([[Kalahari Basin]]), highlands near the [[African Great Lakes]], the interiors of [[Australia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and parts in [[Mexico]] and the [[Andes]]. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of separate, adjacent closed basins.

In endorheic [[Bodies of water|bodies of standing water]] where evaporation is the primary means of water loss, the water is typically more saline than the oceans. An extreme example of this is the [[Dead Sea]].

== Importance of drainage basins ==

=== Geopolitical boundaries ===
Drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important. For example, the [[England|English]] crown gave the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in the entire [[Hudson Bay]] basin, an area called [[Rupert's Land]]. [[bioregionalism|Bioregional]] political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g., international [[treaty|treaties]] and, within the U.S.A., [[interstate compact]]s) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains. Examples of such interstate compacts are the [[Great Lakes Commission]] and the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Ohiorivermap.png|thumb|right|Drainage basin of the [[Ohio River]], part of the [[Mississippi River]] drainage basin]]

In [[hydrology]], the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the [[hydrological cycle]], because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falling on the basin. A portion of the water that enters the [[groundwater]] system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network. Measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a [[stream gauge]] located at the basin's outlet.

Rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin, and there are different ways to interpret that data. If the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation, using the [[arithmetic mean]] method will give good results. In the [[Thiessen polygon]] method, the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon. These polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges, then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons. The [[isohyet]]al method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map. Calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time consuming.

[[Isochrone map]]s can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.&lt;ref name="hydrolearthsystsci bell 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf | title=A grid-based distributed flood forecasting model for use with weather radar data: Part 1.

=== Geomorphology ===
Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]]. A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]

Drainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.

Modern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.

=== Resource management ===
{{further information|Watershed management}}
Because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called "[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as "[[watershed management]]".
In [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n° 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.

When a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.

Management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment factors ==
The catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].

Catchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.

=== Topography ===
Generally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., &gt; 1% gradient).

=== Shape ===
Shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.

=== Size ===
Size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.

=== Soil type ===
Soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.

=== Land use ===
Land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].

'''Fredson Thayer Bowers''' (April 25, 1905 – April 11, 1991) was an American [[Bibliography|bibliographer]] and scholar of [[Textual criticism|textual editing]].

==Life==
Bowers was a graduate of [[Brown University]] and [[Harvard University]] (Ph.D.). He taught at [[Princeton University]] before moving to the [[University of Virginia]] in 1938.

Bowers served as a [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|commander]] in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II leading a group of [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]].

In 1947 he led a group of faculty and interested local citizens in founding the [[Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia]], of which he served as president for many years. He founded its annual publication, ''[[Studies in Bibliography]]'', which became a leading journal in the field.

Bowers was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1958. 
In 1969 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Bibliographical Society]] (of London).

He retired in 1975 and at the time of his death, he was Linden Kent Professor of English Emeritus at the University of Virginia.  His second wife, novelist [[Nancy Hale]], died before him in 1988.  Bowers had three sons and a daughter with his first wife: Fredson Bowers, Jr., Stephen, Peter, and Joan.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/obituaries/fredson-bowers-85-a-specialist-in-bibliography-and-manuscripts.html |title=Fredson Bowers, 85, a specialist in bibliography and manuscripts |first=Glenn |last=Fowler |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=April 13, 1991 |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The charity was formed in 1957 by [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a writer, former [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and a [[high church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]],&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey (2004) '[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51524 Thomas, Ivor Bulmer (1905–1993)]', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Retrieved on 7&amp;nbsp;August 2010. {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became its first chairman; its executive committee included prominent politicians and architects.  Initially the charity campaigned and obtained grants for the repair and restoration of churches within its remit.  The 1968 Pastoral Measure established the Redundant Churches Fund (now called the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which it was thought would obviate the need for the Friends. However, the [[Church Commissioners]] turned down a number of buildings that the executive committee considered worthy of preservation, including [[Old St Matthew's Church, Lightcliffe]], and [[St Peter's Church, Wickham Bishops]]. The charity therefore decided in 1972 to change its constitution, allowing it to acquire threatened buildings either by [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] or by [[Leasehold estate|lease]].  The tower of the church at Lightcliffe was the first property to be vested with the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/early-history-of-the-friends/ |title=Early History of the Friends |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The charity raises money from a number of sources.  Since 1999, it has been recognised in Wales as the equivalent of the Churches Conservation Trust (which only covers churches in England), and as a consequence receives full funding for taking [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches into its care.  Of this, 70% comes from the State via [[Cadw]], and 30% from the [[Church in Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/special-role-in-wales/ |title=The Friends in Wales |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, grants are sometimes obtained from bodies such as [[English Heritage]], as in the case of [[St Mary's Church, Mundon]],&lt;ref name=mundon&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/mundon/ |title=Mundon St Mary |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise funds are raised by donations and local money-raising campaigns.  Some of the churches have been supported by the formation of local groups of Friends, such as Caldecote Church Friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.caldecotechurchfriends.org.uk/ |title=Caldecote Church Friends |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=Caldecote Church Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton.&lt;ref name=fww&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.woodwalton.org.uk/ |title=St Andrew's Church, Wood Walton |accessdate=25 July 2010 |publisher=The Friends of St Andrew's, Wood Walton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can make donations, become a member of the charity, or leave a legacy in their wills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/join-us/ |title=Join Us |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the charity administers two trusts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/about-us/church-trust-funds/ |title=Church Trust Funds |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which, the Cottam Will Trust, was established by [[S. E. Cottam|Rev&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Cottam]] for "the advancement of religion of objects of beauty to be placed in ancient [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches either in England or Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/funding-for-art/ |title=Funding For Art In Churches |accessdate=12 November 2016 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the churches owned by the charity are [[listed building]]s, and most are former [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, either from the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church in Wales]], although three were private chapels, one, the [[Strict and Particular Baptist Chapel, Waddesdon]], was a [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] chapel,&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; and another, [[St Mary of the Angels Church, Brownshill]], was a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church.&lt;ref name=ffc/&gt; In the financial year ending 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010, the income of the charity was £475,367, and its expenditure was £509,034.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The charity works closely with the [[Ancient Monuments Society]].&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;  {{As of|2016}} its patronage is vacant, following the death of the [[George Paget, 7th Marquess of Anglesey|Marquess of Anglesey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |title=Officers and Executive Committee |accessdate=16 July 2013 |publisher=Friends of Friendless Churches |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517011452/http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=executive-committee |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013.

==List of vested churches==
The list is split into two sections, one for England and the other for Wales.  This division reflects the former management of the English churches (with one exception) by the Church of England, the Welsh churches by the Church in Wales, and the different funding arrangements in the two countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">'''Gradualism''', from the Latin ''gradus'' ("step"), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGowran. (2008). ''Biostratigraphy: Microfossils and Geological Time''. Cambridge University Press. p. 384. {{ISBN|978-0521048170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uniformitarianism]], [[incrementalism]], and [[reformism]] are similar concepts.

==Geology and biology==
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

In the natural sciences, gradualism is the [[theory]] which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with [[catastrophism]].  The theory was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]], a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].  Tenets from both theories were applied to [[biology]] and formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory.

[[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see [[catastrophism]]), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in [[Saltation (biology)|saltations]], since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.

Gradualism is often confused with the concept of [[phyletic gradualism]]. It is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to contrast with their model of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.&lt;ref name=punc1972&gt;Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phyletic gradualism ===
{{main|Phyletic gradualism}}
[[Phyletic gradualism]] is a model of [[evolution]] which theorizes that most [[speciation]] is slow, uniform and gradual.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole [[species]] into a new one (through a process called [[anagenesis]]). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless [[cladogenesis|splitting]] occurs.

=== Punctuated gradualism ===
{{main|Punctuated gradualism}}
[[Punctuated gradualism]] is a [[microevolution]]ary [[hypothesis]] that refers to a species that has "relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching". It is one of the three common models of [[evolution]]. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]] claims that major evolutionary changes don't happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation.  Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the [[phyletic gradualism]] model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.

== Politics and society ==
{{Social democracy sidebar |Development}}

In [[politics]], gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | work= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machiavellian]] politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.

In [[socialism|socialist politics]] and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the [[libertarian socialist]] concept of [[dual power]] and is seen as a middle way between reformism and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionism]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

{{quote|This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.|Martin Luther King Jr.'s ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, delivered August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Martin Luther|authorlink1=Martin Luther King|title=I have a dream speech|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1951-/martin-luther-kings-i-have-a-dream-speech-august-28-1963.php|accessdate=1 November 2015|date=August 28, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Linguistics and language change ==
In [[linguistics]], [[language change]] is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to [[Drift (linguistics)#Long-term cyclic drift|cyclic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann]] (1983). "Les réactions en chaîne en morphologie diachronique."  ''Actes du Colloque de la Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle'' 10.285-92.[http://www.nou-la.org/1983c-morphodia.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that [[creole language]]s are the product of [[catastrophism]] is heavily disputed.

==Morality==
===Christianity===
{{main|Law of graduality}}

Gradualism has also been used in a religious sense, especially in the [[Catholic Church]] (specifically, in [[Catholic ethics|ethics]] and [[Catholic moral theology|moral theology]]), to describe the view that certain individuals and families that make up a parish or community may be living at various points along a line extending from being in a state of [[mortal sin]], to being at least minimally in the "[[State (theology)|state]] of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]" and able to receive the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], and to a level of greater [[Universal call to holiness|holiness]]. This view teaches that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as [[Agape|sacrificial love]] and consistent respect. It holds that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations. Catholic clergy who espouse this view include the Bishop of [[San Diego, California]], [[Robert W. McElroy]], who in 2016 wrote: {{quote|The principle of gradualness reaches far beyond the question of marriage to embrace all elements of the Christian moral life, for it really is an embodiment of the pastoral method of the Lord himself. Pope Francis repeatedly cites the example of Jesus’ conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well as a prism through which to construct the Church’s outreach to young couples, a prism which embraces them in their humanity and their love, rather than categorizing them as living in sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/05/11/san-diego-bishop-backs-pope-on-divorced-and-remarried/|title=San Diego bishop backs pope on divorced and remarried|work=Crux|date=May 11, 2016|author=Michael O'Loughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies===
{{main|Subitism}}
&lt;!--"Five precepts" links here.--&gt; 
Gradualism is the approach of certain schools of Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies (e.g. [[Theravada]] or [[Yoga]]), that [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] can be achieved step by step, through an arduous practice. The opposite approach, that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once, is called [[subitism]]. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of [[Zen]], which rejected gradualism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Debate of Samye]]. It was continued in other schools of [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Gregory | first =Peter N. (editor) | year =1991 | title =''Sudden and Gradual. Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'' | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==
[[Lorenzo Peña#Contradictorial gradualism|Contradictorial gradualism]] is the paraconsistent treatment of [[Fuzzy logic|fuzziness]] developed by [[Lorenzo Peña]] which regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence.

Gradualism in [[social change]] implemented through [[reformist]] means is a moral principle to which the [[Fabian Society]] is committed. In a more general way, [[reformism]] is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a [[society]]'s fundamental [[economic system]] and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day [[capitalism]]. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that [[revolution]] is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.

In the terminology of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Gradualism|NWO]]-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]].

'''IDEF4''', or ''Integrated DEFinition for  Object-Oriented Design'', is an [[object-oriented design]] [[modeling language]] for the design of component-based client/server systems. It has been designed to support smooth transition from the application domain and requirements analysis models to the design and to actual source code generation. It specifies design objects with sufficient detail to enable source code generation.&lt;ref name="May95"&gt;[[Richard J. Mayer]] et al. (1995). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef4.pdf '' IDEF4 Object-Oriented Design Method Report ''] Version 2.0. Jan 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

This method is part of the [[IDEF]] family of [[modeling language]]s in the field of [[systems engineering|systems]] and [[software engineering]].

== Overview ==
IDEF4 method is a graphically oriented methodology for the design of object-oriented software systems. The object-oriented programming paradigm provides the developer with an abstract view of his program as composed of a set of state maintaining objects which define the behavior of the program by the protocol of their interactions. An object consists of a set of local state defining attributes and a set of methods (procedures) that define the behavior of that particular object and its relationship to the other objects that make up the system.&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910023489_1991023489.pdf "Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document"]. Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEF4 method multi-dimensional approach to object-oriented software system design consists of the following items:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* Design layers (system-level, application-level, and low-level design),
* Artifact design status (application domain, in transition, software domain),
* Design models (static, dynamic, and behavior) and the [[design rationale]] component, and
* Design features ranging from general to specific enabling deferred [[decision making]].

== History ==
The development of IDEF4 came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm can be realized in traditional [[data processing]] applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex [[distributed system]]s is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

IDEF4 was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the [[Common Lisp Object System]], [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], [[C++]] and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or [[database language]]s, standard methodologies such as [[structure chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, and traditional [[database model|data design model]]s (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

== IDEF4 concepts ==

=== Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects ===
[[File:Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects.jpg|thumb|240px|Dimensions of IDEF4 Design Objects.]]
IDEF4 uses an object-oriented design method or procedure that is very similar to [[James Rumbaugh|Rumbaugh]]’s Object Method Technique&lt;ref&gt;[[James Rumbaugh]] (1991). ''Object-Oriented Modeling and Design''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ:
Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sally Shlaer|Schlaer]]/[[Stephen J. Mellor|Mellor]]’s Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) technique.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Shlaer]] and [[Stephen J. Mellor]] (1988) ''Object-Oriented Systems Analysis: Modeling The Real World in Data''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are some crucial differences: 
* IDEF4 is specifically designed to be compatible with other IDEF methods,
* IDEF4 allows one to track the status of design artifacts from domain object through transition to design specification, and
* IDEF4 includes a [[design rationale]] component.
These extra dimensions are shown in the figure. The edges of the box show the progression of the design
from start to finish elaborating each of these dimensions.

=== IDEF4 Design Activities ===
In IDEF4, a design starts with the analysis of requirements and takes as input the domain objects. These domain objects are encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form and marked as domain objects. As computational objects are developed for these objects, they are marked as “transitional” and finally as “completed.” The level of completion of an IDEF4 design is determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
[[File:IIDEF4 Design Activities.jpg|thumb|240px|left|IDEF4 Design Activities.]]
The system-level design starts once the “raw material” (domain) objects have been collected. This develops the design context, ensures connectivity to legacy systems, and identifies the applications that must be built to satisfy the requirements. Static, dynamic, behavioral, and rationale models are built for the objects at the system level. These specifications become the requirements on the application level – the next level of design. The application level design identifies and specifies all of the software components (partitions) needed in the design. Static models, dynamic models, behavioral models, and the rationale component are built for the objects at the application level. These specifications become the requirements on the next level of design – the low-level design. Static Models, Dynamic Models, Behavioral Models, and the [[design rationale]] component are built for the low-level design objects. Sub-layers may be built within each layer to reduce complexity.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

IDEF4 is an iterative procedure involving partitioning, classification/specification, assembly, simulation, and re-partitioning activities, see figure. First the design is partitioned into objects, each of which is either classified against existing objects or for which an external specification is developed. The external specification enables the internal specification of the object to be delegated and performed concurrently. After classification/specification, the interfaces between the objects are specified in the assembly activity (i.e., static, dynamic, and behavioral models detailing different aspects of the interaction between objects are developed). While the models are developed, it is important to simulate use scenarios or cases &lt;ref&gt;[[Ivar Jacobson]] (1994). ''Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; between objects to uncover design flaws. Based on these flaws the designer can then rearrange the existing models and simulate them until the designer is satisfied.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== IDEF4 Object-oriented Concepts ===
IDEF4’s defines a set of object oriented concepts:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* ''Domains'' : IDEF4 projects are implemented in a domain. A domain can be seen as the scope of the system being developed. During system design, the software is transitioned between three domains: the application domain, the design domain, and the implementation domain.
* ''Features, Artifacts, and Objects''
* ''Object Instance'' : Objects can be object instances, object classes, and object partitions. Object instances are the individual things encountered in the application domain.
* ''Classes'' : Classes are generalizations about objects and are used to manage complexity by taking advantage of similarities in object instances and grouping them under a class or category.
* ''Subclass/Superclass'' : The term subclass captures the concept of grouping particular instances of a class into an even more specialized class.
* ''Partitions'' : A partition object contains objects and relations.
* ''Attributes'' : Attributes are an implementation choice on how to represent an object’s state.
* ''Object States'' : Object states represent situations or conditions of an object instance that are meaningful in the design.
* ''Method'' : A method is an implementation of behavior (i.e., a set of instructions according to which the object performs some operation).
* ''Message and Polymorphism'' : Objects communicate by sending messages to each other.
* ''Event'' : An event is a signal generated by a method in an object indicating some condition in the object.
* ''Object Life cycles'' : In any system, objects exhibit patterns of behavior as they cycle through different states.
* ''Client/Server'' : An object plays the role of a client relative to a message if it is the sender of that message.
* ''Relationships and Roles'' : Objects connected together with arcs. These arcs are called relationships and they show associations between objects.
* ''Inheritance'' : A specific type of relationship used in object-oriented technology is inheritance.
* ''Encapsulation and Information Hiding'' : Encapsulation and information hiding are two object-oriented concepts that are most easily understood when discussed in terms of interactions between objects.

=== Object Class Identification ===
[[File:Object classes in IDEF4.jpg|thumb|480px|The five types of Object classes in IDEF4.]]
The IDEF4 Method assumes that the domain objects have been identified through Object-Oriented Domain Analysis. Methods such as [[IDEF1]], [[IDEF5]], [[IDEF3]], [[SA/SD]] can be used to perform domain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Yourdon]], and [[Larry Constantine]] (1979). ''Structured design: Fundamentals of a discipline of computer program and systems design''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, IDEF4 practitioners should be aware of how objects are identified, as the design process may reveal deficiencies in the Object-Oriented Analysis. IDEF4 had defined five types of classes:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
* ''Physical Objects''
* ''Role Objects'' : The role may be related to other activities that the person engages in (e.g., a patient in a hospital, a stockholder, a client, a trustee, a suspect in a burglary, or a tax payer).
* ''Event Objects'' : Events or incidents may also be considered objects. The identification of events as objects is highly subjective, and will depend on the domain in which the software is to be used.
* ''Interaction Objects'' : Interaction objects are the result of interactions or transactions between two or more objects.
* ''Specification and Procedure Objects'' : Specification objects describe the acceptable characteristics of objects instances. Procedure objects refer to the way other object instances may interact.

== IDEF4 Building blocks ==
[[File:26 Organization of the IDEF4 Project.jpg|thumb|360px|Organization of the IDEF4 Building blocks.]]

=== IDEF4 Layers ===
IDEF4 users design in three distinct layers:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;
# system design,
# application design, and
# low-level design.
This three layered organization reduces the complexity of the design. The system design layer ensures connectivity to other systems in the design context. The application layer depicts the interfaces between the components of the system being designed. These components include commercial applications, previously designed and implemented applications, and applications to be designed. The low-level design layer represents the foundation objects of the system.

=== IDEF4 Artifact Status ===
IDEF4 distinguishes between IDEF4 artifacts newly created from the application domain, artifacts in transition to design specification, and artifacts that have been specified that can be applied to create the design specification. Any design artifact in IDEF4 can be marked as domain, transition, or complete. This allows practitioners and reviewers to track the progress of the design toward completion.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== IDEF4 Design Models ===
[[File:Organization of the IDEF4 model.jpg|thumb|360px|Organization of the IDEF4 model.]]
IDEF4 uses three design models and a design rationale component:&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt; 
* The Static Model (SM) defines time-invariant relations between objects (for example, inheritance).
* The Dynamic Model (DM) specifies the communication between objects and the state transitions of objects.
* The Behavior Model (BM) defines the relations between the respective behaviors of objects.
The design rationale component provides a top-down representation of the system, giving a broad view that encompasses the three design models and documents the rationale for major design evolutions.

Each model represents a different cross section of the design. The three design models capture all the information represented in a design project, and the design rationale documents the reasoning behind the design. Each model is supported by a graphical syntax that highlights the design decisions that must be made and their impact on other perspectives of the design. To facilitate use, the graphical syntax is identical among the three models.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

=== Design Features ===
IDEF4 provides a broad range of design features – from generic to specific. This range enables deferred decision making by allowing the designer to first capture design features in general terms and later to refine them. This significantly reduces the burden on designers by allowing them to immediately capture new design concepts with IDEF4 design features, even if these design concepts have not yet been explored in detail.&lt;ref name="May95"/&gt;

The '''Korn–Kreer–Lenssen model''' ('''KKL model''') is a discrete [[Trinomial tree|trinomial model]] proposed in 1998 by Ralf Korn, Markus Kreer and Mark Lenssen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15326349808807493 | volume=14 | title=Pricing of european options when the underlying stock price follows a linear birth-death process | journal=Communications in Statistics. Stochastic Models | pages=647–662}}&lt;/ref&gt; to model [[illiquid securities]] and to value [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivatives]] on these. It generalizes the binomial [[Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model]] in a natural way as the stock in a given time interval can either rise one unit up, fall one unit down or remain unchanged. In contrast to [[Black–Scholes]] or [[Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model]] the [[Market (economics)|market]] consisting of stock and cash is not complete yet. To value and replicate a financial derivative an additional traded security related to the original security needs to be added. This  might be a Low Exercise Price Option (or short [[LEPO]]). The mathematical proof of arbitrage free pricing is based on [[Martingale representation theorem|martingale representations]] for point processes pioneered in the 1980s and 1990 by [[Albert Shiryaev]], Robert Liptser and [[Marc Yor]].

The dynamics is based on continuous time linear [[birth-death process]]es and analytic formulae for option prices and Greeks can be stated. Later work looks at market completion with general calls or puts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/101130_chen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A comprehensive introduction may be found in the attached MSc-thesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.aims.ac.za/archive/2010/obeng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The model belongs to the class of [[Trinomial tree|trinomial models]] and the difference to the standard [[trinomial tree]] is the following: if &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; denotes the waiting time between two movements of the stock price then in the KKL-model &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; remains finite and exponentially distributed whereas in [[trinomial tree]]s the time is discrete and the limit &lt;math&gt; \Delta t \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; is taken by numerical extrapolation afterwards.

[[File:Gerard van Honthorst 001.jpg|thumb|240px|"Adoration of the Shepherds" by [[Gerard van Honthorst]], 1622]]
The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four canonical gospels: Matthew and Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|3:23–38|NIV}} {{bibleverse|Matthew|1:1–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it downwards towards Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''Where Christology began: essays on Philippians 2'' by [[Ralph P. Martin]], Brian J. Dodd 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25619-8}} p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Both gospels state that Jesus was begotten not by [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], but conceived miraculously in the womb of Mary by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=genpurpose &gt;''The purpose of the Biblical genealogies'' by Marshall D. Johnson 1989 {{ISBN|0-521-35644-X}} pp. 229–233&lt;/ref&gt; Both accounts trace Joseph back to [[David|King David]] and from there to [[Abraham]]. These lists are identical between Abraham and David (except for one), but they differ almost completely between David and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Fitzmyer, ''The Gospel According to Luke I–IX''. Anchor Bible. Garden City: Doubleday, 1981, pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Howard Marshall, "The Gospel of Luke" (''The New International Greek Testament Commentary''). Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1978, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew gives Jacob as Joseph’s father and Luke says Joseph was the son of Heli. Attempts at explaining the differences between the genealogies have varied in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'' by William Barclay 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22487-3}} pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; Much of modern scholarship interprets them as literary inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, ''The First Christmas'' (HarperCollins, 2009) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Luke and Matthew accounts of the birth of Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in [[Bethlehem]], in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the [[Census of Quirinius|census]] to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger.&lt;ref&gt;"biblical literature." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 2011.  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature].&lt;/ref&gt; Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, [[Biblical Magi|The Magi]] follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the ''[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]''. [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus's family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Over the centuries, biblical scholars have attempted to reconcile these contradictions,&lt;ref name="autogenerated102"&gt;Mark D. Roberts ''Can We Trust the Gospels?: Investigating the Reliability of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John'' Good News Publishers, 2007 p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; while modern scholarship mostly views them as legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Casey, Maurice | year=2010 | pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthew' p. 47"&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by [[Daniel J.

===Locations of Ministry===
{{Main article|New Testament places associated with Jesus}}
[[Image:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|250px|[[Galilee]], [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and  [[Judea]] at the time of Jesus]]

In the New Testament accounts, the principle locations for the [[ministry of Jesus]] were Galilee and Judea, with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as Perea and Samaria.&lt;ref name=Redford117/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alister16"/&gt;

The [[Canonical gospel|gospel]] narrative of the ministry of Jesus is traditionally separated into sections that have a geographical nature.

:* ''Galilean ministry'': Jesus' ministry begins when after [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], he [[Return of Jesus to Galilee|returns to Galilee]], and [[Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum|preaches in the synagogue]] of Capernaum.&lt;ref name="Matthew' page 71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capernaum page 7"&gt;''Jesus in the Synagogue of Capernaum: The Pericope and its Programmatic Character for the Gospel of Mark'' by John Chijioke Iwe 1991 {{ISBN|9788876528460}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The [[first disciples of Jesus]] encounter him near the [[Sea of Galilee]] and his later Galilean ministry includes key episodes such as [[Sermon on the Mount]] (with the [[Beatitudes]]) which form the core of his moral teachings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation'' by Carl G. Vaught 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-918954-76-3}} pages xi-xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, 2005, {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}}, pages 63–68&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus' ministry in the Galilee area draws to an end with the [[death of John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox pages 97-110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redford165"/&gt;

:* ''Journey to Jerusalem'': After the death of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately [[Matthew 17]] and [[Mark 9]]) two key events take place that change the nature of the narrative by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his [[Confession of Peter|proclamation as Christ]] by Peter and [[transfiguration of Jesus|his transfiguration]].&lt;ref name="KingsburyMark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton132"/&gt; After these events, a good portion of the gospel narratives deal with Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem through [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and Judea.&lt;ref name="KingsburyMark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox pages 121-135"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 189-207"/&gt; As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized.&lt;ref name="Steven L. Cox page 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 211-229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt;

:* ''Final week in Jerusalem'': The final part of Jesus' ministry begins ([[Matthew 21]] and [[Mark 11]]) with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] after the [[raising of Lazarus]] episode which takes place in [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]. The gospels provide more details about the final portion than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the [[Holy Week|last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem]] which ends in his crucifixion.&lt;ref name="Turner613"/&gt; The New Testament accounts of the [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] and his [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] are also in Judea.

=== Baptism and temptation===
{{main article|Baptism of Jesus|Temptation of Jesus}}
[[File:Baptism-of-Christ-xx-Francesco-Alban.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Francesco Albani]]'s 17th-century ''Baptism of Christ'' is a typical depiction with the sky opening and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] descending as a dove the baptism was done by John.&lt;ref name=Ross30 &gt;''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'' by Leslie Ross 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-313-29329-0}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Baptism of Jesus]] marks the beginning of his [[ministry of Jesus|public ministry]]. This event is recorded in the [[Canonical Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark and Luke. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29-33]], rather than a direct narrative, [[John the Baptist]] bears witness to the episode.&lt;ref name=Zanzig118 &gt;''Jesus of history, Christ of faith'' by Thomas Zanzig 2000 {{ISBN|0-88489-530-0}} page 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnEBrown25 &gt;''The Gospel and Epistles of John: A Concise Commentary'' by Raymond Edward Brown 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-1283-5}} pages 25-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[New Testament]], John the Baptist preached a "[[Baptism in Christianity|baptism with water]]", not of forgiveness but of penance or repentance for the remission of sins ({{bibleref2|Luke|3:3}}), and declared himself a forerunner to one who would baptize 'with the Holy Spirit and with fire' ({{bibleref2|Luke|3:16}}). In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington, Daniel J., SJ. "Jesus Goes Public." ''America,'' Jan. 7–14, 2008, pp. 38ff&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus came to the [[Jordan River]] where he was baptized by John.&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Mt|3:13-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|2Cor|5:21|NIV|2 Cor. 5:21}}; {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|4:15}}; {{Bibleref2|1Peter|3:18|NIV|1 Peter 3:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XVI. ''Jesus of Nazareth.'' Doubleday Religion, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-385-52341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baptismal scene includes the [[Heaven]]s opening, a dove-like descent of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]], and a [[Bath Kol|voice from Heaven]] saying, "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:17}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|1:11}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|3:21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.&lt;ref name=Harring63 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-5803-2}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopez95 &gt;''Christianity: A Biblical, Historical, and Theological Guide'' by Glenn Jonas, Kathryn Muller Lopez 2010 ISBN pages 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chilton187 &gt;''Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 {{ISBN|90-04-11142-5}} page 187-198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell47 &gt;''Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell 1998 {{ISBN|0-664-25703-8}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] states that the historicity of the Baptism and [[crucifixion of Jesus]] "command almost universal assent".&lt;ref name=JDunn339&gt;''Jesus Remembered'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name=JDunn339/&gt;

The ''temptation of Jesus'' is detailed in the gospels of [[gospel of Matthew|Matthew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Matthew|4:1-11|NIV}}, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt; [[gospel of Mark|Mark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Mark|1:12-13|NIV}}, NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gospel of Luke|Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Luke|4:1-13|NIV}}, NIV&lt;/ref&gt; In these narratives, after being [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]], [[Jesus]] [[fasting|fasted]] for forty days and nights in the [[Judaean Desert]]. During this time, [[Devil in Christianity|the devil]] appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation, the devil departed and [[angel]]s came and brought nourishment to Jesus.

===Calling the disciples and early Ministry===
{{see also|First disciples of Jesus}}
[[File:V&amp;A - Raphael, The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (1515).jpg|thumb|200px|Calling of the disciples and the [[miraculous catch of fish]], by [[Raphael]], 1515]]
The calling of the [[first disciples of Jesus|first disciples]] is a key episode in the gospels which begins the active ministry of Jesus, and builds the foundation for the group of people who follow him, and later form the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew'' by Leon Morris'' 1992 {{ISBN|0-85111-338-9}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke'' by Fred B. Craddock 1991 {{ISBN|0-8042-3123-0}} p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:18-22|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|1:16-20|NIV}} and  {{bibleverse||Luke|5:1-11|NIV}} on the [[Sea of Galilee]]. {{bibleverse||John|1:35-51|NIV}} reports the first encounter with two of the disciples a little earlier in the presence of [[John the Baptist]]. Particularly in the [[Gospel of Mark]] the beginning of the ministry of Jesus and the call of the first disciples are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;''The beginning of the Gospel: introducing the Gospel according to Mark'' by Eugene LaVerdiere 1999 {{ISBN|0-8146-2478-2}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|5:1&amp;ndash;11|NIV}}),&lt;ref name="Lukepassage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%205:1-11&amp;version=NIV |title=Luke 5:1-11, New International Version |publisher=Biblegateway |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the event is part of the first [[miraculous catch of fish]] and results in [[Saint Peter|Peter]] as well as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], the sons of Zebedee, joining Jesus [[vocation]]ally as disciples.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clowes (cleric)|John Clowes]], ''The Miracles of Jesus Christ'' published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK, 1817, p. 214, available on Google books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'' by Timothy Johnson, Daniel J. Harrington, 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-5805-9}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'', by Joel B. Green 1997 {{ISBN|0-8028-2315-7}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering of the disciples in {{bibleverse||John|1:35-51|NIV}} follows the many patterns of discipleship that continue in the New Testament, in that who have received someone else's witness become witnesses to Jesus themselves. Andrew follows Jesus because of the testimony of John the Baptist, [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] brings Nathanael and the pattern continues in {{bibleverse||John|4:4-26|NIV}} where the [[Samaritan Woman at the Well]] testifies to the town people about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''John'' by Gail R. O'Day, Susan Hylen 2006 {{ISBN|0-664-25260-5}} p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

This early period also includes the first [[miracle of Jesus]] in the ''[[Marriage at Cana]]'', in the [[Gospel of John]] where Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding and when the wine runs out Jesus turns water into wine by performing a miracle.&lt;ref&gt;H. Van der Loos, 1965 ''The Miracles of Jesus'', E.J. Brill Press, Netherlands page 599&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Royster 1999 ''The miracles of Christ'' {{ISBN|0-88141-193-0}} p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry and miracles in Galilee===
Jesus' activities in Galillee include a number of miracles and teachings. The beginnings of this period include [[The Centurion's Servant]] (8:5-13) and [[Calming the storm]] (Matthew 8:23-27) both dealing with the theme of faith overcoming fear.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary'' by R. T.

Gleave, Manchester, UK p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, Jesus also gathers disciples, e.g. [[Calling of Matthew|calls Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by R. T. France 2007 {{ISBN|0-8028-2501-X}} p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commissioning the twelve Apostles]] relates the initial selection of the [[twelve Apostles]] among the disciples of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''The first gospel'' by Harold Riley, 1992 {{ISBN|0-86554-409-3}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E.

In the [[Mission Discourse]], Jesus instructs the [[twelve apostles]] who are named in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#10:2|Matthew 10:2-3]] to carry no belongings as they travel from city to city and preach.&lt;ref name="New Testament' page 324"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redford143"/&gt; Separately in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1-24]] relates the [[Seventy Disciples]], where Jesus appoints a larger number of disciples and sent them out in pairs with the ''Missionary's Mandate'' to go into villages before Jesus' arrival there.&lt;ref name=Ringe &gt;''Luke'' by Sharon H. Ringe 1995 {{ISBN|0-664-25259-1}} pages 151-152&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing of the Baptist's death, Jesus withdraws by boat privately to a solitary place near [[Bethsaida]], where he addresses the crowds who had followed him on foot from the towns, and feeds them all by "[[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and two fish]]" supplied by a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Maguire 1863 ''The miracles of Christ'' published by Weeks and Co. London p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the gospels present the ''[[Jesus' walk on water|Walking on water]]'' episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22-23]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45-52]] and
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16-21]] as an important step in developing the relationship between Jesus and his disciples, at this stage of his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Chapin Tenney 1997 ''John: Gospel of Belief'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4351-4}} p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The episode emphasizes the importance of faith by stating that when he attempted to walk on water, [[Apostle Peter|Peter]] began to sink when he lost faith and became afraid, and at the end of the episode, the disciples increase their faith in Jesus and in Matthew 14:33 they say: "Of a truth thou art the Son of God".&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Pentecost 2000 ''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' {{ISBN|0-310-30940-9}} p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Major teachings in this period include the [[Discourse on Defilement]] in Matthew 15:1–20 and Mark 7:1–23 where in response to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: "What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'".&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus the miracle worker: a historical &amp; theological study'' by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 {{ISBN|0-8308-1596-1}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this episode Jesus withdraws into the "parts of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]" near the [[Mediterranean Sea]] where the [[Canaanite woman's daughter]] episode takes place in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#15:21|Matthew 15:21–28]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#7:24|Mark 7:24-30]].&lt;ref name=Twelftree133 &gt;''Jesus the miracle worker: a historical &amp; theological study'' by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 {{ISBN|0-8308-1596-1}} pages 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; This episode is an example of how Jesus emphasizes the value of faith, telling the woman: "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted."&lt;ref name=Twelftree133 /&gt; The importance of faith is also emphasized in the [[Cleansing ten lepers]] episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#17:11|Luke 17:11-19]].&lt;ref&gt;Berard L. Marthaler 2007 ''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' {{ISBN|0-89622-537-2}} page 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 ''All the Miracles of the Bible'' {{ISBN|0-310-28101-6}} page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gospel of Mark, after passing through [[Sidon]] Jesus enters the region of the [[Decapolis]], a group of ten cities south east of Galilee, where the [[Healing the deaf mute of Decapolis|Healing the deaf mute]] miracle is reported in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#7:31|Mark 7:31-37]], where after the healing, the disciples say: "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak." The episode is the last in a series of narrated miracles which builds up to Peter's proclamation of Jesus as Christ in Mark 8:29.&lt;ref&gt;Lamar Williamson 1983 ''Mark'' {{ISBN|0-8042-3121-4}} pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation as Christ===
{{Main article|Confession of Peter}}
[[Image:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pietro Perugino]]'s depiction of the "Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter" by Jesus, 1492]]
The ''[[Confession of Peter]]'' refers to an episode in the New Testament in which in Jesus asks a  question to his disciples: "Who do you say that I am?" [[Apostle Peter]] proclaims [[Jesus]] to be [[Christ]] - the expected [[Messiah]]. The proclamation is described in the three [[Synoptic Gospels]]: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:13|Matthew 16:13-20]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:27|Mark 8:27–30]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:18|Luke 9:18–20]].&lt;ref name=Karris &gt;''The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament'' by Robert J. Karris 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-2211-9}} pages 885-886&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kingsbury &gt;''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25752-6}} page xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in which Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among "the multitudes", asking: "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"&lt;ref name=Karris /&gt; The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: ''But who do you say that I am?'' Only Simon Peter answers him: ''You are the Christ, the Son of the living God''.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Christology and the New Testament'' by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22431-8}} page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#16:17|Matthew 16:17]] Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates him as the rock of the Church, and states that he will give Peter "the keys of the kingdom of heaven".&lt;ref name=Boring69 &gt;''The people's New Testament commentary'' by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 {{ISBN|0-664-22754-6}} page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[Son of God]]'' which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]] had revealed it to Peter.&lt;ref name=Yueh &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref name=Yueh /&gt; The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to [[Christology]] and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive statement for it in the New Testament narrative.&lt;ref name=Rudolf7 &gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by Rudolf Schnackenburg 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4438-3}} pages 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is likely to be an addition by Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jesus of Nazareth | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Casey, Maurice | year=2010 | pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transfiguration===
{{Main article|Transfiguration of Jesus}}
[[File:Alexandr Ivanov 015.jpg|thumb|240px|Transfiguration by [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexandr Ivanov]], 1824]]
The ''Transfiguration of Jesus'' is an episode in the New Testament narrative in which [[Jesus]] is [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfigured]] (or metamorphosed) and becomes radiant upon a mountain.&lt;ref name=Lee21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lockyer213 /&gt; The [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#17:1|Matthew 17:1–9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#9:2|Mark 9:2-8]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:28|Luke 9:28–36]]) describe it, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/2 Peter#1:16|2 Peter 1:16–18]] refers to it.&lt;ref name=Lee21 /&gt; In these accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles go to a mountain (the [[Mount of Transfiguration]]). On the mountain, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] appear next to him and he speaks with them. Jesus is then called "[[Son of God|Son]]" by a voice in the sky, assumed to be [[God the Father]], as in the [[Baptism of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Lee21 &gt;''Transfiguration'' by Dorothy A.

Cox page 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesus pages 211-229"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt; The area where Jesus was baptised is inferred as the vicinity of the Perea area, given the activities of the Baptist in [[Bethabara]] and [[Ænon]] in John [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:28|1:28]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:23|3:23]].&lt;ref name=BigPic &gt;''Big Picture of the Bible - New Testament'' by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 {{ISBN|1-57921-928-4}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sloyan11 &gt;''John'' by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 {{ISBN|0-8042-3125-7}} page 11&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally assume that the route Jesus followed from Galilee to Jerusalem passed through Perea.&lt;ref name="Bible' page 929"/&gt;

This period of ministry includes the [[Five Discourses of Matthew|Discourse on the Church]] in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains the role of his apostles in leading it.&lt;ref name=Jensen &gt;''Preaching Matthew's Gospel by Richard A.

The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and clout.&lt;ref name="King pages 215-216"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chouinard &gt;''Matthew'' by Larry Chouinard 1997 {{ISBN|0-89900-628-0}} page 321&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of this period, the Gospel of John includes the [[Raising of Lazarus]] episode in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#11:1|John 11:1-46]] in which Jesus brings [[Lazarus of Bethany]] back to life four days after his burial.&lt;ref name="Cox155"/&gt; In the Gospel of John, the raising of Lazarus is the climax of the "seven signs" which gradually confirm the identity of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and the expected Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and Judea.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt; Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the [[Raising of Lazarus]] episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.&lt;ref name=Cox155 /&gt;

The week begins with the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]. During the week of his "final ministry in Jerusalem", Jesus visits the Temple, and has a [[Cleansing of the Temple|conflict with the money changers]] about their use of the Temple for commercial purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which [[Authority of Jesus Questioned|his authority is questioned]]. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot]], decides to [[Bargain of Judas|betray Jesus]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]].&lt;ref name=Lockyer106 &gt;''All the Apostles of the Bible'' by Herbert Lockyer 1988 {{ISBN|0-310-28011-7}} page 106-111&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the week, Jesus has the [[Last Supper]] with his disciples, during which he institutes the [[Eucharist]], and prepares them for his departure in the [[Farewell Discourse]]. After the supper, Jesus is [[Kiss of Judas|betrayed with a kiss]] while he is in [[agony in the garden]], and is [[Arrest of Jesus|arrested]]. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies him]] three times, as [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|Jesus had predicted]] during the Last Supper.&lt;ref name=Cox182 &gt;[[#refCox2007|Cox (2007)]] p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig A.

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:36|Matthew 26:36-46]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:32|Mark 14:32-42]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:39|Luke 22:39-46]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#18:1|John 18:1]], immediately after the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray, Matthew and Mark identifying this place of prayer as [[Garden of Gethsemane]].&lt;ref name=Maj169 &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck83 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament'' edited by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-88207-812-0}} pages 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is accompanied by Peter, [[St. John the Apostle|John]] and [[St. James the Greater|James the Greater]], whom he asks to "remain here and keep watch with me." He moves "a stone's throw away" from them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says "My [[God the Father|Father]], if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it."&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt; Only the Gospel of Luke mentions the details of the sweat of blood of Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will of the Father. Returning to the disciples after prayer, he finds them asleep and in Matthew 26:40 he asks Peter: "So, could you men not keep watch with me for an hour?"&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;

While in the Garden, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] appears, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas [[the kiss of Judas|gives Jesus a kiss]] to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; One of Jesus' disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the men in the crowd.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; Luke states that Jesus [[miracles of Jesus|miraculously healed]] the wound and John and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his disciples should not resist his arrest. In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:52|Matthew 26:52]] Jesus makes the well known statement: ''[[Live by the sword, die by the sword|all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword]]''.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;

In the narrative of the four canonical gospels after the [[arrest of Jesus|betrayal and arrest]] of Jesus, he is taken to the [[Sanhedrin]], a Jewish judicial body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond E.

After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment. Pilate then orders Jesus' crucifixion.&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig396 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holman608 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GBromiley1050 &gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W.

After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus is taken to ''[[Pilate's court]]'' in the ''[[praetorium]]''. Only in the [[Gospel of Luke]], finding that Jesus, being from [[Galilee]], belonged to [[Herod Antipas]]' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus to Herod]]. Herod Antipas (the same man who had previously ordered the death of [[John the Baptist]]) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he had been hoping to observe one of the [[miracles of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Carter &gt;''Pontius Pilate: portraits of a Roman governor'' by Warren Carter 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5113-1}} pages 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity.&lt;ref name=Niswonger172 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L.

(1995), ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. vol. K-P. p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jesus' return from Herod's court, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus to be innocent of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 vol. K-P, p. 979.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pilate decided to publicly [[Blood curse|wash his hands]] as not being privy to Jesus' death.

After the trials, Jesus made his way to [[Calvary]] (the path is traditionally called [[via Dolorosa]]) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]], the Romans compelling him to do so.&lt;ref name=Evans2003 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A.

The soldiers then crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross was the inscription [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]], and the soldiers and those passing by mocked him about the title.

Following Jesus' death on Friday, [[Joseph of Arimathea]] asked the permission of Pilate to remove the body.

''Journal of Biblical Literature,'' Vol. 116, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 259–272&lt;/ref&gt; Variants have to do with the precise time the women visited the tomb, the number and identity of the women; the purpose of their visit; the appearance of the messenger(s)—angelic or human; their message to the women; and the response of the women.&lt;ref name="Stagg2" /&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:5|Matthew 28:5]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:5|Mark 16:5]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:4|Luke 24:4]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:12|John 20:12]] his resurrection is announced and explained to the followers who arrive there early in the morning by either one or two beings (either men or angels) dressed in bright robes who appear in or near the tomb.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt; The gospel accounts vary as to who arrived at the tomb first, but they are women and are instructed by the risen Jesus to inform the other disciples. All four accounts include [[Mary Magdalene]] and three include [[Mary the mother of Jesus]]. The accounts of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:9|Mark 16:9]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:15|John 20:15]] indicate that Jesus appeared to the Magdalene first, and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#16:9|Luke 16:9]] states that she was among the [[Myrrhbearers]] who informed the disciples about the resurrection.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:11|Matthew 28:11-15]], to explain the empty tomb, the Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded the tomb to spread the rumor that Jesus' disciples took his body.&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;

===Resurrection appearances===
{{Main article|Resurrection appearances of Jesus}}
{{see also|Noli me tangere|Doubting Thomas|Great Commission|Road to Emmaus appearance}}
[[Image:Correggio Noli Me Tangere.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Noli me Tangere]]'' by [[Antonio da Correggio]], c. 1534]]
After the discovery of the empty tomb, the gospels indicate that Jesus made a series of appearances to the disciples.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;

In {{Bibleref2|John|20:15-17|NIV}} Jesus appears to [[Mary Magdalene]] soon after his resurrection. At first she does not recognize him and thinks that he is the gardener. When he says her name, she recognizes him yet he tells her [[Noli me Tangere]], do not touch me, "for I am not yet ascended to my Father."

Later that day, at evening, Jesus appears to the disciples and shows them the wounds in his hands and his side in {{Bibleref2|John|20:19-21}}. [[Thomas the Apostle]] is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known [[Doubting Thomas]] episode in [[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/John#20:24|John 20:24-29]] Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his finger into the holes made by the wounds in Jesus' hands and side.  Thomas then professes his faith in Jesus. In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|28:16–20|ESV}}, in the [[Great Commission]] Jesus appears to his followers on a mountain in [[Galilee]] and calls on them to baptize all nations in the name of the "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit".

{{Bibleref2|Luke|24:13-32|NIV}} describes the [[Road to Emmaus appearance]] in which while a disciple named [[Cleopas]] was walking towards [[Emmaus]] with another disciple, they met Jesus, who later has supper with them. {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:12-13|NIV}} has a similar account that describes the appearance of Jesus to two disciples while they were walking in the country, at about the same time in the Gospel narrative.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Comparative New Testament'' by Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-528299-X}} page 589&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Miraculous catch of 153 fish]] Jesus appears to his disciples on the [[Sea of Galilee]], and thereafter Jesus encourages [[Apostle Peter]] to serve his followers.&lt;ref name=Evans521 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck91 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Easley216 /&gt;

===Ascension===
{{Main article|Ascension of Jesus}}
{{see also|Ascension of Jesus in Christian art}}
[[File:Benvenuto Tisi da Garofalo - Ascension of Christ - WGA08474.jpg|thumb|180px|''Ascension of Christ'' by [[Il Garofalo|Garofalo]] 1520]]
The ''Ascension of Jesus'' ([[anglicized]] from the [[Vulgate]] Latin [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|Acts 1:9-11]] section title: ''Ascensio Iesu'') is the Christian teaching found in the [[New Testament]] that the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]] was [[Entering heaven alive|taken up to heaven]] in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of his [[apostles]], occurring 40 days after the resurrection. In the biblical narrative, an [[angel]] tells the watching [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] that [[Second Coming of Jesus|Jesus' second coming]] will take place in the same manner as his ascension.&lt;ref&gt;"Ascension, The." Macmillan Dictionary of the Bible. London: Collins, 2002. ''Credo Reference.'' Web. 27 September 2010. {{ISBN|0333648056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canonical gospel]]s include two brief descriptions of the Ascension of Jesus in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:50|Luke 24:50-53]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:19|Mark 16:19]], in which it takes place on Easter Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Fred B. Craddock, Luke (Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), page 293&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of Jesus' bodily Ascension into the clouds is given in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|1:9-11]]) where the narrative starts with the account of Jesus' appearances after his resurrection and describes the event as taking place forty days later.&lt;ref name=Fred293 &gt;''Luke'' by Fred B. Craddock 2009 {{ISBN|0664234356}} pages 293-294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Matera53 &gt;''New Testament Theology'' by Frank J. Matera 2007 {{ISBN|066423044X}} pages 53-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts 1:9-12 specifies the location of the Ascension as the "[[Mount of olives|mount called Olivet]]" near Jerusalem. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:3|Acts 1:3]] states that Jesus: :"showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God". After giving a number of instructions to the apostles 
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:9|Acts 1:9]] describes the Ascension as follows:"And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight." Following this two men clothed in white appear and tell the apostles that [[Second Coming|Jesus will return]] in the same manner as he was taken, and the apostles return to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Matera53 /&gt;

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:30|Acts 2:30-33]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#4:8|Ephesians 4:8-10]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#3:16|1 Timothy 3:16]] (where Jesus as taken up in glory) the Ascension is spoken of as an accepted fact, while Hebrews 10:12  describes Jesus as [[Session of Christ|seated in heaven]].&lt;ref name=Freedman110 &gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' by D. N. Freedman, David Noel, Allen Myers and Astrid B. Beck 2000 {{ISBN|9053565035}} page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular graphics''' ('''MG''') is the discipline and philosophy of studying [[molecule]]s and their properties through graphical representation.&lt;ref name="Dickerson1969"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickerson | first = R.E. |author2=Geis, I. | title = The structure and action of proteins | publisher = W.A. Benjamin | year = 1969 | location = Menlo Park, CA }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IUPAC]] limits the definition to representations on a "graphical display device".&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=molecular graphics|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/MT06970.html|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s atoms and [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]]'s [[benzene]], there has been a rich history of hand-drawn atoms and molecules, and these representations have had an important influence on modern molecular graphics. This article concentrates on the use of computers to create molecular graphics. Note, however, that many molecular graphics programs and systems have close coupling between the graphics and editing commands or calculations such as in [[molecular modelling]].

==Relation to molecular models==
[[File:jmol1.png|thumb|Fig. 1. Key: [[Hydrogen]] = white, [[carbon]] = grey, [[nitrogen]] = blue, [[oxygen]] = red, and [[phosphorus]] = orange.]]
There has been a long tradition of creating [[molecular model]]s from physical materials. Perhaps the best known is [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|Watson's]] model of DNA built from rods and planar sheets, but the most widely used approach is to represent all atoms and bonds explicitly using the "[[ball-and-stick model|ball and stick]]" approach. This can demonstrate a wide range of properties, such as shape, relative size, and flexibility. Many chemistry courses expect that students will have access to ball and stick models. One goal of mainstream molecular graphics has been to represent the "ball and stick" model as realistically as possible and to couple this with calculations of molecular properties.

''Figure 1'' shows a small molecule ({{chem|NH|3|CH|2|CH|2|C(OH)(PO|3|H)(PO|3|H)-}}), as drawn by the [[Jmol]] program. It is important to realize that the colors and shapes are purely a convention, as individual atoms are not colored, nor do they have hard surfaces. [[Chemical bond|Bond]]s between atoms are also not rod-shaped.

===Comparison of physical models with molecular graphics===
Physical models and computer models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models can be used by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although [[Haptic technology|haptic]] devices have occasionally been built). On a computer screen, the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the [[pseudorotation]] of [[cyclohexane]] is a good example of the value of mechanical models.

However, it is difficult to build large physical molecules, and all-atom physical models of even simple proteins could take weeks or months to build. Moreover, physical models are not robust and they decay over time. Molecular graphics is particularly valuable for representing global and local properties of molecules, such as electrostatic potential. Graphics can also be animated to represent molecular processes and chemical reactions, a feat that is not easy to reproduce physically.

==History==

Initially the rendering was on early [[Cathode ray tube]] screens or through [[plotter]]s drawing on paper. Molecular structures have always been an attractive choice for developing new [[computer graphics]] tools, since the input data are easy to create and the results are usually highly appealing. The first example of MG was a display of a [[protein]] molecule (Project MAC, 1966) by [[Cyrus Levinthal]] and Robert Langridge. Among the milestones in high-performance MG was the work of [[Nelson Max]] in "realistic" rendering of [[macromolecule]]s using reflecting [[sphere]]s.

By about 1980 many laboratories both in academia and industry had recognized the power of the computer to analyse and predict the properties of molecules, especially in [[materials science]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. The discipline was often called "molecular graphics" and in 1982 a group of academics and industrialists in the UK set up the Molecular Graphics Society (MGS). Initially much of the technology concentrated either on high-performance [[3D graphics]], including  interactive rotation or 3D rendering of atoms as spheres (sometimes with [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|radiosity]]). During the 1980s a number of programs for calculating molecular properties (such as [[molecular dynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]) became available and the term "molecular graphics" often included these. As a result, the MGS has now changed its name to the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society (MGMS).

The requirements of [[X-ray crystallography|macromolecular crystallography]] also drove MG because  the traditional techniques of physical model-building could not scale. The first two protein structures solved by molecular graphics without the aid of the Richards' Box were built with Stan Swanson's program FIT on the Vector General graphics display in the laboratory of Edgar Meyer at Texas A&amp;M University: First Marge Legg in Al Cotton's lab at A&amp;M solved the structure of staph. nuclease (1975) and then Jim Hogle solved the structure of monoclinic lysozyme in 1976. A full year passed before other graphics systems were used to replace the Richards' Box for modelling into density in 3-D. Alwyn Jones' FRODO program (and later "O") were developed to overlay the molecular [[electron density]] determined from X-ray crystallography and the hypothetical molecular structure.

In 2009 [[BALLView]] became the first software to use [[Raytracing]] for molecular graphics.

==Art, science and technology in molecular graphics==
[[File:Hemagglutinin molecule.png|thumb|upright|Fig. 2. Image of [[hemagglutinin]] with alpha [[helices]] depicted as cylinders and the rest of the chain as silver coils. The individual protein molecules (several thousand) have been hidden. All of the non-hydrogen atoms in the two [[ligand]]s (presumably [[sialic acid]]) have been shown near the top of the diagram. Key: [[Carbon]] = grey, [[oxygen]] = red, [[nitrogen]] = blue.]]

Both computer technology and graphic arts have contributed to molecular graphics. The development of [[structural biology]] in the 1950s led to a requirement to display molecules with thousands of [[atom]]s. The existing computer technology was limited in power, and in any case a naive depiction of all atoms left viewers overwhelmed. Most systems therefore used conventions where information was implicit or stylistic. Two [[vector graphics|vectors]] meeting at a point implied an atom or (in macromolecules) a complete [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] (10-20 atoms).

The macromolecular approach was popularized by Dickerson and Geis' presentation of proteins and the graphic work of [[Jane S. Richardson|Jane Richardson]] through high-quality hand-drawn diagrams such as the [[Ribbon diagram|"ribbon"]] representation. In this they strove to capture the intrinsic 'meaning' of the molecule. This search for the "messages in the molecule" has always accompanied the increasing power of computer graphics processing. Typically the depiction would concentrate on specific areas of the molecule (such as the [[active site]]) and this might have different colors or more detail in the number of explicit atoms or the type of depiction (e.g., spheres for atoms).

In some cases the limitations of technology have led to serendipitous methods for rendering. Most early graphics devices used [[vector graphics]], which meant that rendering spheres and surfaces was impossible. Michael Connolly's program "MS" calculated points on the surface-accessible surface of a molecule, and the points were rendered as dots with good visibility using the new vector graphics technology, such as the Evans and Sutherland PS300 series. Thin sections ("slabs") through the structural display showed very clearly the [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] of the surfaces for molecules binding to active sites, and the "Connolly surface" became a universal metaphor.

The relationship between the art and science of molecular graphics is shown in the exhibitions sponsored by the [[Molecular Graphics Society]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some exhibits are created with molecular graphics programs alone, while others are [[collage]]s, or involve physical materials. An example from Mike Hann (1994), inspired by [[Magritte|Magritte's]] painting ''Ceci n'est pas une pipe'', uses an image of a [[salmeterol]] molecule. "''Ceci n'est pas une molecule''," writes Mike Hann, "serves to remind us that all of the graphics images presented here are not molecules, not even pictures of molecules, but pictures of icons which we believe represent some aspects of the molecule's properties."{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Colour molecular graphics is often use on chemistry journal covers in an artistic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Electronic Visualisation in Chemistry: From Alchemy to Art | first1=Karl | last1=Harrison | first2=Jonathan P. | last2=Bowen | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | first3=Alice M. | last3=Bowen | editor-first1=Kia | editor-last1=Ng | editor-first2=Jonathan P. | editor-last2=Bowen | editor-first3=Sarah | editor-last3=McDaid | work=EVA London 2013 Conference Proceedings | series=[http://ewic.bcs.org/ Electronic Workshops in Computing] | publisher=[[British Computer Society]] | year=2013 | pages=267–274 | url=http://ewic.bcs.org/content/ConWebDoc/51042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-filling models===
{{Main|Space-filling model}}
[[File:FormicAcid.pdb.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Space-filling model of formic acid. Key: [[Hydrogen]] = white, [[carbon]] = black, [[oxygen]] = red.]]
Fig. 4 is a "space-filling" representation of [[formic acid]], where atoms are drawn as solid spheres to suggest the space they occupy. This and all space-filling models are necessarily icons or abstractions:  atoms are nuclei with [[Electron cloud#Shapes of orbitals|electron "clouds"]] of varying density surrounding them, and as such have no actual surfaces. For many years the size of atoms has been approximated by physical models ([[CPK coloring|CPK]]) in which the volumes of plastic balls describe where much of the electron density is to be found (often sized to [[van der Waals radius|van der Waals radii]]). That is, the surface of these models is meant to represent a specific ''level of [[Electron density|density]]'' of the electron cloud, not any putative physical surface of the atom.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Isosurface on molecule.jpg|left|thumb|Fig. 5. A molecule (zirconocene) where part (left) is rendered as ball-and-stick and part (right) as an isosurface.]] --&gt;
Since the atomic radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only slightly less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When [[raster graphics]] became affordable, one of the common approaches was to replicate CPK models ''[[in silico]]''. It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the [[molecular volume]] can be calculated.

The use of spheres is often for convenience, being limited both by graphics libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to see images of surfaces that have been colored to show quantities such as [[electrostatic potential]]. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include [[solvent-accessible surface|solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces]], [[solvent-excluded surface|solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces]], and [[isosurface]]s. The isosurface in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms to be seen and identified and it is not easy to deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.

==Technology==
Early interactive molecular computer graphics systems were [[vector graphics]] machines, which used stroke-writing [[vector monitor]]s, sometimes even oscilloscopes.  The electron beam does not sweep left-and-right as in a raster display.  The display hardware followed a sequential list of digital drawing instructions (the display list), directly drawing at an angle one stroke for each molecular bond.  When the list was complete, drawing would begin again from the top of the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), the display would flicker heavily.  Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in the display list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in the display unit, and the display unit would multiply all coordinates in the display list by the contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.

The early black-and white vector displays could somewhat distinguish for example a molecular structure from its surrounding electron density map for crystallographic structure solution work by drawing the molecule brighter than the map.  Color display makes them easier to tell apart.  During the 1970s two-color stroke-writing [[Penetron]] tubes were available, but not used in molecular computer graphics systems.  In about 1980 [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] made the first practical full-color vector displays for molecular graphics, typically attached to an E&amp;S PS-2 or MPS (MPS or Multi-Picture-System refers to several displays using a common graphics processor rack) graphics processor.  This early color display (the CSM or Color-Shadow-Mask) was expensive (around $50,000), because it was originally engineered to withstand the shaking of a flight-simulator motion base and because the vector scan was driven by a pair (X,Y) of 1Kw amplifiers. These systems required frequent maintenance and the wise user signed a flat rate Service Contract with E&amp;S. The newer E&amp;S PS-300 series graphics processors used less expensive color displays with raster scan technology and the entire system could be purchased for less than the older CSM display alone.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Sutherland PS-300 product literature&lt;/ref&gt;

Color raster graphics display of molecular models began around 1978 as seen in this paper by Porter&lt;ref name="Porter1978"/&gt; on spherical shading of atomic models.  Early raster molecular graphics systems displayed static images that could take around a minute to generate.  Dynamically rotating color raster molecular display phased in during 1982-1985 with the introduction of the Ikonas programmable raster display.

Molecular graphics has always pushed the limits of display technology, and has seen a number of cycles of integration and separation of compute-host and display. Early systems like Project MAC were [[bespoke]] and unique, but in the 1970s the MMS-X and similar systems used (relatively) low-cost terminals, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]] series, often over [[dial-up]] lines to multi-user hosts. The devices could only display static pictures but were able to evangelize MG. In the late 1970s, it was possible for departments (such as crystallography) to afford their own hosts (e.g., [[PDP-11]]) and to attach a display (such as [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]]'s PS-1) directly to the [[Computer bus|bus]]. The [[display list]] was kept on the host, and interactivity was good since updates were rapidly reflected in the display—at the cost of reducing most machines to a single-user system.

In the early 1980s, Evans &amp; Sutherland (E&amp;S) decoupled their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own display information transformable through a [[dataflow]] architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a [[serial line]] (e.g. 9600, 56K [[baud]]) or Ethernet interface and then manipulated without impact on the host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months trying to fit such activities into this architecture. E&amp;S designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine in an attempt to simplify this process but it was so difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;E&amp;S PS-300 Field Service documents&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits for MG were considerable, but by the later 1980s, [[UNIX]] [[workstations]] such as [[Sun-3]] with [[raster graphics]] (initially at a [[Image resolution|resolution]] of 256 by 256) had started to appear. Computer-assisted [[drug design]] in particular required raster graphics for the display of computed properties such as atomic [[Electric charge|charge]] and [[electrostatic potential]]. Although E&amp;S had a high-end range of raster graphics (primarily aimed at the [[aerospace]] industry) they failed to respond to the low-end market challenge where single users, rather than engineering departments, bought workstations. As a result, the market for MG displays passed to [[Silicon Graphics]], coupled with the development of [[minisupercomputer]]s (e.g., [[Convex Computer|CONVEX]] and [[Alliant Computer Systems|Alliant]]) which were affordable for well-supported MG laboratories. Silicon Graphics provided a graphics language, IrisGL, which was easier to use and more productive than the PS300 architecture. Commercial companies (e.g., Biosym, Polygen/MSI) ported their code to Silicon Graphics, and by the early 1990s, this was the "industry standard". [[Dial box]]es were often used as control devices.

[[Stereopsis|Stereoscopic displays]] were developed based on [[liquid crystal]] [[polarizer|polarized]] spectacles, and while this had been very expensive on the PS2, it now became a commodity item. A common alternative was to add a polarizable screen to the front of the display and to provide viewers with extremely cheap spectacles with [[orthogonal]] polarization for separate eyes. With projectors such as [[Barco stereoscopic projector|Barco]], it was possible to project stereoscopic display onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way molecular graphics became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.

In the last decade almost all of this technology has become commoditized. IrisGL evolved to [[OpenGL]] so that molecular graphics can be run on any machine. In 1992, Roger Sayle released his [[RasMol]] program into the public domain. RasMol contained a very high-performance molecular [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderer]] that ran on Unix/[[X Window]], and Sayle later ported this to the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platforms. The Richardsons developed [[kinemage]]s and the Mage software, which was also multi-platform.  By specifying the chemical [[MIME type]], molecular models could be served over the Internet, so that for the first time MG could be distributed at zero cost regardless of platform. In 1995, [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]'s crystallography department used this to run "Principles of Protein Structure", the first multimedia course on the Internet, which reached 100 to 200 scientists.

MG continues to see innovation that balances technology and art, and currently zero-cost or [[Open-source software|open source]] programs such as [[PyMOL]] and [[Jmol]] have very wide use and acceptance.

Recently the widespread diffusion of advanced [[graphics hardware]] has improved the rendering capabilities of the visualization tools. The capabilities of current [[shader|shading languages]] allow the inclusion of advanced graphic effects (like [[ambient occlusion]], [[shadow|cast shadows]] and [[non-photorealistic rendering]] techniques) in the [[interactive visualization]] of molecules. These graphic effects, beside being [[Attractiveness|eye candy]], can improve the comprehension of the three-dimensional shapes of the molecules. An example of the effects that can be achieved exploiting recent graphics hardware can be seen in the simple open source visualization system [[QuteMol]].

==Algorithms==

===Reference frames===
Drawing molecules requires a transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in [[Angstrom]] units) and the screen. Because many molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] it is essential that the handedness of the system (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate is out of the screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.

Molecular transformations normally require:

* scaling of the display (but not the molecule).
* translations of the molecule and objects on the screen.
* rotations about points and lines.

Conformational changes (e.g. rotations about bonds) require rotation of one part of the molecule relative to another. The programmer must decide whether a transformation on the screen reflects a change of view or a change in the molecule or its reference frame.

===Simple===
[[File:JmolStick.PNG|left|thumb|Fig. 7. Stick model of caffeine drawn in Jmol.]]
In early displays only vectors could be drawn e.g. (Fig. 7) which are easy to draw because no rendering or hidden surface removal is required.

On vector machines the lines would be smooth but on raster devices [[Bresenham's line algorithm|Bresenham's]] algorithm is used (note the "jaggies" on some of the bonds, which can be largely removed with [[Spatial anti-aliasing|antialiasing]] software.)

Atoms can be drawn as circles, but these should be sorted so that those with the largest z-coordinates (nearest the screen) are drawn last. Although imperfect, this often gives a reasonably attractive display. Other simple tricks which do not include hidden surface algorithms are:

* coloring each end of a bond with the same color as the atom to which it is attached (Fig. 7).
* drawing less than the whole length of the bond (e.g. 10%-90%) to simulate the bond sticking out of a circle.
* adding a small offset white circle within the circle for an atom to simulate reflection.

Typical [[pseudocode]] for creating Fig. 7 (to fit the molecule exactly to the screen):

 // assume:
 // atoms with x, y, z coordinates (Angstrom) and elementSymbol
 // bonds with pointers/references to atoms at ends
 // table of colors for elementTypes
 // find limits of molecule in molecule coordinates as xMin, yMin, xMax, yMax
 scale = min(xScreenMax/(xMax-xMin), yScreenMax/(yMax-yMin))
 xOffset = -xMin * scale; yOffset = -yMin * scale
 for (bond in $bonds) {
   atom0 = bond.getAtom(0)
   atom1 = bond.getAtom(1)
   x0 = xOffset+atom0.getX()*scale; y0 = yOffset+atom0.getY()*scale // (1)
   x1 = xOffset+atom1.getX()*scale; y1 = yOffset+atom1.getY()*scale // (2)
   x1 = atom1.getX();  y1 = atom1.getY()
   xMid = (x0 + x1) /2;  yMid = (y0 + y1) /2;
   color0 = ColorTable.getColor(atom0.getSymbol())
   drawLine (color0, x0, y0, xMid, yMid)
   color1 = ColorTable.getColor(atom1.getSymbol())
   drawLine (color1, x1, y1, xMid, yMid)
 }

Note that this assumes the origin is in the bottom left corner of the screen, with Y up the screen. Many graphics systems have the origin at the top left, with Y down the screen. In this case the lines (1) and (2) should have the y coordinate generation as:
  y0 = yScreenMax -(yOffset+atom0.getY()*scale) // (1)
  y1 = yScreenMax -(yOffset+atom1.getY()*scale) // (2)
Changes of this sort change the handedness of the axes so it is easy to reverse the chirality of the displayed molecule unless care is taken.

===Advanced===
For greater realism and better comprehension of the 3D structure of a molecule many [[computer graphics]] algorithms can be used. For many years molecular graphics has stressed the capabilities of graphics hardware and has required hardware-specific approaches. With the increasing power of machines on the desktop, portability is more important and programs such as [[Jmol]] have advanced algorithms that do not rely on hardware. On the other hand, recent graphics hardware is able to interactively render very complex molecule shapes with a quality that would not be possible with standard software techniques.

===Electronic Richards Box Systems===
Before [[computer graphics]] could be employed,{{when|date=June 2014}} mechanical methods were used to fit large molecules to their electron density maps. Using techniques of [[X-ray crystallography]] crystal of a substance were bombarded with [[X-ray]]s, and the diffracted beams that came off were assembled by computer using a [[Fourier transform]] into a usually blurry 3-D image of the molecule, made visible by drawing contour circles around high electron density to produce a contoured electron density map.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the earliest days, contoured electron density maps were hand drawn on large plastic sheets.  Sometimes, [[bingo chip]]s were placed on the plastic sheets where atoms were interpreted to be.

This was superseded by the Richards Box&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Frederic_M._Richards | title=Richards, Frederic M. | work=Protopedia | accessdate=13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an adjustable brass Kendrew molecular model was placed front of a 2-way mirror, behind which were plastic sheets of the electron density map.  This optically superimposed the molecular model and the electron density map.  The model was moved to within the contour lines of the superimposed map.  Then, atomic coordinates were recorded using a plumb bob and a meter stick.
Computer graphics held out the hope of vastly speeding up this process, as well as giving a clearer view in many ways.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A noteworthy attempt to overcome the low speed of graphics displays of the time{{when|date=June 2014}} took place at [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]], USA.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Dave Barry's group attempted to leapfrog the state of the art in graphics displays by making custom display hardware to display images complex enough for large-molecule crystallographic structure solution, fitting molecules to their electron-density maps.  The MMS-4 (table above) display modules were slow and expensive, so a second generation of modules was produced for the MMS-X (table above) system.

The first large molecule whose atomic structure was ''partly'' determined on a molecular computer graphics system was Transfer RNA by [[Kim Sung-Hou|Sung-Hou Kim]]'s team in 1976.&lt;ref name=Sussman1976a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sussman1976b/&gt; after initial fitting on a mechanical Richards Box. The first large molecule whose atomic structure was ''entirely'' determined on a molecular computer graphics system is said to be neurotoxin A from venom of the Philippines sea snake, by Tsernoglou, [[Gregory Petsko|Petsko]], and Tu,&lt;ref name=Tsernoglou1977a/&gt; with a statement of being first&lt;ref name=Tsernoglou1977b/&gt; in 1977. The [[Jane S. Richardson|Richardson]] group published partial atomic structure results&lt;ref name=Richardson1977/&gt; of the protein superoxide dismutase the same year, in 1977.  All of these were done using the GRIP-75 system.

Other structure fitting systems, FRODO, RING, Builder, MMS-X, etc. (table above) succeeded as well within three years{{when|date=June 2014}} and became dominant.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The reason that most of these systems succeeded in just those years,{{when|date=June 2014}} not earlier or later, and within a short timespan had to do with the arrival of commercial hardware that was powerful enough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Two things were needed and arrived at about the same time.  First, electron density maps are large and require either a computer with at least a 24-bit address space or a combination of a computer with a lesser 16-bit address space plus several years to overcome the difficulties of an address space that is smaller than the data.  The second arrival was that of interactive computer graphics displays that were fast enough to display electron-density maps, whose contour circles require the display of numerous short vectors. The first such displays were the Vector General Series 3 and the Evans and Sutherland Picture System 2, MultiPicture System, and PS-300.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Nowadays,{{when|date=June 2014}} fitting of the molecular structure to the electron density map is largely automated by algorithms with computer graphics a guide to the process.  An example is the [[XtalView]] [[XFit]] program.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Mootral''' is the name given to a programme to reduce [[methane]] emissions from [[ruminant]] animals, chiefly [[cow]]s and [[sheep]], but also [[goat]]s. Methane is a major target [[greenhouse gas]] and in the 4th protocol report of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) is recommended to increase from a x23 to x72 multiplier because of the magnitude of its effect relative to [[carbon dioxide]] and short longevity in [[Earth's atmosphere]].

== Natural feed supplement ==

The Mootral natural feed supplement is produced by Neem Biotech. The active ingredient is an organic [[Organosulfur compounds|organosulfur]] compound (normally found in [[garlic]]), Research at the [[University of Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]] has demonstrated up to a 94% reduction in methane production.

==Emission trading==
Mootral is the brand for the project, designed to certify approved methane reduction programmes in which corporates may participate and prove the provenance of their involvement.  Proceeds of [[emission trading]] credits are part donated to [[farmer]]s, who will receive Mootral without charge for adding to their cattle feed. Further surpluses return to programme participants and charities allied to greenhouse gas reduction research.

==Publicity==
Mootral has attracted much recent  attention as runner-up in the FT Global Climate Challenge and Dutch Postcode Lottery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  

Mootral is a finalist in the Shell/BBC/Newsweek World Challenge 2009 as one of the 12 most promising solutions to [[climate change]].

[[File:BassoonKeys.png |thumb|right|200px|The modern [[bassoon]] was only feasible as an instrument when the mechanical technology for creating precise key mechanisms was developed. In the 2010s, flutes, clarinets and many other woodwind instruments use similar key mechanisms.]]
'''Mechanical music technology''' is the use of any device, mechanism, machine or tool by a musician or composer to make or perform music; to [[musical composition|compose]], [[music notation|notate]], play back or [[sound recording|record]] songs or pieces; or to analyze or edit music. The earliest known applications of technology to music was prehistoric peoples' use of a tool to hand-drill holes in bones to make simple flutes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ians developed stringed instruments, such as [[harp]]s, [[lyre]]s and [[lute]]s, which required making thin strings and some type of peg system for adjusting the pitch of the strings. Ancient Egyptians also used wind instruments such as [[double clarinet]]s and percussion instruments such as [[cymbals]]. In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the lyre. Numerous instruments are referred to in the Bible, including the [[horn (instrument)|horn]], pipe, lyre, harp, and [[bagpipe]]. During Biblical times, the cornet, flute, horn, organ, pipe, and trumpet were also used. During the [[Middle Ages]], hand-written [[music notation]] was developed to write down the notes of religious [[Plainchant]] melodies; this notation enabled the [[Catholic church]] to disseminate the same chant melodies across its entire empire.

During the [[Renaissance music]] era, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made it much easier to mass-produce music (which had previously been hand-copied). This helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of pipe organs and harpsichords, and the development of a new keyboard instrument in about 1700, the piano. In the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]] (1750–1820), [[Beethoven]] added new instruments to the orchestra to create new sounds, such as the [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], [[trombone]]s, and [[Bass drum|untuned percussion]] in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]]. During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of relatively inexpensive [[sheet music]], which amateur middle class music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. In the 19th century, new instruments such as [[piston valve]]-equipped [[cornet]]s, saxophones, [[euphonium]]s, and [[Wagner tuba]]s were added to the orchestra. Many of the mechanical innovations developed for instruments in the 19th century, notably on the piano, brass and woodwinds continued to be used in the 20th and early 21st century.

===References in the Bible===
{{Main article|History of music in the biblical period}}
[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|right|170px|"David with his harp", from the [[Paris Psalter]], c. 960, [[Constantinople]].]]

According to the [[Scriptures]], [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]] was the father of harpists and organists (Gen. 4:20–21). The harp was among the chief instruments and the favorite of [[David]], and it is referred to more than fifty times in the Bible. It was used at both joyful and mournful ceremonies, and its use was "raised to its highest perfection under David" (1 Sam. 16:23). Lockyer adds that "It was the sweet music of the harp that often dispossessed Saul of his melancholy (1 Sam. 16:14–23; 18:10–11).&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} When the Jews were captive in Babylon they hung their harps up and refused to use them while in exile, earlier being part of the instruments used in the Temple (1 Kgs. 10:12). Another stringed instrument of the harp class, and one also used by the ancient Greeks, was the [[lyre]].  A similar instrument was the [[lute]], which had a large pear-shaped body, long neck, and fretted fingerboard with head screws for tuning. Coins displaying musical instruments, the [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]], were issued by the Jews during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Second Jewish Revolt]] against the Roman Empire of 132–135 AD. 
[[File:Miriams Tanz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Miriam]] and women celebrate the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] with "timbrels" (small hand drums) (from the [[Tomić Psalter]]).]]In addition there was the [[psaltery]], another stringed instrument which is referred to almost thirty times in Scripture. According to [[Josephus]], it had twelve strings and was played with a [[quill]], not with the hand. Another writer suggested that it was like a guitar, but with a flat triangular form and strung from side to side.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|49}}

Among the wind instruments used in the biblical period were the [[cornet]], wood flute, [[Horn (instrument)|horn]], organ, [[pipe (instrument)|pipe]], and early trumpet.&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;{{rp|50}} There were also silver trumpets and the double [[oboe]]. Werner concludes that from the measurements taken of the trumpets on the [[Arch of Titus]] in Rome and from coins, that "the trumpets were very high pitched with thin body and shrill sound." He adds that in ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', a manual for military organization and strategy discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], these trumpets "appear clearly capable of regulating their pitch pretty accurately, as they are supposed to blow rather complicated signals in unison."&lt;ref name=Werner&gt;Werner, Eric. ''The Sacred Bridge'', Columbia Univ. Press (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Whitcomb writes that the pair of silver trumpets were fashioned according to [[Torah|Mosaic law]] and were probably among the trophies which the [[Emperor Titus]] brought to Rome when he conquered Jerusalem. She adds that on the Arch raised to the victorious Titus, "there is a sculptured relief of these trumpets, showing their ancient form. (see photo)&lt;ref name=Whitcomb&gt;Whitcomb, Ida Prentice. ''Young People's Story of Music'', Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The flute was commonly used for festal and mourning occasions, according to Whitcomb. "Even the poorest Hebrew was obliged to employ two flute-players to perform at his wife's funeral."&lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt; The [[shofar]] (the horn of a ram) is still used for special liturgical purposes such as the [[Jewish New Year]] services in orthodox communities. As such, it is not considered a musical instrument but an instrument of theological symbolism which has been intentionally kept to its primitive character. In ancient times it was used for warning of danger, to announce the new moon or beginning of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], or to announce the death of a notable. "In its strictly ritual usage it carried the cries of the multitude to God," writes Werner.&lt;ref name=Werner/&gt;{{rp|12}}

Among the percussion instruments were [[Bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbals]], [[sistrum]], [[tabret]], hand drums, and [[tambourines]]. The tabret, or timbrel, was a small hand-drum used for festive occasions, and was considered a woman's instrument. In modern times it was often used by the Salvation Army. According to the Bible, when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and [[The Exodus|crossed the Red Sea]], ''"[[Miriam]] took a timbrel in her hands; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dance."''&lt;ref name=Lockyer/&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Hydraulis 001.jpg|thumb|The ''[[hydraulis]]'' or "water organ". Note the curved trumpet, called the ''bukanē'' by the Greeks and, later, ''cornu'' by the Romans.]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], instruments in all music can be divided into three categories,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; based on how sound is produced: string, wind, and percussion. The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece:

*the [[lyre]]: a strummed and occasionally [[plucked string instrument]], essentially a hand-held [[zither]] built on a tortoise-shell frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song.
*the [[kithara]], also a strummed string instrument, more complicated than the [[lyre]]. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the [[sounding box]] at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a [[plectrum]]. The strings were tunable by adjusting wooden wedges along the cross-bar.
* the ''[[aulos]]'', usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds.
* the [[Pan pipes]], also known as panflute and [[syrinx]] (Greek συριγξ), (so-called for the nymph who was changed into a reed in order to hide from [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top).
* the [[hydraulis]], a keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of Vitruvius &lt;ref&gt;''De Architectura'' x, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Heron of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;''Pneumatica'', I, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the device by which the instrument was supplied with air. A well-preserved model in pottery was found at Carthage in 1885. Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air, and causing a steady supply of air to the pipes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Virgil makes numerous references to the trumpet. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis (water organ) and trumpet all found their way into the [[Ancient Roman music|music of ancient Rome]].

===Ancient Rome===

The Romans may have borrowed the Greek method{{Ref|Ulrich and Pisk2}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} of 'enchiriadic notation' to record their music, if they used any notation at all. Four letters (in English notation 'A', 'G', 'F' and 'C') indicated a series of four succeeding tones. Rhythm signs, written above the letters, indicated the duration of each note. [[Roman art]] depicts various woodwinds, [[brass instrument|"brass"]], percussion and [[stringed instruments]].{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar313}}  Roman-style instruments are found in parts of the Empire where they did not originate, and indicate that music was among the aspects of Roman culture that spread throughout the provinces.

Roman instruments include:
*The [[Roman tuba|Roman ''tuba'']] was a long, straight bronze trumpet with a detachable, conical mouthpiece. Extant examples are about 1.3 metres long, and have a cylindrical bore from the mouthpiece to the point where the bell flares abruptly,{{Ref|Bonanni}} similar to the modern straight trumpet seen in presentations of 'period music'. Since there were no valves, the ''tuba'' was capable only of a single [[overtone]] series.{{Ref|Pierce}} In the military, it was used for "[[bugle call]]s". The ''tuba'' is also depicted in art such as [[Roman mosaic|mosaics]] accompanying games ''([[ludi]])'' and spectacle events.
*The ''[[cornu (horn)|cornu]]'' (Latin "horn") was a long tubular metal wind instrument that curved around the musician's body, shaped rather like an uppercase ''G''.  It had a conical bore (again like a French horn) and a conical mouthpiece. It may be hard to distinguish from the ''[[buccina]]''. The ''cornu'' was used for military signals and on parade.{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar314}} The ''[[cornicen]]'' was a military signal officer who translated orders into calls. Like the ''tuba'', the ''cornu'' also appears as accompaniment for public events and spectacle entertainments.
*The ''tibia'' (Greek ''[[aulos]] – αὐλός''), usually double, had two double-reed (as in a modern oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band ''capistrum'' to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips.{{Ref|Bonanni2}} 
*The ''[[askaules]]'' – a [[bagpipe]].
*Versions of the modern flute and [[panpipes]].
*The [[lyre]], borrowed from the Greeks, was not a [[harp]], but instead had a sounding body of wood or a tortoise shell covered with skin, and arms of animal horn or wood, with strings stretched from a cross bar to the sounding body.{{Ref|Bonanni3}}
*The ''[[cithara]]'' was the premier musical instrument of ancient Rome and was played both in popular and elevated forms of music. Larger and heavier than a lyre, the cithara was a loud, sweet and piercing instrument with precision tuning ability.
*The [[lute]] ([[pandura]] or [[monochord]]) was known by several names among the Greeks and Romans. In construction, the lute differs from the lyre in having fewer strings stretched over a solid neck or [[fingerboard|fret-board]], on which the strings can be [[fret|stopped]] to produce [[interval (music)|graduated]] notes. Each lute string is thereby capable of producing a greater range of notes than a lyre string.{{Ref|Higgins and Winnington-Ingram}} Although long-necked lutes are depicted in art from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2340–2198 BC, and also occur in Egyptian iconography, the lute in the Greco-Roman world was far less common than the lyre and cithara. The lute of the medieval West is thought to owe more to the Arab [[oud]], from which its name derives (''al ʿūd'').{{Ref|Spring}}
* The hydraulic pipe organ ''([[hydraulis]])'', which worked by water pressure, was "one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity".{{Ref|Ginsberg-Klar316}} Essentially, the air to the pipes that produce the sound comes from a mechanism of a wind-chest connected by a pipe to a dome; air is pumped in to compress water, and the water rises in the dome, compressing the air and causing a steady supply to reach the pipes{{Ref|Williams}}{{Page needed|date=February 2010}} (also see [[Pipe organ#History]]). The ''hydraulis'' accompanied [[gladiator]] contests and events in the arena, as well as stage performances. 
*Variations of a hinged wooden or metal device called a [[scabellum]] used to beat time. Also, there were various rattles, bells and [[tambourine]]s.
*Drum and percussion instruments like [[timpani]] and castanets, the Egyptian sistrum, and brazen pans, served various musical and other purposes in ancient Rome, including backgrounds for rhythmic dance, celebratory rites like those of the Bacchantes and military uses. 
*The [[sistrum]] was a rattle consisting of rings strung across the cross-bars of a metal frame, which was often used for ritual purposes.
*''Cymbala'' (Lat. plural of ''cymbalum'', from the Greek ''kymbalon'') were small cymbals: metal discs with concave centres and turned rims, used in pairs which were clashed together.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Gregorian chant.gif|frame|A sample of notation for the [[Kyrie|Kýrie Eléison]] XI (Orbis Factor), which is from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'', which originated in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi. ''Gregorian Chant''. Indiana University Press, 1958. p. 417&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media:Kyrie XI (Orbis Factor) sample.ogg|Listen]] to it interpreted.]]
During the [[Medieval Music]] era (476 to 1400) the [[plainchant]] tunes used by monks for religious songs were primarily monophonic (a single melody line, with no harmony parts) and transmitted by oral tradition ("by ear"). The earliest Medieval music did not have any kind of notational system for writing down melodies. As Rome tried to centralize the various chants across vast distances of its empire, which stretched from Europe to North Africa, a form of music notation was needed to write down the melodies. So long as the church had to rely on teaching people chant melodies "by ear", it limited the number of people who could be taught. As well, when songs are learned by ear, variations and changes naturally slip in.

Various signs written above the chant texts, called ''[[neumes]]'' were introduced. These little signs indicated to the singer whether the melody went up in pitch or down in pitch. By the ninth century, it was firmly established as the primary method of musical notation. The next development in musical notation was "heighted neumes", in which neumes were carefully placed at different heights in relation to each other. This allowed the neumes to give a rough indication of the size of a given interval (e.g., a small interval like a tone or a large interval like a sixth) as well as the direction (up in pitch or down in pitch).

At first the little dots were just placed in the space about the words. However, this method made it hard to determine what pitch a song started on, or when a song was returning to the same pitch. This quickly led to one or two lines, each representing a particular note, being placed on the music with all of the neumes relating back to them, and being placed on or above the lines. The line or lines acted as a reference point to help the singer gauge which notes were higher or lower. At first, these lines had no particular meaning and instead had a letter placed at the beginning indicating which note was represented. However, the lines indicating middle C and the F a fifth below slowly became most common. The completion of the four-line staff is usually credited to [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d' Arezzo]] (c. 1000–1050), one of the most important musical theorists of the Middle Ages. It should be noted that the neumatic notational system, even in its fully developed state, did not clearly define any kind of rhythm for the singing of notes. Singers were expected to be able to improvise the rhythm, using established traditions and norms.

[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|140 px|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c.1310–1320]]
Instruments used to perform medieval music include the early flute, which was made of wood and which did not have any metal keys or pads. Flutes of this era could be made as a side-blown or end-blown instrument; the wooden [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the related instrument called the [[gemshorn]]; and the [[pan flute]]. Medieval music used many plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]], [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]], [[gittern]] and [[psaltery]]. The [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], similar in structure to the [[psaltery]] and [[zither]], were originally plucked, but became struck by hammers in the 14th century after the arrival of new technology that made metal strings possible.

The bowed [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was the first recorded European bowed string instrument. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] of the 9th century (d. 911) cited the [[Byzantine lyra]] as a bowed instrument equivalent to the Arab [[rabāb]] and typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of [[harp]] or [[lyre]]) and the ''salandj'' (probably a [[bagpipe]]).&lt;ref name=Kartomi124&gt;{{harvnb|Kartomi|(1990)|p=124.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hurdy-gurdy]] was a mechanical violin using a rosined wooden wheel attached to a crank to "bow" its strings. Instruments without sound boxes like the [[jaw harp]] were also popular in the time. Early versions of the organ, [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]), and [[trombone]] (called the [[sackbut]]) existed in the medieval era.

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) saw the development of many new technologies that affected the performance and distribution of songs and musical pieces. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was laboriously hand-copied). The increased availability of printed sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger geographic area. One limiting factor to the wider dissemination of musical styles was that [[monk]]s, [[nuns]], [[aristocrat]]s and professional musicians and singers were among the few people who could read music.

Mechanical plate engraving was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. Copper was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many instruments originated during the Renaissance. Some instruments used during the Renaissance were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously in the medieval era. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were part of [[guild]]s, which kept playing techniques secret. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played included:

*[[Slide trumpet]]: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary.
*[[Cornett]]: Made of wood and was played like the recorder, but blown like a trumpet.
*Trumpet: Early trumpets from the Renaissance era had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the [[overtone series]]. This limited the types of melodies that Renaissance trumpets could play. They were also made in different sizes.
*[[Sackbut]]: A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century

Stringed instruments included:
*[[Viol]]: This hollow, wooden stringed instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly had six strings. It was usually played with a bow.
*[[Lyre]]: Its construction is similar to a small [[harp]], although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum (or "pick"). Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Some newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
*[[Hurdy-gurdy]]: (Also known as the "wheel fiddle"), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its "drone strings" which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
*[[Gittern]] and [[Mandore (instrument)|mandore]]: these instruments were used throughout Europe. They were the forerunners of modern plucked string instruments including the [[mandolin]] and acoustic guitar.

Percussion instruments included:
*[[Tambourine]]: The tambourine is a frame drum equipped with jingles that produce a sound when the drum is struck.
*[[Jew's harp]]: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with ones mouth.

Woodwind instruments included:

*[[Shawm]]: A typical shawm is keyless and about a foot long, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were commonly made of wood and more expensive models had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular [[double reed]] instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.

[[File:Barocke Blockflöten.png|thumb|right|Renaissance recorders]]
*[[Reed pipe]]: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the early predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.
*[[Hornpipe (musical instrument)|Hornpipe]]: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
*[[Bagpipe]]/Bladderpipe: It used a bag made out of sheep or goat skin that would provide air pressure for a pipe. When its player takes a breath, the player only needs to squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve.  The reed is located inside the long metal mouthpiece, known as a bocal.
*[[Panpipe]]: Designed to have sixteen wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
*[[Transverse flute]]: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows in the side and holds the flute to the right side.
*[[Recorder (instrument)|Recorder]]: It uses a whistle mouth piece, which is a beak shaped mouth piece, as its main source of sound production. It is usually made of wood, with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.

During the [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] (ca. 1600–1750), technologies for keyboard instruments developed, which led to improvements in the designs of [[pipe organ]]s and [[harpsichord]]s, and to the development of the first pianos. During the Baroque period, organ builders developed new types of pipes and reeds that created new tonal colors (timbres and sounds). Organ builders fashioned new stops that imitated various instruments, such as the [[viol|viola da gamba]] stop. The Baroque period is often thought of as organ building's "golden age," as virtually every important refinement to the instrument was brought to a peak. Builders such as [[Arp Schnitger]], Jasper Johannsen, [[Zacharias Hildebrandt]] and [[Gottfried Silbermann]] constructed instruments that displayed both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger's organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large [[Pedal keyboard|Pedal]] and Rückpositiv divisions.

Harpsichord builders in the [[Southern Netherlands]] built instruments with two keyboard (two manuals) which could be used for [[transposition (music)|transposition]]. These Flemish instruments served as the model for Baroque-era harpsichord construction in other nations.  In France, the double keyboards were adapted to control different choirs (groups) of strings, making a more musically flexible instrument (e.g., the upper manual could be set to a quiet lute stop, while the lower manual could be set to a stop with multiple string choirs, for a louder sound; this enabled the harpsichorist to have two dynamics and tone colours from one instrument). Another approach that could be used on a two manual harpischord would be to use a coupler to make one manual play two choirs of strings (e.g., an 8' set of strings and a 16' set of strings an octave lower), so that this manual could be used for a loud solo sound, and then having another manual set to trigger only one manual, creating an [[accompaniment]] volume. Instruments from the peak of the French tradition, by makers such as the [[Blanchet (harpsichord makers)|Blanchet family]] and [[Pascal Taskin]], are among the most widely admired of all harpsichords, and are frequently used as models for the construction of modern instruments.  In England, the [[Kirkman (harpsichord makers)|Kirkman]] and [[Burkat Shudi|Shudi]] firms produced sophisticated harpsichords of great power and sonority.  German builders extended the sound repertoire of the instrument by adding [[eight foot pitch|sixteen foot]] choirs, adding to the lower register and [[eight foot pitch|two-foot]] choirs, which added to the upper register.

The piano was invented during the Baroque era by the expert harpsichord maker [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]]. Cristofori invented the piano at some point before 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the clavichord allowed expressive control of volume and sustain, it was too quiet for large performances. The harpsichord produced a sufficiently loud sound, but offered little expressive control over each note. The piano offered the best of both, combining loudness with dynamic control.

Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would [[Damping|damp]] the sound. Moreover, the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat the same note rapidly. Cristofori's piano [[Action (piano)|action]] was a model for the many approaches to piano actions that followed. Cristofori's early instruments were much louder and had more [[sustain]] than the clavichord. The [[harpsichord]] continued to be used in performances during the first 50 years of the piano's existence; however, after 1750, the harpsichord was gradually phased out of orchestras and small music groups.

===Classicism===

From about 1790 onward, the Mozart-era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound, and made possible by the ongoing [[Industrial Revolution]] with resources such as high-quality steel [[piano wire]] for [[Strings (music)|strings]], and precision [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] for the production of [[Cast iron|iron frames]]. Over time, the tonal range of the piano was also increased from the five [[octave]]s of Mozart's day to the 7-plus range found on modern pianos.
Early technological progress owed much to the firm of [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood]]. [[John Broadwood]] joined with another Scot, Robert Stodart, and a Dutchman, [[Americus Backers]], to design a piano in the harpsichord case—the origin of the "grand". They achieved this in about 1777. They quickly gained a reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of their instruments, with Broadwood constructing ones that were progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed.

They sent pianos to both [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a [[Interval (music)|fifth (interval)]] during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The [[Vienna|Viennese]] makers similarly followed these trends; however the two schools used different piano actions: Broadwoods were more robust, Viennese instruments were more sensitive.

The [[cornet]], a piston-valved brass instrument related to the trumpet, could not have been developed without the improvement of [[piston valve]]s by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] and [[Friedrich Blühmel]]. In the early 19th century these two instrument makers almost simultaneously invented the valves still used today. [[Beethoven]]'s instrumentation for orchestra added [[piccolo]], [[contrabassoon]], and [[trombone]]s to the triumphal finale of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] (1804–1808). A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver effects of "storm" and "sunshine" in the composer's dramatic [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth Symphony]]. Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion in his [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] expanded the sound of the orchestra.

===Romanticism===
During the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or in [[chamber music]] groups, such as [[string quartet]]s. Since mass-market sheet music was relatively inexpensive, this enabled composers and songwriters to distribute their songs and musical pieces to a larger audience and over a larger geographic area. While the widespread dissemination of sheet music helped to spread musical styles across a larger area, the impact was nevertheless restricted to the socioeconomic segments that could read music, [[sightsinging|sing melodies from sheet music]] and own pianos and other musical instruments–namely the middle class and the upper class. Individuals from lower socioeconomic segments were only indirectly able to benefit from this wider dissemination of musical styles (i.e., by hearing new songs performed by professional musicians in [[brothel]]s or [[tavern]]s), as poor people could typically not read music or own pianos or other expensive instruments.

New instruments such as the saxophone began to appear in some 19th-century orchestra scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]]. The [[euphonium]] was used in a few late Romantic and works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''. The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornet]]s appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The piano continued to undergo technological developments in the Romantic era, up until the 1860s. By the 1820s, the center of piano building innovation had shifted to Paris, where the [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]] firm manufactured pianos used by [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the Érard firm manufactured those used by [[Franz Liszt]]. In 1821, [[Sébastien Érard]] invented the double escapement [[Action (piano)|action]], which incorporated a ''repetition lever'' (also called the ''balancier'') that permitted repeating a note even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position. This facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes, a musical device exploited by Liszt. When the invention became public, as revised by [[Henri Herz]], the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos, and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced.

Other improvements of the piano mechanism included the use of thick felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather or cotton. Felt, which was first introduced by [[Jean-Henri Pape]] in 1826, was a more consistent material, permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased. The [[Sostenuto|sostenuto pedal]], invented in 1844 by [[Jean-Louis Boisselot]] and copied by the [[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]] firm in 1874, allowed a wider range of effects.

One innovation that helped create the powerful, loud sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame. Also called the "plate", the iron frame sits atop the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string [[Tension (physics)|tension]] that can exceed 20 tons in a grand piano. The single-piece [[cast iron]] frame was patented in 1825 in [[Boston]] by [[Alpheus Babcock]],&lt;ref name="isacoff"&gt;Isacoff (2012, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Hervé) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and Érard). The increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker, tenser, and more numerous strings, which further increased the strength of the instrument's tone. In 1834, the Webster &amp; Horsfal firm of [[Birmingham]] brought out a form of piano wire made from [[cast steel]]; according to Dolge it was "so superior to the iron wire that the English firm soon had a monopoly."&lt;ref name="Dolge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolge|first1=Alfred |title=Pianos and Their Makers: A Comprehensive History of the Piano Volume 1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0486228568|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvYgWaXfcIYC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important advances included changes to the way the piano is strung, such as the use of a "choir" of three strings rather than two for all but the lowest notes, which made the piano louder and the implementation of an over-strung scale, in which the strings are placed in two separate planes, each with its own [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] height. The mechanical action structure of the [[upright piano]] was invented in London, England in 1826 by [[Robert Wornum]], and upright models became the most popular model, also amplifying the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri, ed.|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93796-2|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upright pianos were more compact than grand pianos, and less expensive, so the invention of the upright piano helped make the piano an even more important instrument in private homes (for amateur music-making); in schools; in rehearsal halls; and in some types of performance venues.

[[File:Ocreae of a Persicaria maculosa 2006-aug-10 Gothenburg Sweden.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ochrea on a [[Persicaria maculosa|redshank]] stem]]

An '''ochrea''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''ocrea'', [[greave]] or protective legging), also spelled '''ocrea''', is a plant structure formed of [[stipule]]s fused into a sheath surrounding the stem, and is typically found in the [[Polygonaceae]]. 

In [[Arecaceae|palms]] it denotes an extension of the leaf sheath beyond the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] insertion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2357">In [[computational complexity theory]], the '''padding argument''' is a tool to conditionally prove that if some [[complexity classes]] are equal, then some other bigger classes are also equal.

== Example ==

The proof that  [[P (complexity)|P]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[NP (complexity)|NP]] implies [[EXP]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[NEXP]] uses "padding". &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{EXP} \subseteq \mathrm{NEXP}&lt;/math&gt; by definition, so it suffices to show &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{NEXP} \subseteq \mathrm{EXP}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let ''L'' be a language in NEXP.  Since ''L'' is in NEXP, there is a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] ''M'' that decides ''L'' in time &lt;math&gt;2^{n^c}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c''.  Let 

: &lt;math&gt;L'=\{x1^{2^{|x|^c}} \mid x \in L\},&lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''1'' is a symbol not occurring in ''L''.  First we show that &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; is in NP, then we will use the deterministic polynomial time machine given by P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP to show that ''L'' is in EXP.

&lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; can be [[Decision problem|decided]] in non-deterministic polynomial time as follows. Given input &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;, verify that it has the form &lt;math&gt;x' = x1^{2^{|x|^c}}&lt;/math&gt; and reject if it does not.  If it has the correct form, simulate ''M(x)''.  The simulation takes non-deterministic &lt;math&gt;2^{|x|^c}&lt;/math&gt; time, which is polynomial in the size of the input, &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;.  So, &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; is in NP.  By the assumption P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP, there is also a deterministic machine ''DM'' that decides &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; in polynomial time.  We can then decide ''L'' in deterministic exponential time as follows.  Given input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, simulate &lt;math&gt;DM(x1^{2^{|x|^c}})&lt;/math&gt;. This takes only exponential time in the size of the input, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  

The &lt;math&gt;1^d&lt;/math&gt; is called the "padding" of the language ''L''. This type of argument is also sometimes used for space complexity classes, alternating classes, and bounded alternating classes.

'''Pan Britannica Industries Ltd'''  ('''PBI''') was a small company which had 400 employees. It was a household and agrochemical formulation company based at Britannica House, Stewardstone Road, [[Waltham Cross]]  and with a distribution presence in [[Wisbech]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. PBI was, in common with many other UK household names, both a manufacturer and marketing organisation for both agricultural and horticultural products.

PBI produced many agro-chemical formulations that were popular with farmers in many parts of the globe. However It was best known for its product [[Baby Bio]], a liquid plant food that came in a notable small perfume-shaped bottle. Other major products by PBI are the Expert range of books, such as the ''Garden Expert'', ''House Plant Expert'', ''Greenhouse Expert'' etc. written by, [[D.G. Hessayon|Dr D.G. Hessayon]], who later became chairman of PBI. The motto of these books is "''Easy-to-follow advice and information you can trust''". With this in mind they are colourful, informative, and contain accurate product information and literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourhouseplants.com/guides/hessayon&lt;/ref&gt; The Company adopted this approach throughout all its products and brands. Such an approach was in no small way attributable to Dr. Hessayon, who was highly regarded within and outside both Agriculture and Horticulture, for many years.

The company was sold to the [[Sumitomo]] corporation in the late eighties, but continued to be run largely by the same management. It is now part of the [[Bayer]] Corporation, which markets the best of its brands. The Waltham Abbey site has been redeveloped into a housing estate. There is still a presence in Waltham Cross called PBI Home &amp; Garden Ltd in the same building, now renamed Durkan house.

Similar UK operations were run by ICI Agriculture, Murphy Chemical Co, Allbright &amp; Wilson (Farm Protection), Shell Chemical Company, BP and Fisons. Some small scale horticultural products were also packaged at the Waltham Abbey plant, including Draza Slug Pellets for Bayer Agriculture (now owner of the Bio Trade Mark). Companies such as [[Elanco]], [[DuPont]], [[Rohm &amp; Haas]] and [[Stauffer]] actually manufactured, packaged, and labelled the vast majority of Chemical marketed by PBI.

Many of the products which PBI marketed gave it, a very small player, a strong market presence on the global agrochemicals scene. Due to legislation, many of the products have been discontinued in [[Western world|the west]] due to long-term human health issues, but were considered safe and manufactured by other companies around the world. Now only the benign formulas like Baby Bio have continued availability.

Dr Hessayon still writes Expert books but these are now published by [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]].

== Cancer allegations ==

The company did have one negative brush with fame when its formulation plant in Waltham Abbey was alleged to be at the centre and therefore the cause of a cancer hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335218423.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was highlighted by Storyline, an investigative television programme by [[Carlton Television]], in early 1993. Reports of an unusual occurrence of cancer around the plant and subsequent legal action taken by the residents were the basis for this programme, which was followed by several articles in the press.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/inquiry-is-sought-over-pesticide-cancer-fears-1470365.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were rejected by the then managing director, Mr. Jeremy Tear. No official body or agency then charged with the oversight of activities at the Waltham Abbey site had raised any concerns connected with the activity or safety procedures at the plant.

[[File:Sifam.type34A.British.ppm.jpg|thumb|A typical British quasi-PPM. Each division between '1' and '7' is exactly four decibels and '6' is the intended maximum level.]]

A '''peak programme meter''' (PPM) is an [[measuring instrument|instrument]] used in [[professional audio]] to indicate the level of an [[Sound|audio]] [[signal (information theory)|signal]].

There are many different kinds of PPM. They fall into broad categories:
*'''True peak programme meter'''. This shows the peak level of the waveform no matter how brief its duration.
*'''Quasi peak programme meter (QPPM)'''. This only shows the true level of the peak if it exceeds a certain duration, typically a few milliseconds. On peaks of shorter duration, it indicates less than the true peak level. The extent of the shortfall is determined by the 'integration time'.
*'''Sample peak programme meter (SPPM)'''. This is a PPM for digital audio—which shows only peak sample values, not the true waveform peaks (which may fall between samples and be up to 3&amp;nbsp;dB higher in amplitude). It may have either a 'true' or a 'quasi' integration characteristic.
*'''Over-sampling peak programme meter'''. This is a sample PPM in which the signal has first been over-sampled, typically by a factor of four, to alleviate the problem with a basic sample PPM.

In professional usage, where consistent level measurements are needed across an industry, audio level meters often comply with a detailed formal standard. This ensures that all compliant meters indicate the same level for a given audio signal. The principal standard for PPMs is [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60268-10. It describes two different quasi-PPM designs that have roots in meters originally developed in the 1930s for the [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] networks of Germany (Type I) and the United Kingdom (Type II). The term Peak Programme Meter usually refers to these IEC-specified types and similar designs. Though originally designed for monitoring analogue audio signals, these PPMs are now also used with digital audio.

PPMs do not provide effective [[loudness monitoring]]. Newer types of meter do, and there is now a push within the broadcasting industry to move away from traditional level meters such as those featured in this article to two new types: loudness meters based on EBU Tech. 3341 and [[oversampling]] true PPMs. The former would be used to standardise broadcast loudness to −23 LUFS and the latter to prevent digital [[clipping (audio)|clipping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Design characteristics ==
[[Image:Alice Soundtech PPM 306.jpg|thumb|PPMs need active driver electronics - shown here mounted on back of meter movement]]

=== Display technologies ===
In common with many other types of audio level meter, PPMs originally used electro-mechanical displays. These took the form of moving-coil panel meters or [[mirror galvanometer]]s with demanding 'ballistics': the key requirement being that the indicated level should rise as quickly as possible with negligible [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]]. These displays require active driver electronics.

Nowadays PPMs are often implemented as 'bargraph' incremental displays using solid-state illuminated segments in a vertical or horizontal array. For these, IEC 60268-10 requires a minimum of 100 segments and a resolution better than 0.5&amp;nbsp;dB at the higher levels.

Many operators prefer the moving-coil meter type of display in which a needle moves in an arc, because an angular movement is easier for the human eye to monitor than the linear movement of a bargraph.&lt;ref name="Emmett"/&gt;

PPMs can also be implemented in software—in a general-purpose computer or by a dedicated device that inserts a PPM image into a picture signal for display on a picture monitor.

=== Level definitions ===

A variety of terms such as 'line-up level' and 'operating level' exist, and their meaning may vary from place to place. In an attempt bring clarity to level definitions in the context of programme transmission from one country to another, where different technical practices may apply, ITU-R Rec. BS.645 defined three reference levels: Measurement Level (ML), Alignment Level (AL) and Permitted Maximum Level (PML). This document shows the reading corresponding to these levels for several types of meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.645-2-199203-I/en | work=ITU-R Rec. BS.645 | title=Test signals and metering to be used on international sound programme connections | publisher=[[International Telecommunications Union]] | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alignment Level is the level of a steady sine-wave alignment tone. Permitted Maximum Level refers to the permitted maximum ''meter indication'' that operators should aim for on speech, music etc., not tone.

=== Scales and scale marks ===
PPMs often use white-on-black displays, to minimise eyestrain especially with extended periods of use.

PPMs are usually calibrated in one of these ways:
* In decibels relative to Alignment Level (e.g., Nordic, EBU)
* In decibels relative to Permitted Maximum Level (e.g., DIN, ABC, SABC)
* In decibels relative to 0 dBu (e.g., CBC)
* In decibels relative to 0 dBFS (e.g., IEC 60268-18)
* In simple numerical marks that can be correlated with any of the above (e.g., British)

Whichever scheme is used, usually there is a scale mark corresponding to Alignment Level.

Most PPMs have an approximately logarithmic scale, i.e., roughly linear in decibels, to provide useful indications over a wide [[dynamic range]].

Quasi-PPMs use a short [[integral|integration]] time so they can register peaks longer than a few [[second|milliseconds]] in duration. In the original context of AM radio broadcasting in the 1930s, overloads due to shorter peaks were considered unimportant on the grounds that the human ear could not detect [[distortion]] due to momentary clipping. Ignoring momentary clipping made it possible to increase average modulation levels. In modern digital audio practice, where quality standards are hopefully much higher than AM radio in the 1930s, clipping of even short peaks is usually regarded as something to avoid.

On typical, real-world audio signals, a quasi-PPM under-reads the true peak by 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="Yonge_1"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, quasi-PPMs are still widely used in the digital age because of their usefulness in achieving programme balance. Overloads are avoided by allowing, typically, 9&amp;nbsp;dB of [[headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] when controlling digital levels with a quasi-PPM.

The extent to which quasi-PPMs show less than the true amplitude of momentary peaks is determined by the 'integration time'. This is defined by IEC 60268-10 as, "...the duration of a burst of sinusoidal voltage of 5000 Hz at reference level which results in an indication 2 dB below reference indication."&lt;ref name="iec60268-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation | title = The E.B.U. Standard Peak-Programme Meter for the Control of International Transmissions | url = http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/tech/tech3205.pdf | work = EBU Tech. 3205-E | publisher = [[European Broadcasting Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard also contains tables showing the difference between indicated and true peaks for tone bursts of other durations. The longer the integration time, the greater the difference between the true and indicated peaks.

In earlier standards, different methods of measurement and criteria were used, such as 0.2 [[Neper]] or 80% voltage instead of 2&amp;nbsp;dB, but the practical difference between them was small.&lt;ref name="j.15"/&gt;

A Type I PPM has an integration time of 5 milliseconds and a Type II PPM has an integration time of 10 milliseconds.

=== Return time ===
All PPMs have a return time much longer than the integration time, to give the operator more time to see the peaks and reduce eye strain. Type I PPMs fall back 20&amp;nbsp;dB in 1.7 seconds. Type II PPMs fall back 24&amp;nbsp;dB in 2.8 seconds.

== History and national variants ==
The PPM was originally developed, independently in both Germany and the United Kingdom, for use in [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] networks in the 1930s. These were [[quasi-peak]] meters with some features in common but otherwise substantially different. They are superior to earlier types of meter that were not good for monitoring peak audio levels.

=== IEC 60268-10 Type I PPM ===

==== Germany ====
[[Image:Lichtzeiger Instrument Siemens &amp; Halske.jpg|thumb|left|German "Lichtzeigerinstrument" ([[Siemens &amp; Halske]] 1950)]]
[[Image:Sifam Type 32A DIN scale PPM.jpg|thumb|A DIN scale quasi-PPM as widely used in Northern Europe.]]
[[Image:Sifam Type 24A Nordic scale PPM.jpg|thumb|A Nordic scale quasi-PPM as used in Scandinavia.]]
In about 1936 and 1937, German broadcasters developed a peak programme meter with a mirror galvanometer known as a "Lichtzeigerinstrument" (light pointer) for the display. The system consisted of a drive amplifier (e.g., [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] types U21 and U71) and a separate display unit (e.g., ARD types J47 and J48).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=ARD Geräteverzeichnis (List of Equipment) | publisher=[[Institut für Rundfunktechnik]] | date=March 1959 | url=http://www.irt.de/IRT/publikationen/braunbuch/Geraeteverzeichnis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stereo version, known as a "Doppel-Lichtzeigerinstrument" contained two mirror galvanometer displays in a single housing. Such displays were still used until the 1970s, when solid-state bargraph displays became the norm.

The design became standardised as DIN 45406. It evolved into the Type I meter in IEC 60268-10 and it is still known colloquially as a DIN PPM. Compared to the Type II designs it has faster integration and return times, a much wider dynamic range and a semi-logarithmic scale, and is calibrated in dB relative to Permitted Maximum Level. It remains in use in much of northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Yonge_2"/&gt;

In German broadcasting, the nominal analogue signal corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level was standardised by ARD at 1.55 volts (+6 dBu), and this is the usual sensitivity of a DIN-type PPM for an indication of 0&amp;nbsp;dB. Alignment Level (−3 dBu) is shown on the meter by a scale mark at −9.

==== Scandinavia ====
In Scandinavia a variant of the DIN PPM known as 'Nordic' is used. It has the same integration and return times but a different scale, with 'TEST' corresponding to Alignment Level (0 dBu) and +9 corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level (+9 dBu).&lt;ref name="Emmett"&gt;{{citation | title=Audio levels — in the new world of digital systems | first=John | last=Emmett | work=EBU Technical Review | publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] | date=January 2003 | url=http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/techreview/trev_293-emmett.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yonge_2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[Image:spliced.oldppm.jpg|thumb|left|An old-style British PPM with right-hand mechanical zero, as used with [[vacuum tube|valve]] equipment (switched off when photo taken).]]
The [[BBC]] used a number of methods of measuring programme volume in its early years, including the 'volume indicator' and 'slide-back voltmeter'.

By 1932, when the BBC moved to purpose-built facilities in [[Broadcasting House]], the first audio meter called a 'programme meter' was introduced. It was developed by Charles Holt-Smith of the [[BBC Research|Research Department]] and became known as the 'Smith meter'. This was the first meter with white markings on a black background. It was driven by a circuit that gave a roughly [[logarithm]]ic transfer characteristic, so it could be calibrated in [[decibels]]. The overall characteristics were the product of the driver circuit and the movement's ballistics.

The first of the PPMs was designed by C. G. Mayo, also of the BBC's Research Department. It came into service in 1938. It kept the Smith meter's logarithmic, [[white-on-black]] display, and included all the key design features that are still used to this day with only slight modification: [[rectification (electricity)|full-wave rectification]], fast integration and slow return times, and a simple scale calibrated from 1 to 7.

The integration and return times were determined after a series of experiments. At first it was intended to create a true peak meter to prevent transmitters from exceeding 100% modulation. A prototype meter was created with an integration time of about 1 ms. It was found that the ear is tolerant of distortion lasting a few ms, and that a 'registration time' of 4 ms would suffice. The return time had to be a compromise between a rapid return, which was tiring to the eye, and a slow return, which made control difficult. It was decided that the meter should take between 2s and 3s to drop back 26&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref name="Pawley"&gt;{{cite book

The BBC PPM became the subject of several formal standards: BS 4297:1968 (superseded); BS5428:Part 9:1981 (superseded) and then BS 6840-10:1991. The text of the latter is identical to the Type IIa PPM in IEC 60268-10:1991.&lt;ref name="Yonge_2"&gt;{{cite journal

Alignment level (0 dBu) and Permitted Maximum Level (+8 dBu) correspond to scale marks '4' and '6' respectively.

The BBC PPM was adopted by commercial broadcasters in the UK. Other organisations around the world, including the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] used the same dynamics but with slightly different scales.&lt;ref name="Yonge_2"/&gt;

Modern British PPMs have a 4&amp;nbsp;dB spacing between the scale marks. Older designs had a 6&amp;nbsp;dB spacing between '1' and '2'. This discrepancy can sometimes also be found at the equivalent position on the derived CBC and ABC scales.

From its inception in 1939 until 2009, the PPM display was available in the form of an electro-mechanical, moving-coil meter movement with a demanding ballistic specification. For many years these were manufactured by Ernest Turner and Company,&lt;ref name="Pawley"/&gt; and in later years by Sifam, based in Torquay. In 2009 Sifam announced it would end production of the Type 74 dual-needle meter movement. In 2010 this was followed by the end of all PPM meter movement manufacturing by Sifam. Three major users - Bryant Unlimited, Canford Audio and TSL - placed final orders with Sifam for large stocks of the meters to supply manufacturing and maintenance activities for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.prosoundnewseurope.com/website-content/full/the-ppm-hits-the-end-stop | title=The PPM hits the end stop | work=Pro Sound News Europe |date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, twin-needle PPMs are sometimes used for stereo. Red and green needles are used for left and right. This colour convention comes from [[port and starboard]] navigation lights, in accordance with an ancient BBC in-joke about Broadcasting House resembling a battleship. White and yellow needles are used for sum and difference (M and S). A more recent variation is to use a black needle with a dayglo orange tip for S instead of yellow.

The sensitivity of the S indication can be increased on some meter installations by 20&amp;nbsp;dB; this is to aid line-up procedures, e.g., of stereo mic pairs, or the azimuth of analogue tape machine heads, which rely on cancellation of the S signal.

====== M3 and M6 ======

M and S meters are normally aligned to the ‘M6’ standard in which M = (L + R) − 6 dB and S = (L − R) − 6 dB. In other words, the sum and difference signals are each attenuated by 6dB before being displayed on the meter. As a result, signals of identical amplitude and phase in the left and right channels make the M meter show exactly the same deflection as for the individual L and R meters. This is because summing two identical signals produces a result which is 6dB louder than either source, but the M and S meters show summed signals attenuated by 6dB to compensate. The M6 standard means that dual mono sources (eg. a presenter panned to the centre of a stereo sound stage) can be peaked to 6 in both channels, with the M meter also showing 6.

The M6 format has largely replaced the earlier ‘M3’ standard in which the sum and difference attenuation is only 3dB. This M3 format is designed to give a more accurate indication of the level of the summed mono signal when working with conventional stereo material. The premise is that in summing two signals of similar level but carrying non-phase-coherent sounds (ie. typical stereo material), the result averages 3 dB more than either source channel (rather than 6dB more). The M3 standard means that true stereo material can be peaked to 6 in both channels, with the M meter also showing 6. However, dual-mono sources can only be peaked to 5.25 in each channel to keep the M meter at 6. 

Note: the chosen M6/M3 metering standard does not affect the relative audible balance of sounds panned to one side versus the centre – that is determined solely by the panning law of the mixing console’s pan-pot.

The M6 standard is deemed a simpler form of metering for untrained broadcasters to use as it keeps the M meter at '4' for Alignment Level and '6' for peaks, without the operator having to remember to subtract 3 dB.

Commercial broadcasting in the UK initially used M3&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Code of Practice for Independent Local Radio Studio Performance | work=IBA Technical Review No. 2 | publisher=[[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] | page=60 | date=September 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had switched to M6 by 1980. This was mandated by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]]'s Engineering Code of Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Standards for Independent Local Radio Studio and Outside Broadcast Performance | work=IBA Technical Review No. 13 | publisher=[[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] | page=49 | date=September 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC installations used M3 until 1999. The BBC now uses M6 in both radio and TV, although much legacy equipment is still configured for the 'traditional' M3 standard.

[[Image:Sifam Type 22A EBU scale PPM.jpg|thumb|An EBU scale quasi-PPM as used for international programme exchange.]]
The EBU PPM is a variant of the British PPM designed for the control of programme levels in international programme exchange. It is formalised as the Type IIb PPM in IEC 60268-10. It is identical to the British PPM except for the scale plate, which is calibrated in dB relative to Alignment Level, which is marked 'TEST'. There are also ticks at 2&amp;nbsp;dB intervals and at +9&amp;nbsp;dB, corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level.

==== US ====
In the late 1930s PPMs were considered for use in the US, but rejected in favour of a 'Standard Volume Indicator' ([[VU meter]]) on grounds of cost. Joint research by [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and [[Bell Labs]] found that using an experimental design of PPM (with a relatively long integration time of 25 ms) in the control of programme levels gave only a 1&amp;nbsp;dB advantage over the VU meter, in terms of average output level for a given amount of distortion. It was felt that this was too small to justify the much greater expense. It was also found that VU meters gave more consistent readings than PPMs when comparing programme levels at the sending and receiving end of [[long line (telecommunications)|long line]]s subject to [[group delay and phase delay|group delay]], which altered the waveform.&lt;ref name="chinn"&gt;{{ cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been disputed by others.&lt;ref name="schmid"/&gt;

A widely believed myth is that the PPM was developed as a superior alternative to the VU meter. In fact, the PPM came first, and if anything the VU meter was developed as an economical alternative to the PPM.&lt;ref name="chinn"/&gt;

By 1980, ABC had about 100 PPMs in use in control rooms in New York and its Washington News Bureau, and was ordering new consoles with PPMs fitted. These were Type II PPMs with the seven marks labelled −22, −16, −12, −8, −4, 0 and +4. ABC found that a modified version of the EBU meter based on the VU-meter 'A scale' was best, since it let operators use their usual jargon such as 'zero level' etc.&lt;ref name="schmid"&gt;{{citation | title=The Peak Program Meter and the VU Meter in Broadcasting | first=Hans | last=Schmid | year=1980 | publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] | work=AES preprint 1691 | url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=3685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance is similar to an EBU scale except that the numbers are 8&amp;nbsp;dB lower.

To aid alignment on both VU meters and PPMS, ABC in New York used a special test signal known as ATS. A 440&amp;nbsp;Hz tone alternated between steady tone at +8 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and −8 PPM) and tone bursts at +16 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and 0 PPM).&lt;ref name="schmid"/&gt;

==== Canada ====
By 1978 PPMs were in use at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Vancouver plant. Some 30 or 40 PPMs were in use, with just one or two VU meters retained for settling [[telephone company|telco]] disputes. These are Type II PPMs with the seven marks labelled −6, 0, +4, +8, +12, +16 and +20: this scaling shows absolute levels in dBu (or dBm into 600&amp;nbsp;Ω). The appearance is similar to the ABC PPM except that all the numbers are 16&amp;nbsp;dB higher.&lt;ref name="schmid"/&gt;

==== South Africa ====
[[Image:SABC PPM.jpg|thumb|SABC scale plate on Type II PPM]]
The [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) uses a Type II PPM modified with a black-on-white scale plate calibrated in percentage and dB relative to Permitted Maximum Level, which is +6 dBu. Alignment Level is 0 dBu or 50%.

=== IEC 60268-18 Digital PPM ===
IEC 60268-18 is a partial standard for a PPM designed for use with digital audio in both professional and consumer use, using "incremental dot or bar type displays or numerical displays". Such a display shows level relative to 0 dBFS. The integration time can have any value less than 5 ms − thus both true-peak and quasi-peak meters can comply, and different meters may indicate very different levels despite compliance with the standard. The return time has the same value as a Type I meter: 1.7±0.3 seconds for a 20&amp;nbsp;dB fall.&lt;ref name="iec60268-18"&gt;{{citation | work = IEC 60268-18 ed1.0 | title=Sound system equipment - Part 18: Peak programme level meters - Digital audio peak level meter | publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] | year=1995 | url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/018772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Table of characteristics ===
IEC 60268-10 specifies three variants: Types I, IIa and IIb, known colloquially as the DIN, British and EBU types respectively. Types IIa and IIb differ only in the scale marks.&lt;ref name="iec60268-10"&gt;{{citation | work = IEC 60268-10 ed2.0 | title=Sound system equipment - Part 10: Peak programme level meters | publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission]] | year=1991 | url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/Artnum_PK/18760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nordic, ABC, CBC and SABC variants are not specified in IEC 60268-10. The Nordic PPM uses Type I ballistics with a different scale. The ABC, CBC and SABC variants use Type II ballistics with different scales.

== Nagra modulometer ==
[[Image:NAGRA Modulometer.jpg|thumb|left|Nagra double modulometer]] The 'modulometer' is a proprietary type of quasi-PPM found on [[Nagra]] products. It has an integration time (−2&amp;nbsp;dB) of 7.5 ms,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.nagraaudio.com/files/Instruction+Manual+4_2.pdf | title=Nagra 4.2 portable tape recorder instruction manual | publisher=[[Kudelski Group]] | year=1991 | page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a semi-logarithmic scale with an appearance between that of a VU meter and a DIN-type PPM. A stereo version ("double modulometer") uses a meter movement with two coaxial needles.

In typical practice for Nagra analogue tape recorders, Alignment Level is regarded as −8 and maximum level 0. Thus sound recordists using location mixers would typically send a tone at 0 VU or PPM 4 (British) and adjust the Nagra recorder's gain to read −8 on the modulometer.

Some newer digital recorders, e.g., the Nagra VI, have modulometers displayed as bargraphs calibrated in dBFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.nagraaudio.com/files/Nagra_vi_man_3.pdf | title=Nagra VI operating instructions and reference manual | publisher=[[Kudelski Group]] | date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, Alignment Level is as for any other digital PPM, i.e., −18 dBFS (EBU) or −20 dBFS (SMPTE).

== Usage of meter by sound balancers ==
To use PPMs effectively to control sound levels it is necessary to understand design rationale and limitations.

Many engineers prefer the PPM to the much slower VU meter used in the US—but it does require some interpretation in use. Though it gives a useful overload warning, it does not represent either true peak level or subjective loudness. The BBC have tables showing recommended settings for different types of programme, such as speech, classical music etc., which attempt to take account of the latter.

Regardless of the kind of programme, there is usually a nominal Permitted Maximum Level, as indicated on a PPM. Operators are expected to keep levels below it, within reason. Practices vary between countries and organisations. In the UK, the Permitted Maximum Level is 8&amp;nbsp;dB above Alignment Level, corresponding to '6' on the British PPM scale. ITU-T standards for international sound programme circuits specify a Permitted Maximum Level of 9&amp;nbsp;dB above Alignment Level. Accordingly, +9&amp;nbsp;dB is represented by a mark on the EBU PPM scale.

== PPMs and digital audio levels ==
Because quasi-peak PPMs indicate neither loudness nor true peaks but something between the two, it is important to allow sufficient headroom when using them in the control of digital audio levels. The EBU convention (R68) provides for this by defining Alignment Level as −18 dBFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation
| work = EBU Tech. Rec. R68
| title = Alignment level in digital audio production equipment and in digital audio recorders
| url = http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/r/r068.pdf
| publisher = [[European Broadcasting Union]]
| year = 2000
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a peak to the Permitted Maximum Level ''as indicated on a quasi-PPM'' corresponds to −9 or −10 dBFS. This 9-10&amp;nbsp;dB margin allows for operator error, the true peak typically being several dB higher than the PPM indication, and that subsequent signal processing (e.g., sample rate conversion) may increase the amplitude.

[[SMPTE]] RP 0155 recommends a different alignment level, corresponding to 0 VU, of −20 dBFS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://store.smpte.org/product-p/rp%200155-2004.htm | title=Reference Level for Digital Audio Systems | work=SMPTE RP 0155 | publisher=[[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conventions result in line-up tone levels that differ by 2&amp;nbsp;dB, but in practice the level of programme modulation tends to be similar.

The SMPTE and the EBU agree that regardless of whether −18 or −20 dBFS is used as the Alignment Level, that level should be declared and that in both cases programme should peak to a Permitted Maximum Level of −9 dBFS when measured on an IEC 60268-10 quasi-PPM with an integration time of 10 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation

== PPMs for consumer use ==
IEC 60268-10 is concerned mainly with the highly specified Type I and Type II PPMs used in broadcasting. It does however also contain a brief section on PPMs for 'secondary and consumer' applications. The requirements include a minimum of a 12-segment bargraph type display covering a range of −42&amp;nbsp;dB to +6&amp;nbsp;dB relative to nominal maximum level, and the same integration and return times as a Type I PPM.&lt;ref name="iec60268-10"/&gt;

'''Physiological chemistry''' is the [[chemistry]] of the organs and tissues of the body and of the various physiological processes incident to life.  Physiological chemistry is essentially the precursor to modern [[biochemistry]].  In the nineteenth century, physiological chemistry dealt primarily with extracellular chemistry, such as the chemistry of digestion and other body fluids.  Modern biochemical methods have allowed a much broader study including the chemistry of [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144425/http://www.hssonline.org/teach_res/essays/allen/allenp5.html Life Sciences in the Twentieth Century, Garland E.

Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000).

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig. ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'', pp. 120&amp;ndash;121, 1995, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0297835122}}; Bartrum, 69&amp;ndash;70; there is a further account of the development of scholarship by Zika in [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRvhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 48&amp;ndash;65 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch of Endor]] was a previously obscure subject that allowed the combination of biblical and witchcraft interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14609">'''Pseudo-response regulator''' ('''PRR''') refers to a group of genes that are important in the plant [[circadian oscillator]]. There are four primary PRR proteins (PRR9, PRR7, PRR5 and [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]]/PRR1) that perform the majority of interactions with other proteins within the circadian oscillator, and another (PRR3) that has limited function. These genes are all paralogs of each other, and all repress the transcription of Circadian Clock Associated 1 ([[CCA1]]) and [[Late Elongated Hypocotyl]] (LHY) at various times throughout the day. The expression of PRR9, PRR7, PRR5 and [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]]/PRR1 peak around morning, mid-day, afternoon and evening, respectively. As a group, these genes are one part of the three-part [[repressilator]] system that governs the biological clock in plants.

== Discovery ==
Multiple labs identified the PRR genes as parts of the circadian clock in the 1990s. In 2000, Akinori Matsushika, Seiya Makino, Masaya Kojima, and Takeshi Mizuno were the first to understand PRR genes as pseudo-response repressor genes rather than as [[Response regulator|response regulator (ARR) genes]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomé|first=Patrice A.|last2=McClung|first2=C.

== Function and Interactions ==

PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 participate in the repressilator of a negative autoregulatory feedback loop that synchronizes to environmental inputs. The repressilator has a morning, evening, and night loop that are regulated in part by the pseudo-response regulator proteins' interactions with CCA1 and LHY. CCA1 and LHY exhibit peak binding to PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 in the morning, evening, and night, respectively.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===PRR3 and PRR5===

When [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by an unknown [[kinase]], PRR5 and PRR3 proteins demonstrate increased binding to TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION 1 ( [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]]). This interaction stabilizes both TOC1 and PRR5 and prevents their degradation by the [[F-box protein]] ZEITLUPE (ZTL).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through this mechanism, PRR5 is indirectly activated by light, as ZTL is inhibited by light. Additionally, PRR5 contributes to the transcriptional repression of the genes encoding the single MYB transcription factors CCA1 and LHY.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===PRR7 and PRR9===

Two single MYB transcription factors, CCA1 and LHY, activate expression of ''PRR7'' and ''PRR9''. In turn, PRR7 and PRR9 repress ''CCA1'' and ''LHY'' through the binding of their promoters. This interaction forms the morning loop of the [[repressilator]] of the biological clock in ''A. thaliana''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chromatin [[immunoprecipitation]] demonstrates that LUX binds to the ''PRR9'' promoter to repress it. Additionally, ELF3 has been shown to activate ''PRR9'' and repress ''CCA1'' and ''LHY''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; PRR9 is also activated by alternative [[RNA splicing]]. When [[PRMT5]] (a [[DNA methylation|methylation]] factor) is prevented from methylating intron 2 of PRR9, a [[Translational frameshift|frameshift]] resulting in premature truncation occurs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

PRR7 and PRR9 also play a role in the [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of ''A. thaliana'' to a temperature cycle. Double-mutant plants with inactivated ''PRR7'' and ''PRR9'' exhibit extreme period lengthening at high temperatures but show no change in period at low temperatures. However, the inactivation of ''CCA1'' and ''LHY'' in the ''PRR7/PRR9'' loss-of-function mutants shows no change in period at high temperatures—this suggests that ''PRR7'' and ''PRR9'' are acting by overcompensation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Interactions Within Arabidopsis ==
In ''A. thaliana'', the main feedback loop is proposed to involve a transcriptional regulation between several proteins. The three main components of this loop are [[TOC1 (gene)|TOC1]] (also known as PRR1), CCA1 and LHY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alabadi|first=David|last2=Oyama|first2=Tokitaka|last3=Yanovsky|first3=Marcelo|last4=Harmon|first4=Franklin|date=2001|title=Reciprocal regulation between TOC1 and LHY/CCA 1 within the Arabidopsis Circadian clock|url=|journal=Science|volume=293|pages=880–883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual component peaks in transcriptions at different times of day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamichi|first=Norihito|last2=Kiba|first2=Takatoshi|last3=Henriques|first3=Rossana|last4=Mizuno|first4=Takeshi|last5=Chua|first5=Nam-Hai|last6=Sakakibara|first6=Hitoshi|date=2010-03-01|title=PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS 9, 7, and 5 Are Transcriptional Repressors in the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/22/3/594|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=594–605|doi=10.1105/tpc.109.072892|issn=1532-298X|pmc=2861452|pmid=20233950}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRR 9, 7 and 5 each significantly reduce the transcription levels of CCA1 and LHY.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the opposite manner, PRR 9 and 7 slightly increase the transcription levels of TOC1.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Constans (CO) is also indirectly regulated by the PRR proteins as well by setting up the molecular mechanism to dictate the [[photosensitive]] period in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Golembeski|first=Greg S.|last2=Imaizumi|first2=Takato|date=2015-01-01|title=Photoperiodic Regulation of Florigen Function in Arabidopsis thaliana|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=13|pages=e0178|doi=10.1199/tab.0178|pmc=4489636|pmid=26157354}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRRs are also known to stabilize CO at certain times of day to mediate its accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayama|first1=Ryosuke|last2=Sarid-Krebs|first2=Liron|last3=Richter|first3=René|last4=Fernández|first4=Virginia|last5=Jang|first5=Seonghoe|last6=Coupland|first6=George|title=PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATORs stabilize CONSTANS protein to promote flowering in response to day length|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=3 April 2017|volume=36|issue=7|pages=904–918|doi=10.15252/embj.201693907|pmid=28270524|issn=1460-2075|pmc=5376961}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the regulation of early flowering in shorter [[Photoperiodism|photoperiods]], making light sensitivity and control of flowering time important functions of the PRR class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Homologs ==

=== Paralogs ===
PPR3, PRR5, PRR7, and PRR9 are all paralogs of each other. They have similar structure, and all repress the transcription of CCA1 and LHY. Additionally, they are all characterized by their lack of a phospho-accepting aspartate site. These genes are also paralogs to TOC1, which is alternatively called PRR1.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Orthologs ===
Several pseudo-response regulators have been found in ''Selaginella,'' but their function has not yet been explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=Jo Ann|last2=Nishiyama|first2=Tomoaki|last3=Hasebe|first3=Mitsuyasu|last4=Bowman|first4=John L.|last5=Gribskov|first5=Michael|last6=dePamphilis|first6=Claude|last7=Albert|first7=Victor A.|last8=Aono|first8=Naoki|last9=Aoyama|first9=Tsuyoshi|date=2011-05-20|title=The compact Selaginella genome identifies changes in gene content associated with the evolution of vascular plants|journal=Science|volume=332|issue=6032|pages=960–963|doi=10.1126/science.1203810|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3166216|pmid=21551031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mutants ==
As PRR is a family of genes, several rounds mutant screening have been performed to identify each possible phenotype.

===Rhythmicity Phenotype===

In regards to rhythmicity of the clock in a [[Free-running sleep|free running]] setting PRR9 and PRR5 are associated with longer and shorter periods respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For each gene, the double mutant with PRR7 exacerbates observed trends in rhythmicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The triple mutant renders the plant arrhythmic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Flowering Time Phenotype===

In terms of flowering time in long day conditions, all mutants made the observed flowering late, with PRR7 significantly more late in comparison to the other mutants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All double mutants with PRR7 saw much later flowering time than the PRR5/PRR9 mutant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Light Sensitivity Phenotype===

With regard to light sensitivity, particularly in red light which is associated with hypocotyl lengthening, all PRR mutants were observed to be hypo-sensitive with PRR9 showing to be less sensitive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All the double mutants were equal in hyposensitivity as the PRR5 or PRR7 mutants; the triple mutant is extremely hypo-sensitive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Future research ==
Recent research has showed that expression of clock genes show tissue-specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shim|first=Jae Sung|last2=Kubota|first2=Akane|last3=Imaizumi|first3=Takato|date=2017-01-01|title=Circadian Clock and Photoperiodic Flowering in Arabidopsis: CONSTANS Is a Hub for Signal Integration|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/173/1/5|journal=Plant Physiology|language=en|volume=173|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01327|issn=1532-2548|pmc=5210731|pmid=27688622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about how, when, and why specific tissues show certain peaks in clock genes like PRR can reveal more about the subtle nuances of each gene within the repressilator.

Few investigations into the circadian oscillator mechanisms in species other than ''A. thaliana'' have taken place; learning which genes are responsible for clock functions in other species will give more insight into the similarities and differences in clocks across plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shim|first=Jae Shung|last2=Imaizumi|first2=Takato|date=2014|title=Circadian Clock and Photoperiodic Response in Arabidopsis: From Seasonal Flowering to Redox Homeostasis|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=2|pages=157–170|doi=10.1021/bi500922q|pmid=25346271|pmc=4303289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanistic details of each step in the plant biological clock repressilator system have yet to be fully understood. An understanding of these will give knowledge of clock function and, across species, increase understanding of the ecological and evolutionary functions of circadian oscillators.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClung|first=C. Robertson|date=2006-04-01|title=Plant Circadian Rhythms|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/18/4/792|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=792–803|doi=10.1105/tpc.106.040980|issn=1532-298X|pmc=1425852|pmid=16595397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, identifying direct targets of PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 that are not CCA1 and LHY will provide information about the molecular links from the PRRs to output genes like the flowering pathway and metabolism in mitochondria, which are CCA1-independent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">The '''RISKS Digest''' or '''Forum On Risks to the Public in Computers and Related Systems''' is an online [[periodical]] published since 1985 by the Committee on Computers and Public Policy of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. The editor is [[Peter G. Neumann]].

It is a moderated forum concerned with the security and safety of [[computer]]s, [[software]], and technological systems. Security, and risk, here are taken broadly; RISKS is concerned not merely with so-called [[security hole]]s in software, but with [[unintended consequence]]s and hazards stemming from the design (or lack thereof) of automated systems. Other recurring subjects include [[cryptography]] and the effects of technically ill-considered public policies. RISKS also publishes announcements and Calls for Papers from various technical conferences, and technical book reviews (usually by [[Robert Slade|Rob Slade]], though occasionally by others).

Although RISKS is a forum of a [[computer science]] association, most contributions are readable and informative to anyone with an interest in the subject. It is heavily read by [[system administrator]]s, and [[computer security]] managers, as well as computer scientists and [[engineering|engineers]].

The RISKS Digest is published on a frequent but irregular schedule through the moderated [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''[news:comp.risks comp.risks]'', which exists solely to carry the Digest.

Summaries of the forum appear as columns edited by Neumann in the ACM [[SIGSOFT]] ''[[Software Engineering Notes]]'' (SEN) and the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (CACM).

[[File:Firmas de Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Signatures by Rembrandt published by the Rembrandt Research Project.]]
The '''Rembrandt Research Project''' (RRP) is an initiative of the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek]] (NWO), which is the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. Its purpose is to organize and categorize research on [[Rembrandt]], with the aim of discovering new facts about this [[Dutch Golden Age]] painter and his studio. The project was started in 1968, but has since become the authority on Rembrandt and has final say in whether a painting is ''genuine''.

==Results==
As a result of the project, which analyzed documentation, techniques, and forensic research on Rembrandt paintings from his early years in [[Leiden]] until his death, the number of signed Rembrandt ''self-portraits'' around the world has been reduced by half. Also, more paintings have been attributed to [[List of Rembrandt pupils|students working in the Rembrandt studio]], and more has been discovered about the ways in which the students worked. Recently, period copies of Rembrandt paintings are being studied for clues as to whether certain copies were factory-style pieces for visiting functionaries. Rembrandt's work was in high demand for decades, and he managed to keep productivity up while also keeping his prices high by enforcing strict quality control on the work done in his studio.

The project's six-volume publication, ''A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings'', is considered the definitive authority by all auction houses and dealers who work with works by Rembrandt and his studio. The research project has proved invaluable to art historians, and the lack of such a project for other prominent Dutch painters such as [[Frans Hals]] is felt sorely by museums and collectors trying to acquire the same sort of ''stamp of approval'' on their paintings.  However, the project has also initiated debate about the feasibility of conclusive attribution, particularly for painters who were associated with one or more workshops.

==Concordance with other Rembrandt catalogs==
The research project is also the single point of reference regarding concordance with other catalogs of the master's works, though most of these reference each other, as well. Below is a partial list of some commonly quoted catalogs:

===Old man with turban===
In 1998, the pAn Amsterdam art fair showed a Rembrandt for the first time that until then had been attributed to his pupil [[Jacques des Rousseaux]]. This painting was first cataloged in 1917 by [[Abraham Bredius]], who accepted it as a Rembrandt. Later [[Kurt Bauch]] rejected this based on a photograph and attributed it to [[Jan Lievens]] without ever having seen the painting. [[Werner Sumowski]] re-attributed the painting based on photographs to Rousseaux as a rebuttal to the arguments by art historians Bauch, [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Horst Gerson]].&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;Catalog [http://www.pan.nl/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=58&amp;lg=nl pAn Amsterdam] 1998, p.11-17&lt;/ref&gt; The Rembrandt Research project seeks to avoid such arguments by making attributions based on historical and forensic evidence. The study of Rembrandt's oevre includes study of drawings and etchings as well as paintings by a wide range of artists who were Rembrandt's contemporaries. Analysis of his techniques includes the study of paints and panel wood he and his contemporaries used, while x-rays of paintings reveal whether a painting is a copy based on the amount of "discovery" drawing in the underlayer.

The pAn 1998 catalog contains an article by [[Ernst van de Wetering]] with foto's of other depictions of the same man by [[Jan Lievens]], [[Gerard Dou]], and Jacques Rousseau (thus the mis-attribution). The man has clearly the same face in all four portraits.

====Rembrandt's father====
According to Van de Wetering, this is the man often referred to as ''Rembrandt's father'', who was probably not his father, but a functionary in the [[Leiden Guild of St. Luke|Leiden painters' guild]] or male model.&lt;ref name=catalog /&gt;

==End==
In early 2011, the RRP board voted to terminate the project by the end of 2011 even though approximately one-quarter of Rembrandt's oeuvre has not yet been investigated.  A major reason for this decision was the lack of scholars available to assume responsibilities from the RRP's chair, [[Ernst van de Wetering]], who has been involved with the project since 1968.  Other reasons cited included lack of funding, as the [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] ceased funding the project in 1998.  However, with funding from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] and the [[Mauritshuis]] have launched a pilot initiative called the [http://www.rembrandtdatabase.org/ Rembrandt Database] that will build off of and supplement research from the RRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926052740/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rembrandt-Research-Project-ended/23044# |archive-date=2011-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Riken'''|理研}} is a large [[research institute]] in Japan. Founded in 1917, it now has about 3,000 scientists on seven campuses across Japan, including the main site at [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], just outside [[Tokyo]]. Riken is a [[Japanese National Research and Development Agencies|Designated National Research and Development Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/kokurituken/gijiroku/attach/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2016/07/15/1373910_01.pdf|title=MEXT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly an [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. "Riken" is a contraction of the formal name {{nihongo|'''Rikagaku Kenkyūjyo'''|理化学研究所}}, and its full name in Japanese is {{nihongo|'''Kokuritsu Kenkyū Kaihatsu Hōjin Rikagaku Kenkyūsho'''|国立研究開発法人理化学研究所}}.

Riken conducts research in many areas of science, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medical science]], [[engineering]], [[high-performance computing]] and [[computer science|computational science]], and ranging from [[basic research]] to [[applied research|practical applications]] with 485 partners worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riken.jp/en/outreach/research/&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost entirely funded by the [[Japanese government]], and its annual [[budget]] is about ¥88 billion (US$760 million).{{when|date=June 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:RIKEN building in Taisho period.JPG|thumb|Riken in the [[Taishō period]]]]
[[Image:RIKEN VITAMIN.png|thumb|A 1938 ad for Riken Vitamin A]]
In 1913, the well-known scientist [[Jokichi Takamine]] first proposed the establishment of a national science research institute in Japan. This task was taken on by Viscount [[Shibusawa Eiichi]], a prominent businessman, and following a resolution by the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1915, Riken came into existence in March 1917. In its first incarnation, Riken was a private foundation (''zaidan''), funded by a combination of industry, the government, and the [[Japanese royal family|Imperial Household]]. It was located in the Komagome district of [[Tokyo]], and its first Director was the mathematician Baron [[Dairoku Kikuchi]].

In 1927, Viscount [[Masatoshi Ōkōchi]], the third Director, established the Riken Konzern (a [[zaibatsu]]). This was a group of spin-off companies that used Riken's scientific achievements for commercial ends and returned the profits to Riken. At its peak in 1939 the Konzern comprised about 121 factories and 63 companies, including Riken Kankōshi, which is now [[Ricoh]].

During [[World War II]] the [[Japanese atomic program|Japanese army's atomic bomb program]] was conducted at Riken. In April 1945 the US bombed Riken's laboratories in Komagome, and in November, after the end of the war, Allied soldiers destroyed its two [[cyclotron]]s.

After the war, the Allies dissolved Riken as a private foundation, and it was brought back to life as a company called {{nihongo |Kagaku Kenkyūjyo|科学研究所}}, or {{nihongo|Kaken|科研}}. In 1958 the Diet passed the Riken Law, whereby the institute returned to its original name and entered its third incarnation, as a {{nihongo |public corporation|特殊法人|tokushu hōjin}}, funded by the government. In 1963 it relocated to a large site in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]], just outside [[Tokyo]].

Since the 1980s Riken has expanded dramatically. New labs, centers, and institutes have been established in Japan and overseas, including:
* in 1984, the Life Science Center in [[Tsukuba]]
* in 1995, the Muon Research Facility at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]
* in 1997, the [[Harima]] Institute, the Brain Science Institute in Wako, and the center at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the [[United States|USA]]
* in 1998, the Genomic Sciences Center
* in 2000, the Yokohama Institute, which now contains four centers for research in the life sciences
* in 2002, the Kobe Institute, which contains the Center for Developmental Biology

In October 2003, Riken's status changed again, to [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. As such, Riken is still publicly funded, and it is periodically evaluated by the government, but it has a higher degree of autonomy than before. Riken is regarded as the flagship research institute in Japan and conducts basic and applied experimental research in a wide range of science and technology fields including physics, chemistry, medical science, biology and engineering.

Riken was the subject of international attention in 2014 after the [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency cell]] (also known as '''STAP''') publication, investigation, retraction, and suicide of [[Yoshiki Sasai]], the principal investigator. Observers, journalists, and former members of Riken have stated that the organization is riddled with unprofessional and inadequate scientific rigor and consistency, and that this is reflective of serious issues with scientific research in Japan in general.&lt;ref&gt;Otake, Tomoko, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/04/20/national/stapgate-shows-japan-must-get-back-to-basics-in-science/#.U1WkzMKRVZI 'STAPgate' shows Japan must get back to basics in science]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/07/05/national/media-national/ongoing-obokata-story-seeks-scandal/#.U7qcsY2KB9A Ongoing Obokata story seeks out scandal]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 July 2014, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Site and services''' is an approach to bringing shelter within the economic reach of the poor.

==History==
Recognizing that the vast majority of low income families in the world build their own shelter, which lacks basic [[hygiene]], access and electricity, the strategy was developed. The approach first appeared on a large scale in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]) in 1972 when the [[World Bank]] engaged [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] to advise the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA) on their housing sector investments. The approach links the user group's ability to pay with land prices and the costs of rudimentary and upgradable [[infrastructure]]. The fundamental idea is to market plots with essential infrastructure at market prices, to avoid the resale of [[subsidized housing]], directed at low-income groups. The first major scheme planned by Benninger, at Arambakkum in Chennai, created about 7,000 shelter units, within the paying capacity of the urban poor.  Within five years the MMDA created more than 20,000 units and the approach became a major strategy of the World Bank to tackle a variety of shelter problems globally.

:Social Informatics (SI) refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization – including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.&lt;ref name="rkcsi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|title=Homepage of Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|url=http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/|website=Indiana University|publisher=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Historically, Western European concepts of social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries and the UK.&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|last2=Edge|first2=David|title=The social shaping of technology|journal=Research Policy|date=1996|volume=25|issue=6|pages=865–899|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings can be traced to the 1980s in Norway and Slovenia.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichman|first1=Pnina|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Howard|title=Social Informatics: Past, Present and Future|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=978-1443855761}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamentals of social informatics in the USA were laid by Kling in 1996 with his colleagues and students from Indiana University.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014" /&gt; Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt; There are several approaches, which were historically named or classified as social informatics: American, Russian, British, Norwegian, Slovenian, German and Japanese.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smutny|first1=Zdenek|title=Social informatics as a concept: Widening the discourse|journal=Journal of Information Science|date=2016|volume=42|issue=5|pages=681–710|doi=10.1177/0165551515608731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest concept of social informatics was founded in the USSR by A.V. Sokolov and his colleagues in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chugunov2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chugunov|first1=Andrey Vladimirovich|title=Социальная информатика: Учебное пособие|date=2012|publisher=НИУ ИТМО|location=Санкт-Петербургский}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society which are dictated by the technology’s stated capabilities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt;  Similarly, the socially [[Determinism|deterministic theory]] represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory as advocated by Williams &amp; Edge (1996)&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; see technology as the product of human social forces.  In contrast, some social informatics methodologies consider the context surrounding technology and the material properties of the technology to be equally important:  the people who will interact with a system, the organizational policies governing work practice, and support resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This contextual inquiry produces "nuanced [[concept]]ual understanding" of systems that can be used to examine issues like access to technology, [[Telecommunication|electronic forms of communication]], and large-scale [[Computer networking|networks]].&lt;ref name="Kling2000a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|title=Learning about information technologies and social change: The contribution of social informatics|journal=The Information Society|date=2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=217–232|doi=10.1080/01972240050133661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in social informatics can be categorized into three orientations.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;  [[Norm (sociology)|Normative]] research focuses on the development of theories based on [[empirical]] analysis that may be used to develop organizational policies and work practices.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; The heart of such analyses lies in socio-technical interaction networks,&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; a framework built around the idea that humans and the technologies they build are "[[Coconstitutionalism|co-constitutive]]", bound together, and that any examination of one must necessarily consider the other. Studies of the analytical orientation develop theory or define methodologies to contribute to theorizing in institutional settings.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;  Critical analysis, like [[Lucy Suchman]]’s examination of articulation work,&lt;ref name="Suchman1994"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Lucy|last1=Suchman|title=Supporting articulation work: Aspects of a feminist practice of office technology production|conference=Proceedings of the 5th IFIP WG9.1 Conference on Women, Work and Computerization|date=1994|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York|pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine technological solutions from non-traditional perspectives in order to influence design and implementation.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;

==Future==
Social informatics is a young intellectual movement and its future is still being defined.  However, because SST theorists such as [[Robin Williams (academic)|Williams]] and Edge suggest that the [[amorphous]] boundaries between humans and technology that emerge in social shaping technology research indicate that technology is not a distinct social endeavor worthy of individual study,&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; indicating that there is a need for social informatics research that bridges the gap between technological and social [[determinism]].  This observation, coupled with the many fields that contribute research, suggest a future in which social informatics theories and concepts settle to form a substrate, an "indispensable analytical foundation"&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; for work in other disciplines.

Relevant topics about future direction of social informatics are discussed in the book by Fichman and Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014" /&gt; Conceptualization of international discourse, including current trends in research and direction of social informatics development is presented in an article by Smutny.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt; This article discusses current possibilities of development of social informatics within the international discourse of various concepts including possible areas for future cooperation. Other topical article by Marcinkowski&lt;ref name="Marcinkowski2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcinkowski|first1=Michael|title=Data, Ideology, and the Developing Critical Program of Social Informatics|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=2016|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1266–1275|doi=10.1002/asi.23483}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents a perspective shift from studying only the effects of the implementation and use of technology to the primary discussion of what are the ideological implications of empirical work in social informatics connected with data analytics approach.

==In education==
Social informatics is also about teaching social issues of computing to computer science students.&lt;ref name="KlingJewett1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|last2=Jewett|first2=Tom|title=The Social Design of Worklife with Computers and Networks: An Open Natural Systems Perspective|journal=Advances in Computers|date=1994|volume=39|pages=239–293|doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60381-2|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/13m1k4jg|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on educational traditions, social informatics is scattered in the curriculum of different disciplines, as well as in [[computer science]], information science, [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] (Europe) and web sociology.&lt;ref name="Kling2007" /&gt; In some instances there might be a lack of understanding of why teaching social issues of computing is important, both by individual lecturers and students, resulting in a view that social informatics is boring and without importance.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per Arne|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2007|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007" /&gt;

In [[asynchronous serial communication]], start signals are used at the beginning of a [[character (computing)|character]] that prepares the receiving device for the reception of the [[code]] elements. 

A start signal is limited to one [[signal element]] usually having the duration of a [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="980">In [[electronics]], a '''synchronous detector''' is a device that [[Demodulation|recovers information from a modulated signal]] by mixing the signal with a replica of the un-modulated carrier.  This can be locally generated at the receiver using a [[phase-locked loop]] or other techniques. Synchronous detection preserves any phase information originally present in the modulating signal. Synchronous detection is a necessary component of any analog [[color television]] receiver, where it allows recovery of the phase information that conveys hue.&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Fink (ed.)., ''Electronics Engineers' Handbook'', McGraw Hill, 1975 {{ISBN|0-07-020980-4}} page 20-57&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronous detectors are also found in some [[shortwave radio]] receivers used for audio signals, where they provide better performance on signals that may be affected by fading.

The '''Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager''' ('''TORQUE''')&lt;ref name="TORQUE paper"&gt;[http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1188455.1188464  TORQUE resource manager, Garrick Staples, SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing], {{ISBN|0-7695-2700-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[distributed resource manager]] providing control over batch jobs and distributed compute nodes. TORQUE can integrate with the non-commercial [[Maui Cluster Scheduler]] or the commercial [[Moab Cluster Suite|Moab Workload Manager]] to improve overall utilization, scheduling and administration on a cluster. 

The TORQUE community has extended the original [[Portable Batch System|PBS]] to extend scalability, fault tolerance, and functionality. Contributors include [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]], [[Ohio Supercomputer Center|OSC]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], the [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]], [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]], [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|PNNL]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|UB]], [[TeraGrid]], and other [[High-performance computing|HPC]] organizations. As of June 2018, TORQUE is no longer open-source even though previously it was described by its developers as [[open-source software]],&lt;ref name="proprietary_license" /&gt; using the OpenPBS version 2.3 license&lt;ref name="openpbsv2.3_licence" /&gt; and as non-[[free software license|free software]] by the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]&lt;ref name="DFSG_Torque_non-free"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = The DFSG and Software Licenses - Licenses that are DFSG-incompatible| work =| publisher =[[Debian]] | date =2011-03-27 | url =http://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses#Licenses_that_are_DFSG-incompatible |format =| doi =| accessdate =2011-07-31 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60b7SqSsP |archivedate=2011-07-31  |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to license issues.

==Feature set==
TORQUE provides enhancements over standard OpenPBS in the following areas:

* Fault Tolerance
** Additional failure conditions checked/handled
** Node health check script support
* Scheduling Interface
** Extended query interface providing the scheduler with additional and more accurate information
** Extended control interface allowing the scheduler increased control over job behavior and attributes
** Allows the collection of statistics for completed jobs
* Scalability
** Significantly improved server to MOM communication model
** Ability to handle larger clusters (over 15 TF/2,500 processors)
** Ability to handle larger jobs (over 2000 processors)
** Ability to support larger server messages
* Usability
** Extensive logging additions
** More human readable logging (i.e. no more 'error 15038 on command 42')

'''''The Bible with Sources Revealed''''' (2003) is a book by American biblical scholar [[Richard Elliott Friedman]] dealing with the process by which the five books of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]] (the "Five Books of Moses") came to be written. Friedman follows the four-source [[Documentary Hypothesis]] model, but differs significantly from [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s model in several respects. 

Most notably, Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the date of the [[Deuteronomist]] (the court of [[Josiah]], c. 621 or 622 BC), but places the [[Priestly source]] at the court of [[Hezekiah]]; his sequence of sources therefore runs [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]]–[[Deuteronomist]] [JEPD] (while Wellhausen order it as [[Jahwist]]–[[Elohist]]–[[Deuteronomist]]–[[Priestly source|Priestly]] [JEDP] in his Documentary Hypothesis model). Like Wellhausen, he sees a final redaction in the time of [[Ezra]], c. 450 BC.

== Summary ==

The core of the book, taking up almost 300 of its approximately 380 pages in the paperback edition, is Friedman's own translation of the five Pentateuchal books, in which the four sources plus the contributions of the two [[Redactor]]s (of the combined JE source and the later redactor of the final document) are indicated typographically. The remaining sections include a short Introduction outlining Friedman's thesis, a "Collection of Evidence," and a bibliography.

Friedman's version of the documentary hypothesis can be summarised as follows: The first source to be written down was the Jahwist, or J. This occurred in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], the southern of the two Israelite kingdoms, in the period between 922-722 BC. (Friedman's arguments are dealt with below). The Elohist, or E, was composed in roughly the same period, but probably a little later than J, in the northern kingdom of Israel. In 722 BC the Assyrian conquest of Israel brought E to Judah with refugees from the northern kingdom.

Shortly after this a redactor combined the two into a standard text, JE, the redactor himself being known as RJE. Then in the reign of [[Hezekiah]], c.715-687 BC, the Jerusalem priesthood produced a text which they saw as a replacement for JE, the theology of which was objectionable to their project of religious reform: this was the Priestly source, or P. Hezekiah's reform program failed, but was revived in the reign of his great-grandson [[Josiah]], c. 640-609 BC, producing the last source, the [[Deuteronomist]], or D. The three sources (JE now counting as a single source) existed independently until the return from the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]], when a final redactor, R, combined them. 

The "Collection of Evidence" section sets out Friedman's arguments for the documentary hypothesis in general and for his own version of it in particular. He notes seven arguments:
* Linguistic: each source (treating JE as a single source) reflects the Hebrew of its period.
* Terminology: Certain words and phrases appear disproportionately, or exclusively, in certain sources.
* Consistent content: Certain concepts, objects, and practices are specific to certain sources.
* Continuity of texts: When separated into sources following linguistic, terminological and contextual clues, each source constitutes a coherent, self-contained narrative.
* Connections with other parts of the Bible: Each source has direct, non-indiscriminate affinities with other specific parts of the Bible.
* Relationships of sources to each other and to history: The sources each have connections to specific circumstances in the history of Israel/Judah, and to each other.

== Comparison with Wellhausen ==

As Friedman himself says in his ''Who Wrote the Bible?'', when a scholar agrees with the documentary hypothesis, he agrees with Wellhausen; when he wishes to propose a new model of the hypothesis, he compares it with Wellhausen.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrase from Friedman's "Who Wrote the Bible?", pp. 26-27 of 1997 edition (original edition 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the identity of the four sources, and on the identification of certain possible or probable authors: [[Jeremiah]] and/or his scribe, [[Baruch ben Neriah]], as the author of D, [[Ezra]] as the Redactor. (These identifications in fact were made long before Wellhausen: the identification of the Redactor with Ezra can be traced to [[Spinoza]] in the 17th century or even [[Jerome]] in the 4th). Where he departs most radically from Wellhausen is in dating P to the time of Hezekiah, almost a century before Josiah and the D source. Wellhausen's placing of P after D, so that the sequence of sources was JEDP, was crucial to the view of the development of Israelite religion from original polytheism to Judaic monotheism; Friedman's reordering of the sources is thus his major challenge to Wellhausen's model, as it undermines Wellhausen's thesis that the [[Priestly Code]] represents the final development of a priest-centred religious practice. Friedman's dating of J to the time of the divided kingdom - Wellhausen put it in the 10th century BC rather than the 8th - is also novel, but less so than his ordering of the sources.

== Critical assessment ==

The documentary hypothesis as defined by Wellhausen, having dominated critical thinking on the origin of the Pentateuch, came into increasing question from the late 1960s onwards as alternative models - supplementary and fragmentary rather than the discrete documents of the DH paradigm - were put forward. Friedman's book is thus in one sense an answer to these critics, and perhaps especially to [[R. N. Whybray]], whose 1987 ''[[The Making of the Pentateuch]]'' had concluded that the tools by which the documentary model distinguished its supposed documents were fundamentally faulty: how could they suppose, he asked, that the authors of each of the four so-called source documents had not tolerated inconsistency, but that the two redactors had had no problems with it? 

Scholars as eminent as [[Baruch Halpern]] and [[Michael D. Coogan]] (editor of ''[[The New Oxford Annotated Bible]]'') welcomed ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'' as an indispensable teaching tool; nevertheless, Friedman's departures from Wellhausen have been criticised by his professional colleagues on several grounds, not least for ignoring all other models and all advances in scholarship outside his preferred documentary model.

For example, the review in the [[Review of Biblical Literature]] noted:

"It is basic for the understanding of biblical literary history that the [[Supplementary hypothesis|Supplementary Hypothesis]] is the 'normal hypothesis' (even within the Pentateuch) and that the Documentary Hypothesis (i.e., the fusion of two literary sources) is only a notable exception."

Also, some scholars advocated 'the Fragmentary hypothesis' for another major text-critical approach to the Pentateuch's authorship''.

Moreover, Friedman was criticised for ignoring evidence that P did not precede Deuteronomy, for an arbitrary approach to his assignment of sources, and for failing to note or argue with scholarship that does not support his argument.

On the other hand, his close examination of R (and RJE) was welcomed as innovative and useful, as was his schematisation of the arguments in favour of the documentary model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/5126_5394.pdf Review by Christof Levin, ''Review of Biblical Literature'', RBL06/2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18248">{{turing}}
A [[Turing machine]] is a hypothetical computing device, first conceived by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936. Turing machines manipulate symbols on a potentially infinite strip of tape according to a finite table of rules, and they provide the theoretical underpinnings for the notion of a computer algorithm.

While none of the following models have been shown to have more power than the single-tape, one-way infinite, multi-symbol Turing-machine model, their authors defined and used them to investigate questions and solve problems more easily than they could have if they had stayed with Turing's ''a''-machine model.

== Machines equivalent to the Turing machine model ==

'''Turing equivalence'''

Many machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] | year = 1979| title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation| publisher = Addison–Wesley, Reading Mass| edition = 1st | isbn = 0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (The [[Church–Turing thesis]] ''hypothesizes'' this to be true: that anything that can be “computed” can be computed by some Turing machine.)

'''The sequential-machine models'''

All of the following are called "sequential machine models" to distinguish them from "parallel machine models".&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;[[Peter van Emde Boas]], ''Machine Models and Simulations''; [[Jan van Leeuwen]], ed. ''Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science. Volume A: Algorithms and Complexity'', p. 3-66, The MIT Press/Elsevier, 1990. {{ISBN|0-262-72014-0}} (volume A). QA76.H279 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tape-based Turing machines ==

'''Turing's ''a''-machine model'''

Turing's a-machine (as he called it) was left-ended, right-end-infinite. He provided symbols '''əə''' to mark the left end. Any of finite number of tape symbols were permitted. The instructions (if a universal machine), and the "input" and "out" were written only on "F-squares", and markers were to appear on "E-squares". In essence he divided his machine into two tapes that always moved together. The instructions appeared in a tabular form called "5-tuples" and were not executed sequentially.

=== Single-tape machines with restricted symbols and/or restricted instructions ===
The following models are single tape Turing machines but restricted with (i) restricted tape symbols { mark, blank }, and/or (ii) sequential, computer-like instructions, and/or (iii) machine-actions fully atomized.

==== Post's "Formulation 1" model of computation ====
{{details|Post–Turing machine}}

[[Emil Post]] in an independent description of a computational process, reduced the symbols allowed to the equivalent binary set of marks on the tape { "mark", "blank"=not_mark }. He changed the notion of "tape" from 1-way infinite to the right to an infinite set of rooms each with a sheet of paper in both directions. He atomized the Turing 5-tuples into 4-tuples—motion instructions separate from print/erase instructions. Although his 1936 model is ambiguous about this, Post's 1947 model did not require sequential instruction execution.

His extremely simple model can emulate any Turing machine, and although his 1936 ''Formulation 1'' does not use the word "program" or "machine", it is effectively a formulation of a very primitive programmable computer and associated [[programming language]], with the boxes acting as an unbounded bitstring memory, and the set of instructions constituting a program.

==== Wang machines ====
{{details|Wang B-machine}}

In an influential paper, [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] reduced Post's "[[Post–Turing machine#1936: Post model|formulation 1]]" to machines that still use a two-way infinite binary tape, but whose instructions are simpler — being the "atomic" components of Post's instructions — and are by default executed sequentially (like a "computer program").  His stated principal purpose was to offer, as an alternative to Turing's theory, one that "is more economical in the basic operations".  His results were "program formulations" of a variety of such machines, including the 5-instruction Wang W-machine with the instruction-set

: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, MARK-SQUARE, ERASE-SQUARE, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx }

and his most-severely reduced 4-instruction [[Wang B-machine]] ("B" for "basic") with the instruction-set
 
: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, MARK-SQUARE, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx }

which has not even an ERASE-SQUARE instruction.

Many authors later introduced variants of the machines discussed by Wang:

Minsky evolved Wang's notion with his version of the (multi-tape) "counter machine" model that allowed SHIFT-LEFT and SHIFT-RIGHT motion of the separate heads but no printing at all.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt; In this case the tapes would be left-ended, each end marked with a single "mark" to indicate the end. He was able to reduce this to a single tape, but at the expense of introducing multi-tape-square motion equivalent to multiplication and division rather than the much simpler { SHIFT-LEFT = DECREMENT, SHIFT-RIGHT = INCREMENT }.

Davis, adding an explicit HALT instruction to one of the machines discussed by Wang, used a model with the instruction-set

: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, ERASE, MARK, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx, JUMP-to xxx, HALT }

and also considered versions with tape-alphabets of size larger than 2.

====Böhm's theoretical machine language P"====
{{details|P"}}
In keeping with Wang's project to seek a Turing-equivalent theory "economical in the basic operations", and wishing to avoid unconditional jumps, a notable theoretical language is the 4-instruction language [[P"]] introduced by [[Corrado Böhm]] in 1964 — the first "GOTO-less" imperative "[[structured programming]]" language to be proved [[Turing-complete]].

=== Multi-tape Turing machines ===
{{details|Multitape Turing machine}}

In practical analysis, various types of multi-tape Turing machines are often used.  Multi-tape machines are similar to single-tape machines, but there is some constant ''k'' number of independent tapes.

===Deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines===
{{details|non-deterministic Turing machine}}

If the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state then the machine is a "deterministic Turing machine" (DTM).  If the action table contains multiple entries for a combination of symbol and state then the machine is a "non-deterministic Turing machine" (NDTM). '''The two are computationally equivalent, that is, it is possible to turn any NDTM into a DTM (and ''vice versa'').''' This can be proved via construction.

=== Oblivious Turing machines ===

An oblivious Turing machine is a Turing machine where movement of the various heads are fixed functions of time, independent of the input.  In other words, there is a predetermined sequence in which the various tapes are scanned, advanced, and written to.  Pippenger and Fischer showed that any computation that can be performed by a multi-tape Turing machine in ''n'' steps can be performed by an oblivious two-tape Turing machine in {{tmath|O(n \log n)}} steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Nicholas|last=Pippenger|authorlink=Nick Pippenger|first2=Michael J.|last2=Fischer|authorlink2=Michael J. Fischer|title=Relations Among Complexity Measures|journal=J ACM|year=1979|volume=26|issue=3|pages=361–381|doi=10.1145/322123.322138}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Register machine models ==
{{details|Register machine}}

[[Peter van Emde Boas]] includes all machines of this type in one class, "the register machine".&lt;ref name="Boas" /&gt; However, historically the literature has also called the most primitive member of this group i.e. "the counter machine" -- "the register machine". And the most primitive embodiment of a "counter machine" is sometimes called the "Minsky machine".

=== The "counter machine", also called a "register machine" model ===
{{details|Counter machine}}

The primitive model register machine is, in effect, a multitape 2-symbol Post–Turing machine with its behavior restricted so its tapes act like simple "counters".

By the time of Melzak, Lambek, and Minsky the notion of a "computer program" produced a different type of simple machine with many left-ended tapes cut from a Post–Turing tape. In all cases the models permit only two tape symbols { mark, blank }.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt;

Some versions represent the positive integers as only a strings/stack of marks allowed in a "register" (i.e. left-ended tape), and a blank tape represented by the count "0". Minsky eliminated the PRINT instruction at the expense of providing his model with a mandatory single mark at the left-end of each tape.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt;

In this model the single-ended tapes-as-registers are thought of as "counters", their instructions restricted to only two (or three if the TEST/DECREMENT instruction is atomized). Two common instruction sets are the following:
:(1): { INC ( r ), DEC ( r ), JZ ( r,z ) }, i.e.
::{ INCrement contents of register #r; DECrement contents of register #r; IF contents of #r=Zero THEN Jump-to Instruction #z}
:(2): { CLR ( r ); INC ( r ); JE ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, z ) }, i.e.
::{ CLeaR contents of register r; INCrement contents of r; compare contents of r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and if Equal then Jump to instruction z}

Although his model is more complicated than this simple description, the Melzak "pebble" model extended this notion of "counter" to permit multi-
pebble adds and subtracts.

=== The random-access machine (RAM) model ===
{{details|Random-access machine}}
 
Melzak recognized a couple serious defects in his register/counter-machine model:&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. A. Melzak]], ''An informal Arithmetical Approach to Computability and Computation'', Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, vol. 4, no. 3. September 1961 pages 279-293.&lt;/ref&gt; (i) Without a form of indirect addressing he would not be able to "easily" show the model is [[Turing completeness|Turing equivalent]], (ii) The program and registers were in different "spaces", so self-modifying programs would not be easy. When Melzak added indirect addressing to his model he created a random access machine model.

(However, with [[Gödel numbering]] of the instructions Minsky offered a proof that with such numbering the general [[recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s were indeed possible; he offers proof that [[μ recursion]] is indeed possible&lt;ref name="Marvin"&gt;[[Marvin Minsky]], ''Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines'', Prentice–Hall, Inc., N.J., 1967. See Chapter 8, Section 8.2 "Unsolvability of the Halting Problem."&lt;/ref&gt;).

Unlike the RASP model, the RAM model does not allow the machine's actions to modify its instructions. Sometimes the model works only register-to-register with no accumulator, but most models seem to include an accumulator.

van Emde Boas divides the various RAM models into a number of sub-types:&lt;ref name="Boas" /&gt;
* SRAM, the "successor RAM" with only one arithmetic instruction, the successor (INCREMENT h). The others include "CLEAR h", and an IF equality-between-register THEN jump-to xxx.
* RAM: the standard model with addition and subtraction
* MRAM: the RAM agumented with multiplication and division
* BRAM, MBRAM: Bitwise Boolean versions of the RAM  and MRAM
* N****: Non-deterministic versions of any of the above with an N before the name

=== The random-access stored program (RASP) machine model ===
{{details|Random-access stored-program machine}}

The RASP is a RAM with the instructions stored together with their data in the same 'space' -- i.e. sequence of registers. The notion of a RASP was described at least as early as Kiphengst. His model had a "mill"—an accumulator, but now the instructions were in the registers with the data—the so-called [[von Neumann architecture]]. When the RASP has alternating even and odd registers—the even holding the "operation code" (instruction) and the odd holding its "operand" (parameter), then indirect addressing is achieved by simply modifying an instruction's operand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Cook|Stephen A. Cook]] and Robert A. Reckhow (1972), ''Time-bounded random access machines'', Journal of Computer Systems Science 7 (1973), 354-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original RASP model of Elgot and Robinson had only three instructions in the fashion of the register-machine model,&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvin Elgot]] and [[Abraham Robinson]] (1964), ''Random-Access Stored-Program Machines, an Approach to Programming Languages'', Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October, 1964), pp. 365-399.&lt;/ref&gt; but they placed them in the register space together with their data. (Here COPY takes the place of CLEAR when one register e.g. "z" or "0" starts with and always contains 0. This trick is not unusual. The unit 1 in register "unit" or "1" is also useful.) 
: { INC ( r ), COPY ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ),  JE ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, z ) }

The RASP models allow indirect as well as direct-addressing; some allow "immediate" instructions too, e.g. "Load accumulator with the constant 3". The instructions may be of a highly restricted set such as the following 16 instructions of Hartmanis.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Hartmanis]] (1971), "Computational Complexity of Random Access Stored Program Machines," Mathematical Systems Theory 5, 3 (1971) pp. 232-245.&lt;/ref&gt; This model uses an accumulator A. The mnemonics are those that the authors used (their CLA is "load accumulator" with constant or from register; STO is "store accumulator"). Their syntax is the following, excepting the jumps: "n, &lt;n&gt;, &lt;&lt;n&gt;&gt;" for "immediate", "direct" and "indirect"). Jumps are via two "Transfer instructions" TRA—unconditional jump by directly "n" or indirectly "&lt; n &gt;" jamming contents of register n into the instruction counter, TRZ (conditional jump if Accumulator is zero in the same manner as TRA): 
:{ ADD n , ADD &lt; n &gt;, ADD &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, SUB n, SUB &lt; n &gt;, SUB &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, CLA n, CLA &lt; n &gt;, CLA &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, STO &lt; n &gt;, STO &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, TRA n, TRA &lt; n &gt;, TRZ n, TRA &lt; n &gt;, HALT }

=== The Pointer machine model ===
{{details|Pointer machine}}

A relative late-comer is Schönhage's Storage Modification Machine or [[pointer machine]]. Another version is the Kolmogorov-Uspensii machine, and the Knuth "linking automaton" proposal. (For references see [[pointer machine]]). Like a state-machine diagram, a node emits at least two labelled "edges" (arrows) that point to another node or nodes which in turn point to other nodes, etc. The outside world points at the center node.

==Machines with input and output==
Any of the above tape-based machines can be equipped with input and output tapes; any of the above register-based machines can be equipped with dedicated input and output registers. For example, the Schönhage pointer-machine model has two instructions called "''input'' ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and "''output'' ''β''".

It is difficult to study [[sublinear]] [[space complexity]] on multi-tape machines with the traditional model, because an input of size ''n'' already takes up space ''n''.  Thus, to study small [[DSPACE]] classes, we must use a different model.  In some sense, if we never "write to" the input tape, we don't want to charge ourself for this space.  And if we never "read from" our output tape, we don't want to charge ourself for this space.

We solve this problem by introducing a ''k''-string Turing machine with input and output.  This is the same as an ordinary ''k''-string Turing machine, except that the transition function {{mvar|&amp;delta;}} is restricted so that the input tape can never be changed, and so that the output head can never move left.  This model allows us to define deterministic space classes smaller than linear.  Turing machines with input-and-output also have the same time complexity as other Turing machines; in the words of Papadimitriou 1994 Prop 2.2:

:For any ''k''-string Turing machine ''M'' operating within time bound {{tmath|f(n)}} there is a {{tmath|(k+2)}}-string Turing machine ''M''’ with input and output, which operates within time bound {{tmath|O(f(n))}}.

''k''-string Turing machines with input and output can be used in the formal definition of the complexity resource [[DSPACE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Christos Papadimitriou]] | year = 1993 | title = Computational Complexity | publisher = Addison Wesley | edition = 1st | isbn = 0-201-53082-1}} Chapter 2: Turing machines, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–56.&lt;/ref&gt;
