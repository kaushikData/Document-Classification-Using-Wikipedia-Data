'''Anxiety buffer disruption theory''' (ABDT) is an application of [[terror management theory]] to explain an individual's reaction to a traumatic event, which leads to [[post traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="mainpaper"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P. (2011). Anxiety buffer disruption theory: A terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping, 24(1), 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Terror management theory posits that humans, unlike any other organism, are uniquely aware that death is the inevitable outcome of life. When thoughts of death are made salient, such as when a terrorist attack carries those thoughts into the level of consciousness, humans are subject to debilitating anxiety unless it can be "buffered." Humans respond to the anxiety and dread [[mortality salience]] produces by clinging  to their [[World view|cultural worldview]], through [[self-esteem]] and also [[Interpersonal relationship|close personal relationships]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, C. &amp; Landau, M. (2005) Communication and terrorism: a terror management theory perspective. Communication Research Reports. Vol. 22 Nos 1–4 pages 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural worldviews, with their cultural norms, religious beliefs and moral values infuse life with meaning. They give life a feeling of normalcy and also a feeling of control. There is no way to definitely prove one's cultural world view, there they are fragile human constructs and must be maintained. Clinging to a cultural worldview and self-esteem buffer the anxiety connected to thoughts of mortality.&lt;ref name="luo"&gt;Luo, S., Shi, Z., Yang, X., Wang., X. &amp; Han, S. (2014) Reminders of mortality decrease midcingulate activity in response to others' suffering. SCAN (9) 477–486.&lt;/ref&gt; When thoughts of death are salient, humans are drawn to their cultural world view which "stipulates appropriate social requirements, and standards for valued conduct, while instilling one's life with meaning, order and permanence." &lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

When a traumatic experience cannot be assimilated into a currently held cultural worldview, the anxiety-buffering mechanisms are disrupted.&lt;ref name="edmonson"&gt;Edmondson, D., Chaudoir, S. R., Mills, M. A., Park, C. L., Holub, J., &amp; Bartkowiak, J. M. (2011). From shattered assumptions to weakened worldviews: Trauma symptoms signal anxiety buffer disruption. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16(4), 358–385.&lt;/ref&gt; ABDT argues that individuals face overwhelming anxiety which leads to the symptoms of PTSD including re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, avoidance and disassociation.&lt;ref name="ABDT"&gt;Pyszczynski, T., &amp; Kesebir, P. Anxiety buffer disruption theory: a terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping. Vol 24. No. 1, Jan. 2011, 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samandmaxfield"&gt;Abdollahi, A., Maxfield, M., Pyszczynski, T, &amp; Luxzezynski, A. Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy. 2011, Vol. 3, Nov. 4, 329–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The dissociation causes atypical responses to mortality salience compared with individuals who do not suffer from an anxiety buffer disruption &lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; When the anxiety buffer disruption is mild, exaggerated coping responses, such as rejecting or taking offense at other cultures, is expected. When the anxiety buffer disruption is severe, there can be a total breakdown of coping mechanisms.&lt;ref name="studyone"&gt;Abdollahi, A., Pyszczynski, T., Maxfield, M., &amp; Luszczynska, A. (2011). Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: Dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 3(4), 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was proposed by [[Tom Pyszczynski]] and  Pelin Kesebir.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;

== Origins ==

=== Shattered assumption theory ===
In 1992, Janoff-Bulman delineated a theory of trauma response ([[Shattered Assumptions Theory]]). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about the world in which they live, based on the belief that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that the individual has self-worth.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;Mills, M. (2010) Shattered assumptions? A prospective study: The impact of trauma of global beliefs and adjustment. Doctoral Dissertations. Paper AAI3447452. http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/AAI3447452.&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered.&lt;ref name="mills" /&gt; The world is no longer benevolent or predictable.
Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further.

=== Anxiety buffer disruption theory ===
Anxiety buffer disruption theory not only focuses on the thoughts and emotions of an individual, but it also studies the behavior that results when terror management theory and shattered assumptions theory are examined together.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Excessive anxiety experienced by post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers occurs because the events causing the post-traumatic stress disorder have demonstrated to these individuals that anxiety-buffering mechanisms are not capable of protecting them from death.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; Individuals who have high levels of [[dissociation (psychology)|peritraumatic dissociation]] and low levels of [[self-efficacy]] coping, two indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder,  have abnormal responses to reminders of death. These individuals in turn do not utilize the coping mechanisms that are typically used to remove the fear of death: culture, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. In fact, in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder, mortality salience coping mechanisms are viewed as worthless and perhaps are even seen to be detestable.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt;

=== Components of anxiety buffers ===

* '''Cultural Worldview''':  Individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder will often reject their culture when provided with mortality salience triggers, the direct opposite of what terror management theory demonstrates to be true in those without post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="ABDT" /&gt; Cultural worldviews infuse life with structure, purpose and meaning. People maintain these fragile constructions by preferring the company of the like-minded. But when faced with a traumatic event, there are times when the horror cannot be assimilated into the framework of the person's existing cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="mainpaper"/&gt;
* '''Self-Esteem''': Various studies demonstrate that individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder also have decreased self-esteem. Self-esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt; High self-esteem can displace defensive responses and buffer against the terror of mortality salience because it is a signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view.&lt;ref name="edmonson" /&gt; Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system. PTSD is related to a breakdown in this system, and noted that veterans with past and present, or ongoing PTSD have shown to have lower self-esteem. According to ABDT this leaves this group particularly vulnerable to anxiety, since self-worth is an integral part of the individual’s anxiety- buffering mechanism. [1]
* '''Close Relationships''': It is often mentioned that worldview and self-esteem affect ways in which our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. Close relationships also serve as a regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that close relationships played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of close relationships in Terror Management Theories.&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;Florian, V., Mikulincer, M., &amp; Hirschberger, G. (2002). The anxiety-buffering function of close relationships: evidence that relationship commitment acts as a terror management mechanism. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82(4), 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Close relationships seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people’s genes through their offspring. Therefore, close relationships increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers.&lt;ref name="buss"&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological review, 100(2), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization.&lt;ref name="maslow"&gt;Maslow, A. H., Frager, R., &amp; Cox, R. (1970). Motivation and personality (Vol. 2). J. Fadiman, &amp; C. McReynolds (Eds.). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation and maintenance of close relationships have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from close relationships. Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of close relationships may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Close relationships appear to have inoculating power against basic existential threats, which allows people to respond to these threats by fulfilling relational potentials. Second, it seems the sense of relationship commitment is shaped by not only perceived relational investment, gains, and potential alternatives, as well as the existential need of denial of death awareness. Third, it seems processes of terror management not only include worldview defenses to protect the self, but also promote commitment to significant others and the expansion of the self, provided by these relationships.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

An important finding is that close relationships may serve as a fundamental anxiety buffer. It appears close relationships not only protect individuals from concrete and actual threats or danger, but also offers a symbolic shield against the awareness of one’s finitude. Since the threat of death is inescapable, the support from those close to us make may make the thought of death more tolerable by giving meaning to our lives by being important to others.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

As other anxiety buffers, interpersonal relationships are damaged as well in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder. People with post traumatic stress disorder have higher rates of divorce, more difficulty with their children, are more prone to domestic violence, and are emotionally distant from loved ones. All of these are damaging and as a result, terror management cannot be accomplished through close interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="mainpaper" /&gt;

== Anxiety buffer disruption theory studies ==

=== Posttraumatic stress reactions ===
A study looked at dissociation responses and PTSD in students who survived the [[2005 Zarand earthquake]] in Iran. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,500 people and displaced more than 6,700 for two months or more. It looked at dissociation one month later then two years later to see if level of dissociation predicted PTSD.

Four weeks after the earthquake, researchers solicited for volunteers at local universities. All of the participants met the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] criterion for a Class A1 trauma. Many were wearing black mourning clothes or had injuries from the earthquake.

Three priming conditions were employed: mortality salience, earthquake or dental pain. The researchers then evaluated  how the subjects felt toward foreign aid in the wake of the disaster. The results indicated that subjects with high dissociative tendencies showed no effect of mortality salience on attitudes toward the foreign aid. Subjects with low dissociative tendencies reacted as terror management theory predicts when confronted with mortality salience and thought of the earthquake.

Two years after the quake, the researchers returned and 172 of the original respondents participated. They predicted that subjects with high PTSD symptoms would have a disrupted worldview on both foreign aid and the [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress code]]. They found a strong relationship between dissociation and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Even after the passage of two years, subjects with high dissociative tendencies were still not defending against existential threats in a way typical for the population who has not experienced trauma.&lt;ref name="studyone"/&gt;

=== Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity ===
105 students of the University of Abidjan took the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version and then an opinion survey on the civil war in [[Cote d'Ivoire]]. Last, they took part in a word-completion task designed to measure their accessibility of death-related thoughts. This study, unlike previous studies related to terror management theory, looked at the subjects' thoughts of death as related to the war, a specific traumatic event.

In the [[Scientific control|control condition]], where subjects were asked to talk about their anxiety related to their worst exam, death thought accessibility was lower for those with higher levels of PTSD. This suggests that people suffering from strong PTSD repress thoughts of death. But when mortality was made salient, it provoked a marked increase in death thought accessibility for those with high PTSD. The results indicate that the anxiety buffer of death thought suppression under normal circumstances failed when subjects were reminded of the traumatic event.

A second experiment was conducted with 197 students of the University of Ajidjan where they evaluated exposure (proximity) to a traumatic event. In this case, it was geographical location to the civil war. The researchers hypothesized that subjects who lived where the fighting was more constant and intense would be more likely to increase their PTSD reports when mortality was made salient. Those who lived in an area of less conflict should not increase their reports of PTSD. As a form of defensive denial, the researchers predicted they might report lower levels of symptoms. As expected, subjects who had more exposure to war reported greater PTSD symptoms in the mortality salience condition.&lt;ref name="tard"&gt;Chatard, A., Pyszczynski, T., Arndt, J., Selimbegović, L., Konan, P. N., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2012). Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity as predictors of anxiety-buffer functioning. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 4(1), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arctic foothills tundra''' is an [[ecoregion]] of the far north of North America, lying inland from the north coast of [[Alaska]]. This is permafrost tundra with an average annual temperature below freezing.

==Setting==
This is a hilly area that lies between the boggier [[Arctic coastal tundra]] to the north and the [[Brooks Range]] to the south, and stretching from the [[Chukchi Sea]] east across northern Alaska to the border with [[Canada]]'s [[Yukon Territory]]. The [[Noatak River]] valley is the only forested area.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na1104|name=Arctic foothills tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The main vegetation is the scrubby cottongrass (''[[Eriophorum vaginatum]]''), stiff sedge (''[[Carex bigelowii]]'') and shrubs such as ''[[Betula nana]]'', ''[[Empetrum nigrum]]'', ''[[Rhododendron subarcticum]]'', and the berry ''[[Vaccinium vitis-idaea]]''.

==Fauna==
The [[Colville River (Alaska)|Colville River]] is a migration route for wildlife including [[moose]], and a breeding area for [[gyrfalcon]], [[peregrine falcon]], and [[rough-legged hawk]]s. The ecoregion is also home to a number of waterbirds.
Mammals include the large ungulates [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') and [[caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus''), the predators [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') and [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') breed here, while smaller mammals include [[Alaskan hare]] (''Lepus othus'') and [[Arctic ground squirrel]] (''Spermophilus parryi'').

==Threats and preservation==
This ecoregion is unspoilt except that it is crossed by the [[Dalton Highway]] and the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]], which can disrupt migratory behaviour of some wildlife. The east end of the ecoregion is part of the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]].

'''Bernard d'Abrera''' (28 August 1940 – 13 January 2017) was an Australian [[entomological]] [[taxonomist]] and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], particularly noted for his books on true butterflies ([[Papilionoidea]]) and larger moths of the world ([[Saturniidae]] and [[Sphingidae]]). Referred to as one of the world's best-known [[lepidopterists]] by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Museum's move puts butterfly world in a flutter |author=Charles Clover |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]]|page=5|date= 27 November 2004|accessdate=28 January 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1477627/Museum-move-puts-butterfly-world-in-a-flutter.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; his work since 1982 was openly critical of [[evolution]].

== Biography ==
Bernard d'Abrera was a graduate of the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], Australia. While at the university in 1964 he with a group of other students kidnapped an alligator from Taronga Zoo as a Foundation Day prank. Using 80 biology students as a shield, the group captured the animal in a bag and walked out through the turnstiles. The animal was returned after payment of a £100 ransom, which went towards establishing the first aboriginal scholarship of the University of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/foundationday.html |title=University of New South Wales - Records and Archives Office - Foundation Day Exhibition |publisher=Recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1965, with a double major in History &amp; Philosophy of Science and History. He has a  diploma in Education (Melbourne T.C., 1972).

D'Abrera spent over forty years photographing museum specimens of butterflies and moths, as well as identifying and cataloguing specimens around the world.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/LETTOW.DABRERA081507.pdf Opinion and Order] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514090656/http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/LETTOW.DABRERA081507.pdf |date=14 May 2009 }}, Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He has also visited the [[Macleay Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usyd.edu.au/museums/pdfs_docs/macleay_news/cnews08.pdf ''Macleay Museum News''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912024601/http://www.usyd.edu.au/museums/pdfs_docs/macleay_news/cnews08.pdf |date=12 September 2007 }}, usyd.edu.au. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sydney]].
He contributed his butterfly and moth photographs to other books not authored by him.&lt;ref name=court /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UK |url=http://www.nhbs.com/the_butterflies_of_the_malay_peninsula_tefno_5567.html&amp;tab_tag=album |title=The Butterflies of the Malay Peninsula - AS Corbet and HM Pendlebury |publisher=NHBS |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[D'Abrera's tiger]], ''Parantica dabrerai'', an Indonesian butterfly species is named for him, as is ''[[Gnathothlibus dabrera]]'', a species of Indonesian moth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sphin-sea.unibas.ch/SphinSEA/species%20pages/Gn_dabrera.htm |title=The Sphingidae of Southeast |publisher=Sphin-sea.unibas.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726051925/http://www.sphin-sea.unibas.ch/SphinSEA/species%20pages/Gn_dabrera.htm |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, d'Abrera helped uncover a smuggling ring on [[Papua New Guinea]] estimated to have earned at least $200,000 annually through the rare butterfly black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australian entomologist Bernard D'Abrera comments on network of smugglers and black marketeers|author=Sandra Salmans|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 April 1978|accessdate=7 December 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/pinning-down-the-elusive-butterfly.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, d'Abrera and his wife Lucilla founded Hill House Publishers, a publishing house based in [[Melbourne]] and [[London]], to publish among other things, his own work. In 1987, Hill House began a project to produce antiquarian facsimiles of the works of Victorian ornithologist [[John Gould]], based on the Natural History Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillhouse-publishers.com/about-hill-house-publishers |title=About Hill House Publishers &amp;#124; HillHouse |publisher=Hillhouse-publishers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711171059/http://www.hillhouse-publishers.com/about-hill-house-publishers |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill House also publishes authentic facsimiles of documents, prints, and antiquarian maps, including an atlas of the [[Dutch Indies]] for the Royal Dutch Geographical Society (KNAG - Gemilang, Landsmeer, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hillhouse-publishers.com/ | title=Official Website for Hill House Publishers | publisher=Hill House Publishers | accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 review of the book ''The Last Sorcerer: Echoes of the Rainforest'', ''[[Townsend Letter]]'' quoted from d'Abrera's 1984 book ''Butterflies of South America,'' writing: "The greatest number and diversity of insect and plant species occur in the Neotropics, a vast amount of which is still being discovered and described. Paradoxically, an almost equal amount of unknown creatures is being destroyed even before their discovery, because of the violent and ruthless destruction by civilized man of the complex miracles that make up the Neotropical ecosystem. History alone will pour out its wrathful judgement on these disgraceful goings-on, because contemporary man is too besotted with economic trivia to comprehend the consequences of his avaricious deeds. - Bernard D'Abrera Butterflies of South America (1984)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adventure and Research in the Rainforest. (Book Corner). |author=Irene Alleger |newspaper=[[Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients]] |date=1 February 2002|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution==
D'Abrera is listed as a signatory on the petition known as "[[A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]", a [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|campaign]] begun in 2001 by the [[Discovery Institute]]. D'Abrera is also a fellow of the pro-[[intelligent design]] organization, [[International Society for Complexity, Information and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php Society Fellows], [[International Society for Complexity, Information and Design]] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Abrera was strongly opposed to the theory of evolution because in his view it is not a bona fide scientific theory. He describes evolution theory as "viscid, asphyxiating baggage" that requires "blind religious faith",&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Atlas of the Butterflies of the World'', Bernard d'Abrera, Hill House Publishers, Melb.&amp; Lond., 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-947352-37-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed it cannot be tested or demonstrated in any natural frame of reference, and therefore it may not be considered even a scientific postulate. The [[Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|objection that evolution is unfalsifiable]] has been widely rejected by the scientific community. D'Abrera's views on evolution and science have been criticised by Arthur Shapiro, who describes him as "profoundly anti-scientific — not ''un''scientific, but hostile to science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = (Review of) Bernard d'Abrera, Butterflies of the Holarctic Region, Part I | journal = Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera | first = Arthur | last = Shapiro | volume = 30 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 142–144| id = | url = http://lepidopteraresearchfoundation.org/journals/30/PDF30/30-142.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Arthur Shapiro (ecologist)|Arthur Shapiro]], an [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[entomologist]] at the [[University of California at Davis]], described d'Abrera's books thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Laufer | first1 = Peter. | title = The dangerous world of butterflies : the startling subculture of criminals, collectors, and conservationist | year = 2009 | publisher = Lyons Press | location = Guilford, Conn. | isbn = 1-59921-555-1 | page = 215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Attention should be paid to their stupidities, their errors, their pig-headedness, their bad writing. The thing is, as I say in my reviews, they're absolutely indispensable. There's nothing else like them. If you're trying to identify exotic butterflies outside your geographic area, the primary and secondary literatures are so scattered and relatively inaccessible, you're out of hope. Big coffee table picture books are the only way to go. But if you're going to do that, at least get input from the people in the areas you cover geographically so you don't make an ass of yourself.}}

[[Philip James DeVries]] described him as "likely one of the  best known Lepidopterists in the world, and therefore, an eminence on all things butterfly'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peabody.research.yale.edu/jls/pdfs/2000s/2003/2003-57%281%2975-DeVries.pdf Peabody research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807221057/http://peabody.research.yale.edu/jls/pdfs/2000s/2003/2003-57%281%2975-DeVries.pdf |date=7 August 2011 }}, Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with recruiting high-profile speakers, the Biennial commissions major artistic exhibitions throughout the city of Denver. Artists and architects from across the Americas participate in the programming.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biennial of the Americas 2013 Draft Urbanism|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/2013-draft-urbanism/|publisher=E-flux}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Biennial of the Americas’ 2013 exhibition, Draft Urbanism, was curated by Carson Chan, Gaspar Libedinsky, Paul Andersen, and Cortney Stell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Curators Elaborate the 2013 Biennial of the Americas, Draft Urbanism...|url=http://www.biennialfoundation.org/2013/06/four-curators-elaborate-the-2013-biennial-of-the-americas-draft-urbanism-that-brings-together-artists-and-architects-from-across-the-americas-to-examine-our-evolving-relationship-with-the-urban-fabr/|publisher=Biennial Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The exhibition brought together artists and architects from across the Americas to create site-specific art and architectural installations throughout Downtown Denver and in the historic McNichols Building. The exhibition explored the many meanings of the word “draft,” looking at the ideas of iteration, process, and the ever-changing urban fabric.  In addition to last year's Draft Urbanism, the Biennial of the Americas will highlight Denver’s cultural offerings with featured exhibitions, films, public parties, performances, and other events intended to explore the various cultures of the Americas during the upcoming festival as well.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forbes|first=Alexander|title=Curator Carson Chan on Serving Up 2013's Beer-Themed Biennial of the Americas|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/898949/curator-carson-chan-on-serving-up-2013s-beer-themed-biennial|publisher=Blouin Art Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

:[[File:John W. Hickenlooper World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|right|thumb|Governor John Hiickenlooper]]
Before becoming governor, John Hickenlooper served as the Mayor of Denver from 2003-2011.  During that time he developed a vision for an event that would celebrate the ideas and cultures of the Americas, believing that such an event would highlight Denver as a hub for bipartisan discussion.

{{Economics sidebar}}

'''Blue economy''' is a term in [[economics]] relating to the exploitation and preservation of the marine environment. Its scope of interpretation varies among organizations.

==Definitions==
According to the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Blue Economy?|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/infographic/2017/06/06/blue-economy|website=THE WORLD BANK|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the blue economy is the "sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem."

[[European Commission]] defines it as "All economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. It covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=The 2018 Annual Economic Report on EU Blue Economy|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-annual-economic-report-on-blue-economy_en.pdf|journal=European Union|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] considers it "an emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or 'blue' resources."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/blue-economy|title=Blue economy {{!}} The Commonwealth|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|website=thecommonwealth.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation International]] adds that "blue economy also includes economic benefits that may not be marketed, such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.conservation.org/2018/03/what-on-earth-is-the-blue-economy/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwl9zdBRDgARIsAL5Nyn3xGXHsApcgFjjO6CvN0Zg602NYYuJw2LPvqa_nDpKKxPtNDJWQxLYaAvSLEALw_wcB|title=What on Earth is the ‘blue economy’? – Human Nature - Conservation...|last=Bertazzo|first=Sophie|date=2018-03-07|work=Human Nature – Conservation International Blog|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for the Blue Economy]] says "it is now a widely used term around the world with three related but distinct meanings- the overall contribution of the oceans to economies, the need to address the environmental and ecological sustainability of the oceans, and the ocean economy as a growth opportunity for both developed and developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy/about/history|title=Our History and Methodology|website=Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Wildlife Fund]] begins its report&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/15_1471_blue_economy_6_pages_final.pdf|title=Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY|last=|first=|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|year=|isbn=|location=|page=2|pages=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Principles for a Sustainable BLUE ECONOMY'' with two senses given to this term: "For some, blue economy means the use of the sea and its resources for sustainable economic development. For others, it simply refers to any economic activity in the maritime sector, whether sustainable or not."

As the WWF reveals in its purpose of the report, there is still no widely accepted definition of the term blue economy despite increasing high-level adoption of it as a concept and as a goal of policy-making and investment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Related terms ==

=== Ocean economy ===
A related term of blue economy is ocean economy and we see some organizations using the two terms interchangeably. However, these two terms represent different concepts. Ocean economy simply deals with the use of ocean resources and is strictly aimed at empowering the economic system of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.examrace.com/Current-Affairs/NEWS-Blue-Economy-Versus-Ocean-Economy.htm|title=Blue Economy versus Ocean Economy- Translation in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Sindhi, Sindhi, Tamil, Telgu - Examrace|last=Examrace|website=www.examrace.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy goes beyond viewing the ocean economy solely as a mechanism for economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It focuses on the sustainability of ocean for economic growth. Therefore, blue economy encompasses ecological aspects of the ocean along with economic aspects.

=== Green economy ===
The [[green economy]] is defined as an economy that aims at reducing environmental risks, and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the environment. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]]. Therefore, blue economy is a part of green economy.  During Rio+20 Summit in June 2012, Pacific small island developing states stated that, for them, "a green economy was in fact a blue economy".&lt;ref name="Really"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/homepage.cfm?249111/What-a-blue-economy-really-is|title=What a 'blue economy' really is – WWF’s perspective|date=10 July 2015|website=WWF|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue growth ===
A related term is blue growth, which means "support to the growth of the maritime sector in a sustainable way."&lt;ref name="Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=BLUE GROWTH|url=http://ec.europa.eu/assets/mare/infographics/|website=Mare|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is adopted by the European Union as an integrated maritime policy to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/blue_growth_en|title=Blue growth - Maritime Affairs - European Commission|last=Anonymous|date=2016-09-28|website=Maritime Affairs - European Commission|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential==
On top of the traditional ocean activities such as fisheries, tourism and maritime transport, blue economy entails emerging industries including renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive activities and marine biotechnology and bioprospecting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Potential of the Blue Economy : Increasing Long-term Benefits of the Sustainable Use of Marine Resources for Small Island Developing States and Coastal Least Developed Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/26843/115545.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=World Bank|volume=|pages=ix|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue economy also attempts to embrace ocean ecosystem services that are not captured by the market but provide significant contribution to economic and human activity. They include carbon sequestration, coastal protection, waste disposal, and the existence of biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The 2015 WWF briefing puts the value of key ocean assets over US$24 trillion.&lt;ref name="Really" /&gt; Fisheries are now overexploited, but there is still plenty of room for aquaculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujita|first1=Rod|title=FAO Reports 87% of the World’s Fisheries are Overexploited or Fully Exploited|url=http://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2012/07/11/fao-reports-87-of-the-worlds-fisheries-are-overexploited-or-fully-exploited/|website=FAO|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offshore wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind EUROPE|last2=BVGassociates|title=Unleashing Europe’s offshore wind potential|date=June 2017|location=Brussels, Belgium|page=16|url=https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/reports/Unleashing-Europes-offshore-wind-potential.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector with the supply of 58 percent of fish to global markets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aquaculture is vital to food security of the poorest countries especially. Only in the [[European Union]] the blue economy employed 3,362,510 people in 2014.&lt;ref name="Commission" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
The World Bank specifies three challenges that limit the potential to develop a blue economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Current economic trends that have been rapidly degrading ocean resources.
# The lack of investment in human capital for employment and development in innovative blue economy sectors.
# Inadequate care for marine resources and ecosystem services of the oceans.

'''Cirrus fibratus''' is a type of [[cirrus cloud]]. The name ''cirrus fibratus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "fibrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of fibratus, fibratus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=2022232&amp;p2=f&amp;p3=2 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clouds are similar to [[cirrus uncinus]], commonly known as "mares' tails"; however, fibratus clouds do not have tufts or hooks at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=fibratus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filaments are usually separate from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrus fibratus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrus/cirrus-fibratus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[cirrus cloud]]s, cirrus fibratus occur at high [[altitude]]s. They can indicate an approaching [[warm front]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulus Clouds |url=http://www.wolstanton.org.uk/public_html/web_weather/web/gallery_clouds_cirrus.php|work=Clouds |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=Wolstanton Weather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327014352/http://www.wolstanton.org.uk/public_html/web_weather/web/gallery_clouds_cirrus.php|archivedate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they can also be an indication that fair weather will follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cirrus Fibratus (Ci fib) |url=http://www.theweatherobserver.com/?p=71 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=The Weather Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Croatian Natural History Museum''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski prirodoslovni muzej}}) is the oldest and biggest [[natural history museum]] and the main body for natural history research, preservation and collection in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="mdc museum mission"&gt;{{cite web |title=Poslanje muzeja |url=http://hvm.mdc.hr/hrvatski-prirodoslovni-muzej,600%3aZAG/hr/info/|publisher=Museum Documentation Centre |location=Zagreb |language=hr |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on [[Dimitrije Demeter]] Street in [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]], one of the oldest neighbourhoods of the Croatian capital [[Zagreb]], it owns one of the biggest museum collections in Croatia, with over 2&amp;nbsp;million artefacts, including over 1.1&amp;nbsp;million animal specimens. It was founded in 1846 as the "National Museum". The National Museum was later split up into five museums, three of which were in 1986 merged as departments of the newly named Croatian Natural History Museum. The museum contains a large scientific library open to the public, and publishes the first Croatian natural history scientific journal, ''Natura Croatica''.

The permanent display of the Croatian Natural History Museum consists of mineralogical, petrographical and zoological collections, as well as two permanent exhibits in the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]]: the Rock Map of Croatia and the Geological Pole. It is home to the remains of the [[Krapina remains|Neanderthal from Krapina]].

== History ==
[[File:Hrvatski prirodoslovni muzej (ploca).jpg|thumb|left|Museum plaque]]
The history of the Croatian Natural History Museum begins with the founding of the so-called "National Museum" ({{lang|hr|Narodni muzej}}) on 10 September 1846, the first museum for historic and pre-historic objects related to Croatia.&lt;ref name="informatica museologica" /&gt; In 1867, it was moved to its current address.&lt;ref name="mdc about museum"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the museum |url=http://hvm.mdc.hr/croatian-natural-history-museum,600%3aZAG/en/info/|publisher=Museum Documentation Centre| location=Zagreb |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Museum grew and was split into five new museums by the end of the 19th century. Three of them covered natural history: the Croatian National Zoological Museum ({{lang|hr|Hrvatski narodni zoološki muzej}}), the Geological–Palaeontological Museum ({{lang|hr|Geološko-paleontološki muzej}}) and the Mineralogical–Petrographic Museum ({{lang|hr|Mineraloško-petrografski muzej}}). All three were housed in the same building on Demeter Street 1, and, in 1986, united into the Croatian Natural History Museum.&lt;ref name="informatica museologica"&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Balabanić |first1=Josip  |last2=Ćaleta|first2=Darija  |last3=Vuković |first3=Marijana  |title=Prirodoslovni muzeji i znanstveni rad  |journal=Informatica Museologica  |date=July 1999  |volume=29 |issue=3–4  |page=47–54 |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=210954  |accessdate=6 August 2015 |trans-title=Natural History Museums and Scientific Research |publisher=Museum Documentation Centre |location=Zagreb  |language=hr |issn=1849-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum's current building was earlier home to [[Amadeo's theatre]], the first theatre in Zagreb.&lt;ref name="informatica museologica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="museum beginnings"&gt;{{cite web |title=Postanak i ustrojstvo muzeja |url=http://hpm.web.link2.hr/O%20muzeju./Postanak%20i%20ustrojstvo%20muzeja|publisher=Croatian Natural History Museum |language=hr |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 1797 by [[Antal Amade de Varkony]], the prefect of [[Zagreb County (former)|Zagreb County]], it operated until 1834. In 2000, Amadeo's theatre was revived as a yearly summer series of theatrical plays entitled ''[[Amadeo Theatre and Music Company|Scena Amadeo]]'' ("Amadeo Scene") held in the museum atrium.&lt;ref name="about museum"&gt;{{cite web |title=O muzeju |url=http://hpm.web.link2.hr/O%20muzeju./O%20muzeju|publisher=Croatian Natural History Museum |language=hr |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vecernji amadeo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Scena Amadeo za dobar večernji provod u Prirodoslovnom muzeju |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kazaliste/scena-amadeo-za-dobar-vecernji-provod-u-prirodoslovnom-muzeju-306999|website=[[Večernji list]] |language=hr |accessdate=6 August 2015 |date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its oldest books were printed in 17th-century Italy, and includes works by [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], [[Niccolò Gualtieri]] and [[Carl Linné]].&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web |title=Knjižnica |url=http://hpm.web.link2.hr/Knji%C5%BEnica.|publisher=Croatian Natural History Museum |language=hr |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="im library history"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ćaleta|first1=Darija |title=Iz povijesti knjižnice Hrvatskoga prirodoslovnog muzeja |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=210993&amp;lang=en |journal=Informatica Museologica |date=February 1999 |volume=29|issue=1–2 |pages=45–50 |accessdate=14 August 2015|trans-title=From the history of the library of the Croatian Natural History Museum|publisher=Museum Documentation Centre|location=Zagreb |language=hr |issn=1849-4277|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was founded in 1868 by a newly appointed museum director, [[Spiridon Brusina]]. Starting from a meager corpus acquired from the [[National and University Library in Zagreb|National Library]], including only three books on zoology, Brusina traveled throughout then-[[Austria-Hungary]] in order to acquire books. In 1875, the museum acquired the large library and natural history collection of [[Francesco Lanza]], a physician and archaeologist from [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Croatia. Brusina retired in 1901, reporting a collection 1,800 works in 3,948 volumes three years earlier. In 1928, it was recorded that the library held 5,838 books in 9,901 volumes. As the library was not professionally maintained during the [[Croatian War of Independence]] or inventoried since, it is not known how many titles it holds. A 1999 estimate is 30,000 volumes and 13,100 [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref name="im library history" /&gt;

== Journals ==
In 1885, Brusina led a successful initiative to publish ''The Journal of the Croatian Natural History Society'' ({{lang|hr|Glasnik Hrvatskoga naravoslovnoga družtva}}).&lt;ref name="im library history" /&gt; The journal is published since 1972 under the title ''Periodicum biologorum'', and focuses on [[biology]] and [[biomedicine]], [[forestry]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name="im library history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrcak pb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Periodicum biologorum |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/pb|website=Hrčak|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]] |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the museum began publishing ''Natura Croatica'', a peer-reviewed biological and geological academic journal.&lt;ref name="natura croatica"&gt;{{cite web |title=Natura Croatica |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/natura-croatica?lang=en|website=Hrčak|publisher=[[University of Zagreb]] |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural history journal was the first of its kind in Croatia, despite the existence of seven natural history museums.&lt;ref name="informatica museologica" /&gt; The journal is published quarterly in English, and reviewed by both Croatian and foreign scholars.&lt;ref name="im library history" /&gt;

The museum is divided into Mineralogical–Petrographical, Geological–Palaeontological, Zoological and Botanical Departments. The first three are successors to the National Museum's 19th-century offspring museums, while the Botanical Department was established in 1990.&lt;ref name="informatica museologica" /&gt;

The museum's holdings number over 2 million rocks, minerals, fossils, and other artefacts collected all over the country. The zoological collection consists of 1,135,000 animal specimens, including a [[tissue bank]] for [[DNA analysis]].&lt;ref name="about museum" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mdc&gt;{{cite web |title=Croatian Natural History Museum |url=http://hvm.mdc.hr/croatian-natural-history-museum,600%3AZAG/en/info/|publisher=Museum Documentation Centre |location=Zagreb |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds the [[Krapina remains|remains]] of the [[Neanderthal]] man found near [[Krapina]] by [[Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger]], a former director of the National Museum. The original remains are held in the museum's [[safe|vault]], while a replica is being exhibited in the Krapina museum.&lt;ref name="jutarnji krapina man"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sutlić|first1=Korana |title=Sve tajne zbirke Krapinca o kojoj izvještavaju CNN i New York Times |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/sve-tajne-zbirke-krapinca-o-kojoj-izvjestavaju-cnn-i-new-york-times/1323218/|website=[[Jutarnji list]] |accessdate=6 August 2015 |language=hr |date=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jutarnji vučedol dove"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sutlić|first1=Korana |title=Vučedolska golubica ipak se ne vraća kući |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vucedolska-golubica-ipak-se-ne-vraca-kuci/1319477/|website=[[Jutarnji list]] |language=hr |accessdate=6 August 2015 |date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes the skeleton of a [[Mediterranean monk seal]], a [[basking shark]] native to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and an [[Atlantic puffin]], a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the Adriatic in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="zoological collection" /&gt;

The mineralogical and petrographical collections are divided into three exhibitions. "From a Collection to a Museum" ({{lang|hr|Od zbirke do muzeja}}) showcases the work of Croatian mineralogists and petrographers through history, including a [[geological map]] of [[Moslavačka gora]] in central Croatia by [[Ljudevit Vukotinović]], as well as the work of [[Đuro Pilar]], one of the first Croatian academic geologists. "The Empire of Minerals" ({{lang|hr|Carstvo minerala}}) displays a collection of minerals assembled by location of discovery, including collections of [[agate]] from [[Lepoglava]] and [[opal]], [[gemstone]]s rare in Croatia. "Rocky Planet Earth" ({{lang|hr|Stjenoviti planet Zemlja}}) is organized by [[list of rock types|rock types]], and also contains [[meteorite]]s, [[lava]] from [[Vesuvius]] and [[speleothem]]s. In 2014, the exhibitions were made accessible to blind people.&lt;ref name="min-petr collection" /&gt;

The [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the museum contains two exhibits: the Rock Map of Croatia (''Kamenospisna karta Hrvatske'') and the Geological Pole (''Geološki stup'').

In [[physics]], the '''Dember effect''' is when the [[electron]] [[electric current|current]] from a [[cathode]] &lt;math&gt;(I_3)&lt;/math&gt; subjected to both illumination and a simultaneous electron bombardment is greater than the sum of the [[photoelectric]] current &lt;math&gt;(I_1)&lt;/math&gt; and the secondary emission current &lt;math&gt;(I_2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Seeger2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karlheinz Seeger|title=Semiconductor Physics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLboCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-05025-5|pages=151–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Discovered by [[Harry Dember]] (1882–1943) in 1925, this effect is due to the sum of the excitations of an electron by two means: photonic illumination and electron bombardment (i.e. the sum of the two excitations extracts the electron). In Dember’s initial study, he referred only to metals; however, more complex materials have been analyzed since then.

==Photoelectric effect==
The [[photoelectric effect]] due to the illumination of the metallic surface extracts electrons (if the energy of the photon is greater than the extraction work) and excites the electrons which the photons don’t have the energy to extract.

In a similar process, the electron bombardment of the metal both extracts and excites electrons inside the metal.

: &lt;math&gt;  I_3-I_2-I_1=I_4 \, &lt;/math&gt;

If one considers &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; a constant and increases &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt;, it can be observed that &lt;math&gt;I_4&lt;/math&gt; has a maximum of about 150 times &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, considering &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; a constant and increasing the intensity of the illumination &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;I_4&lt;/math&gt;, supplementary current, tends to saturate. This is due to the usage in the photoelectric effect of all the electrons excited (sufficiently) by the primary electrons of &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">'''Dense-rock equivalent''' is a [[volcanology|volcanologic]] calculation used to estimate [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]] volume. One of the widely accepted measures of the size of a historic or prehistoric eruption is the volume of [[magma]] ejected as [[pumice]] and [[volcanic ash]], known as [[tephra]] during an explosive phase of the eruption, or the volume of [[lava]] [[Extrusive|extruded]] during an effusive phase of a volcanic eruption. Eruption volumes are commonly expressed in cubic kilometers (km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

Historical and geological estimates of tephra volumes are usually obtained by mapping the distribution and thickness of tephra deposits on the ground after the eruption is over.  For historical volcanic explosions, further estimates must be made of tephra deposits that might have changed significantly over time by other geological processes including erosion.  Tephra volumes measured in this way must then be corrected for void spaces ([[Vesicular texture|vesicles]] - bubbles within the pumice, empty spaces between individual pieces of pumice or ash) to get an estimate of the original volume of [[magma]] erupted. This correction can be made by comparing the bulk density of the tephra deposit with the known [[density]] of the original gas-free rock-type that makes up the tephra. The result is referred to as the dense-rock equivalent of the erupted volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Note on Eruption Sizes|work=Long Valley Observatory Volcano Hazards Program|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|date=1999-11-30|url=http://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/sizes.html|accessdate=2007-03-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204142745/http://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/sizes.html|archivedate=2007-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dense-rock equivalent calculations can also be used to measure the sizes of volcanic eruptions on other planetary bodies, such as [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2001/2000JE001420.shtml|title=Estimation of volcanic eruption conditions for a large flank event on Elysium Mons, Mars|last=Wilson|first =L|author2=Mouginis-Mark, PJ|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=106|issue=E9|pages=20621–20628|year=2001|accessdate=2007-04-15|doi=10.1029/2000JE001420|bibcode=2001JGR...10620621W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the challenge to making these estimates is accurately estimating the density of the tephra deposit or of the dense rock, measuring the thickness of tephra, determining if the tephra is related to the eruption studied or to a nearby one, and estimating changes resulting from other geological processes that may be less understood than on [[Earth]].

Significant studies of the dense-rock equivalent erupted volumes of the [[Bronze-Age]] [[Minoan eruption]] in [[Santorini]] have provided data to [[archeology|archeologists]] to better understand the effect of the eruption on development of several [[civilization]]s including [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Egyptian]] cultures.  Through careful analysis of pumice and ash deposits (including [[deep sea]] [[core sample]]s), researchers have been able to make dense-rock equivalent volume estimates for each of the major eruptions of Thera.&lt;ref name="Thera"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thera and the Aegean World III.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">A '''drainage equation''' is an equation describing the relation between depth and spacing of parallel subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drains]], depth of the [[watertable]], depth and [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soils. It is used in [[drainage]] design.
[[File:Drainsection.PNG|thumb|400px|Parameters in Hooghoudt's drainage equation]]

A well known [[steady-state]] drainage equation is the Hooghoudt drain spacing equation. Its original publication is in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;S.B.Hooghoudt, 1940 (in Dutch). ''Algemene beschouwing van het probleem van de detailontwatering en de infiltratie door middel van parallel loopende drains, greppels, slooten en kanalen''. No. 7 in de serie: Bijdragen tot de kennis van eenige natuurkundige grootheden van den grond. Bodemkundig Instituut te Groningen. Rijksuitgeverij Dienst van de  Nderlandse Staatscourant. 's-Gravenhage, Algemeene Landsdrukkerij.&lt;/ref&gt; The equation was introduced in the USA by van Schilfgaarde.&lt;ref&gt;J. van Schilfgaarde, 1957. ''Approximate solutions to drainage flow problems''. In: J.N.Luthin (Ed.), Drainage of agricultural lands, p.79-112. Agron. Monogr. 7. ASA, Madison, WI, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hooghoudt's equation==
Hooghoudt's equation can be written as:.&lt;ref&gt;H.P.Ritzema, 1994, ''Subsurface flow to drains''. Chapter 8 in: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, Publ. 16, pp. 236-304, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Q L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 Kb d (Dd - Dw) + 4 Ka (Dd - Dw)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

where:
* Q	= [[steady state]] drainage discharge rate (m/day)
* Ka	= [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soil above drain level (m/day)
* Kb 	= [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soil below drain level (m/day)
* Di 	= depth of the impermeable layer below drain level (m)
* Dd 	= depth of the drains (m)
* Dw 	= steady state depth of the [[watertable]] midway between the drains (m)
* L  	= spacing between the drains (m)
* d  	= equivalent depth, a function of L, (Di-Dd), and r
* r  	= drain radius (m)

''Steady (equilibrium) state condition'' &lt;br /&gt;
In [[steady state]], the level of the water table remains constant and the discharge rate (Q) equals the rate of [[groundwater recharge]] (R), i.e. the amount of water entering the [[groundwater]] through the [[watertable]] per unit of time. By considering a long-term (e.g. seasonal) average depth of the water table (Dw) in combination with the long-term average recharge rate (R), the net storage of water in that period of time is negligibly small and the steady state condition is satisfied: one obtains a [[dynamic equilibrium]]. 

''Derivation of the equation'' &lt;br /&gt;
For the derivation of the equation Hooghoudt used the [[Darcy's law|law of Darcy]], the summation of circular [[Hydraulic head|potential functions]] and, for the determination of the influence of the impermeable layer, de method of [[mirror image]]s and [[Superposition principle|superposition]]. &lt;br /&gt;
Hooghoudt published tables for the determination of the equivalent depth (d), because the function (F) in d = F (L,Di-Dd,r) consists of long series of terms.
[[File:R-3VAR1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Crop yield (Y) and seasonal average depth of water table (X in dm) &lt;ref&gt; Data provided by various authors on banana, cotton, sugarcane and wheat response to shallow water tables [https://www.waterlog.info/cropwat.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; ]]

''Determining:'' 
*the discharge rate (Q) from the recharge rate (R) in a [[water balance]] as detailed in the article: [[hydrology (agriculture)]]
*the permissible long term average depth of the water table (Dw) on the basis of ''agricultural drainage criteria''
*the soil's [[hydraulic conductivity]] (Ka and Kb) by measurements
*the depth of the bottom of the [[aquifer]] (Di)
the design drain spacing (L) can be found from the equation in dependence of the drain depth (Dd) and drain radius (r). 

''Drainage criteria'' &lt;br /&gt;
One would not want the water table to be too shallow to avoid crop yield depression nor too deep to avoid drought conditions. This is a subject of [[drainage research]]. The figure shows that a seasonal average depth of the water table shallower than 70&amp;nbsp;cm causes a yield depression &lt;ref&gt;''Drainage research in farmers' fields: analysis of data''.

The figure was made with the [[SegReg]] program for [[segmented regression]].&lt;ref&gt;The computer program SegReg for segmented regression can be downloaded freely from web page : [http://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [http://www.waterlog.info/segreg.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalent depth===
In 1991 a [[closed-form expression]] was developed for the equivalent depth (d) that can replace the Hooghoudt tables:&lt;ref&gt;W.H. van der Molen en J.Wesseling, 1991. ''A solution in closed form and a series solution to replace the tables for the thickness of the equivalent layer in Hooghoudt's drain spacing equation''. Agricultural Water Management 19, pp.1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

:d = πL / 8 &lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt; ln(L/πr) + F(x) &lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;

where: 
*x = 2π (Di &amp;minus; Dd) &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; L
*F(x) = Σ 4e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2nx&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;'''/'''&lt;/big&gt; n (1 &amp;minus; e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2nx&lt;/sup&gt;), with n = 1, 3, 5, . . .

===Extended use===
Theoretically, Hooghoudt's equation can also be used for ''sloping land''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hooghoudt's drainage equation adjusted for entrance resistance and sloping land''. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.  On line : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/sloping.pdf] . Updated version of: R.J. Oosterbaan, “Interception drainage and drainage of sloping lands” published in: Bulletin of the Irrigation, Drainage and Flood Control Council, Pakistan, Vol. 5, No. 1, June 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory on drainage of sloping land is corroborated by the results of sand tank experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, E.R. 1972. ''Laboratory tests to study drainage from sloping land''. Report REC ERC 72 4, Engineering and Research Center, Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, Col., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''entrance resistance'' encountered by the water upon entering the drains can be accounted for.

==Amplification==
[[File:AnisotropicSoil.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Amplification of parameters compared to Hooghoudt]]
[[File:Endrain.png|thumb|250px|right|EnDrain: shape of the watertable with drainage]]
The drainage formula can be amplified &lt;ref&gt;''The energy balance of groundwater flow applied to subsurface drainage in anisotropic soils by pipes or ditches with entrance resistance''. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.  On line : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerart.pdf] . Paper based on: R.J. Oosterbaan, J. Boonstra and K.V.G.K. Rao, 1996, “The energy balance of groundwater flow”. Published in V.P.Singh and B.Kumar (eds.), Subsurface-Water Hydrology, p. 153-160, Vol.2 of Proceedings of the International Conference on Hydrology and Water Resources, New Delhi, India, 1993. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-3651-8}} . On line : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/enerbal.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; to account for (see  figure on the right):
*the additional energy associated with the incoming percolation water ([[Groundwater recharge|recharge]]), see [[groundwater energy balance]]
*multiple soil layers
*[[anisotropy|anisotropric]] hydraulic conductivity, the vertical conductivity (Kv) being different from the horizontal (Kh)
*drains of different dimensions with any width (W)

===Computer program===

The amplified drainage equation uses an hydraulic equivalent of [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in electricity.

It is in the form of a [[differential equation]] that cannot be solved [[Analytical solution|analytically]] (i.e. in a [[Closed-form expression|closed form]]) but the solution requires a [[numerical method]] for which a [[computer program]] is indispensable.

The availability of a computer program also helps in quickly assessing various alternatives and performing a [[sensitivity analysis]].

The blue figure shows an example of results of a computer aided calculation with the amplified drainage equation using the EnDrain program.&lt;ref&gt;The free computer program EnDrain can be downloaded from web page : [http://www.waterlog.info/software.htm] , or from : [http://www.waterlog.info/endrain.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that incorporation of the incoming energy associated with the recharge leads to a somewhat deeper [[watertable|water table]].

The '''Eastern Canadian forests''' is an [[ecoregion]] of [[Canada]] as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) categorization system.

==Setting==
This ecoregion contains a number of mountainous areas on the east coast of Canada and along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in eastern [[Quebec]] (including [[Anticosti Island]] in the Saint Lawrence and the coast up to near [[Labrador]], on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in the highlands of [[New Brunswick]], and the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] on [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Nova Scotia]]. The mountains included are the [[Laurentian Mountains]], to the north of the ecoregion, and the northernmost ranges of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] chain to the south, with peaks over 1000m, including the rugged [[Gaspé Peninsula]] of Quebec. The climate is cool and wet and the coast is subject to heavy fog, especially on the [[Strait of Belle Isle]] between Labrador and Newfoundland for example. The [[Central Canadian Shield forests]] ecoregion lies inland to the west and has more [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] than the [[Abies balsamea|balsam fir]] that are the dominant tree in this ecoregion.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0605|name=Eastern Canadian forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The dominant trees of these coastal forests are balsam fir ''Abies balsamea'' along with black spruce ''Picea mariana'', white spruce ''[[Picea glauca]]'' on the shoreline, and paper birch ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' and [[aspen]]s where the forest is regrown following logging or other disturbance. Other plants include [[moss]]es and coastal [[Ericaceae|heath]] shrubs. Sheltered areas within the mountains, such as the valley around [[Lac St. Jean]] have a different woodland pattern.

==Fauna==
This coast is a breeding ground for large colonies of [[eider]]s and other seabirds. Mammals include moose ''([[Alces alces]])'', American black bear ''([[Ursus americanus]])'', Canada lynx ''([[Lynx canadensis]])'', red fox ''([[Vulpes vulpes]])'', [[snowshoe hare]] and [[grey wolf]].

==Threats and preservation==
This coast has long been inhabited and the forest much altered especially by logging. However up to 40% remains intact, especially in the north of the region in Quebec, while the Gaspé Peninsula, northern New Brunswick and Newfoundland are more heavily populated and the environment therefore much changed and fragmented. Mining has also damaged habitats in certain areas such as [[Matamec Ecological Reserve|Matamec]]. Protected areas include [[Bay du Nord Wilderness Reserve]], [[Avalon Wilderness Reserve]], [[Middle Ridge Wildlife Reserve]] and [[Terra Nova National Park]] in Newfoundland; [[Monts-Valin National Park]] north of the [[Saguenay River]], [[Gaspésie National Park]], [[Saguenay National Park]] and [[Forillon National Park]] in Quebec; and [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]] and [[Pollett's Cove]] in Nova Scotia.

[[File:EMNMsign.jpg|thumb|An entrance to Effigy Mounds National Monument]]
'''Effigy Mounds National Monument''' preserves more than 200 prehistoric [[mound]]s built by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Numerous [[effigy mound]]s are shaped like animals, including bears and birds. These were built mostly in the first millennium, by peoples of the [[Woodland period|Woodland Culture]]. In 2017, they were featured in the [[America the Beautiful Quarters]] Program.

The monument is located primarily in [[Allamakee County, Iowa|Allamakee County]], [[Iowa]], with a small part in [[Clayton County, Iowa]], in the midwestern [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effigy Mounds|url=http://www.nps.gov/efmo/index.htm|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park's visitor center is located in [[Harpers Ferry, Iowa]], just north of [[Marquette, Iowa|Marquette]].

==Mounds==
[[File:Effigy mounds lidar.jpg|thumb|[[Lidar]]-derived image of Marching Bears Mound Group, Effigy Mounds National Monument.]]
Prehistoric earthworks by [[Mound builder (people)|mound builder cultures]] are common in the [[U.S. Midwest|Midwest]].  However, mounds in the shape of mammals, birds, or reptiles, known as effigies, apparently were constructed primarily by peoples in what is now known as southern Wisconsin, northeast Iowa, and small parts of Minnesota and Illinois. Exceptions are the [[Great Serpent Mound]] in south-eastern Ohio, and Mound A at [[Poverty Point, Louisiana]], built in the shape of a large soaring bird.

Effigy Mounds National Monument takes in the western edge of the effigy region. The North Unit (67 mounds) and South Unit (29 mounds) are located where the counties meet along the [[Mississippi River]]. They are contiguous and easily accessible. The [[Sny Magill Creek|Sny Magill]] Unit (112 mounds) is approximately {{convert|11|mi|km}} south of the other units, and offers no visitor facilities. Other mounds are located on remote parts of the Monument property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=HRA Gray &amp; Pape, LLC. |title=Appendix A |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/efmo/hrs/hrsaa.htm |work=Figures on the Landscape: Effigy Mounds Historic Resource Study |publisher=National Park Service |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument contains {{convert|2,526|acre|km2}} with 206 mounds, of which 31 are effigies. The largest, Great Bear Mound, measures 42 meters from head to tail and rises over a meter above the original ground level.

[[File:2017 Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|The mounds commemorated on a 2017 [[US Quarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Effigy Mounds National Monument Quarter |url=http://www.parkquarters.com/effigy-mounds-national-monument-quarter |website=parkquarters.com |publisher=National Park Quarters |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In northeastern Iowa the Effigy Mounds area was a point of transition between the eastern [[hardwood forest]]s and the central prairies. Native American and early settlers would have been able to draw on natural resources available in [[forest]]s, [[wetland]]s, and [[prairie]]s. These areas were occupied by humans for many centuries.

Effigy Mounds is adjacent to the [[Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge]], the [[Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge]], the [[Yellow River State Forest]], and a short distance to the south, [[Pikes Peak State Park]]. There are also a number of state-owned wildlife management areas, such as the one at [[Sny Magill Creek]], where Clayton County also maintains a county park.

Numerous federally recognized tribes have been identified as having linguistic and cultural ties to the various ancestral peoples who built the effigy and other earthwork mounds at the monument site.

==Public access==
[[File:effigymoundsnationalmonument3.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Mississippi River]] and western [[Wisconsin]] from Effigy Mounds National Monument in 2007]]
The [[visitor center]], located at the park entrance, contains museum exhibits highlighting archaeological and natural specimens, an auditorium, and book sales outlet. The park has 14 miles of hiking trails. No paved public automobile access roads exist in the park. Rangers give guided hikes and prehistoric tool demonstrations that are scheduled and advertised, mid-June through Labor Day weekend. Educational programs are presented on- and off-site by appointment.

Natural features in the monument include forests, [[tallgrass prairie]]s, wetlands and [[river]]s. There are no lodging or camping facilities in the park. Excellent camping is available at nearby [[Pikes Peak State Park]] and [[Yellow River State Forest]] in Iowa; there is also [[Wyalusing State Park]] in [[Wisconsin]]. Various primitive campgrounds exist in the area as well. The national monument is quite close to the town of [[Marquette, Iowa]], and is just across the Mississippi River from the city of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], where ample motel and gambling-boat facilities exist.

Effigy Mounds was proclaimed a [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] on October 25, 1949. [[Charles R. Keyes]], head of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, and Ellison Orr, chief field supervisor for the Iowa Archaeological Survey, worked to survey and map the area, and to establish its significance for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Archeology; http://www.nps.gov/archeology/sites/npsites/effigyMounds.htm&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:efmo map 02.png|thumb|290px|Map of Effigy Mounds National Monument and the surrounding area]]

==Driftless Area==
The Effigy Mounds National Monument is noted for being in the [[Driftless Area]], an area of North America which escaped glaciation during the last [[Wisconsin glaciation|ice age]].  The adjacent [[Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge]] takes its name from this region.

The Park Service writes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Patchy remnants of [[Pre-Illinoian]] glacial [[Moraine|drift]] more than 500,000 years old recently have been discovered in the area. Unlike the rest of Iowa, the [[Driftless Area|Paleozoic Plateau]] was bypassed by the last of the [[Pleistocene]] glaciers (the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin]]), allowing the region's fast cutting streams to expose and carve out deep channels in the bedrock-dominated terrain. The area is characterized by thin [[loess]] soil cover, isolated patches of glacial drift, deeply entrenched river valleys, and [[karst]] ([[sinkhole]]s, [[cave]]s, and springs) topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=HRA Gray &amp; Pape, LLC. |title=Chapter 3: Environment |url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/efmo/hrs/hrs3.htm |work=Figures on the Landscape: Effigy Mounds Historic Resource Study |publisher=National Park Service |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversies==

From 1999 to 2009, Superintendent Phyllis Ewing "oversaw more than $3 million in illegal construction of boardwalks, trails and other structures that damaged irreplaceable archaeological artifacts."&lt;ref name="gazette" /&gt;  She failed to conduct consultation with affiliated American Indian tribes and follow procedures of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] and other statutes. The Park Service conducted an internal investigation, finding numerous violations but no intent to damage the park.&lt;ref name="gazette" /&gt;

In July 2016, Thomas Munson, Superintendent for 20 years of the Effigy Mounds National Monument, was sentenced after pleading guilty to stealing bones in 1990 of 40 ancient Native Americans, who lived between 700 and 2,500 years ago, from the holdings of the museum at the site.&lt;ref name="Hopper"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hopper |first=Frank |title=Home detention for Park Service grave robber |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/14/home-detention-park-service-grave-robber-165143 |work=Indian Country Today |date=2016-07-14 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains had been excavated along with artifacts from burial mounds at the park. Munson was apparently trying to evade the proposed provisions of the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which was passed by Congress that year.&lt;ref name="Hopper" /&gt; The act provides for artifacts and bones to be returned or repatriated by governmental agencies and other institutions to tribes who are affiliated with the peoples who buried the items.

Tracing the bones could have demonstrated a link to the affiliated tribes and required return of both the remains and related artifacts from grave goods. Without that evidence, most of the artifacts have been retained by the park museum. The government conducted a five-year investigation through the US Attorney's Office, following questions raised in 2011 by Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska member Patt Murphy. As tribal representative under NAGPRA to receive "remains and funerary objects for repatriation and reburial," he had requested an inventory from the national monument of all remains and goods, which they could not provide. This began the inquiry. Murphy has praised the work of the US Attorney's Office and others in this case.&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt;

Munson was sentenced to a year of home detention, 10 weekends in jail, and paying "$108,905 in restitution for the damage he caused to the bones and a $3,000 fine."&lt;ref name=Hopper/&gt; Munson had retired from the National Park Service in 1994.

Jim Nepstad, who was appointed superintendent at the monument in 2011, is working to restore those disturbed areas of the park. He is also working to rebuild the Park Service's standing with area residents and members of the site's affiliated American Indian tribes.&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegazette.com/subject/news/effigy-mounds-report-to-be-released-monday-20140510|title=Effigy Mounds report to be released Monday|last=Love|first=Orlan|date=May 10, 2014|work=The Gazette|publisher=Gazette Communications, Iowa|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">'''Electroluminescent Displays''' ('''ELD'''s) are a type of [[Flat panel display]] created by sandwiching a layer of electroluminescent material such as [[GaAs]] between two layers of conductors. When current flows, the layer of material emits radiation in the form of visible light. [[Electroluminescence]] (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon where a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field.

==Mechanism==
EL works by exciting [[atom]]s by passing an electric current through them, causing them to emit [[photon]]s. By varying the material being excited, the colour of the light emitted can be changed.
The actual ELD is constructed using flat, [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] [[electrode]] strips running parallel to each other, covered by a layer of electroluminescent material, followed by another layer of electrodes, running perpendicular to the bottom layer. This top layer must be transparent in order to let light escape. At each intersection, the material lights, creating a pixel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5674">'''Edmund Everett Garrison''' (b. winter of 1893, [[Yonkers, New York]]; d. February 8, 1975, [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]], United States) was a [[Structural engineer|structural]] and [[electrical engineer]] known as a maker of [[bamboo fly rod]]s and co-author of ''A Master's Guide To Building A Bamboo Fly Rod''. Everett Garrison's methods and designs have been utilized by generations of bamboo fly rod makers. His rods fetch high prices from collectors.

== Early life ==
Everett Garrison was born in Yonkers in the winter of 1893. He was of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry. His father was an [[engineer]] who held two degrees from [[Columbia University]]. His family owned and operated a steam driven [[barge]] business along the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name="Garrison/Carmichael"&gt;Garrison, Everett and Carmichael, Hoagy B. (1997). ''A Master's Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod''. Far Hills, New Jersey: Meadow Run Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison grew up in Yonkers and went on to study electrical engineering at [[Union College]], where he earned a degree in 1916. He tested steel for [[Curtiss-Wright]] aircraft engines, and later became involved in railroad construction.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;Schwiebert, Ernest (1984). Trout. New York, New York: E.P. Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; He also lived in [[Staten Island]] and Ossining, New York.  He was married to Charlotte Goff.

== Innovator of bamboo rod building ==
In 1922, Garrison met [[George Parker Holden]], author of ''The Idyll of the Split-Bamboo''.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, George Parker (1998). ''Idyll of the Split Bamboo''. Bedford, Massachusetts: Applewood Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Garrison was interested in bamboo construction as a way to improve the shafts on his [[golf clubs]] and began to visit Holden at his house in Yonkers. Both men were avid golfers, both also shared a love of [[fly fishing]]. It was there that Garrison made his first bamboo fly rods.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, when expecting his second child, Garrison suffered from a [[neurological]] malady coupled with a debilitating [[Depression (mood)|depression]], during which time he turned to designing a new type of bamboo fly rod. Whereas other rod designers had been using empirical methods, Garrison used engineering principles to create the foundations for his revolutionary taper designs.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From a hospital bed, Garrison used an understanding of casting mechanics and the physical properties of bamboo to derive a stress analysis formula to use as a basis for plotting the final dimensions of a fly rod.&lt;ref name="Garrison/Carmichael"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Everett Garrison had many other credits to his name in the world of fly fishing. He coined the term "Parabolic Fly Rod" to describe an early prototype belonging to [[Charles Ritz]].&lt;ref name="Garrison/Carmichael"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed the tools needed to hand-split and hand-plane the bamboo used in his rods, including an adjustable planing form and a glue binding machine that were capable of holding tolerances to .001" which are in common usage to this day.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison first reached acclaim when he made rods for author [[John Alden Knight]] and members of the Anglers' Club of New York, for whom Garrison gave a lecture on rodmaking in 1933.&lt;ref name="Garrison/Carmichael"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Alden Knight described Garrison in the book ''The Modern Angler'' as a meticulous craftsman capable of unique precision.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, John Alden (1936). ''The Modern Angler''. New York/London: Charles Scribner's Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of Everett Garrison's rods reflect his ethos of design and construction. The relatively small number of rods he made during his career are a tribute to quality craftsmanship and a philosophy of performance through simplicity of design. The aesthetics of his fishing rods were not concerned with artifice or embellishment and were never altered.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

He worked at his craft nights and weekends until he retired from a structural engineering firm in 1972, after which he built rods and perfected his equipment full-time until his health began to fail in 1974. He died on February 8, 1975. It is estimated he made approximately 650 rods in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Garrison/Carmichael"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoagy B. Carmichael was making the documentary film ''Creating the Garrison Fly Rod''&lt;ref&gt;''Creating the Garrison Fly Rod''. Hoagy B. Carmichael. Lazy Bones. 2006 DVD&lt;/ref&gt; when he became an apprentice to Garrison. They were collaborating on a book when Garrison died. Carmichael completed the manuscript using notebooks, recordings and photographs.&lt;ref name="Schwiebert"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When published in 1977, ''A Master's Guide to Building a Bamboo Fly Rod'' made accessible to hobbyists and enthusiasts the methods of a craft that had previously been shrouded in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, George E. and Elser, Bernard P. (2002). ''Fundamentals of Building Bamboo Fly-Rod''. Woodstock, Vermont: The Countryman Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fossil fuel phase out''' refers to the discontinuation of the use of [[fossil fuels]], through the decommissioning of operating [[Fossil-fuel power station|fossil fuel-fired power plants]], the prevention of the construction of new ones, and the use of [[alternative energy]] to replace the role of fossil fuels.

The purpose of fossil fuel phase-out is to reduce the negative [[externalities]] that use of fossil fuels cause. Negative externalities refer to the costs a certain activity has over people who did not choose to incur in them. A direct negative externality from fossil fuels' use is [[air pollution]], and an indirect negative externality are [[mining accidents]], that happen as a consequence of the extraction of fossil fuels. Fossil fuel burning contributes to [[climate change]], as it releases [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/contents.html|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007|last=Solomon, S., D.

=== Coal ===
[[File:Top 5 Coal Consumers.png|thumb|Coal consumption trends 1980–2012 in the top five coal-consuming countries ([[Energy Information Administration|US EIA]])]]
[[File:Grand Junction Trip 92007 098.JPG|thumb|right|Coal-fired power plants provided 30% of consumed electricity in the United States in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_01|title=Electric Power Monthly - Table 1.1.

Coal is one of the largest sources of energy, supplying 28.6% percent of the world's primary energy in 2014 (equivalent to 3,917&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) according to the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal combustion accounted for 14,863&amp;nbsp;Mt of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2014, which is equivalent to a 45.9% of fossil fuel emissions from combustion (excluding non-energy emissions).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To decrease carbon emissions and thus possibly stop extreme climate change, some have called for coal to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;Kharecha, P.A., and J.E. Hansen, [http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Kharecha_Hansen.html "Implications of "peak oil" for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and climate,"] Global Biogeochem.

Hansen said "We need a moratorium on coal now...with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/europe/23coal.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin|title=Europe Turns Back to Coal, Raising Climate Fears|last=Rosenthal|first=Elizabeth|date=23 April 2008|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|quote=“We need a moratorium on coal now,” he added, “with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades.”|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 2017, coal has to be phased-out globally by about 2030, if the agreed 2&amp;nbsp;°C target is taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Rockström]] et al.: ''A roadmap for rapid decarbonization''. In: Science. 355, 6331, 2017, pp. 1269–1271, {{DOI|10.1126/science.aah3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations have decreased their coal consumption thus far in the 21st century, the greatest reductions being in the United States (coal consumption reduced by 176 million metric tons per year over the period 2000–2012), Canada (reduced by 21 million tons per year) and Spain (20 million tons per year). Other nations have increased their coal consumption in the same period, led by China (increased 2,263 million metric tons per year in the period 2000–2012), India (increased 367 million tons per year), and South Korea (59 million tons per year). Worldwide, coal consumption increased 60% during the period 2000–2012.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&amp;pid=1&amp;aid=2 International statistics: coal consumption], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, 1200 new coal power plants were reportedly being planned worldwide, most of them in China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Damian | last=Carrington | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/20/coal-plants-world-resources-institute | title=More than 1,000 new coal plants being planned | newspaper=The Guardian, | date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011–2013 period, the [[OECD]] group of Western European countries has increased the use of coal, attributed largely to the low cost of coal and the high price of imported natural gas in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=US EIA | url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | title=Multiple factors push Western Europe to use less natural gas and more coal | date=27 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150527/http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail/2013-09-27/multiple-factors-push-western-europe-use-less-natural-gas-and-more | archivedate=27 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, coal consumption has peaked in China in 2013 or 2014, depending on the data used and fell in 2015 by 3.6%, even though there was a growth of GDP of 6.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Qi | first1 = Ye | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2016 | title = China's post-coal growth | url = | journal = [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  9| issue = | pages =  564–566| doi = 10.1038/ngeo2777 | bibcode = 2016NatGe...9..564Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; After smaller increases, consumption remained below the prior peak by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Qi Ye, Jiaqi Lu ([[Brookings Institute]]): China's coal comsumption has peaked[https://www.brookings.edu/2018/01/22/chinas-coal-consumption-has-peaked/], 20.

According to [[Scientific American]], the average coal plant emits more than 100 times as much radiation per year than does a comparatively sized nuclear power plant, in the form of fly ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste|title=Coal Ash Is More Radioactive than Nuclear Waste: By burning away all the pesky carbon and other impurities, coal power plants produce heaps of radiation|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some like the "coal advisory board" of the IEA believe that coal should not be phased out, considering that longer-term global economic growth cannot be achieved without adequate and affordable energy supplies, which will require continuing significant contributions from fossil fuels including coal. In this viewpoint, [[clean coal technology]] could reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions compatible with a low-emissions future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/ciab/papers/ciab.pdf|title=Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions - The Potential of Coal|website=Coal Industry Advisory Board/International Energy Agency|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/International Energy Agency|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmentalists and climatologists support a phase-out and criticise clean coal as not a solution to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5975|title=Clean Coal: Wave of the Future or Empty Rhetoric?|website=Worldwatch Institute|publisher=Worldwatch Institute|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs promote improved regulations and modernised technology.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Sometimes coal is replaced by natural gas, which has lower carbon emissions and produces less pollutants. However natural gas is also a fossil fuel, so a switch from coal to natural gas does not contribute to a fossil fuel phase-out.

{{As of|October 2018}}, 28 national governments, 19 sub-national governments and 28 organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/about/Powering_Past_Coal_Alliance_Members|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance members list|last=|first=|date=|website=poweringpastcoal.org|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had become members of the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]], each making a declaration to advance the transition away from unabated coal power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/about/Powering_Past_Coal_Alliance_Declaration|title=Powering Past Coal Alliance declaration|last=|first=|date=|website=poweringpastcoal.org|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oil ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Oil is refined into [[fuel oil]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[gasoline]]. The refined products are primarily for transportation by conventional cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships.  Popular alternatives are [[human-powered transport]], [[public transport]], [[electric vehicles]], and [[biofuels]].

=== Natural gas ===
{{Main|Natural gas}}
Although natural gas has about half the carbon intensity of coal it is also the single largest source of [[atmospheric methane]] in the United States. It is seen by many as a temporary "bridge fuel" to replace coal, but in turn to be replaced by renewable sources. However this "bridge fuel" is likely to  significantly extend the use of fossil fuel as the average plant life is 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://energycenter.org/sites/default/files/docs/nav/policy/research-and-reports/Natural_Gas_Bridge_Fuel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gas consumption has tripled since 1971, and by 2015 it was generating half as much electricity as coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417225701/https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyNaturalGasTrends.pdf|title=Key natural gas trends|year=2015|archive-date=2016-04-17|website=www.iea.org|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the consumption of gas is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2040, the phase out is likely to be many years in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/topics/naturalgas/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
The basis of phasing-out fossil fuels consists mainly of the projected lower cost of renewable sources of energy,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irena.org/publications/2018/Jan/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the avoidance of risks in health and [[mitigation of global warming]] are also important considerations.

=== Health ===
Using computer modeling he developed over 20 years, [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] has found that [[carbon]]aceous fuel [[particulate matter|soot emissions]] (which lead to respiratory illness, heart disease, and asthma) have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year, mostly in the developing world where the non-fossil fuels wood and animal dung are used for cooking. Jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines, coal-fired power plants, and burning wood is a "bigger cause of global warming than previously thought, and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the Arctic's sea ice".&lt;ref name="dp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Scientists-say-soot-a-key-factor-in-warming-3180603.php#ixzz0v1KwN5yZ | title=Scientists say soot a key factor in warming | work=SFGate | date=28 July 2010 | accessdate=19 July 2016 | author=Perlman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies are needed:

{{Block quote|Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Global warming mitigation ===
{{See|Global warming}}In 2008, [[James E. Hansen|James Hansen]] and nine other scientists published a journal article titled "Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?" which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030.&lt;ref name="hansen-etal-2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last2=Sato |first2=Makiko| last3=Kharecha |first3=Pushker| last4=Beerling|first4=David|last5=Berner|first5=Robert|last6=Masson-Delmotte|first6=Valerie|authorlink6=Valerie Masson-Delmotte | last7=Pagani |first7=Mark | last8=Raymo | first8=Maureen| last9=Royer | first9=Dana L | date=31 October 2008 | title=Target atmospheric {{co2}}: Where should humanity aim?|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2008/TargetCO2_20080407.pdf|journal=The Open Atmospheric Science Journal|volume=2|pages=217–231|arxiv=0804.1126|bibcode=2008OASJ....2..217H|doi=10.2174/1874282300802010217|access-date=2016-10-31|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first10=James C|last10=Zachos}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Hansen has stated that continued [[opposition to nuclear power]] threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/|title=Top climate change scientists issue open letter to policy influencers - CNN.com|date=3 November 2013|author=By|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, co-authored with other climate change experts declared "If we stay on the current path," he said, "those are the consequences we'll be leaving to our children. The best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power. It's ready now. We need to take advantage of it." and "Continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."

Also in 2008, Pushker Kharecha and James Hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Implications of "peak oil" for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and climate|url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2008/Kharecha_Hansen.html|journal=Global Biogeochem. Cycles|volume=22|issue=3|pages=GB3012|arxiv=0704.2782|bibcode=2008GBioC..22.3012K|doi=10.1029/2007GB003142|author1=Kharecha, P.A.|author2=J.E. Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. The authors describe the scenario as follows:

{{quote|The second scenario, labeled Coal Phase-out, is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions.  Between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from coal usage.  Thus in Coal Phase-out we have global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal increasing 2% per year until 2012, 1% per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022, flat coal emissions for 2023–2025, and finally a linear decrease to zero CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from coal in 2050.  These rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal, provided the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is captured and sequestered. Oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the BAU [business as usual] scenario.}}

Kharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as [[methane hydrates]] and [[tar sands]].

In December 2015, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Europe]] released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe.  Their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official EU registries.&lt;ref name="jones-and-gutmann-2015"&gt;

A September 2016 report by Oil Change International, concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal, oil, and gas in currently working mines and fields, assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes, will take the world to just beyond the 2{{nnbsp}}°C limit contained in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] and even further from the 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C goal.&lt;ref name="mathiesen-2016"&gt;

In October 2016, the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) and 11 other [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity.  The report concludes that, on the whole, building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer.  Moreover, wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost.&lt;ref name="nuccitelli-2016"&gt;

A 2018 study in Nature Energy, suggests that 10 countries in Europe could completely phase out coal-fired electricity generation with their current infrastructure, whilst the United States and Russia could phase out at least 30%.&lt;ref name="wilson-and-staffell-2018"&gt;
{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=IAG|last2=Staffell|first2=I|date=2018|title=Rapid fuel switching from coal to natural gas through effective carbon pricing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-018-0109-0|journal=Nature Energy|volume=3|pages=365–372|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0109-0|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..365W}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of fossil fuel phase-out ==
The phase-out of fossil fuels involves many challenges, and one of them is the reliance that currently the world has on them. In 2014, fossil fuels provided 81.1% of the [[primary energy consumption]] of the world, with approximately 11,109&amp;nbsp;Mtoe. This number is composed by 4,287&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of oil consumption; 3,918&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of coal consumption, and 2,904&amp;nbsp;Mtoe of natural gas consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf|title=Key World Energy Statistics|last=|first=|date=2016|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil fuel phase-out can lead to an increment in electricity prices, because of the new investments needed to replace their share in the electricity mix with alternative energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=R|last2=Staffell|first2=I|date=2016|title=Electricity in Europe: exiting fossil fuels?|url=https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-pdf/32/2/282/7298756/grw003.pdf|journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=282-303|doi=10.1093/oxrep/grw003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause to increasing electricity price comes from the need to import the electricity that can't be generated nationally.&lt;ref&gt;Yilmaz, H. Ü., Bchini, Q., Keles, D., Hartel, R., Fichtner, W., Mikulić, M., &amp; Jakšić, D. (2016). Impacts of a UK and German coal phase-out on the electricity mix and CO 2 emissions in Europe. ''Insight Energy'', (April).

Another impact of a phase-out of fossil fuels is in the employment. In the case of employments in the fossil fuel industry, a phase-out is logically undesired, therefore, people in the industry will usually oppose any measures that put their industries under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Heinrichs 285–305"/&gt; Endre Tvinnereim and Elisabeth Ivarsflaten studied the relationship between employment in the fossil fuel industry with the support to climate change policies. They proposed that one opportunity for displaced drilling employments in the fossil fuel industry could be in the geothermal energy industry. This was suggested as a result of their conclusion: people and companies in the fossil fuel industry will likely oppose measures that endanger their employments, unless they have other stronger alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tvinnereim|first=Endre|last2=Ivarsflaten|first2=Elisabeth|date=2016-09-01|title=Fossil fuels, employment, and support for climate policies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516302828|journal=Energy Policy|volume=96|pages=364–371|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2016.05.052}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be extrapolated to political interests, that can push against the phase-out of fossil fuels initiative. One example is how the vote of [[United Stats|US]] Congress members is related to the preeminence of fossil fuel industries in their respective states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cragg|first=Michael I.|last2=Zhou|first2=Yuyu|last3=Gurney|first3=Kevin|last4=Kahn|first4=Matthew E.|date=2013-04-01|title=Carbon Geography: The Political Economy of Congressional Support for Legislation Intended to Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Production|ssrn=2225690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation and initiatives to phase out coal ==

=== Major economies ===
In 8 June 2015, several newspapers ran an article wrote that the leaders of the [[Group of Seven]] (or G7, consisting of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]) agreed to phase-out fossil fuel use by 2100,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/08/g7-leaders-agree-phase-out-fossil-fuel-use-end-of-century|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuel use by end of century|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2015-06-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ec2c365a-0ddf-11e5-aa7b-00144feabdc0|title=G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuels|last=Clark|first=Pilita|date=8 June 2015|work=Financial Times|access-date=|last2=Wagstyl|first2=Stefan|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the efforts to keep global temperature increase under 2°C. This was done as a prelude for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (a.k.a. [[COP 21]]) hosted in Paris, on December of the same year.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia in 2010]]

The [[Australian Greens]] party have proposed to phase out coal power stations. The NSW Greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and [[coal industry subsidies]].  The Australian Greens and the [[Australian Labor Party]] also oppose nuclear power.  The Federal Government and Victorian State Government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The Federal Labor government extended the [[Mandatory Renewable Energy Target#Australia|mandatory renewable energy target]]s, an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power, solar power and other sources of [[renewable energy in Australia]].  [[Australia]] is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita, and also the largest exporter. The proposals are strongly opposed by industry, unions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php Australian Options Magazine, CFMEU on coal phase out] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320100225/http://www.australian-options.org.au/issues/options_53/article_colley.php |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main Opposition Party in Parliament (now forming the party in government after the September 2013 election).

=== Canada ===
In 2005, Canada annually burned 60 million tons of coal, mainly for electrical power, increasing by 15 percent annually.

In November 2016, Canada announced plans to phase-out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030.&lt;ref name="the-guardian-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] planned coal phase-out legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050216005791/en/Ontarios-Coal-Phase-out-Drastic-Consequences-Thinking-Companies#.Uv-cnP0-vCE Ontario's Coal Phase-out Will Have Drastic Consequences, Say The Thinking Companies]. 16 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario annually consumed 15 million tons of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power. [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] was a major source of air pollution, and Ontario suffered "smog days" during the summer.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}
In 2007, Ontario's Liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014. Premier Dalton McGuinty said, "By 2030 there will be about 1,000 more new coal-fired generating stations built on this planet. There is only one place in the world that is phasing out coal-fired generation and we're doing that right here in Ontario."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070618/ont_coal_plants_070618/20070618 |title=Ont.

=== China ===
There are currently no plans to phase out coal burning power stations in the [[People's Republic of China]] on the national level.

China's exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power. Each week, another 2&amp;nbsp;GW of coal-fired power is put online in China.  Coal supplies about 80% of China's energy needs today, and that ratio is expected to continue, even as overall power usage grows rapidly. Serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many Chinese cities suffer severe smog events.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}

As a consequence the region of Beijing has decided to phase out all its coal-fired power generation by the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/singapore/chinas-beijing-city-to-abolish-coal-fired-power-27490804|title=China's Beijing city to abolish coal-fired power plants by end 2014 - Electric Power - Platts News Article &amp; Story|website=www.platts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Update inline|date=November 2016}}

In 2009, China had 172&amp;nbsp;GW of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world, producing 16% of China's electricity, the Eleventh Five-Year Plan has set a 300&amp;nbsp;GW target for 2020. China built the world's largest power plant of any kind, the [[Three Gorges Dam]].

In addition to the huge investments in coal power, China has 32&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=CN |title=PRIS - Country Details |publisher=Iaea.org |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; reactors under construction, the highest number in the world.

In July 2014, [[Climate Action Network|CAN Europe]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF European Policy Office]], HEAL, [[European Environmental Bureau|EEB]] and [[Climate-Alliance Germany]] published a report calling for the decommissioning of the thirty most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

As part of their Climate policy Plan, Denmark stated that it will phase out oil for heating purposes and coal by 2030.

In 2007, [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] and her party agreed to legislation to phase out Germany's hard coal mining sector. That does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general. There were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years. Most German coal power plants were built in the 1960s, and have a low energy efficiency. Public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; A number are under construction and still being built. No concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation. As of October 2015, the remaining coal plants still under planning include: Niederaussem, Profen, and Stade. The coal plants currently under construction include: Mannheim, Hamm D, Datteln, and Willhelmshaven. Between 2012 and 2015, six new plants went online. All of these plants are 600–1800&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]]&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energytransition.de/2015/10/the-demise-of-coal-in-germany-and-globally/|title=The demise of coal in Germany and globally|date=15 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Germany's coal consumption dropped for the first time, having risen each year since the low during the 2009 recession.&lt;ref name="bp-statistical-review-2015"&gt;

A 2014 study, found that coal is not making a comeback in Germany, as is sometimes claimed.  Rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear facilities that have been shutdown as a result of Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''Atomausstieg'').  Hard coal plants now face financial stringency as their operating hours are cut back by the market.  But in contrast, [[lignite]]-fired generation is in a safe position until the {{nowrap|mid-2020s}} unless government policies change.  To phase-out coal, Germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system ([[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU-ETS]]), consider a carbon tax, promote [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and strengthen the use of natural gas as a bridge fuel.&lt;ref name="jungjohann-and-morris-2014"&gt;

In 2016, the German government and affected [[lignite]] power plant operators [[:de:Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlengesellschaft|Mibrag]], [[RWE]], and [[Vattenfall]] reached an understanding (''Verständigung'') on the transfer of lignite power plant units into security standby (''Überführung von Braunkohlekraftwerksblöcken in die Sicherheitsbereitschaft'').  As a result, eight lignite-fired power plants are to be mothballed and later closed, with the first plant scheduled to cease operation in October 2016 and the last in October 2019.  The affected operators will receive state compensation for foregone profits.  The [[European Commission]] has declared government plans to use €1.6{{nbsp}}billion of public financing for this purpose to be in line with EU [[state aid]] rules.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2016"&gt;

A 2016 study, found that the phase-out of lignite in [[Lusatia]] (''Lausitz'') by 2030 can be financed by future owner [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]] in a manner that avoids taxpayer involvement.  Instead, liabilities covering decommissioning and land rehabilitation could be paid by EPH directly into a foundation, perhaps run by the public company [[:de:Lausitzer und Mitteldeutsche Bergbau-Verwaltungsgesellschaft|LMBV]].  The study calculates the necessary provisions at €2.6{{nbsp}}billion.&lt;ref name="ieefa-2016"&gt;

A coal phase-out for Germany is implied in Germany's [[German Climate Action Plan 2050|Climate Action Plan 2050]], environment minister [[Barbara Hendricks (politician)|Barbara Hendricks]] said in an interview on 21{{nbsp}}November 2016.  "If you read the Climate Action Plan carefully, you will find that the exit from coal-fired power generation is the immanent consequence of the energy sector target.{{nbsp}}...

Plans to cut down the ancient [[Hambach Forest]] to extend the [[Hambach open pit mine]] in 2018 have resulted in massive protests. On 5 Oct, 2018 a German court ruled against the further destruction of the forest for mining purposes. The ruling states, the court needs more time to reconsider the complaint. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, welcomed the court's ruling. The forest is located approximately 29 km km west of the city center of Cologne (specifically Cologne Cathedral).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/05/europe/germany-hambach-forest-court-intl/index.html|title=Hambach Forest clearance halted by German court|last=CNN|first=Laura Smith-Spark,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
On 22 September 2016, the Dutch parliament voted for a 55% cut in {{CO2}} emissions by 2030, a move which would require the closure of the country's five coal-fired power plants.  The vote is not binding on the government however.&lt;ref name="neslen=2016"&gt;

==== Spain ==== 
In October 2018, the [[Sánchez government]] and Spanish [[Labour union]]s settled an agreement to close ten [[Coal mining#SPain|Spanish coal mines]] at the end of 2018. The government pre-engaged to spend 250 million Euro to pay for early retirements, occupational retraining and structural change. In 2018, about 2.3 per cent of the electric energy produced in Spain was produced in [[coal-burning power plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;theguardian.com 26.

=== South Africa ===
As of 2007, South Africa's power sector is the 8th highest global emitter of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071114163448.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005/2006, 77% of South Africa's energy demand was directly met by coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202053007/http://www.dme.gov.za/energy/coal.stm |archivedate=2 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when current projects come online, this ratio will increase in the near term.

There are no plans to phase out coal-fired power plants in South Africa, and indeed, the country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands, as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements.

On April 6, 2010, the World Bank approved a $3.75B loan to South Africa to support the construction of the world's 4th largest coal-fired plant, at Medupi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7088297.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | title=Britain may block World Bank loan for coal plant in South Africa | first=Ben | last=Webster | date=April 6, 2010 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed World Bank loan includes a relatively small amount{{snd}} $260 million{{snd}} for wind and solar power.

Rated at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, [[Medupi Power Station]] would join other mammoth coal-fired power plants already in operation in the country, namely [[Kendal Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), [[Majuba Power Station]] (4100&amp;nbsp;GW), and [[Matimba Power Station]] (4000&amp;nbsp;GW), as well as a similar-capacity [[Kusile Power Station]], at 4800&amp;nbsp;GW, currently under construction.  Kusile is expected to come online in stages, starting in 2012, while Medupi is expected to first come online in 2013, with full capacity available by 2017.  These schedules are provisional, and may change.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Since 2008, South Africa's government started funding [[solar water heating]] installations. As of January 2016, there have been 400 000 domestic installations in total, with free-of-charge installation of low-pressure solar water heaters for low-cost homes or low-income households which have access to the electricity grid, while other installations are subsidised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ee.co.za/article/solar-water-heater-rollout-programme-gains-momentum.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[Ed Miliband]] ([[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|energy secretary]] from 3 October 2008{{snd}} 11 May 2010) announced that no new coal-fired power stations will be built in Britain from 2009 onwards unless they capture and bury at least 25% of greenhouse gases immediately and 100% by 2025 although at the time this was a statement of intent rather than something he was able to enforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/23/clean-coal-energy-policy | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=Clean coal push marks reversal of UK energy policy | date=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Huhne]] (energy secretary from 12 May 2010{{snd}} 5 February 2012) has confirmed that the legislation required to allow his office to enforce [[Emission standard#UK|emissions standards]] are proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/1806551/huhne-promises-coal-plants-ccs |title=Huhne promises no more coal plants without CCS |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=17 Aug 2010 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK is also subject to the EU's [[Large Combustion Plant Directive]] covering non-CO2 emissions which is expected to bring many older plants to a close over the next few years as they are too expensive to upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |title=Large Combustion Plant Directive « Industrial emissions |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424052427/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/industrial/eu-international/lcpd/ |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amber Rudd]] (energy secretary from 11 May 2015) announced on 18 November 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025. This will not be a complete phase out of fossil fuels because gas-fired power stations will continue to provide some [[firm power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12001752/UK-coal-plants-must-close-by-2025-Amber-Rudd-to-announce.html|title=UK coal plants must close by 2025, Amber Rudd announces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, US Secretary of Energy [[Ernest Moniz]] outlined Obama administration policy on fossil fuels:

{{Block quote|In the last four years, we’ve more than doubled renewable energy generation from wind and solar power.  However, coal and other fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of our energy, 70 percent of our electricity, and will be a major part of our energy future for decades.  That’s why any serious effort to protect our kids from the worst effects of climate change must also include developing, demonstrating and deploying the technologies to use our abundant fossil fuel resources as cleanly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Moritz, [http://energy.gov/articles/excerpts-energy-secretary-ernest-moniz-s-remarks-national-energy-technology-laboratory Excerpts of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz’s Remarks at National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown], [[United States Department of Energy]], 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then-US Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu]] and researchers for the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] have noted that greater electrical generation by non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables, such as wind and solar, will also increase the need for flexible natural gas-powered generators, to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;April Lee and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56324.pdf Opportunities for synergy between natural gas and renewable energy], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Funk, [http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/01/doe_boss_says_shale_gas_could.html DOE boss says shale gas could benefit wind and solar], Cleveland Plain Dealer, 18 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Gas-powered generators have the ability to ramp up and down quickly to meet changing loads.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13191 Natural gas-fired combustion turbines are generally used to meet peak electricity load], 1 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, many of the fossil fuel phase-out initiatives have taken place at the state or local levels.

==== California ====
[[California]]'s SB 1368 created the first governmental moratorium on new coal plants in the United States. The law was signed in September 2006 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/emission_standards/index.html |title=SB 1368 Emission Performance Standards |publisher=Energy.ca.gov |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; took effect for investor-owned utilities in January 2007, and took effect for publicly owned utilities in August 2007. SB 1368 applied to long-term investments (five years or more) by California utilities, whether in-state or out-of-state. It set the standard for greenhouse gas emissions at 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, equal to the emissions of a combined-cycle natural gas plant. This standard created a de facto moratorium on new coal, since it could not be met without carbon capture and sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solutionsforglobalwarming.org/docs/SB1368_FS_FINAL.pdf "California Takes on Power Plant Emissions: SB 1368 Sets Groundbreaking Greenhouse Gas Performance Standard,"] [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] Fact Sheet, August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maine ====
On April 15, 2008, [[Maine]] Governor [[John E. Baldacci]] signed LD 2126, "An Act To Minimize Carbon Dioxide Emissions from New Coal-Powered Industrial and Electrical Generating Facilities in the State." The law, which was sponsored by Rep. W. Bruce MacDonald (D-[[Boothbay, Maine|Boothbay]]), requires the Board of Environmental Protection to develop greenhouse gas emission standards for coal gasification facilities. It also puts a moratorium in place on building any new coal gasification facilities until the standards are developed.&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda Erskine, [http://www.wcsh6.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=84867 "Maine Governor Baldacci Signs Bill to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions,"] [[WCSH]] [[WCSH6]].com, April 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oregon ====
In early March 2016, Oregon lawmakers approved a plan to stop paying for out-of-state coal plants by 2030 and require a 50 percent renewable energy standard by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|title=Oregon lawmakers approve far-reaching climate change bill|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305215204/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/oregon-lawmakers-approve-far-reaching-climate-change-bill/ar-BBqiuvg?ocid=ansmsnnews11|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups such as the [[American Wind Energy Association]] and leading Democrats praised the bill.

==== Texas ====
In 2006 a coalition of [[Texas]] groups organized a campaign in favor of a statewide moratorium on new coal-fired power plants. The campaign culminated in a "Stop the Coal Rush" mobilization, including rallying and lobbying, at the state capital in  [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] on February 11 and 12th, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp "Stop the Coal Rush" Rally &amp; Lobby Day Set for February 11 &amp; 12"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030034206/http://texas.sierraclub.org/press/newsreleases/20070125.asp |date=30 October 2008 }}, [[Sierra Club]] Lone Star Chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 citizen groups supported the mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |title=StopTheCoalRush - Hot Rush in Marketing |work=stopthecoalrush.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513110722/http://www.stopthecoalrush.com/participating-organizations/ |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=dmy }}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2007, A resolution calling for a 180-day moratorium on new pulverized coal plants was filed in the Texas Legislature by State Rep. [[Charles "Doc" Anderson]] (R-Waco) as House Concurrent Resolution 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/80R/billtext/pdf/HC00043I.pdf|title=Text of HCR 43|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was left pending in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HCR43|title=Texas Legislature Online - 80(R) History for HCR 43|work=state.tx.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2007, Rep. Anderson announced his support for two proposed  [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal plants proposed by [[Luminant]] (formerly TXU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docandersonfortexas.com/news.htm Rep.

==== Washington state ====
[[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] has followed the same approach as California, prohibiting coal plants whose emissions would exceed those of natural gas plants. Substitute Senate Bill 6001 (SSB 6001), signed on May 3, 2007, by Governor [[Christine Gregoire]], enacted the standard.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"&gt;Christina Russell, [http://whitmanpioneer.com/outdoors/2007/11/15/wallula-coal-plant-proposal-controversial-among-students-faculty/ "Wallula Coal Plant Proposal Controversial Among Students, Faculty,"] [[Whitman College]] Pioneer, 11/15/07&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of SSB 6001, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090716184525/http://www.energy-northwest.com/generation/igcc/index.php Pacific Mountain Energy Center] in Kalama was rejected by the state. However, a new plant proposal, the [http://www.wallulaenergy.com/ Wallula Energy Resource Center], shows the limits of the "natural gas equivalency" approach as a means of prohibiting new coal plants. The proposed plant would meet the standard set by SSB 6001 by capturing and sequestering a portion (65 percent, according to a plant spokesman) of its carbon.&lt;ref name="whitmanpioneer.com"/&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, made a major move to use more fossil fuels in 2012, when the nation shut down nuclear reactors following the Fukishima accident. Nuclear, which had supplied 30 percent of Japanese electricity from 1987 to 2011, supplied only 2 percent in 2012 (hydropower supplied 8 percent). Nuclear electricity was replaced with electricity from petroleum, coal, and liquified natural gas. As a result, electricity generation from fossil fuels rose to 90 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=10391  "Japan’s fossil-fueled generation remains high because of continuing nuclear plant outages"], US Energy Information Administration, 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Japanese government announced plans to build 45 new coal-fired power plants in the next ten years, largely to replace expensive electricity from petroleum power plants.&lt;ref&gt;Babs McHugh, [http://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/sydney/japan-plans-to-build-45-new-coal-power-plants-27762428 "Japan plans to build 45 coal power plants in next decade,"] Platts, 3 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opinion polls ===

==== Opinion research ====
In October 2007, [http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/ Civil Society Institute] released the results of a poll of 1,003 US citizens conducted by Opinion Research Corporation.

The authors of the poll reported:
"75 percent of Americans—including 65 percent of Republicans, 83 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Independents—would 'support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards.' Women (80 percent) were more likely than men (70 percent) to support this idea. Support also was higher among college graduates (78 percent) than among those who did not graduate from high school (68 percent)."&lt;ref&gt;Opinion Research Corporation, [http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf A Post Fossil-Fuel America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201122738/http://www.cleanenergyaction.net/101807_CLEAN_survey_report.pdf |date=1 December 2008 }}, Executive Summary, National Opinion Survey Produced for Citizens Lead for Energy Action Now (CLEAN),
A Project of the Civil Society Institute, 18 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact question posed by the survey was as follows:
"More than half of power plant-generated electricity comes from coal. Experts say that power plants are responsible for about 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide pollution linked to global warming. There are plans to build more than 150 new coal-fired power plants over the next several years. Would you support a five-year moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in the United States if there was stepped-up investment in clean, safe and renewable energy—such as wind and solar—and improved home energy-efficiency standards? Would you say definitely yes, probably yes, probably no, definitely no, or don't know."

== Alternative Sources of Energy ==
{{See also|Alternative energy|energy transition|100% renewable energy}}

[[Alternative energy]] refers to any source of energy that can substitute the role of fossil fuels. [[Renewable energy]], or energy that is harnessed from [[Renewable resource|renewable sources]], is an alternative energy. However, alternative energy can refer to non renewable sources as well, like [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. Between the alternative sources of energy are: [[solar energy]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[marine energy]], [[Wind power|wind energy]], [[geothermal energy]], [[biofuel]]s, [[ethanol]] and [[Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen]].

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] is complementary to the use of alternative energy sources, when phasing-out fossil fuels.

=== Renewable energy ===
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|The worldwide growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy is [[energy]] that comes from resources which are naturally replenished such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal energy|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]]. {{As of|2014}}, 19% of global final energy consumption comes from [[renewable resource]]s, with 9% of all energy from traditional [[biomass]], mainly used for [[heating]], 1% from biofuels, 4% from [[hydroelectricity]] and 4% from biomass, geothermal or solar heat. Popular renewables (wind, solar, geothermal and biomass for power) accounted for another 1.4% and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf pg18&lt;/ref&gt; While renewable energy supplies are growing and have displaced coal in some regions, the amount of coal burned in 2021, is expected to be the same as it was in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/MediumTermCoalMarketReport2016ExecutiveSummaryEnglishversion.pdf pg3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:Chief Joseph Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Chief Joseph Dam]] near [[Bridgeport, Washington]], US, is a major run-of-the-river station without a sizeable reservoir.]]
In 2015, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric energy]] generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe and North America environmental concerns around land flooded by large [[reservoir]]s ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s. Since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like China, Brazil and India. [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] and [[small hydro]] have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas.

=== Wind power ===
{{Main|Wind farm}}
[[File:Turbiny wiatrowe w Szwecji, 2011 ubt.JPG|thumb|[[Lillgrund Wind Farm]] in Sweden]]
[[File:windpark Estinnes 20juli2010 kort voor voltooiing.jpg|thumb|First wind farm consisting of 7,5&amp;nbsp;MW Enercon E-126 turbines, [[Estinnes]], [[Belgium]], 20 July 2010, two months before completion; note the 2-part blades.]]

A wind farm is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2015 supplied almost 1% of global energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/REN21_GSR2016_KeyFindings_en_10.pdf page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the United States and China. The [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has over 5,000&amp;nbsp;MW installed with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. China has several other "wind power bases" of similar size. The [[Alta Wind Energy Center]] in [[California]], United States is the largest onshore wind farm outside of China, with a capacity of 1020&amp;nbsp;MW of power.&lt;ref name=terragen&gt;[http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx Terra-Gen Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902091230/http://www.terra-genpower.com/News/Terra-Gen-Power-Announces-Closing-of-$650-Million-.aspx |date=2 September 2015 }}, 17 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2012, the [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367&amp;nbsp;MW, followed by [[Thanet Offshore Wind Project]] (300&amp;nbsp;MW), also in the United Kingdom.

{{See also|Concentrated solar power}}
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations. Several European countries have debated [[Nuclear power phase-out|nuclear phase-outs]] and others have completely shut down some reactors. Three [[nuclear accidents]] have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power: the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States, the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] in the USSR, and the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]] in Japan.

=== Energy efficiency ===
{{Main|Efficient energy use}}

Moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.  Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007). [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2007). [http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2007/bestpractice/Workshop_Proceedings.pdf ''Global Best Practice in Renewable Energy Policy Making'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ganigobis Formation''' is a [[Late Carboniferous]] ([[Gzhelian]]) to [[Early Permian]] ([[Artinskian]]) geologic [[Formation (geology)|formation]] of the [[Dwyka Group]] in the [[ǁKaras Region]] of southeastern [[Namibia]] and the [[Northern Cape]] of [[South Africa]]. The widespread formation was deposited in the [[Aranos Basin|Aranos]] and [[Karoo Basin]]s of southern Africa.

== Description ==
The Ganigobis Formation is an extensive unit with a maximum thickness of {{convert|240|m|ft}} evidenced in the Vreda borehole.&lt;ref name=Bangertetal2000_p266&gt;Bangert et al., 2000, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[sandstone]]s, [[shale]]s and [[tuff]] of the formation were deposited in a [[glacial|glacio]]-[[lacustrine]] to marine [[depositional environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?action=displayStrata&amp;geological_group=Dwyka%20Shale&amp;formation=Ganigobis&amp;group_formation_member=Ganigobis Ganigobis Formation] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bangert2000_p21&gt;Bangert, 2000, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The Ganigobis Formation provides fossil fish as well as [[bivalve]]s (e.g. ''[[Nuculopsis]]''), [[gastropod]]s (e.g. ''[[Peruvispira]]''), [[scyphozoa]] (e.g. ''[[Conularia]]''), [[crinoid]] stalks, [[foraminifera]] (''[[Hyperammina]]'', ''[[Ammodiscus]]'', ''[[Glomospira]]'', ''[[Ammobacculites]]'' and ''[[Spiroplectammina]]''),&lt;ref name=Bangert2000_p60&gt;Bangert, 2000, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[sponge]]s and sponge spicules, [[radiolaria]], [[coprolite]]s and permineralised wood.&lt;ref name=Bangert2000_p3&gt;Bangert, 2000, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zircon]]s of the Ganigobis Shale Member yield SHRIMP-ages of 302-300 Ma. This dates the uppermost part of the second deglaciation sequence in southern Namibia to the
Late Carboniferous (Gzelian) and provides a minimum age for the onset of Karoo-equivalent marine deposition. The age of the uppermost argillaceous part of the third deglaciation sequence (297 Ma) was determined from zircons of a [[tuff]]aceous bed sampled in a roadcut in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.&lt;ref name=Bangert2000_p3/&gt;

== Fossil content ==
Among others, the following fossils are reported from the formation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=131110 Ganigobis] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=131113 Wesselton Mine, Kimberley] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=131078 Ganigobis, near Tses Station] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">A '''groundbed''' is an [[:wikt:array|array]] of [[electrode]]s, installed in the ground to provide a low [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] [[electricity|electrical]] path to [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] or earth.  A groundbed is a component in an [[earthing system]].

Each electrode is called a '''ground rod''' or a '''earth electrode'''.

==Grounding systems==
For building electrical grounding systems or earthing systems there is a low resistance conductor bonding the metalwork and this is connected to a groundbed.  The electrodes for electrical grounding are often called ''ground rods'' and are often made from [[steel]] with a [[copper]] [[Cladding (metalworking)|clad]] surface – typically 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;m long and {{convert|20|mm|in|2}} in diameter.  These are driven vertically into the ground and bonded together with bare copper [[wire]].&lt;ref&gt;Electrical Engineer's Reference Book, Sixteenth edition by M. A. Laughton CEng., FIEE and D. J. Warne CEng., FIEE, Newnes, 2003, {{ISBN|0 7506 46373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other grounding electrodes may include buried solid plates, or a grid of buried wires, where soil conditions do not favor driven ground rods. Buried metallic piping systems, well casings or the reinforcing bars of concrete slabs in contact with the earth have all been used as grounding electrodes.

== Soil conditioning ==
Various materials may be placed around the ground rod to improve conductivity. These include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keison.co.uk/furse/earth_soil_conditioning_agents.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ecmweb.com/content/achieving-acceptable-ground-poor-soil&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marconite.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Jones, ''Bentonite Rods Assure Ground Rod Installation In Problem Soils'', 1980, DOI: 10.1109/TPAS.1980.319556&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cathodic protection==
In [[cathodic protection]], the [[anode]] groundbed is the arrangement of anodes in the ground or water and it provides the path for protective current to leave the anodes and enter to [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref&gt;NACE/ASTM G193 – 10a Standard Terminology and Acronyms Relating to Corrosion 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==High voltage direct current systems==
In a [[high voltage direct current]] transmission system, each converter station may be equipped with a substantial ground bed to facilitate earth return operation of the system. In normal operation of a bipolar HVDC system, current is carried on the two wires of the transmission line, but if a line fails or one converter fails, the earth return can be used to maintain partial operation.  Ground beds must be designed to accept considerable current ( on the order of 1000 amperes) for extending times, without drying out.  Ground return operation may cause objectionable earth currents that cause corrosion of other buried services such as pipelines. A short overhead power line may be run from the converter station to obtain the best location for a ground bed.

Hammeren features a large lake, [[Hammersø]], the largest on the island, and a deep pond, Opalsø, surrounded by the rocky slopes of a former [[granite]] quarry. Separated by a rift valley, the area is composed of about 50% rocks, 25% forest and 25% cultivated land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studienet.dk/Opgaver/Hammers%C3%B8en--24294.aspx|title=Rapport: Hammersøen|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=SStuidenet}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Hammeren is now a protected nature reserve.

Close to the coast, to the south of the Hammeren Lighthouse, the ruins of [[Salomons Kapel]] (Solomon's Chapel) can be seen. Thought to have been built by the [[Archbishop of Lund]] in the beginning of the fourteenth century, it was named after St Solomon, a [[Dominican monk]]. It was built of brick and hewn boulders in two stages: first the small rectangular church and later the porch area to the south. Remains of the altar and of brick benches along the walls can be seen. The chapel was constructed in connection with Bornholm's herring trade with the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic cities]] of Hamburg and Lübeck from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholmerguiden.dk/kirchen/salomons_kapel_bornholm/index.htm "Salomons kapel på Bornholm"], ''Bornholmer Guiden''. {{da icon}}.

A '''katabatic wind''' (named from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word κατάβασις ''[[katabasis]]'', meaning "descending") is the technical name for a drainage wind, a [[wind]] that carries high-density air from a higher elevation down a slope under the force of gravity. Such winds are sometimes also called '''fall winds'''; the spelling '''catabatic winds'''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
also occurs. Katabatic winds can rush down elevated slopes at hurricane speeds, but most are not as intense as that, and many are of the order of 10 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (18 km/h) or less.

Not all downslope winds are katabatic. For instance, winds such as the [[Foehn wind|föhn]], [[Chinook wind|chinook]], and [[bergwind]] are [[rain shadow]] winds where air driven upslope on the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] side of a mountain range drops its moisture and descends [[Windward and leeward|leeward]] drier and warmer. Examples of true katabatic winds include the [[Bora (wind)|bora]] (or bura) in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], the [[Bohemian Wind]] or ''Böhmwind'' in the [[Ore Mountains]], the [[Santa Ana wind|Santa Ana]] in southern California, the [[piteraq]] winds of Greenland, and the [[oroshi]] in [[Japan]]. Another example is "the Barber", an enhanced katabatic wind that blows over the town of [[Greymouth]] in [[New Zealand]] when there is a southeast flow over the South Island. "The Barber" has a local reputation for its coldness.

== Theory ==
[[File:Katabatic-wind hg.png|thumb|Sketch of the generation of katabatic winds in Antarctica]]
A katabatic wind originates from radiational cooling of air atop a plateau, a mountain, glacier, or even a hill. Since the [[density]] of [[air]] is [[Inverse proportion#Inverse_proportionality|inversely proportional]] to [[temperature]], the air will flow downwards, warming approximately [[adiabatic process|adiabatically]] as it descends. The temperature of the air depends on the temperature in the source region and the amount of descent. In the case of the Santa Ana, for example, the wind can (but does not always) become hot by the time it reaches sea level. In Antarctica, by contrast, the wind is still intensely cold.

The entire near-surface wind field over Antarctica is largely determined by the katabatic winds, particularly outside the summer season, except in coastal regions when storms may impose their own wind field.

== Impacts ==
[[File:Antarctic shelf ice hg.png|thumb|Coastal [[polynya]]s are produced in the Antarctic by katabatic winds]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Sea ice by fruchtzwerg's world.jpg|thumb|Katabatic wind spilling off an ice shelf]]--&gt;
Katabatic winds are most commonly found blowing out from the large and elevated ice sheets of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]].  The buildup of high density cold air over the ice sheets and the elevation of the ice sheets brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/southpole/577 Climate: The South Pole] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918055013/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/SouthPole/577 |date=2008-09-18 }} [http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html Stanford Humanities Lab]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060912022451/http://shl.stanford.edu:3455/admin/directory.html |date=2006-09-12 }}, Retrieved 2008-10-01&lt;/ref&gt; reaching around {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Trewby, M. (Ed., 2002): ''Antarctica. An encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton'' Firefly Books Ltd. {{ISBN|1-55297-590-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greenland these winds are called [[piteraq]] and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast.

In a few regions of continental Antarctica the snow is scoured away by the force of the katabatic winds, leading to "dry valleys" (or "[[Antarctic oasis|Antarctic oases]]") such as the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]]. Since the katabatic winds are descending, they tend to have a low relative humidity, which desiccates the region. Other regions may have a similar but lesser effect, leading to "blue ice" areas where the snow is removed and the surface ice [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]], but is replenished by glacier flow from upstream.

In the Fuegian Archipelago ([[Tierra del Fuego]]) in South America as well as in Alaska, a wind known as a [[williwaw]] is a particular danger to harboring vessels. Williwaws originate in the snow and ice fields of the coastal mountains, and they can be faster than {{convert|120|kn|mph km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wind/The-Williwaw.htm Williwaw] ''weatheronline.co.uk''.

A '''Wisconsin state forest''' is an area of [[forest]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]] managed by the [[Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]]'s Division of Forestry.  They are managed for outdoor recreation, watershed and habitat preservation, and sustainable [[forestry]].  The various units total 471,329 acres (1,907&amp;nbsp;km²), although many contain extensive private [[inholding]]s.  Wisconsin's state forests are often co-listed with [[List of Wisconsin state parks|Wisconsin's state park system]], which is maintained by the Division of Parks and Recreation.

Below is the '''list of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2017'''.

== Timeline of known close approaches less than one lunar distance from Earth in 2017 ==
A list of known [[near-Earth asteroid]] close approaches less than 1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] ({{convert|0.0025696|AU|km mi|abbr=on}}) from [[Earth]] in 2017.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For a list of current Earth close approaches see [http://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca NEO Earth Close Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt;

For reference, the [[Earth radius|radius of Earth]] is approximately {{convert|0.0000426|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} or 0.0166 lunar distances.&lt;br&gt;[[Geosynchronous satellite]]s have an orbit with [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] length of {{convert|0.000282|AU|km mi|abbr=on}} or 0.110 lunar distances. In 2017, five known [[asteroid]]s have traveled nearer than this, 2017 GM, 2017 UJ2, YU95BEF, 2017 EA, and 2017 WE30. P10ELNY and A104Vqx probably have traveled nearer, but knowledge of their orbit is too poor to be sure.

While most asteroids on this list are confirmed, well-observed unconfirmed objects with a 50% or greater chance of passing within 1 LD of the Earth are included as well.

This list does not include any of the [[List_of_bolides|29 objects that collided with earth in 2017]], none of which were discovered in advance, but were recorded by sensors designed to detect detonation of nuclear devices (of the 29 objects detected, 6 had an impact energy greater than that of a 1 kiloton device) &lt;ref&gt;https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{color box|#ff9999}} Rows highlighted red indicate objects which were not discovered until after closest approach

{{color box|#ffff99}} Rows highlighted yellow indicate objects discovered less than 24 hours before closest approach

{{color box|#99ff99}} Rows highlighted green indicate objects discovered more than one week before closest approach (in 2017 only one object was detected on final approach this far in advance, {{mpl|2017 TD|6}})

{{color box|#79d8ff}} Rows highlighted blue indicate objects discovered more than one year before closest approach i.e. objects successfully cataloged on a previous orbit, rather than being detected during final approach (in 2017 only one object was detected this far in advance {{mpl|2012 TC|4}} which was discovered 5 years previously)

=== Notes ===
{{Reflist|group="note"}}

== Timeline of close approaches less than one lunar distance from the Moon in 2017 ==
The number of asteroids listed here are significantly less than those of asteroids that approach Earth for several reasons. Asteroids that approach Earth not only move faster, but are brighter and are easier to detect with modern [[Astronomical survey|surveys]] because:
* Asteroids that come closer to Earth are a higher priority to confirm, and only confirmed asteroids are listed with a lunocentric approach distance.
* Those that closely approach the Moon are frequently lost in its glare, making them harder to confirm. They are similarly hard to discover during the [[new moon]], when the Moon is too close to the [[Sun]] to detect asteroids while they are near the Moon.

These factors severely limit the amount of Moon-approaching asteroids, to a level many times lower than the asteroids detected passing as close to Earth.

==Virtual Impactors==

List of asteroids with a [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]] greater than −6 that are listed on the [[Sentry Risk Table]] because they have short [[observation arc]]s with poorly constrained orbits and have a chance of [[Impact event|impacting]] Earth in 2017. Given a short observation arc, many different orbits fit the observed data. {{mp|2010 XB|73}} could have approached Earth around May 2017 or could have been 9 AU&lt;ref name="ND10XB73"/&gt; from Earth on the way to a close approach with Saturn in 2018. A Palermo rating of −4 indicates an event that is 10,000 times less likely than the background hazard level of Earth impacts, which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.

'''Roofing material''' is the outermost layer on the [[roof]] of a building, sometimes self-supporting, but generally supported by an underlying structure. A building's roofing material provides shelter from the natural elements. The outer layer of a roof shows great variation dependent upon availability of material, and the nature of the supporting structure. Those types of roofing material which are commercially available range from natural products such as [[thatch]] and [[slate]] to commercially produced products such as [[tiles]] and [[polycarbonate]] sheeting. Roofing materials may be placed on top of a secondary water-resistant material called underlayment.

==Materials==
The weatherproofing material is the topmost or outermost layer exposed to the weather.  Many materials have been used as weatherproofing material:
* [[Thatch]] is roofing made of plant stalks in overlapping layers
** [[Wheat]] [[straw]], widely used in England, France, and other parts of Europe
**[[Seagrass]], used in coastal areas where there are [[estuary|estuaries]] such as Scotland. Has a longer life than straw. Claimed to have a life in excess of 60 years.
** [[Rye]] straw, commonly used in a barn.
** Raffia palm leaves:A well organised raffia palm leaves is mainly used as roof houses in Nigeria, especially among the Igbos.
** [[Rice]] straw, commonly used in Eastern Asia.
** Water reed, commonly used in Ireland for [[Thatching]].
* [[Roof shingle|Shingle]] is the generic term for a roofing material that is in many overlapping sections, 
** [[Wood shingle]], shingles sawn from bolts of wood such as [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] which has a useful performance life expectancy of up to 30 years. However, young growth red cedar has a short life expectancy and high cost. In the United States and Canada, eastern [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] is also used. Some [[hardwood]]s were very durable roofing found in Colonial [[Australian architecture|Australian]] and [[American colonial architecture]]; their use is now usually limited to [[building restoration]]. All wood shingles benefit by being allowed to breathe (dry out from below).
** [[Shake (shingle)]], Are different than wood shingles in that they are split on one side and sawed on the back side. Commonly referred to as "resawn Shakes". A cedar shake is NOT the same as a cedar shingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Grading and Manufacturing {{!}} Products {{!}} Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau|url = http://www.cedarbureau.org/frequently-asked-questions/product/grading-and-manufacturing.asp|website = www.cedarbureau.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Slate]]. High cost with a life expectancy of 80 to 400 years. See the article [[slate industry]] for an overview including names of quarries. Some of the famous quarries where the highest quality slate comes from that are available in Australia are Bethesda in Wales and areas of Spain.
** [[Asphalt shingle]] made of bitumen embedded in an organic or fiberglass mat, usually covered with colored, man-made ceramic grit. Cheaper than slate or tiles. The reduced cost of this particular style of roofing is especially apparent in its application and removal. Installation is very streamlined and a rapid process. Depending on the size of the roof and the experience of the crew, it is possible to remove old shingles and apply new ones on 2-3 houses in one day. Life span varies. Use only on slanted roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing Requirements One- and Two- Family Dwellings|url=http://roofingroger.com/roofing-requirements-one-and-two-family-dwellings/|publisher=Regulatory Services Department|accessdate=29 August 2015|quote=Asphalt-based organic and fiberglass shingles may only be used on roofs with slopes of 2:12 and greater.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Rubber shingle, alternative to asphalt shingle, slate, shake or tile. Made primarily of rubber, often recycled tire-derived rubber. Other typical ingredients include binders, UV (ultraviolet light) inhibitors and color. Warranted and designed to last at least 50 years in most cases.
** [[Asbestos]] shingles. Very long lifespan, fireproof, and low cost but now rarely used because of health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asbestos_and_your_health?open | title=Asbestos and your health | publisher=[[State Government of Victoria]] | work=Better Health Channel | date=September 2011 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Stone slab. Heavy stone slabs (not to be confused with slate) 1–2 inches thick were formerly used as roofing tiles in some regions in England, the [[Alps]], and [[Scandinavia]]. Stone slabs require a very heavyweight roof structure, but their weight makes them stormproof. An obsolete roofing material, now used commercially only for building restoration.
*** [[Collyweston stone slate]]
** [[Solar shingle]]
** Metal shakes or shingles. Long life. High cost, suitable for roofs of 3:12 pitch or greater. Because of the flexibility of metal, they can be manufactured to lock together, giving durability and reducing assembly time. For a discussion of copper system shingles, see [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding]].
* Ceramic [[tile#Roof tiles|tile]]. High cost, life of more than 100 years.
** [[Imbrex and tegula]], style dating back to ancient Greece and Rome.
** [[Monk and Nun]], a style similar to Imbrex and tegula, but basically using two Imbrex tiles.
** [[Dutch roof tiles]], Netherlands
** [[Mangalore tiles]], India
* [[Membrane roofing]]. Membrane roofing is in large sheets, generally fused in some way at the joints to form a continuous surface.
** [[Thermoset membrane]] (e.g. [[EPDM rubber]]). [[Synthetic rubber]] sheets adhered together with contact adhesive or tape. Primary application is big box stores with large open areas.
** [[Thermoplastic]]s (e.g. [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[ThermoPlastic Olefin|TPO]], [[Hypalon|CSPE]]) – Plastic sheets welded together with hot air, creating one continuous sheet membrane. They can be re-welded with the exception of CSPE. Lends itself well to both big box and small roof application because of its hot air weldability. This membrane is installed by two methods: 1.) Rolls of membrane are attached to the ridged insulation using a bonding adhesive; 2.) The edge of each roll is fastened through ridged insulation into structural deck, and the proceeding roll is lapped over the fasteners.  The overlap is then heat-welded with hot air to create a mechanically fastened thermoplastic roof. PVC is also known as IB.[[Vinyl roof membrane]].
** [[Liquid roofing]]
** [[Asphalt roll roofing]] including single and double coverage types.
** [[Bituminous waterproofing]] is a general term for:
*** Modified [[bitumen]] – heat-welded, asphalt-adhered, or installed with adhesive. Asphalt is mixed with polymers such as APP or SBS, then applied to fiberglass and/or polyester mat, seams sealed by locally melting the asphalt with heat, hot mopping of asphalt, or adhesive.  Lends itself well to most applications.
*** Built-up roof – Multiple plies of salt-saturated organic felt or coated fiberglass felts. Plies of felt are adhered with hot asphalt, coal tar pitch, or adhesive.  Although the roof membrane can be left bare, it is typically covered with a thick coat of the waterproofing material and covered with gravel.  The gravel provides protection from ultra-violet degradation, stabilizes the temperature changes, protects surface of the roof, and increases the weight of the roof system to resist wind blow-off.
**[[Textile|Fabric]]
** [[polyester]].
** [[PTFE]], (synthetic fluoropolymer) embedded in [[fibreglass]].
* [[Metal roof]]ing.
** [[Corrugated galvanised iron]] is [[Hot-dip galvanizing|Galvanised steel]] manufactured with wavy corrugations to resist lateral flexing and fitted with exposed fasteners. Widely used for low cost and durability. Sheds are normally roofed with this material. ''Gal iron'' or ''Corro'' was the most extensively used roofing material of 20th century Australia, now replaced in popularity by steel with longer-lasting, coloured, alloy coatings.
** [[Copper in architecture#Roofing|Copper roofs]] can last for hundreds of years. Copper roofing offers durability, ease of fabrication, lighter weight than some other roofing materials, can be curved, low maintenance, corrosion resistance, low thermal movement, lightning protection, radio frequency shielding, and are 100% recyclable. Copper roofs have a high initial cost but very long lifetime: tests on European copper roofs from the 18th Century showed that, in theory, copper roofs can last one thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;The glory of copper; ''Metal Roofing Magazine,'' December 2002/January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of copper roofing systems is that they are relatively easy to repair.
** Standing-seam metal with concealed fasteners.
** Mechanically seamed metal with concealed fasteners contains sealant in seams for use on very low sloped roofs, suitable for roofs of low pitch such as 0.5/12 to 3/12 pitch.
** Flat-seam metal with or without soldered seams.
** [[Steel]] coated with a coloured [[alloy]] of [[zinc]] and [[aluminium]].
** [[Stone-coated metal roofing]].
* [[Concrete]] or [[fibre cement]], usually reinforced with fibres of some sort.
** may also be in the form of concrete tiles.
* Structural concrete can also be used for flat roof constructions. There are three main categories, [[Prestressed concrete|precast/prestressed]], cast-in-place and [[Concrete shell|shell]]. There are many types of precast/prestressed concrete roofing. The following are the most common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concrete Roof Systems Part 1: Precast/Prestressed Constructions |url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |accessdate=26 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171509/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Concrete%20Roof%20Systems%20Part%20I_%20Precast_Prestressed%20Construction_tcm45-348518.pdf |archivedate=26 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Double tee]]s are the most common products for short spans up to {{Convert|60|ft}}
** [[Hollow-core slab]]s are used when there is a need for flushed ceiling.
** [[T-beam]]s are similar to double tees but can be used for span ranging from {{Convert|30|ft}} to {{Convert|100|ft}}.
** [[Joist]]s and [[Concrete slab|planks]] are combination of using prestressed joists with prestressed planks. [[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]]-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|36|ft|adj=on}} spans and tee-shape joists can be used for up to {{Convert|60|ft|adj=on}} span.

The following is an extensive list of [[earthquake]]s that have been detected in the British Isles&amp;Ireland. On average, several hundred earthquakes are detected by the [[British Geological Survey]] each year, but almost all are far too faint to be felt by humans. Those that are felt generally cause very little damage. Nonetheless, earthquakes have on occasion resulted in considerable damage, most notably in 1580 and 1884; Musson (2003) reports that there have been ten documented fatalities&amp;nbsp;– six caused by falling masonry and four by building collapse. The causes of earthquakes in the UK are unclear, but may include "regional compression caused by motion of the Earth’s tectonic plates, and uplift resulting from the melting of the ice sheets that covered many parts of Britain thousands of years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/hazards/earthquakes/UK.html |title=Earthquakes in the UK |publisher=British Geological Society |access-date=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval reports of "earthquakes" that threw down newly built cathedrals may simply have been catastrophic failure of overloaded masonry, particularly towers, rather than actual tectonic events.

(Compare to [[:File:Level IV ecoregions, Arkansas.pdf|map of Level IV ecoregions]].)]]

&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: Please do not link general place articles such as [[Cascade Range]]. This list is for the ecoregions defined under the CEC classification, and articles linked here should be about the specific units defined by the CEC. See [[User:Northwesterner1/notes]] for a rationale. NOTE TO EDITORS--&gt;
This '''list of ecoregions in Arkansas''' provides an overview of [[ecoregions]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arkansas]] designated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (CEC). The Commission's 1997 report, [[List of Ecoregions of North America|Ecological Regions of North America]], provides a spatial framework that may be used by government agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s, and academic researchers as a basis for [[Risk management|risk analysis]], [[natural resource management|resource management]], and [[environmental science|environmental study]] of the continent's [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=CEC&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] | title=Ecological Regions of North America: Toward a Common Perspective | url=http://www3.cec.org/islandora/en/item/1701-ecological-regions-north-america-toward-common-perspective-en.pdf | year=1997 | accessdate=January 15, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecoregions may be identified by similarities in [[geology]], [[physiography]], [[vegetation]], [[climate]], [[soil]]s, [[land use]], [[wildlife]] distributions, and [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name=map4&gt;{{Cite document |last1=Woods |first1=A.J. |last2=Foti |first2=T.L. |last3=Chapman, |first3=S.S. |last4=Omernik |first4=J.M. | title=Ecoregions of Arkansas (color poster with map, descriptive text, summary tables, and photographs) | place=Reston, Virginia | publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] | year=2004 | url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/ar/ar_front.pdf | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification system has four levels. Levels III, and IV are shown on this list. '''Level I''' divides [[North America]] into 15 ecoregions; of these, the entire state is within the [[List of ecoregions in North America (CEC)#Eastern Temperate Forests|Eastern Temperate Forests]] level. Subdividing the Eastern Temperate Forests, Arkansas is split among three Level II ecoregions: the [[Southeastern Plains]], [[Ozark, Ouachita, Appalachian Forests]], and the [[Mississippi Alluvial and Southeast USA Coastal Plains]]. '''Level III''' subdivides the continent into 182 ecoregions; of these, seven lay partly within Arkansas's borders. '''Level IV''' is a further subdivision of Level III ecoregions. There are 32 Level IV ecoregions in Arkansas,&lt;ref name="map4"/&gt; many of which continue into adjacent areas in the neighboring states of [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]. 

The task of defining and mapping these ecoregions was carried out by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) Region 6, EPA-National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory ([[Corvallis, Oregon]]), and the Multi-Agency Wetland Planning Team{{#tag:ref|Multi-Agency Wetland Planning Team consists of the [[Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission]], [[Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission]], [[Arkansas Game and Fish Commission]] (AGFC), [[Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality]] (ADEQ), [[Arkansas Forestry Commission]], and [[University of Arkansas]] Cooperative Extension Service.&lt;ref name="map4"/&gt;
|group=Note}} The new classification system they developed may differ from previous frameworks developed separately by the agencies.

Arkansas is [[biodiversity|ecologically diverse]]. Though often simplistically split into halves from southwest to northeast, with "uplands" in the northwest half and "lowlands" in the southeastern half, the CEC system of levels reveals the diverse forests and floodplains, prairies and plateaus, ridges and river bottoms, and [[loess hills]] and lowlands of Arkansas.&lt;ref name="map4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9928">This list of '''rivers of Chile''' includes all the major rivers of [[Chile]]. See each article for their tributaries, drainage areas, etc.  Usually significant [[Tributary|tributaries]] appear in this list, under the river into which they drain.

==Rivers by name==
Following lists show the information of GeoNames ordered by names:
* [[List of rivers of Chile (A–C)]]
* [[List of rivers of Chile (D–O)]]
* [[List of rivers of Chile (P–Z)]]

==Rivers by region==
The lists of rivers by region are:

* [[List of rivers of the Arica y Parinacota Region]] (approx. 34 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Tarapacá Region]] (approx. 44 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Antofagasta Region]] (approx. 41 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Atacama Region]] (approx. 61 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Coquimbo Region]] (approx. 121 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Valparaíso Region]] (approx. 174 rivers)

* [[List of rivers of the Aysén Region]] (approx. 295 rivers)
* [[List of rivers of the Magallanes Region]] (approx. 173 rivers)

==Information in the lists==
This list contains:
# '''Name''' of the stream, in Spanish Language
# '''Coordinates''' are the latitude and longitude of the feature in ± decimal degrees, at the mouth of the stream
# '''Link''' to a map including the [http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt ''Geonameid''] (a number which uniquely identifies a Geoname feature)
# '''Feature Code''' explained in [http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html]
# '''Other names''' for the same feature, if any
# '''Basin countries''' additional to Chile, if any

Among all the features recorded in the GeoNames database, Wikipedia has arbitrarily selected for these lists features named "Rio", "Rio", "Canal", "Arroyo", "Estero", "Riachuelo" and they must contain one of following ''Feature Codes'' (explained in [http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html]):

:'''RPDS''': rapids, a turbulent section of a stream associated with a steep, irregular stream bed 
:'''CHN''': channel, the deepest part of a stream, bay, lagoon, or strait, through which the main current flows
:'''CNLA''': aqueduct, a conduit used to carry water 
:'''CNLB''': canal bend, a conspicuously curved or bent section of a canal
:'''CNLD''': drainage canal, an artificial waterway carrying water away from a wetland or from drainage ditches
:'''CNLI''': irrigation canal, a canal which serves as a main conduit for irrigation water 
:'''CNLN''': navigation canal(s), a watercourse constructed for navigation of vessels
:'''CNLSB''': underground irrigation canal(s), a gently inclined underground tunnel bringing water for irrigation from aquifers 
:'''CRKT''': tidal creek(s) a meandering channel in a coastal wetland subject to bi-directional tidal currents 
:'''DTCH''':  ditch, a small artificial watercourse dug for draining or irrigating the land
:'''DTCHI''': irrigation ditch, a ditch which serves to distribute irrigation water
:'''DTCHD''': drainage ditch, a ditch which serves to drain the land
:'''ESTY''':  estuary, a funnel-shaped stream mouth or embayment where fresh water mixes with sea water under tidal influences
:'''FORD''':  ford, a shallow part of a stream which can be crossed on foot or by land vehicl
:'''SBED''':  dry stream bed, a channel formerly containing the water of a stream
:'''STM''': stream, a body of running water moving to a lower level in a channel on land
:'''STMA''': anabranch, a diverging branch flowing out of a main stream and rejoining it downstream
:'''STMB''': stream bend, a conspicuously curved or bent segment of a stream
:'''STMC''': canalized stream, a stream that has been substantially ditched, diked, or straightened
:'''STMD''': distributary(-ies), a branch which flows away from the main stream, as in a delta or irrigation canal
:'''STMH''': headwaters, the source and upper part of a stream, including the upper drainage basin
:'''STMI''': intermittent stream
:'''STMIX''': section of intermittent stream
:'''STMM''': stream mouth(s), a place where a stream discharges into a lagoon, lake, or the sea
:'''STMQ''': abandoned watercourse, a former stream or distributary no longer carrying flowing water, but still evident due to lakes, wetland, topographic or vegetation patterns
:'''STMS''': streams, bodies of running water moving to a lower level in a channel on land
:'''STMSB''': lost river, a surface stream that disappears into an underground channel, or dries up in an arid area
:'''STMX''': section of stream
:'''TNLC''': canal tunnel, a tunnel through which a canal passes
:'''WTRC''': watercourse, a natural, well-defined channel produced by flowing water, or an artificial channel designed to carry flowing water
:'''WTRH''': waterhole(s), a natural hole, hollow, or small depression that contains water, used by man and animals, especially in arid areas

==Rivers by latitude==
Note: The rivers are ordered by the latitude of their outflows into the ocean, lakes, other rivers or out of Chile respectively.

==Largest rivers by basin area==
Note: The rivers are ordered by their [[drainage basin]] area within Chile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20055">Dr. '''Moritaka Hayashi''' is an [[international]] [[lawyer]], [[scholar]] and [[author]], who is widely considered a leading [[expert]] on the impact of human activity on the world's [[oceans]]. Over a period of nearly 40 years, he has published extensively on issues involving the [[law of the sea]], including [[overfishing]], [[maritime shipping]] and [[maritime security]]. In 2008, he served on an international commission that generated controversy by calling for the immediate suspension of [[bluefin tuna]] fishing in the Eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. He has also served as an [[official]] at the [[United Nations]] and as a [[diplomat]] for the [[Permanent Mission]] of [[Japan]] to the United Nations.

==Background==
Dr. Hayashi began his international legal career in 1971 as an officer at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/seafarers/icons-site/members.html |title=International Commission on Shipping Members |publisher=International Commission on Shipping |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1980, he worked as a [[diplomat]] at the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations rising to the position of [[Minister (government)|Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/seafarers/icons-site/members.html |title=International Commission on Shipping Members |publisher=International Commission on Shipping |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he returned to the United Nations to serve as Principal Officer, and subsequently as Director of its Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/seafarers/icons-site/members.html |title=International Commission on Shipping Members |publisher=International Commission on Shipping |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Dr. Hayashi began serving as the Head of the Fisheries Department within the United Nations' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/seafarers/icons-site/members.html |title=International Commission on Shipping Members |publisher=International Commission on Shipping |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, he joined [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]] to teach various courses including international law of the sea and [[international environmental law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/seafarers/icons-site/members.html |title=International Commission on Shipping Members |publisher=International Commission on Shipping |accessdate= 22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served on the International Commission on Shipping and an independent panel appointed by the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]].

==Role in bluefin tuna debate==
By its own description, the [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]] (ICCAT), is an "inter-governmental fishery organization responsible for the conservation of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccat.int/en/ |title=ICCAT |publisher=ICCAT |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, responding to concerns raised by the [[international community]], ICCAT appointed an independent panel to review its own performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagagiant.org/media/ICCAT%20Performance%20Review.pdf |title=Report of the Independent Review, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) |publisher=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hayashi served as a member of this panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagagiant.org/media/ICCAT%20Performance%20Review.pdf |title=Report of the Independent Review, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) |publisher=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report criticized the performance of ICCAT noting that the performance by ICCAT's members in managing bluefin tuna [[fisheries]] in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is "widely regarded as an international disgrace" and "a travesty in fisheries management." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagagiant.org/media/ICCAT%20Performance%20Review.pdf |title=Report of the Independent Review, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) |publisher=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}; {{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=145184 |title=Collapsing fishery gets tuna commission a blast from own review |publisher=WWF |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indicating that the collapse of the bluefin tuna stock in those areas "could be a real possibility in the foreseeable future," the panel recommended that fishing on bluefin tuna be suspended until ICCAT's members agree to abide by certain recommendations and [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagagiant.org/media/ICCAT%20Performance%20Review.pdf |title=Report of the Independent Review, International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) |publisher=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report attracted the support of several major [[advocacy groups]]. For example, [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (formerly, World Wildlife Fund) embraced the report and called the fishery "grossly out of control." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=145184 |title=Collapsing fishery gets tuna commission a blast from own review |publisher=WWF |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenpeace]] indicated that it "believes that EU and Mediterranean fishing countries should bear the brunt of the criticism for having taken bluefin to the brink of collapse, adding that the countries have placed again and again the short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/greenpeace-cites-is-last-chan/ |title=Greenpeace: CITES is last chance to save bluefin tuna from commercial extinction |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ICCAT indicated that, in response to the report, it reviewed the compliance record of each country with a particular focus on eastern bluefin tuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tagagiant.org/media/ICCAT_CFN_1.09.pdf |title=ICCAT failure prompts CITES talk for bluefin (Commercial Fisheries News, January 2009) |publisher=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |format=PDF |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2010, however, ICCAT has not agreed to suspend fishing on bluefin tuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/sharks-off-the-menu-but-delegates-reject-protection-for-bluefin-tuna-in-secret-vote-20101128-18ccr.html |title=Sharks off the menu but delegates reject protection for bluefin tuna in secret vote |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=22 July 2011 |date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Hayashi has long stressed the need for an increase in [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] and political will to control the potential devastation generated by [[market demand]]. In an interview in 1997, Dr. Hayashi commented: "Looking at the issue of overfishing, for example, history shows that therein lies the road to overcapitalization in industrial fisheries and excessive pressure in the case of small-scale fisheries and a headlong chase in pursuit of greater harvests. This has led to the collapse of some fisheries and fish stocks."

[[File:Map of the Arctic region showing the Northeast Passage, the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage, and bathymetry.png|thumb|upright=2|Map of the Arctic region showing the Northern Sea Route, in the context of the [[Northeast Passage]], and [[Northwest Passage]]&lt;ref name ="AMSA 2009"/&gt;]]

The '''Northern Sea Route''' ({{lang-ru|Се́верный морско́й путь}}, ''Severnyy morskoy put'', shortened to Севморпуть, ''Sevmorput'') is a [[Sea lane|shipping route]] officially defined by [[Russian law|Russian legislation]] as lying east of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and specifically running along the [[Russia]]n Arctic coast from the [[Kara Sea]], along [[Siberia]], to the [[Bering Strait]]. The entire route lies in [[Arctic]] waters and within Russia's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ). Parts are free of [[ice]] for only two months per year. The overall route on Russia's side of the Arctic between North Cape and the Bering Strait has been called the [[Northeast Passage]], analogous to the [[Northwest Passage]] on the Canada side.

While the Northeast Passage includes all the East Arctic seas and connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Northern Sea Route does not include the [[Barents Sea]], and it therefore does not reach the Atlantic.&lt;ref name ="AMSA 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Østreng 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Buixade Farre 2014"/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Northeast Passage#History}}
The route was first conquered by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]]'s ''[[Vega (ship)|Vega]]'' expedition.

Since the mid-1930s the Northern Sea Route has been an officially managed and administered shipping route along the northern/Arctic coast of Russia.  The administrative entity was sequentially updated, upgraded, and renamed.  Its current incarnation was the establishment of the Russian Federal State Institution (FGUP) “The Northern Sea Route Administration” in 2013 "to organize navigation in the water area of the Northern sea route by issuing navigation permissions and contributing to support activities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsra.ru/en/celi_funktsii/ Object of activity and functions of NSRA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811084328/http://www.nsra.ru/en/celi_funktsii/ |date=2016-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the first ship traversed the Northern Sea Route without the use of ice-breakers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/world/europe/russia-tanker-christophe-de-margerie.html|title=Russian Tanker Completes Arctic Passage Without Aid of Icebreakers|last=Goldman|first=Russell|date=2017-08-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', this forebodes more shipping through the Arctic, as the sea ice melts and makes shipping easier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2018 [[Maersk Line]] sent the new "ice-class" container ship ''Venta Maersk'' through the route to gather data on operational feasibility, though they did not currently see it as commercially attractive.&lt;ref name=bbc-20180823&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45271766 |title=Container ship to break the ice on Russian Arctic route |work=BBC News |date=23 August 2018 |accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escort assistance was required for three days from the Russian [[nuclear-powered icebreaker|Nuclear-powered icebreaker]] [[50 Let Pobedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/maersk-container-ship-arctic-ocean-northern-sea-route-venta-global-warming-a8543431.html|title=Container ship crosses Arctic route for first time in history due to melting sea ice|last=Embury-Dennis|first=Tom|date=2017-09-18|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-UK|issn=0951-9467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highnorthnews.com/maersk-container-ship-transits-arctic-ocean-with-icebreaker-escort/|title=Maersk Container Ship Transits Arctic Ocean With Icebreaker Escort|last=Humpert|first=Malte|date=2017-09-14|work=High North News|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report by the [[Copenhagen Business School]] found that large-scale trans-Arctic shipping will become economically viable by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://services-webdav.cbs.dk/doc/CBS.dk/Arctic%20Shipping%20-%20Commercial%20Opportunities%20and%20Challenges.pdf|title=Arctic shipping - Commercial opportunities and challenges|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2018 the government transferred the main responsibility for the Northern Sea Route to [[Rosatom]] which through its ROSATOMFLOT subsidiary manages the Russian nuclear powered icebreaker fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/arctic/2018/07/vyasheslav-ruksha-will-lead-newly-established-northern-sea-route-directorate | title= Vyacheslav Ruksha will lead the newly established Northern Sea Route Directorate |first=Thomas |last=Nilsen | date=2018-07-18 | work=The Barents Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On the Track of Unknown Animals''''' is a cryptozoological book by the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[France|French]] [[zoologist]] [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] that was first published in 1955 under the title ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées''. The English translation by Richard Garnett was published in 1958 with some updating by the author and with a foreword by [[Gerald Durrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Raymond |date=28 June 1959 |title=Time Blurred Their Trail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/06/28/archives/time-blurred-their-trail-on-the-track-of-unknown-animals-by-bernard.html |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher= |location= |volume= |issue= |department=Book Review |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised and abridged edition was published in 1965, and a further edition in 1995. It is credited with introducing the term [[cryptozoology]]&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;George Gaylord Simpson, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. '''128''', No. 1 (March 30, 1984), pp1-19 "Mammals and Cryptozoology"&lt;/ref&gt; and established its author as the "Father of Cryptozoology."&lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;Peter Dendle ''Folklore'' Vol 117, No. 2 (2006), pp 190-206 "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject== 
As one reviewer explained, it is a book "about animals that ''might'' exist."&lt;ref name=Science&gt;D. Johnson ''Science New Series'', Vol. 130, No. 3384 (Nov. 6, 1959), pp. 1245-1246 (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Track of Unknown Animals'' cites animals that had only been discovered relatively recently, such as the [[bonobo|pygmy chimpanzee]], [[coelacanth]], [[Komodo dragon]] and [[giant panda]]; and those that are believed to have become extinct relatively recently, such as the [[moa]] and [[thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]]. A major theme is that these animals were generally known to local peoples, but their stories were dismissed by visiting zoologists, particularly the [[okapi]].&lt;ref name=AmSci&gt;C. J. Reed ''American Scientist'' Vol. 47, No. 4, 1959, p 378A (book review)&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then discusses evidence for mystery animals from all over the world including the [[Mokele-mbembe]], [[sea serpent]]s and the [[Yeti]], with an extensive bibliography. He begins by complaining that "The Press has made such a laughing-stock of the [[Loch Ness Monster]]... that no scientific commission has ever dared tackle the problem" and ends with the wish that any new species are not merely slaughtered for trophies: "Have pity on them all, for it is we who are the real monsters."

Reviewers praised the breadth of study, careful citation and the author's knowledge&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmSci/&gt; but it was criticized for being somewhat shallow and "overly long and rambling."&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall1958"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3356">[[File:Landscape of Bayanaul 3.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the [[Kazakh Uplands]] which is a tectonically uplifted planation surface. The background areas are particularly flat. The Kazakh Uplands are usually referred as a [[peneplain]].]]
In [[geology]] and [[geomorphology]] a '''planation surface''' is a large-scale surface that is almost flat with the possible exception of some [[inselberg|residuals hills]]. The processes that form planation surfaces are labelled collectively '''planation''' and are [[Exogeny|exogenic]] (chiefly [[erosion]]). Planation surfaces are planated regardless of [[bedrock]] structures.&lt;ref name=Migon/&gt; On Earth they constitute some of the most common landscapes.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|editor-last=|editor-first=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=planation surface|year=|pages=|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/planation-surface}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peneplain]]s and [[pediplain]]s are types of planation surfaces planated respectively by "peneplanation" and "pediplanation". In addition to these there are planation surfaces proposed to be formed by [[cryoplanation]], marine processes, [[glacial erosion|areal glacial erosion]] and [[salt weathering]].&lt;ref name=Migon&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Migoń|first=Piotr|author-link=Piotr Migoń|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Planation surface|year=2004|pages=788–792}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''planation surface'' is often preferred over others because some more specific planation surface types and processes remain controversial.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; [[Etchplain]]s are [[weathering|weathered]] planation surfaces.&lt;ref name=Migon2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Migoń|first=Piotr|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Etchning, etchplain and etchplanation|year=2004|pages=345–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large planation surfaces, like the [[African Surface]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Kevin |last2=Gunnell |first2=Yanni |date=2008 |title=The African Erosion Surface: A Continental-Scale Synthesis of Geomorphology, Tectonics, and Environmental Change over the Past 180 Million Years |url= |location= |publisher=The Geological Society of America |pages=6–7 |isbn=978-0-8137-1201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; are typically formed [[diachronous]]ly.&lt;ref name=Romer2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Römer |first1=Wolfgang |last2= |first2= |date=2010 |title=Multiple planation surfaces in basement regions: Implications for the reconstruction of periods of denudation and uplift in southern Zimbabwe |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=114 |issue= |pages=199–212 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Planation surfaces are often thought to form at distinct [[base level]]s with sequences of them representing uplift events. However the disposition of some so-called planation surfaces may better reflect the easiness of erosion into different [[lithology|lithologies]] or [[structural geology|structures]] and may therefore not fit any uplift scheme.&lt;ref name=Romer2010/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2780">'''Pollution in the Arctic Ocean''' is primarily the result of economic activities carried out on land&amp;nbsp;– such as [[industrial development]] in the [[Arctic]] region, northern rivers, and the effects of military activities, particularly nuclear activity&amp;nbsp;– as well as the influx of [[pollutants]] from other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} However, the [[Arctic Ocean]] remains relatively clean compared to other marine regions of the world.

Economic activity in the Arctic seas is not the only source of pollution. The growing presence of military weapons systems in the region raises concerns of increased pollution.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Management of specific risks of [[marine pollution]] in the Arctic is governed primarily by national legislation in coastal states, although these take existing international standards into account. Bilateral agreements exist between Arctic states on cooperation in the prevention of marine pollution in the Arctic seas and immediate responses in case of [[oil spill]]s. Nevertheless, there is no legal framework relating to weapons and other military presence.

The first steps in this direction have already been made. After signing the 2010 [[List_of_maritime_boundary_treaties|Treaty on Maritime Delimitation]] of the continental shelf in the [[Barents Sea]] and the Arctic Ocean, [[Russia]] and [[Norway]] began bilateral consultations on the [[Harmonization (standards)|harmonization]] of national environmental standards used for the exploration and development of the mineral resources of the shelf. The parties came to an agreement to make a comparative analysis of national legislation and to identify differences concerning measures for preventing the pollution of the environment.

A recent report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theicct.org/air-pollution-marine-vessels-us-high-arctic-2025&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150209/report-warns-more-arctic-shipping-will-increase-warming-affect-health |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210155923/http://www.adn.com/article/20150209/report-warns-more-arctic-shipping-will-increase-warming-affect-health |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[International Council on Clean Transportation]] (ICCT) suggested that the reduction of the [[polar ice cap]]s and the projected increase in shipping activity in the region
could have a severe impact on the levels of pollution experienced across the entire [[Arctic]] region but notes that a shift to cleaner sulphur-based fuel could resolve the issue.

'''Poskær Stenhus''' is the largest round barrow in Denmark, dating back to 3.300 B.C. It is by the village Knebel on the hilly southern part of the peninsula, [[Djursland]], at the entrance to the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Sweden in northern Europe.&lt;ref name=autogeneret1 /&gt; The central burial chamber is equipped with a capstone weighing {{convert|11|tonne}}, surrounded by 23 slabs taller than a man, forming a circle.&lt;ref name=autogeneret1 /&gt;
[[File:Dolmen near Knebel, Denmark.png|thumb|250px|left|The Poskær Dolmen, as seen in this picture from 1937 (person beside it for scale)]] 
 
The capstone is the lesser half of a granite slab brought to Denmark from Northern Scandinavia by ice age glaciers' movements. The underside is remarkably flat, and possibly split from another half, by the dolmen builders. The other half is a {{convert|19|tonne|adj=on}} slab {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} to the northwest, placed as a capstone on another dolmen, [[Agri Dyssen]].&lt;ref name=autogeneret1 /&gt; How these slabs were transported and erected by Stone Age people is not known.

Apart from Denmark's easternmost island, [[Bornholm]], the country has no bedrock. Therefore, large granite slabs have been sought out for construction purposes and many dolmens have disappeared or been damaged.&lt;ref name=autogeneret2 /&gt;
[[File:1 borehul.jpg|thumb|upright|Dynamiting drill mark from Ole Hansen's attempt to convert the barrow to building blocks in 1859]]

In 1859 a landowner, Ole Hansen, attempted to dynamite slabs from Poskær Stenhus. A local priest started a process to stop the destruction of the burial site, ending with an official protection of the site in 1860. As part of this, Hansen was given a compensation of 100&amp;nbsp;rigsdaler.&lt;ref name=autogeneret2 /&gt; A broken slab-part with drill-marks from dynamiting at the barrow gives witness to his endeavor. At least one slab was destroyed before the site was protected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1876">The '''Richmond temperate forests''' are an [[ecoregion]] covering the northern part of [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]].

==Location and description==
This area includes the mountain valleys of the [[Kaikoura Ranges]] with its high peak at the 2880-metre [[Mount Tapuaenuku]], while to the south lies the beech-covered Spencer Range, and to the north and east lies open land running down to the [[Marlborough Sounds]] at the tip of the island. The wide valleys of the [[Wairau Valley|Wairau]] and [[Awatere River|Awatere]] rivers divide the region.

The climate is characterised by a hot summer and a cold, dry winter. &lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Northern part of New Zealand's South Island|id=aa0408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The native flora of this north country is [[Nothofagus]] beech forest with red beech (N. fusca) and silver beech (N. menziesii) in the lower, warmer, more fertile areas and hard beech (N.truncata) in the more exposed areas. Notable plants include the [[sedge]] [[Carex uncifolia]].

==Fauna==
The black-eyed gecko ([[Hoplodactylus kahutarae]]), New Zealand’s only alpine gecko is endemic to the north of South island, which is also home to the vulnerable scree skint ([[Oligosoma waimatense]]) and four species of [[giant weta]] including Kaikoura giant weta ([[Deinacrida parva]]) and the Kaikoura Ranges weta ([[Deinacrida elegans]]). The islands in the Marlborough Sounds have more endemic species of their own.

==Threats and preservation==
There are a number of protected areas along the Marlborough Sounds (on the islands in particular) and inland in the [[Nelson Lakes National Park]] and [[Richmond Forest Park]].

{{Governance}}
'''Soil governance''' refers to the [[Policy|policies]], strategies, and the processes of decision-making employed by [[nation state]]s and [[local government]]s regarding the use of [[soil]].&lt;ref name=Bonn2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonn2011|first=Conference|title=Sustainable Soil Governance: Towards Integrated Management for Water and food Security|url=http://www.water-energy-food.org/documents/hottopicsessions/6_hot_topic_issue_paper_soils_for_sustainable_development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, governance of the soil has been limited to an [[Agriculture|agricultural]] perspective due to increased [[food insecurity]] from the most populated regions on earth. The Global Soil Partnership,&lt;ref name=GSP&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Soil Partnership|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GSP, was initiated by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and its members with the hope to improve governance of the limited soil resources of the planet in order to guarantee healthy and productive soils for a food-secure world, as well as support other essential [[ecosystem service]]s.

Governing the soil requires international and national collaboration between governments, local authorities, industries and citizens to ensure implementation of coherent policies that encourage practices and methodologies that regulate usage of the resource to avoid conflict between users to promote [[sustainable land management]].&lt;ref name=Bonn2011 /&gt; In the [[European Union]]'s environmental policies, soil is recognized as a non-renewable resource, but its governance is maintained at a national level, unlike other non-renewable and climate sensitive resources.&lt;ref name=Commission2006a&gt;{{cite web|last=Commission of the European Communities|title=Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection|url=http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ESDB_Archive/Policies/Directive/com_2006_0231_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the developing world, soil governance is biased towards promoting [[sustainable agriculture]] and ensuring [[food security]].

Governance of the soil differs from [[soil management]]. Soil management involves practices and techniques used to increase and maintain [[soil fertility]], [[Soil structure|structure]], and carbon sequestration, etc.&lt;ref name=Follet2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Follet|first=R.F|title=Soil management concepts and carbon sequestration|journal=Soil Tillage and Research|year=2001|volume=61|issue=1-2|pages=77–92|doi=10.1016/s0167-1987(01)00180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil management techniques are heavily utilized in agriculture, because of the need to regulate the various practices, such as tillage techniques, [[fertilizer]] application and crop rotation (among others) by the various stakeholders involved. The need to monitor and avoid the negative effects of agricultural land use such as [[soil erosion]] has formed the basis of the discourse and awareness on soil governance,&lt;ref name=Bonn2011 /&gt; and has also seen the emergence of science and technology as the link between soil management and governance.&lt;ref name=GSM2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Soil Map|title=About the Project|url=http://www.globalsoilmap.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil governance mechanisms are usually encapsulated within the context of land governance, with little focus on urban and industrial soil governance especially in developing countries that have rapid [[urbanization]] rates;&lt;ref name=FAO1984&gt;{{cite web|last=Food and Agriculture Organisation|first=FAO|title=World Soil Charter|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0389E/T0389E0b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lal,Hall,Miller1989&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=R. |author2=Hall, G.F. |author3=Miller, F.P |title=Soil Degradation: Basic Processes|journal=Land Degradation and Development|year=1989|volume=1|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1002/ldr.3400010106}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, soil governance is highly interlinked with other atmospheric and anthropogenic processes which may contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing it as an entity.

With an aim to make soil data available to all, the Food and Agriculture Organization and [[UNESCO]] created a global soil map in 1981 as the main information on the distribution of soil resources. Currently, under the GSP framework, a new global soil information system will be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World|url=http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-survey/soil-maps-and-databases/faounesco-soil-map-of-the-world/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the International Union of Soil Sciences proposed December 5 to be "World Soil Day" to celebrate the importance of soil in our lives. Under the framework of the GSP, the [[sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly]] in December 2013 designated December 5 as the World Soil Day and declared 2015 as the International Year of Soils with the aim to raise awareness on the importance of soils for ecosystem functions and food security .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IUSS|title=World Soil Day|url=http://www.iuss.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=405|publisher=IUSS|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Year of Soils 2015 - IYS 2015|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/iys-2015/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Soil Partnership==
Changes in land use, population growth, and the impacts of climate change have led to a gradual process of [[soil degradation]].&lt;ref name=MyerTurner1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myer|first=W.B|author2=Turner, B.L |title=Human Population Growth and global Land-Use/ Cover Change.|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1992|volume=23|pages=39–61|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.23.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eswaran,lal,reich2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Eswaran|first=H|title=Land Degradation and Overview|url=http://1.usa.gov/ddEA2g|author2=Lal,R., Reich P.F |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil degradation is a gradual process involving the natural and anthropogenic processes that result in the physical loss (erosion) and reduction in soil quality.&lt;ref name=Lal,Hall,Miller1989 /&gt; The recognition of anthropogenic effects on soil degradation has influenced discourse of urban soil management, and formulation of policies by regional organizations.&lt;ref name=Urbansoil&gt;{{cite web|last=Urban Soil Management Strategy|title=Urban Soil Protection|url=http://www.urban-sms.eu/urban-soil-protection/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, soil remains as the primary medium for food production, thus global soil governance is directed towards the impacts of soil degradation on food production and conflicts that arise between the need for human settlements and space available for food production.&lt;ref name=Lal,Hall,Miller1989 /&gt; The impacts of climate change also contribute to the conflict because carbon dioxide emissions have progressively led to higher average global temperatures, which has led to an increase in soil degradation through erosion, increased salinity, and a reduction in the flora and fauna that contribute to its quality.&lt;ref name=Brownfieldbrief&gt;{{cite web|last=BrownfieldBriefing|title=Global Soil Partnership Launched, 19 September 2011|url=http://www.brownfieldbriefing.com/news/global-soil-partnership-launched}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Soil Partnership (GSP)&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; was launched in 2011. It is an initiative of the FAO and the European Commission that aims to "Support and facilitate joint efforts towards sustainable management of soil resources for food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation" and to update the 1982 World Soil Charter.&lt;ref name=FAO2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Food and Agricultural Organisation|first=FAO|title=Global Soil Partnership|url=http://www.fao.org/rio20/special-features/the-global-soil-partnership/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (Rome, 1979), and the Plan of Action of the UN Conference on Desertification (Nairobi, 1977) to combat [[land degradation]] and desertification initiated international discourse on effective soil management and governance, however the initiatives were limited to the soil and its relation to agricultural productivity.&lt;ref name=FAO1984 /&gt;

The GSP's ultimate goal is to achieve food security and restoration of ecosystem services through conserving, enhancing, and restoring soil resources through productive and sustainable use.&lt;ref name="GSP Technical Working Group"&gt;{{cite web|last=GSP Technical Working Group|title=Global Soil Partnership Background Paper|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/GSP/docs/WS_managinglivingsoils/GSP_Background_Paper.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a global partnership, the GSP aims to create Regional Soil Partnerships (RSPs) to provide guidance on goals and priorities within specific regions and develop relevant activities within each region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Soil Partnerships|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/regional-partnerships/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GSP meets in Plenary Assembly form to meet the different demands from each region. The First Plenary Assembly, held in June 2013 at the FAO's headquarters adopted the Rules of Procedure, nominated and established an Intergovernmental Technical Panel of Soils (ITPS), started thinking about the 5 pillars of action, supported the implementation of Regional Soil Partnerships and developed a GSP roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the first meeting of the plenary assembly of the Global Soil Partnership|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/GSP/docs/Plenary_Assembly/GSPPA_I_sept13.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Plenary Assembly will be held in July 2014.

=== Vision and mission ===
The vision of the GSP is to improve governance of soil resources to guarantee healthy and productive soils for a food-secure world and support other essential ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandate and Rules of Procedures|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/mandate-rules-of-procedure/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the GSP is capacity building, facilitate and contribute to soil science and technologies for sustainable management of soil resources at all levels.&lt;ref name="GSP Technical Working Group"/&gt;

=== Intergovernmental Panel of Soils (ITPS) ===
The Intergovernmental Panel of Soils represents all regions of the world and is composed of 27 soil expert representatives. The ITPS is here to advise the GSP on scientific and technical knowledge, advocate for the inclusion of sustainable soil management in different agendas, review the GSP's Plan of Action, follow up on the Plan of Action and request the formation of committees  for exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS)|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/intergovernmental-technical-panel-on-soils/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of action===

To achieve its vision and mandate, the GSP operates under five pillars of action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 5 pillars of action|url=http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/the-5-pillars-of-action/en/|publisher=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By region ==

=== In the European Union ===
The United Nations [[Earth Summit]] Conference on Environment and Development catalysed the formation of EU environmental policy into a policy that was centred on the environmental consequences of integration.&lt;ref name=Heyeu&gt;{{cite web|last=Hey|first=C|title=EU Environmental Policies: A short history of the policy strategies|url=http://www.eeb.org/publication/chapter-3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference organized by the United Nations saw the acceptance of various documents and charters governing the natural environment and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=UN1997&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=United Nations (1997) UN Conference on Environment and Development (1992)|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its inception phase, EU environmental policy was a reaction to normalise competition with the markets. Having a common policy would ensure that member states were bound to directives that would regulate their production methods thus affect production output and competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=Knilll,lieff&gt;{{cite book|last=Knill|first=C|title=Environmental Politics in the European Union: policy-making, implementation and patterns of multi-level governance|year=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|author2=Liefferink, D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus was directed on [[air pollution]] from industries, and other forms of tangible, measurable, and traceable pollution that could be isolated to an event or a process, such as acidification Swedish lakes in the 1970s and 1980s caused by high [[sulphur dioxide]] emissions from power plants. Such forms of pollution were often governed with bans, quotas and economic instruments such as taxes and fines.&lt;ref name=Knilll,lieff /&gt;  With improvements in technology, access and delivery of information and changes in global conceptualisation of the environment, EU environmental policy has evolved to become more responsive and bespoke, and has also increased its scope to various sources and sinks of pollution.&lt;ref name=Goulb1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Goulb|first=J|title=New instruments for environmental policy in the EU|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the European Commission tabled a proposal to the European Parliament to establish a framework for soil protection within the union. Soil is recognised as a non-renewable resource because of its slow formation process. However—unlike other non-renewable resources, such as coal, that have explicit policies governing extraction methods, trading, and consumption in the EU—soil governance is contained within the contexts of environmental policies and regulation on various entities of the [[biosphere]]. The draft policy recognised that soil governance had been "scattered" in EU legislation, and lacked a cohesive isolated framework, therefore governance and management of the same resource was open to interpretation depending on the main resource and industry policy in question.&lt;ref name=comiss2006b&gt;{{cite web|last=Commission of the European Communities|title=Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the council establishing a framework for the protection of soil and amending Directive|url=http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ESDB_Archive/Policies/Directive/com_2006_0232_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy sought to unify the "scattered" regulations because they lacked the mandate to "identify and cover all soil threats". This view was supported by extensive consultation between stakeholders and the European commission that started in February 2003, and saw member states convey their support for a framework based on regional action in 2004.&lt;ref name=Commission2006a /&gt; The framework was developed as a directive to member states; this form of legislation allows interpretation by stakeholders at national and local levels, and between networks thus complying with the [[subsidiarity]] principle. The principle provides that EU political decisions must be implemented at "the lowest possible administrative and political level, and as close to the citizens as possible", unless in areas where action by individual countries is insufficient.&lt;ref name=europa&gt;{{cite web|last=Europa|title=Summaries of EU legislation|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/index_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is under this principle that member states rejected the proposal to establish a framework for soil protection as the proposal argued that member states are unable to effectively monitor and manage their soils. Inconsistencies in national soil governance strategies and, classification and treatment of contaminants would disable the objectives of the proposal because of the complexities of trans-border soil pollution and management. Furthermore, soil degradation and mismanagement affects other environmental areas, and industries governed through EU legislation such as water, biodiversity, and food production, thus it was deemed appropriate to have uniform legislation across all entities.&lt;ref name=Commission2006a /&gt; Member states argued that soil management should not be negotiated at the European Regional level as they already had strong domestic policies regulating soil usage and management, therefore focus should be directed at strengthening local policies and regulatory institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Department for Environment and Rural Affairs|title=Proposed EU Soil framework Directive|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/land-manage/soil/soil-framework-directive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the EU does not have a cohesive soil governance policy and relies on environmental policies, and non-renewable resource policies and legislations of member states to guide utilisation, management and regulate pollutants of the soil.

=== In India ===
In terms of employment, the agricultural sector is one of the main sectors in the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]]. In 2010, the sector employed 58.2% of the nations workforce, and contributed 15.7% to the nations GDP. Cognisant of agriculture's role in the economy, the 11th five-year economic plan that runs from 2007-2012 recognises the importance of proper soil management in agriculture. Soil degradation through excessive and miscalculated fertiliser use because of emphasis on increased output has led to nearly two-thirds of India's farmlands to be classified as either degraded or sick.&lt;ref name=Planningcom2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Planning Commission|first=Government of India|title=Eleventh Five Year Plan Volume III Agriculture, Rural development, Industry, Services, and Physical infrastructure|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempts to increase knowledge on soils and soil management, the government of Gujarat initiated the Soil Health Cards Programme in 2006 that was "expected to bridge the gap between Scientists, agricultural extension workers, farmers and input-output dealers".&lt;ref name=presstrustindia&gt;{{cite web|last=Press Trust of India|title=Gujarat Farmers to get Soil Health Cards|url=http://indiagovernance.gov.in/news.php?id=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme relies on technology to disseminate accountable and uncomplicated scientific information that is based on the farmers needs. Farmers take samples of their soil for analysis in a state run laboratory. Based on the sample, farmers get information on the soil mineral and water content, fertiliser application methods, and advice on what crops to grow.

In the pilot scheme, collected data was inputted into a web-based information system that included the Internet, intranet and GSWAN (Gujarat State Wide Area Network) to build up the state, and national database on soil health.&lt;ref name=gujaratgov&gt;{{cite web|last=Government of Gujarat|title=Soil Health Card Programme|url=http://www.shc.gujarat.gov.in/images/HorBarLinks/Acknowledgement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing knowledge on soil management, increased output, and reduced costs for farmers and contributed to Gujarat's agriculture growth rate that was three times the national growth rate in 2009.&lt;ref name=yojanagujarat&gt;{{cite web|last=Yojana|first=S|title=Soil Health Card Scheme aiming and praiseworthy increase in income of farmers|url=http://agri.gujarat.gov.in/krushi_mahotsav_2006/soil_health_card.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the scheme has facilitated its implementation at a national level under the Ministry of Agriculture. Each state and union territory is responsible for the set-up and management of the soil testing facilities and maintaining the state soil database so that it is uniform and standardised. The testing, advisory and issuance processes involved are at multi-governance levels involving stakeholders from the private and public sectors. Government approved NGOs, community associations' farmers, the state administration and national administration are all involved in the scheme at different levels. The process begins with the farmers assisted by various NGOs and community groups and involves interactions with more NGOs and state officers at higher levels, as they are responsible for soil sample testing.&lt;ref name=Planningcom2008 /&gt; 
The impacts of increased global temperatures have had negative effects towards effective soil management techniques in the developing world. Changes in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme events such as floods and drought have exacerbated issues such as desertification and [[soil erosion]]. The effects of such events are further aggravated by resource-deficient farmers and government officials who lack skills to prepare and manage their soils for disasters, and end up relying on relief aid for sustenance.&lt;ref name=chaterjee,das2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaterjee|first=K |author2=Chaterjee, A. |author3=Das, S. |title=India Community Adaptation to Drought in Rajasthan|journal=IDS Bulletin|year=2009|volume=36|issue=4|pages=33–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huq et al,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huq|first=S |author2=Yamin, F. |author3=Rahman, A. |author4=Chatterjee, A. |author5=Yang, X. |author6=Wade, S. |author7=Orindi, V. |author8=Chigwada, J. |title=Linking Climate Adaptation and Development: A Synthesis of Six Case Studies from Asia and Africa|journal=IDS Bulletin|year=2009|volume=36|issue=4|pages=117–122|doi=10.1111/j.1759-5436.2005.tb00238.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the Impacts of desertification is a complex multi-level process because of the social, environmental and economic factors.&lt;ref name=chaterjee,das2009 /&gt;

The Republic of India ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1984, and has since instituted the National Programme to Combat Desertification that utilises an integrated and holistic approach at governing the soil. Through various ministries the national programme aspires to implement the UNCCD by increasing capacity in soil and soil water management, improving access to micro-credit with a focus on women and marginalised groups, promoting alternative energy supplies to reduce reliance on wood increasing soil monitoring and strengthening legislation regarding land management in industrial and mining activities.&lt;ref name=moef2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Environment and Forests|title=Nation action Programme to Combat Desertification- Status of Desertification|url=http://www.unccd.int/actionprogrammes/asia/national/2001/india-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moef2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of Environment and Forests|title=Third National Report on Implementation of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|url=http://www.unccd.int/cop/reports/asia/national/2006/india-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts of industrialization and urbanization==
In the developing world, [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] are emerging as significant contributors to land and soil degradation. Lack of sufficient knowledge in soil management and disregard for the environment has been identified as key reasons affecting urban soil degradation.&lt;ref name=moef2001 /&gt; Industrialization alters the chemical aspects of the soil through pollution of heavy metals and effluents. Construction and landfills in urban areas affect soil through compaction and excavation, which affect natural processes such as water purification and storage. In the developing and developing world governance of soils in urban areas requires bespoke policies because of the nature of urban and industrial developments in the cities.&lt;ref name=pavao2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavao-Zuckerman|first=D|title=The Nature of Urban Soils and Their Role in Ecological Restoration in Cities|journal=Restoration Ecology|year=2008|volume=16|issue=4|pages=642–649|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00486.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Central Europe, governance of urban soils is facilitated by the urban soil management strategy that aims to design applicable soil management strategies in select European cities. Through networks created with universities and municipal authorities the project aims to research into and develop an interdisciplinary approach to manage urban soils,.&lt;ref name=Urbansoil /&gt;&lt;ref name=dekimp2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=De-Kimp|first=C|author2=Jean-Louis, M |title=Urban Soil Management: A growing concern|journal=Soil Science|year=2000|volume=165|issue=1|pages=31–40|doi=10.1097/00010694-200001000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the developing world, urban and industrial soil governance is linked to sustainable development of cities to address urban poverty and responsible land use through effective waste management. Often, developing countries lack resources to implement policies governing settlements and industries, thus the soil and water are often heavily polluted.&lt;ref name=MyerTurner1992 /&gt;
Urban soil management uses an interdisciplinary approach to protect biodiversity reliant upon the soil and land, reduce pollution from industrial effluents, and increase resilience of the soil to stresses such as compaction from construction.&lt;ref name=pavao2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dekimp2000 /&gt;

==Role of science and technology==
The global soil map is a global consortium between academic, regional and national scientific institutions coordinated by stakeholders according to the respective regions. Using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), [[Remote sensing]] and emerging technologies a global soil map will be created to represent different soil types.&lt;ref name=GSM2011 /&gt; The consortium is led by the ISRIC-World Soil Information, whose mandate to increase knowledge on soils through data collection and dissemination and development of technologies and methodologies for digital soil mapping. GIS is used to display, analyse and collate soil data and processes, and also identify different types of soils through mapping and web-based software.&lt;ref name=hossack&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hossack|first=I|author2=Robertson, D. |author3=Tucker, P. |author4=Fyfe, C |title=A GIS and web based decision support tool for the management of urban soils|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|year=2004|volume=35|pages=499–509|doi=10.1080/01969720490451878}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Soil science|Soil Science]] is used in tandem with GIS to identify individual soil properties applicable to agricultural and urban soil management. The Soil Health Card Programme in India utilises soil science to advise farmers on fertiliser usage and crop rotations and records the data on a national network which can be used to map different soil types across the country.

== Criticisms ==
{{criticism section|date=November 2014}}
Exponential population growth has led to discourses on maintaining food security through increased agricultural output.&lt;ref name=MyerTurner1992 /&gt; Often emphasis is limited to increasing intensity of output through more intensive use of fertilisers, machinery, pesticides and other inputs. Because soil is the main medium in agriculture, soil governance has maintained a strong agricultural perspective. Urban soil governance is crucial in developing countries because of rapid urbanization and changing land use in rural areas.&lt;ref name=lal2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=R|title=Soil Management in Developing Countries|journal=Soil Science|year=2000|volume=165|issue=1|pages=57–72|doi=10.1097/00010694-200001000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial activities such as mining dramatically alter the landscape and soil through generation of overburden and excavation; however governance remains biased towards agriculture and food production. 
The effects of climate change vis-à-vis desertification and increased [[soil erosion]] are not yet addressed in cohesive global policies, yet the scope and nature of the problem is global. 
The establishment of the GSP in 2011 has recognized the need for an interdisciplinary approach to soil governance underpinning the diverse ecosystem services and functions including the production of healthy food.

[[Image:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|Air-sea exchange of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''solubility pump''' is a physico-chemical process that transports [[carbon]] (as dissolved inorganic carbon) from the ocean's surface to its interior.

==Overview==
The solubility pump is driven by the coincidence of two processes in the ocean :

* The [[solubility]] of [[carbon dioxide]] is a strong inverse function of [[sea surface temperature|seawater temperature]] (i.e. solubility is greater in cooler water)
* The [[thermohaline circulation]] is driven by the formation of deep water at high latitudes where seawater is usually cooler and denser

Since deep water (that is, seawater in the ocean's interior) is formed under the same surface conditions that promote carbon dioxide solubility, it contains a higher concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon than might be expected from average surface concentrations.  Consequently, these two processes act together to pump carbon from the atmosphere into the ocean's interior.

One consequence of this is that when deep water upwells in warmer, equatorial latitudes, it strongly outgasses carbon dioxide to the atmosphere because of the reduced solubility of the gas.

The solubility pump has a biological counterpart known as the [[biological pump]].  For an overview of both pumps, see Raven &amp; Falkowski (1999).&lt;ref name=raven99&gt;Raven, J. A. and P. G. Falkowski (1999).  [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x Oceanic sinks for atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]  ''Plant Cell Environ.'' '''22''', 741-755.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon dioxide solubility==
[[File:Solubility-co2-water.png|thumb|CO2 solubility in water, temperature dependency]]
[[Carbon dioxide]], like other gases, is soluble in water.  However, unlike many other gases ([[oxygen]] for instance), it reacts with water and forms a balance of several ionic and non-ionic species (collectively known as [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]], or DIC).  These are dissolved free carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), and they interact with water as follows :

&lt;center&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

The balance of these carbonate species (which ultimately affects the solubility of carbon dioxide), is dependent on factors such as [[pH]], as shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]].  In [[seawater]] this is regulated by the charge balance of a number of positive (e.g. [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]) and negative (e.g. CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; itself, [[chlorine|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[bromine|Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]) ions.  Normally, the balance of these species leaves a net positive charge. With respect to the carbonate system, this excess positive charge shifts the balance of carbonate species towards negative ions to compensate.  The result of which is a reduced concentration of the free carbon dioxide and carbonic acid species, which in turn leads to an oceanic uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to restore balance.  Thus, the greater the positive charge imbalance, the greater the solubility of carbon dioxide.  In carbonate chemistry terms, this imbalance is referred to as [[alkalinity]].

In terms of measurement, four basic parameters are of key importance: '''[[Total inorganic carbon]]''' (TIC, T&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), '''Total [[alkalinity]]''' (T&lt;sub&gt;ALK&lt;/sub&gt; or A&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), '''pH''', and '''[[partial pressure|pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]'''.  Measuring any two of these parameters allows for the determination of a wide range of pH-dependent species (including the above-mentioned species).  This balance can be changed by a number of processes.  For example, the [[flux|air-sea flux]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[solvation|dissolution]]/[[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of [[Calcium Carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], or biological activity such as [[photosynthesis]]/[[cellular respiration|respiration]].  Each of these has different effects on each of the four basic parameters, and together they exert strong influences on global cycles.  The net and local charge of the oceans remains neutral during any chemical process.

==Anthropogenic changes==

The [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s, land-use changes, and the production of [[cement]] have led to a flux of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere.

The solubility pump is the primary mechanism driving this flux, with the consequence that anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reaching the ocean interior via high latitude sites of deep water formation (particularly the North Atlantic).  Ultimately, most of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean,&lt;ref name=arch05&gt;Archer, D. (2005).

Res.'', '''110''', {{doi|10.1029/2004JC002625}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain.

In a study of carbon cycle up to the end of the 21st century, Cox ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;ref name=cox00&gt;Cox, P. M., Betts, R. A., Jones, C. D., Spall, S. A. and Totterdell, I. J. (2000).

This was partially due to [[nonlinearity|non-linearities]] in the seawater carbonate system, but also due to [[climate change]].  Ocean warming decreases the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in seawater, slowing the ocean's response to emissions.  Warming also acts to increase ocean stratification, isolating the surface ocean from deeper waters.

However, the magnitude of these processes is still uncertain, preventing good long-term estimates of the fate of the solubility pump.

While ocean absorption of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere acts to decrease climate change, it causes [[ocean acidification]] which is believed will have negative consequences for marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=orr05&gt;Orr, J.

The '''subcontinental lithospheric mantle''' ('''SCLM''') is the uppermost  solid part of Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] associated with the  [[continental lithosphere]].

The modern understanding of the Earth's upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is that there are two distinct components - the [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] part and the [[asthenosphere]]. The lithosphere, which includes the [[continental plate]]s, acts as a brittle solid whereas the asthenosphere is hotter and weaker due to mantle convection. The boundary between these two layers is [[Rheology|rheologically]] based and is not necessarily a strict function of depth. Specifically, [[Lithosphere#Oceanic lithosphere|oceanic lithosphere]] (lithosphere underneath the oceanic plates) and subcontinental lithosphere, is defined as a mechanical boundary layer that heats via conduction and the asthenosphere is a convecting [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] layer. In contrast to oceanic lithosphere, which experiences quicker rates of recycling, subcontinental lithosphere is chemically distinct, cold, and older. This translated into the differences between the SCLM and the [[oceanic lithospheric mantle]].

There are two different types of subcontinental lithosphere that formed at different times in Earth's history: [[Archean]] and [[Phanerozoic]] subcontinental mantle.

== Archean subcontinental mantle ==
Archean lithosphere is strongly depleted in fertile melt indicators such as CaO and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This depletion in major-elements should then be consequence of the Archean lithosphere's formation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3558903|title=The Continental Lithospheric Mantle: Characteristics and Significance as a mantle Reservoir|journal=Chemical reservoirs and convection in the Earth's mantle.

M.|year=2002|doi=10.1098/rsta.2002.1074}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Trace element|Trace-elements]] are abundant in Archean lithosphere relative to [[Mid-ocean ridge|MORB]] (which samples modern upper mantle) and have been sampled by Re-Os isotope dating of [[Peridotite|peridotites]] and [[Ophiolite|ophiolites]]. The trace element composition of these xenoliths suggest mixing between the two different layers of subcontinental mantle. Particularly, the theory for the removal of Archean subcontinental lithosphere below Archean continental crust via [[Delamination (geology)|delamination]] helps to explain mantle-peridotite [[xenolith]]s found in the extinct [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] arc&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3077682|title=Osmium isotopic evidence for Mesozoic removal of lithopsheric mantle beneath the Sierra Nevada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Though there is evidence for the preservation of the Archean lithosphere, there is controversy over the preservation of the Archean mantle, for which the Archean lithosphere would have been derived.

The formation of the Archean SCLM is enigmatic. One early theory that [[komatiite]] melts formed the Archean SCLM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.208.4938&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=A subduction origin for komatiites and cratonic lithospheric mantle|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not explain how komatiites, which form in hot and deep environments, creates a reservoir that is shallow and cool. Another model of Archean SCLM formation suggests that the SCLM formed in a subduction environment in which new Archean crust was created through slab melting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/38/12/1083|title=Coupled evolution of Archean continental crust and subcontinental lithospheric mantle|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If the primitive mantle is the starting composition for this SCLM formation event, subducting slab would be composed of [[Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite|TTG]] crust, then the removal of basaltic melt and the enrichment of the mantle wedge with felsic melts could explain the formation of the depleted Archean subcontinental lithosphere. For more information, see [[Archean subduction]].

== Phanerozoic subcontinental mantle ==
The mechanism of arc [[subduction]] is well understood to be the location where new continental crust is formed and is presumably also the site of subcontinental mantle genesis. Firstly, hydrated oceanic crust slabs begin subducting which releases fluids ([[subduction zone metamorphism]]) to the mantle wedge above. Continued subduction of the slab leads to further hydration of the mantle which causes partial melting in the mantle wedge. It is expected then that the modern subcontinental mantle is a former, melt-depleted mantle wedge. If the connection between continental crust and the subcontinental lithospheric mantle does not exist, and rather a different Earth process formed both reservoirs, then it further complicates the mechanisms for how the Archean subcontinental mantle formed.

The '''Valdivian temperate forests''' (NT0404) is an [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] on the west coast of southern [[South America]], in [[Chile]] and extending into [[Argentina]]. It is part of the [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]] [[biogeographic realm|ecozone]]. The forests are named after the city of [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]]. The Valdivian temperate rainforests are characterized by their dense [[understory|understories]] of [[chusquea|bamboos]], [[fern]]s, and for being mostly dominated by [[evergreen]] [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] trees with some deciduous specimens, though [[conifer]] trees are also common.

==Setting==
Temperate rain forests comprise a relatively narrow coastal strip between the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, and the southern [[Andes Mountains]] to the east, from roughly 37° to 48° south latitude. North of 42°, the [[Chilean Coast Range|Chilean coastal range]] runs along the coast, and the north-south running [[Chilean Central Valley]] lies between the coastal range and the Andes. South of 42°, the coast range continues as a chain of offshore islands, including [[Chiloé Island]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago]], while the "Central Valley" is submerged and continues as the [[Gulf of Corcovado]]. Much of the ecoregion was covered by the [[Patagonian Ice Sheet]] and other [[glacier]]s at the peak of the last [[ice age]], which descended from the Andes mountains, and the numerous lakes of the Chilean lakes district in the central part of the ecoregion were originally glacial valleys, while the southern part of the region has many glacier-carved [[fjord]]s.

[[Image:Bosque de olivillo en Punta Curinanco.jpg|thumbnail|An old-grown pure stand of [[Aextoxicon]] in [[Punta Curiñanco]] at the Pacific coast.]]
To the north the Valdivian forests give way to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] of the [[Chilean Matorral]] ecoregion. Some few Valdivian forests grows in northern Chile such as that one in [[Bosque de Fray Jorge National Park]] as remains of the [[last glacial maximum]]. To the south lies the [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregion. The temperate Valdivian, Matorral, and Magellanic ecoregions are isolated from the subtropical and tropical forests of northern South America by the [[Atacama]] desert north of the Matorral, the Andes mountains, and dry rain-shadow Argentine grasslands east of the Andes. As a result, the temperate forest regions have evolved in relative isolation, with a high degree of [[endemism|endemic]] species.

The forest of northwestern North America exist in similar settings but differ in not being connected to large inland forest like the [[Taiga|boreal forest]] or the forest of the [[Rocky Mountains]].&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt; Compared to the similar North American forest, the Valdivian temperate rain forest is considerably richer in species, a characteristic that is also found when comparing with similar forest in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt;

===Climate===
Since the forest is located at around 40 degrees south, it is strongly influenced by the [[westerlies]]. The water vapour held by the westerlies condenses as they arrive at the higher part of the [[Windward and leeward|windward slope]] of the [[Andes]], thus creating [[Orographic rainfall|rainfalls]]. At the same time, the northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400 m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35° S), and descends to 1,000 m in the south of the Valdivian region. In the summer the temperature can climb to 16.5 °C (62 °F), while during winter the temperature can drop below 7 °C (45 °F).&lt;ref&gt;Di Castri F di &amp; E. Hajek 1976.
[http://svsch.ceachile.cl/biblioteca_archivos/Bioclimatologia%20de%20Chile.pdf "Bioclimatología de Chile" 163 pages with english summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411125445/http://svsch.ceachile.cl/biblioteca_archivos/Bioclimatologia%20de%20Chile.pdf |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average annual temperatures are fairly uniform within the area, specially at coastal locations where annual temperature differences between localities never exceed 7 °C.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt;

==Flora==

The Valdivian temperate rain forests are [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. The Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only [[temperate rain forest]]s in [[South America]] and one of a small number of temperate rain forests in the world. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]] (which stretches from Alaska to northern California). The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant families with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.

''[[Chusquea quila]]'' is a [[bamboo]] that grows in humid areas below 500 m, where ''[[Chusquea coleou]]'' becomes more dominant above. ''Chusquea quila'' can form pure stands called ''quilantales''. Very few plants can grow under this species. Other notable species are the ''[[nalca]]'' or Chilean rhubarb (''Gunnera tinctoria'') and the ferns ''[[Lophosoria quadripinnata]]'' and ''[[Blechnum chilense]]''. Chile's national flower, the ''[[copihue]]'' (''Lapageria rosea'') is a [[pioneer species]] that grows in disturbed areas of the Valdivian rain forest.

The maximum plant species richness is found at latitudes 40 to 43° S.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt;

===Forests ecosystems===
[[File:Alerce chileno.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Fitzroya cupressoides|Alerce]]'']]
There are four main types of forest ecosystems in the Valdivian ecoregion. At the northern end of the ecoregion are deciduous forests, dominated by two deciduous species of [[southern beech]]: ''rauli'' (''[[Nothofagus alpina]]'') and ''roble'' (''[[Nothofagus obliqua|N. obliqua]]''); this is a transitional zone to the Mediterranean-climate forests to the north.

The second type are the Valdivian [[laurel forest|laurel-leaved forests]], characterized by a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, including ''[[Laureliopsis|Laureliopsis philippiana]]'', ''[[Aextoxicon|Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', ''[[Caldcluvia paniculata]]'', and ''[[Weinmannia trichosperma]]'', with an understory of ''[[Myrceugenia planipes]]'', the ''[[Luma apiculata|arrayán]]'' (''Luma apiculata'') and other plants.

The third forest type is the [[Patagonian Andean forest]]s, which are distributed at higher elevations along the Andes mountain front, and are dominated by evergreen [[conifer]]s, including the ''[[Araucaria araucana|pehuén]]'' or monkey-puzzle (''[[Araucaria araucana]]'') and the ''[[Fitzroya|alerce]]'' (''Fitzroya cupressoides''). The ''alerce'' looks like a [[giant sequoia]], and is a rival in longevity to the [[bristlecone pine]], some with growth rings recording 3,625 years of local weather cycles. Closer to the treeline, the conifers give way to Andean scrublands of deciduous ''[[Nothofagus]]''.

The fourth and last type is the Northern Patagonian forests, which dominate the southern half of the ecoregion, with evergreen species such as the broadleaf ''[[Nothofagus dombeyi]]'' and ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' and the coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]], including ''[[Podocarpus nubigenus]]''.

Distribution of plants follow [[Rapoport's rule]] with plants of higher latitudes spanning having larger distribution acros latitudes than plants of lower distribution.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt;

Lowland [[soil]]s near the coast contain more available nutrients than more inland soils.&lt;ref name=perez95&gt;{{cite book |last=Pérez|first=Cecilia|date=1995|editor-last=Armesto|editor-first=Juan J. |editor-last2=Villagrán|editor-first2=Carolina|editor-last3=Arroyo|editor-first3=Mary Kalin|editor-link2=Carolina Villagrán |chapter=Los procesos de descomposición de la materia orgánica de bosques templados costeros: Interacción entre suelo, clima y vegetación|title=Ecología de los bosques nativos de Chile|url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |pages=301–315 |isbn=9561112841 |language=Spanish|trans-chapter=Litter decomposition processes in coastal temperate forest: Interactions between plants, soils and vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and evolution===
The flora of the forest has inherited and developed its characteristics due to a variety of causes. Its Neotropical affinities reflect its current geographic connection to the remaining South America.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt; Its "Gondwanan" species are a legacy of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], a landmass that once grouped South America, Africa, India, Antarctica and Australia. The high degree of [[endemic]] species and [[monospecific]] genera is thought to be linked to the geographic isolation came into being as result of the [[Andean orogeny|uplift of the Andes]].&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95&gt;{{cite book |last=Arroyo|first=Mary Kalin|author-link=Mary Kalin Arroyo |last2=Cavieres |first2=Lohengrin |last3=Peñaloza|first3=Alejandro|last4=Riveros |first4=Magal |last5=Faggi|first5=Ana María|date=1995|editor-last=Armesto|editor-first=Juan J. |editor-last2=Villagrán|editor-first2=Carolina|editor-last3=Arroyo|editor-first3=Mary Kalin|editor-link2=Carolina Villagrán |title=Ecología de los bosques nativos de Chile|chapter=Relaciones fitogeográficas y patrones regionales de riqueza de especies en la flora del bosque lluvioso templado de Sudamérica|url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |pages=71–99 |isbn=9561112841 |language=Spanish|trans-chapter=Floristic structure and human impact on the Maulino forest of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few "[[Biantitropical distribution|boreal]]" components in the Valdivian temperate rain forest which arrived by long-distance transport.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt; Yet another component are the species from nearby South American ecosystems that adapted to the temperate rainforest.&lt;ref name=arroyoetal95/&gt; 

During the [[Llanquihue glaciation]] much of the area west of [[Llanquihue Lake]] remained ice-free during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by ''[[Nothofagus]]'' species. Valdivian temperate rain forest proper was reduced to scattered remnants in to the west of the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Adams |author-first=Jonathan |title=South America during the last 150,000 years |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercSOUTHAMERICA.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130085619/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercSOUTHAMERICA.html |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically the [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugia]] of the Valdivian temperate rain forest between latitudes 41 and 37° S were; the coastal region, the lower slopes of the Chilean Coast Range and the westernmost [[Chilean Central Valley]] all of which remained free of disturbance by the glacial, [[glacifluvial]] and [[periglacial]] disturbance through the glaciation.&lt;ref name=VillagranHinojosa2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Villagrán |first=Carolina|last2=Hinojosa |first2=Luis Felipe|author-link1=Carolina Villagrán |date=2005|language=Spanish |title=Regionalización Biogeográfica en Iberoámeríca y tópicos afines |chapter=Esquema biogeográfico de Chile |editor-last=Llorente Bousquests|editor-first=Jorge|editor-last2=Morrone |editor-first2=Juan J. |url= |location=Mexico |publisher=Ediciones de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Jiménez Editores |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VeitGarleff1995&gt;{{cite book |last=Veit |first=Heinz |last2=Garleff |first2=Karsten |date=1995|editor-last=Armesto|editor-first=Juan J. |editor-last2=Villagrán|editor-first2=Carolina|editor-last3=Arroyo|editor-first3=Mary Kalin|editor-link2=Carolina Villagrán|editor-link3=Mary Kalin Arroyo |title=Ecología de los bosques nativos de Chile|chapter=Evolución del paisaje cuaternario y los suelos de Chile Central-Sur |url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |pages=29–49 |isbn=9561112841 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
[[File:Poudou IMG 4342.JPG|thumb|[[Pudú]]]]
Some of the threatened mammals of the Valdivian forests include the ''[[monito del monte]]'' ''(Dromiciops gliroides)'', an arboreal [[marsupial]], the [[Pudú|southern ''pudú'']] ''(Pudu pudu)'' the world's smallest [[deer]], and the [[kodkod]] ''(Leopardus guigna)'', South America's smallest [[cat]]. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have also been nonnative [[wild boar]]s living in the Valdivian forests.{{fact|date=October 2017}} Hummingbirds are common on Valdivian forests because of the presence of plants like the ''[[Aristotelia chilensis|maqui]]'' (''Aristotelia chilensis'') and the ''[[copihue]]''.

Most mammal genera in Valdivian temperate rain forest are also found in [[Patagonian Desert|semi-arid parts of Patagonia]].&lt;ref name=murua95/&gt; Relative to similar forest in North America there is a low diversity of mammals in Chilean temperate forests.&lt;ref name=murua95&gt;{{cite book |last=Murúa|first=Roberto|date=1995|editor-last=Armesto|editor-first=Juan J. |editor-last2=Villagrán|editor-first2=Carolina|editor-last3=Arroyo|editor-first3=Mary Kalin|editor-link2=Carolina Villagrán |title=Ecología de los bosques nativos de Chile|chapter=Comunidades de mamíferos del bosque templado de Chile|url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |pages=113–134 |isbn=9561112841 |language=Spanish|trans-chapter=Mammalian communities of Chilean temperate forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

{{see also|Native Forest Law|Ecotourism in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest}}
The Valdivian forests include stands of huge trees, especially ''Nothofagus'' and ''Fitzroya'', which can live to a great age. These magnificent rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing [[pine]]s and [[eucalyptus]], which are more sought-after by the pulp and paper industry. The native trees that are cleared to make way for these monocultures are often exported as [[woodchips]] to Japan.  A start at conservation was made in November 2003 when a consortium of conservation groups, both local and international, bought at auction of a bankrupt logging firm 147,500 acres (600&amp;nbsp;km²) of biologically rich rainforest in the Valdivian Coastal Range. Gianni Lopez, Executive Director of [[CONAMA]], Chile’s national environmental agency remarked, "Ten years ago the existence of protected areas not owned by the government was unthinkable." Among the efforts supporting conservation, has been a growing [[Ecotourism in the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest|ecotourism industry]].
