      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">'''Abraham Baer ben Joseph Ezra Dobsewitch''' (or ''Dobsevage'') (born [[Pinsk]], Oct. 17, 1843; died [[New York City]], Jan. 14, 1900) was a Russian [[Hebraist]] and exegete.

== Life ==
At the age of thirteen Dobsewitch had written a commentary to the [[Canticles]]. In 1861 he went to [[Yekaterinoslav]], where he settled as teacher of Hebrew and contributed to various Hebrew periodicals. In 1874 he removed to [[Kiev]], where he became private tutor to the sons of Brodski and of other wealthy families. He went to the United States in 1891, and lived in [[New York City]], leaving it only for a short time in 1895.

Dobsewitch's chief published work is ''Ha-Meẓaref'' (''The Refiner''), a collection of rationalistic interpretations of various passages of the [[Aggadah]] (Odessa, 1870). Dobsewitch's two later works, ''Be-Ḥada Maḥeta'' (''With One Sweep''), a collection of articles (Cracow, 1888), and ''Lo Dubbim we-lo Ya'ar'' (''Neither Bears nor Forest'') (Berdyehev, 1890), as well as numerous articles in Hebrew periodicals, are devoted to criticisms directed against [[Moses Aaron Shatzkes|Shatzkes]], [[Isaac Jacob Weissberg|Weissberg]], and others. He continued his literary activity in the United States, and contributed to ''Ha-'Ibri'', ''Ner ha-Ma'arabi'', and various Yiddish publications. Some of his correspondence was published in ''Ha-Modi'a le-Ḥadashim'', i., New York, 1900.

Dobsewitch left several works in manuscript, including one on the [[Masoretic Text|Masorah]], one on the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan text of the Pentateuch]], and one on the wit and humor of ancient Jewish literature. Short extracts from the last-named work were published in the United States.

'''Arbëresh''' (also known as '''Arbërisht''', '''Arbërishtja''' or '''T'arbrisht''') is the language spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] people in [[Italy]]. It is a dialect of the [[Albanian language]].

==Classification==
Arbëresh derives from a medieval variety of [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], which was spoken in southern [[Albania]] and from which the modern Tosk is also derived. It follows a similar evolutionary pattern to [[Arvanitika]], a similar language spoken in Greece. Arbëresh is spoken in Southern Italy in the regions of [[Abruzzi]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], [[Campania]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]] and [[Sicily]]. All the varieties of Arberesh are closely related to each other but are not always entirely mutually intelligible.

Arbëresh retains many features of medieval Albanian from the time before the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of Albania in the 15th century. It also retains some [[Greek language|Greek]] elements, including vocabulary and pronunciation, most of which it shares with its relative [[Arvanitika]]. Many of the conservative features of Arberesh were lost in mainstream Albanian Tosk. For example, it has preserved certain syllable-initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in Standard Albanian (cf. Arbëresh ''gluhë'' {{IPA|/ˈɡluxə/}} ('language/tongue'), vs. Standard Albanian {{wikt-lang|sq|gjuhë}} {{IPA|/ˈɟuhə/}}). Arbëresh most resembles the dialect of Albanian spoken in the south-central region of Albania, particularly that of [[Çam]] Albanians.

Arbëresh was commonly called 'Albanese' ("Albanian" in the Italian language) in Italy until the 1990s. Arbëresh speakers used to have only very vague notions about how related or unrelated their language was to Albanian. Until the 1980s Arbëresh was exclusively a spoken language, except for its written form used in the [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church|Italo-Albanian Byzantine Church]], and Arbëreshë people had no practical connection with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they did not use this form in writing or in media. When a large number of immigrants from Albania began to enter Italy in the 1990s and came into contact with local Arbëreshë communities, the differences and similarities were for the first time made apparent. 

Since the 1980s, some efforts have been organized to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of the language.

Arbëresh has been replaced by local [[Romance languages]] and by Italian in several villages, and in others is experiencing contact induced [[language shift]]. Many scholars have produced language learning materials for communities, including those by [[Zef Skirò Di Maxho]] who has written two books 'Udha e Mbarë' and 'Udhëtimi', both used in schools in the village of [[Piana degli Albanesi]], [[Sicily]], Gaetano Gerbino wrote Fjalori Arbëresh (Arberesh dictionary), others include Giuseppe Schirò Di Modica, Matteo Mandalà, Zef Chiaramonte, and the only book written in English for the U.S. and U.K. Arberesh diaspora is ‘Everyday Arberesh’ by Martin H. Di Maggio (2013).

== False friends ==
While the relation between Arbëresh and standard [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is close, the two are not 100% mutually intelligible and there are many [[false friends]], for example:

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Arbëresh!!Meaning!!Albanian!!Meaning
|-
|''shërbenj''|| to work ||''shërbej''||to serve
|-
|''pënonj''|| to work in the fields|| ''punoj''|| to work
|-
|''shesh''|| plateau|| ''shesh''||square
|-

|-
|''brekë''|| trousers || ''brekë'' ||underpants
|-
|''brumë''|| pasta || ''brumë''|| dough
|-

|}

== Varieties ==

The varieties of Arberisht largely correspond with the regions where they are spoken, while some settlements have distinctive features that result in greater or lesser degrees of mutual intelligibility.

The [[Siculo]]-Arbëresh variety is spoken exclusively in the [[Province of Palermo]] and in three villages; [[Piana degli Albanesi]], [[Santa Cristina Gela]] and [[Contessa Entellina]], while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely inteliglble. Therefore a further dialect within Siculo-Arberesh known as the [[Palermo|Palermitan]]-Arberisht variety can be identified,&lt;ref&gt;Mandala', M., &amp; Mandala' M (2005). Siculo-arbëresh e siciliano a contatto: alcune verifiche. In Der Einfluss des Italienischen auf die Grammatik der Minderheitensprachen. Morphologische und syntaktische Probleme (pagg. 13-21)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Cosenza]] variety, a [[Basilicata]] variety, a [[Campania]] variety represented by the speech of one single settlement of [[Greci, Campania|Greci]]. There is also a [[Molise|Molisan]]-Arbëresh and an [[Apulian|Apulio]]-Arbëresh.

Within the Cosenza Calabrian varieties of Arbëresh, the dialect of [[Vaccarizzo Albanese]] is particularly distinct. Spoken in the villages of [[Vaccarizzo Albanese]] and [[San Giorgio Albanese]] in [[Calabria]] by approximately 3,000 people. Vaccarizzo Albanian has retained many archaic features of both [[Gheg]] and [[Tosk]] dialects.

== Phonology ==

Some features of Arbërish distinguish it considerably from standard Albanian. In some cases these are retentions of older pronunciations.

==== Vowels ====
;Ë

The letter {{angbr|Ë}} is pronounced as either a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} or as a [[near-close near-back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ʊ̜]}}. So the word {{wikt-lang|sq|arbëresh}}is pronounced either {{IPA|[ɑɾbəˈɾɛʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ɑɾbʊ̜ˈɾɛʃ]}} depending on the dialect.

;Y to I

Arbërisht lacks the [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[y]}} of Albanian, which is replaced by the [[close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}}. For example {{wikt-lang|sq|ty}} ('you') becomes ''ti'', and {{wikt-lang|sq|hyni}} ('enter') becomes ''hini''.

==== Consonants ====

'''GJ, Q'''

The letters {{angbr|GJ}} and {{angbr|Q}} are pronounced as a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[voiced velar plosive]] {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} and a [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[voiceless velar plosive]] {{IPA|[kʲ]}}, rather than a [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|[ɟ]}} and a [[voiceless palatal plosive]] {{IPA|[c]}} as in standard Albanian. E.g. the word {{wikt-lang|sq|gjith}} ('all') is pronounced {{IPA|[ɡʲiθ]}} rather than {{IPA|[ɟiθ]}}, {{wikt-lang|sq|qiell}} ('heaven') is pronounced {{IPA|[kʲiɛx]}} rather than {{IPA|[ciɛɫ]}}, and {{wikt-lang|sq|shqip}} ('albanian') is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃkʲɪp]}}.

'''GL, KL'''

In some words, Arbëresh has preserved the consonant clusters {{IPA|/ɡl/}} and {{IPA|/kl/}}. In Standard Albanian these have mostly become the palatal stops ''gj'' and ''q''. E.g. ''glet'' not {{wikt-lang|sq|gjet}} ('s/he looks like ... '), ''klumësht'' not {{wikt-lang|sq|qumësht}} ('milk'), and ''klisha'' instead of {{wikt-lang|sq|kisha}} ('church').

'''H, HJ'''

The letter {{angbr|H}} is pronounced as a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} (a sound also found in [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|el|χαρά}} {{IPA|[xaˈra]}}, 'joy'). As such, the Albanian word {{wikt-lang|sq|ha}} ('eat') is pronounced {{IPA|[xɑ]}}, not {{IPA|[hɑ]}}. Arbëresh additionally has the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] counterpart, {{IPA|[ç]}}. Therefore, the word {{wikt-lang|sq|hjedh}} ('throw') is pronounced {{IPA|[çɛθ]}}. The letter combination {{angbr|HJ}} is present in a few standard Albanian words (without a voiceless velar fricative), but is not treated as a separate letter of the alphabet as it is in Arbëresh.

'''LL, G'''

The letters {{angbr|LL}} and {{angbr|G}} are realised as a [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}} (also found in Greek: {{wikt-lang|el|γάλα}} {{IPA|[ˈɣala]}}, 'milk'). The vast majority of these words originate in Sicilian, but the sound also occurs in words of Albanian origin.  Often {{angbr|G}} is replaced by {{angbr|GH}} in the Arbëresh orthography. This feature is very strong that it is carried over into the Italian speech of inhabitants of [[Piana degli Albanesi]] and [[Santa Cristina Gela]] in words such as ''Grazie'', ''Frigorifero'', ''Gallera'', ''Magro'', ''Gamba'' etc. which are realised respectively as {{IPA|[ʁratsiɛ]}}, {{IPA|[friɣoˈrifero]}}, {{IPA|[ɣaˈlɛra]}}, {{IPA|[ˈmaɣro]}}, {{IPA|[ˈʁamba]}} etc.&lt;ref&gt;A. Guzzetta, La Parlata di Piana degli Albanesi, Parte I - Fonologia, Palermo 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ResearchGate"&gt;{{cite report|author=Vito Matranga|date=January 1995|title=Ipotesi per il rilevamento dei dati variazionali nei punti albanofoni dell’Atlante linguistico della Sicilia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317636612_Ipotesi_per_il_rilevamento_dei_dati_variazionali_nei_punti_albanofoni_dell%27Atlante_linguistico_della_Sicilia|publisher=|page=|docket=|access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Piana degli Albanesi the tendency is to treat Italian [[loanwords]] differently from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], which results in the difference between ''llampjun'', pronounced as {{IPA|[ʁampˈjun]}} (from {{wikt-lang|scn|lampione}}, 'lamp post'), and ''lampadhin'', pronounced as {{IPA|[lampaˈðin]}} (from Italian {{wikt-lang|it|lampadina}}).  In the first example, the {{angbr|L}} becomes {{angbr|LL}} {{IPA|[ʁ]}} because it comes from Sicilian, whereas in the process of transference from the Italian ''ampadina'' to Arbëresh ''lampadhin'', the {{angbr|l}} does not change but the {{angbr|d}} becomes {{IPA|[ð]}}.

====Final devoicing of consonants====
In contrast with standard [[Albanian language|Albanian]] Arbëresh has retained an archaic system{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} of [[final devoicing]] of consonants. The consonants that change when in final position or before another consonant are the voiced stops ''b, d, g, gj''; the voiced affricates ''x, xh''; and the voiced fricatives ''dh, ll, v, z, zh''.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Original voiced
| ''b'' {{IPAblink|b}} || ''d'' {{IPAblink|d}} || ''g'' {{IPAblink|ɡ}}/{{IPAblink|ɣ}} || ''gj'' {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}}
| ''x'' {{IPAblink|dz}} || ''xh'' {{IPAblink|dʒ}}
| ''dh'' {{IPAblink|ð}} || ''ll'' {{IPAblink|ɣ}} || ''v'' {{IPAblink|v}} || ''z'' {{IPAblink|z}} || ''zh'' {{IPAblink|ʒ}}
|-
! Devoiced
| ''p'' {{IPAblink|p}} || ''t'' {{IPAblink|t}} || ''k'' {{IPAblink|k}} || ''q'' {{IPA|[kʲ]}}
| ''c'' {{IPAblink|ts}} || ''ch'' {{IPAblink|tʃ}}
| ''th'' {{IPAblink|θ}} || ''h'' {{IPAblink|x}} || ''f'' {{IPAblink|f}} || ''s'' {{IPAblink|s}} || ''sh'' {{IPAblink|ʃ}}
|}

Examples:
* ''b'' &gt; ''p'': ''thelb'' ('clove') - {{IPA|[θɛlp]}}
* ''d'' &gt; ''t'': ''vend'' ('place') - {{IPA|[vɛnt]}}
* ''dh'' &gt; ''th'': ''zgledh'' ('read') - {{IPA|[sklɛθ]}}
* ''g'' &gt; ''k'': ''lig'' ('bad') - {{IPA|[lɪk]}}
* ''gj'' &gt; ''q'': ''zogj'' ('chicks') - {{IPA|[zɔkʲ]}}
* ''j'' &gt; ''hj'': ''vaj'' ('oil') - {{IPA|[vaç]}}
* ''ll'' &gt; ''h'': ''uthull'' ('vinegar') - {{IPA|[ʊθʊχ]}}
* ''x'' &gt; ''c'': ''ndanx'' ('near') - {{IPA|[ndant͡s]}}
* ''z'' &gt; ''s'': ''loz'' ('dance') - {{IPA|[lɔs]}}
* ''zh'' &gt; ''sh'': ''gozhda'' ('pin') - {{IPA|[ɣɔʃda]}}

==== Stress ====
Stress in Arbëresh is usually on the [[penult]]imate syllable, as in [[Italian language|Italian]].

== Morphology ==
In Arbëresh the first person present [[indicative]] (e.g. "I work") is marked by the word ending in ''NJ'', whereas in Albanian this is normally marked by ''J''. So, 'I live' is ''rró'''nj''''' in Arbëresh and ''rro'''j''''' in standard Albanian.
The [[present continuous]] or [[gerund]] differs from Standard Albanian; Arbëresh uses the form "jam'e bënj" instead of "po bej" (I am doing).

== Non-Albanian derived elements ==

=== Vocabulary ===

Many Arbëresh words appear to be [[cognate]] with their corresponding [[Greek language|Greek]] words

Examples:

*'''''amáhj''''' {{IPA|[aˈmaç]}} ('war') shared with Greek {{wikt-lang|el|μάχη}} {{IPA|[maˈxi]}} ('battle').
*'''''haristís''''' {{IPA|[xaɾiˈstis]}}  ('thank') shared with Greek {{wikt-lang|el|ευχαριστώ}} {{IPA|[e̞fˌxariˈsto̞]}} ('thank you'). Arvanitika uses '''fharistisem'''.
*'''''hórë''''' {{IPA|[xɔˈɾə]}} ('village') shared with Greek {{wikt-lang|el|χωρα}} ([[Khora|Chora]]: land, main village).
*'''''parkalés''''' {{IPA|[paɾkaˈlɛs]}} ('I plead', 'please') shared with Greek {{wikt-lang|el|παρακαλώ}} {{IPA|[paˌrakaˈlo̞]}} ('please').

== Archaic Sicilianisms ==

Alongside the Greek component in Arbëresh, there is an extensive vocabulary derived from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and other southern Italian regional languages. Many of these words have retained their original meanings where Sicilian has given way to Italian in everyday speech amongst the non-Arbëresh Sicilian people.

Examples:

*'''''ghranët''''' ('money') &lt;  Sic. ''granna'', meaning 'grains'. It is still used in some contexts by modern Sicilian speakers, but in all situations in Arbëresh. Another Arbëresh word for 'money' is ''haromë'', but is no longer used.
*'''''qaca''''' ('square') &lt; Sic. ''chiazza''; used in all Arbëresh dialects as well as Sicilian. The Albanian word ''sheshi'' which means 'square' in standard Albanian means 'plateau' in Arbëresh.
*'''''rritrenjët''''' ('toilets') &lt; [[Norman French]] via Sic. retained in Arbëresh, but no longer in use in modern Sicilian.
*'''''rritëratë''''' ('photograph') &lt; Sic. 'picture' (''ritrattu''), more common in Arbëresh than in modern Sicilian.
*'''''zdar''''' (to go to the countryside) &lt; Sic. ''sdari''; no longer commonly used in Sicilian.
*'''''zgarrar''''' (to make a mistake; to err) &lt; Sic. ''sgarrari'' (now carries a different meaning in Sicilian).

=== Incorporation ===

Alongside the Sicilian vocabulary element in Siculo-Arbëresh, the language also includes grammatical rules for the incorporation of Sicilian-derived verbs in Arbëresh, which differs from the rules concerning Albanian lexical material.

Examples:

*'''pincar''' ('think'), originally ''mendonj''-''mbanj mend'' but also ''mëndinj''; derived from the Sicilian 'pinzari'. Which conjugates in the present tense as follows:
*U pincar = I think
*Ti pincar = You think
*Ai/Ajo pincar = He/She thinks
*Na pincarjëm = We think
*Ata/Ato pincarjën = They think
*Ju pincarni = You (pl) think

In the past tense this conjugates as follows:

*U pincarta = I thought
*Ti pincarte = You thought
*Ai/Ajo pincarti = He/She thought
*Na pircartëm = We thought
*Ata/Ato pincartën = They thought
*Ju pincartët = You (pl.) thought

== Contractions ==

|M’e tha mua || He told me (feminine object)

|Ngë m’i tha më || He did not tell me (masculine object)
|-
|T’e thom || I tell you (feminine object)
|-
|T’i thom || I tell you (masculine object)
|}

== Diminutives and augmentatives ==

The Arbëresh diminutive and augmentative system is [[calque]]d from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and takes the form of /-ats(-ɛ)/ = Sic. -azz(u/a); for example "kalac" (cavallone/big horse), and the diminutive takes the form of /-tʃ-ɛl(-ɛ) from Sic. /-c-edd(u/a); for example "vajziçele" (raggazzina/little girl).&lt;ref name="ResearchGate" /&gt;

==Comparison with other forms of Albanian==
There are many instances in which Arberisht differs greatly from Standard Albanian, for instance:

|''Vje' më rarë'' or ''vje' më thënë''||''do të thotë'' or ''do me thënë''||It means

== Grammar comparison ==

There are many elements of Arberesh grammar that differ considerably from Albanian, for example:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! Arbërisht !! Shqip !! Meaning !! Notes
|-
|''ka shkosh''||''do kalosh''|| You will pass
| Arbërisht uses the common Balkan participle ''ka'', whereas Shqip uses ''do'' which translates as 'want', which is also a feature of the Balkan sprachsbund
|-
|''flini alluras/anangasij''||''folni/flisni shpejt''|| Speak soon (pl.)
|
|-
|''flëni''||''flini''|| Sleep! (pl.)
|
|-
|''bëjëm të shkonj''||''më le të kaloj''|| Let me pass
| Shqip uses 'allow me to pass' whereas Arbërisht uses 'we do to pass' and 'able to pass'.
|-
|''vajta''||''shkova'' || I went
| Arbërisht conjugates from the Tosk word ''të vete'' whereas ''shkova'' means 'I passed' in Arbërisht
|-
|''ke gjegjur''||''ke dëgjuar''|| You have heard
|
|-
|''i papas zën fill parkalesin''||''prifti fillon lutën'' || The priest starts the prayer
|
|-
|''stisi''||''ishtë ndërtuar''|| It was built
|
|-
|''Jo, ngë u ka' parë''||''Jo, nuk u kam parë''|| No, I haven't seen it
|
|-
|''jam e flas, je flet, ai isht e flet, ajo isht e flet, jem'e flasjëm, jan'e flasjën, jan'e flini ''||''po flas, ti po flet, ai po flet, ajo po flet, po flasim, po flasin, po flisni''|| I am talking, you are talking, he is talking, she is talking, we are talking, they are talking, you (pl) are talking
| The present continuous is marked with the structure 'I am, You are, He is, She is, We are, They are etc. Whereas Shqip uses ''po'' which literally means 'yes'
|-
|''ki’ të zgjoneshjëm''||''kishim të zgjoneshim''|| We should have got up
|
|-
|''te ku ë Mërì?''||''ku është Maria?''|| Where is Maria?
| The locative marker ''te'' which literally means 'to' is added before ''ku'' 'where'. (A similar phenomena occurs in Welsh English and West Country English i.e. 'Where to you going?' or 'Where's he to?')
|-
|''Mërìa rri alartë''||''Maria jeton lartë''|| Maria lives upstairs
|
|-
|''Si ë Zotërote?''||''Si jeni ju, Zotëri?''|| How are you sir?
| The polite or formal is marked by use of ''Zotërote'' with ''ju'' being reserved for the plural only
|}

== Name ==

The name Arbërishte is derived from the ethnonym "[[Albanoi]]",  which in turn comes from the toponym "Arbëria" (Greek: Άρβανα), which in the Middle Ages referred to a region in what is today [[Albania]] (Babiniotis 1998). Its native equivalents (''Arbërorë, Arbëreshë'' and others) used to be the self-designation of Albanians in general. Both "Arbëria" and "Albania/Albanian" go further back to name forms attested since antiquity.

Within the Arbëresh community the language is often referred to as "Tarbrisht" or "Gjegje." The origin of the term "gjegje" is uncertain, however this does mean "listen" in Arbërisht. Gheg is also the name of one of the two major dialects of Albanian as spoken in the Balkans. The name Gheg is derived from the term initially used by the Orthodox Christian population of pre-Ottoman Albania for confessional denotation when referring to their Catholic neighbors who converted to Catholicism to better resist the Orthodox Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghegs]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

== Arbëresh names ==
Every Italo-Albanian person is given a legal Italian name and also a name in Albanian Arbërisht. Quite often the Arbëresh name is merely a translation of the Italian name. Arbëresh surnames are also used amongst villagers but do not carry any legal weight; the Arbëresh surname is called an "ofiqe" in Arbërisht. Some Arbëresh 'ofiqe' are 'Butijuni', 'Pafundi' (literally 'without anus', probably with the meaning of 'without end, infinite'), 'Skarpari' (shoemaker from Italian word 'scarpa'), 'Mut', 'Picanarët', 'Balolërat', 'Kashetërat', 'Lopa', 'Bikubiu' etc.

Shërbesa e Kurorës - The Arbëresh Marriage Ceremony

Zoti : ''Gjergji'', do ti të marsh për gruja ''Linën'' çë ë ke këtú te ana, si urdhuron Klisha Shejte, e të qëndrosh lidhur me atë në të mirën si edhé në të ligën gjithë ditët e gjellës tënde?

Priest: Do you George want to take as your wife Lina who is present here according to the instructions of the Holy Church and to be faithful through the good and the bad all of your life?

Dhëndërri: O, e dua!

Groom: Yes, I want!

Zoti: Bekuar kloft Perëndia jínë nga herë, naní e për gjithëmonë e për jetë të jetëvet.

Priest: blessed be our God for all time, now and always in the centuries of centuries.

Populli: Amín.

People: Amen.

Zoti: Në paqe parkalesjëm t'ën Zonë.

Priest: In peace we pray to the Lord.

Populli: Lipisí, o i Madh'yn'Zot.

'''''Bekimi të unazavet'''''

Zoti: Me këtë unazë shërbëtori i Perëndis, Gjergji, lidhet me shërbëtorën e Perëndis, Lina, në embër të Atit, të Birit e të Shpirtit Shejt.

Priest: The servant of God, George, is tied to the servant of God, Lina, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

'''''Zoti jep krinjët e këndon Msalmin 127:'''''
Të limë atá çë i trëmben t'ynë Zoti e çë jecjën te udhët e Tij.

'''''the priest delivers the candles and intones Psalm 127'''''
Make happy those who fear the Lord and may they walk in His ways.

'''''Lëvdi tij, o i madh'yn'Zot, lëvdi tij. Dhóksa si, o Theós imón, dhóksa si'''''
Glory to you, our God, glory to you.

Se ti ka hashë bukën e shërbëtyrës s'duarvet tote. Lumë ti e fatbardhë ka jeshë. Jotë shoqe ka jet si dhri me pemë te muret e shpis tënde. Bijët tatë si degë ullinjësh rrethë triesës tënde. Shi kështú ka jet bekuar njeriu çë ka trëmbësirën e Perëndisë.

That you will eat the bread of the work of your hands. You will be happy and enjoy all that is good.
See your wife as a fertile vine in the intimacy of your home.
That your daughters will be like olive branches around your table.
That those who fear the Lord will be blessed.

'''Artists and repertoire''' ('''A&amp;R''') is the division of a [[record label]] or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of [[recording artist]]s and songwriters.&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&amp;R.

==Responsibilities==

===Finding talent===
The A&amp;R division of a record label is responsible for finding new [[recording artist]]s and bringing those artists to the record company. Personnel in the A&amp;R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&amp;R people are often young and many are musicians, [[music journalists]] or [[record producers]].{{sfn|Albini|1993}}

An A&amp;R executive is authorized to offer a [[record contract]], often in the form of a "deal memo": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company.{{sfn|Albini|1993}} The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival [[entertainment lawyer]]s hired by the musician's [[artist manager|manager]] and the record company.{{sfn|Krasilovsky|Shemel|Gross|Feinstein|2007}}

A&amp;R executives rely mostly on the [[word of mouth]] of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}} They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices.{{sfn|Weissman|2003|p=25}}

===Overseeing the recording process===
The A&amp;R division of a record label oversees the [[sound recording|recording]] and format process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e.[[Wiktionary:repertoire|repertoire]]) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&amp;R person will assist in finding songs and songwriters. A&amp;R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing companies]] to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.

As the record nears completion, the A&amp;R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to [[marketing|market]] the record on radio.

===Assisting with marketing and promotion===
Once the record is completed, the A&amp;R department consults with marketing, [[radio promotion|promotion]], the [[recording artist|artist]] and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.

==History and influence==
The tastes of particular A&amp;R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&amp;R man [[John H. Hammond]] discovered [[Billie Holiday]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating "commercial" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records.{{sfn|Prial|2006}} [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]], Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as [[The Tubes]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] during his career. [[David Geffen Company|Geffen Records]]' Gary Gersh signed the band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] at a time when [[alternative rock]] music was not considered commercial.{{sfn|Shoemer|1992}} Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings.{{sfn|Goldberg|2009|p=179-180}} In cases like these, A&amp;R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.

This kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&amp;R executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, [[Columbia Records]]' A&amp;R man in the 1950s, [[Mitch Miller]], favored traditional pop singers like [[Guy Mitchell]] and [[Patti Page]], and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]].

This "trend following" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including [[teen pop]] (1998–2001), [[alternative rock]] (1993–1996), [[glam metal]] (1986–1991) and [[disco]] (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Disco boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=15–35}}. Teen pop boom: {{Harvtxt|Knopper|2009|pp=}}. Knopper discusses the way the industry has overreacted to these waves throughout his book.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but business people. Traditionally A&amp;R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – [[Atlantic Records]]'s heads [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] were producers and composers respectively – but an A&amp;R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with [[Ron Fair]] and [[Martin Kierszenbaum]] being notable recent exceptions.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Richard_Niles_Interview.html |title=Interview with Richard Niles |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=23 Apr 2007 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer and arranger [[Richard Niles]] has said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&amp;R staff are businessmen. They’re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, "Go out and get me anything that's popular now."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hip hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]] referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&amp;R executive in their single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", metaphorically likening them to "mountain climbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan: 10 of the best|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/26/wu-tang-clan-10-of-the-best|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=Wu-Tang Clan Still Sting|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/wu-tang-clan-still-sting-2151230|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations==
According to [[Rhythm King Records]] and [[Lizard King Records]] founder Martin Heath, the A&amp;R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MartinHeath.html |title=Interview With Martin Heath |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=12 December 2005 |accessdate=20 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If scouts are chasing a band, you’ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well," he said in an interview with [[HitQuarters]].&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt; Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&amp;R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"/&gt;

==Recent changes==
{{See also|2000s in the music industry}}

New forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&amp;R.{{sfn|Kusek|Leonhard|2005}} In the wake of [[Music industry in the 21st century|declining record sales]], a large number of A&amp;R staffers have been terminated.{{sfn|Knopper|2009|pp=220–221}} It is unclear whether A&amp;R executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.

'''Aymaran''' (also '''Jaqi''', '''Aru''', '''Jaqui''', '''Aimara''', '''Haki''') is one of the two dominant [[language families]] of the central [[Andes]], along with [[Quechua languages|Quechuan]].

Hardman (1978) proposed the name ''Jaqi'' for the family of languages (1978), [[Alfredo Torero]] ''Aru'' 'to speak', and [[Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino]] ''Aymaran'', with two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymaran and Central Aymaran (Jaqaru and Kawki). 

Quechuan languages, especially those of the south, share a large amount of vocabulary with Aymara, and the languages have often been grouped together as [[Quechumaran]]. This proposal is controversial, however; the shared vocabulary may be better explained as intensive borrowing due to long-term contact.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Aymaran languages have only three [[phonemic]] [[Vowel|vowels]] {{IPA|/a i u/}}, which in most varieties of Aymara and Jaqaru are distinguished by length. Length is commonly transcribed using [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaereses]] in Aymara and [[Length (phonetics)|length diacritics]] in Jaqaru.

=== Consonants ===
Though Aymaran languages vary in terms of consonant inventories, they have several features in common. Aymara and Jaqaru both contain phonemic stops at [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal]], [[velar]] and [[uvular]] points of articulation. Stops are distinguished by [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] and [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] features. Both also contain [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], and [[Velar consonant|velar]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and several [[Central approximant|central]] and [[Lateral approximant|lateral]] [[Approximant consonant|approximants.]]

=== Morphophonology ===
Aymaran languages differ from Quechuan languages in that all verbal and nominal roots must end in a vowel, even in loanwords: Spanish ''habas'' ("beans") became Aymara ''hawasa'' and Jaqaru ''háwaša''. That feature is not found in other Andean languages. 

Like Quechuan languages, Ayamaran languages are highly agglutinative. However, they differ in that many agglutinative suffixes trigger vowel suppression in the preceding roots. An example is the loss of final vowel in the word ''apa'' ("to take"), when it becomes ''ap-su'' ("to take out"). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiwaUY6KsY8C|title=The Languages of the Andes|last=Adelaar|first=Willem F. H.|date=2004-06-10|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139451123|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family division==
Aymaran consists of two languages:
*[[Aymara language|Aymara]]. Southern and Central dialects divergent and sometimes considered separate languages.
*[[Jaqaru]] (Haqearu, Haqaru, Haq'aru, Aru). Kawki dialect (Cauqui, Cachuy) is divergent.

Aymara has approximately 2.2 million speakers; 1.7 million in [[Bolivia]], 350,000 in [[Peru]], and the rest in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Jaqaru has approximately 725 speakers in central Peru, and Kawki had 9 surviving speakers as of 2005. Kawki is little documented though its relationship with Jaqaru is extremely close. Initially, they were considered by Martha Hardman (on very limited data at the time) to be different languages, but all subsequent fieldwork and research has contradicted that and demonstrated that they are mutually intelligible but divergent dialects of a single language.

'''Belize Kriol''' (also '''Kriol''' or '''Belizean Creole''') is an [[English-based creole language]] closely related to [[Miskito Coastal Creole]], [[Jamaican Patois]], [[San Andrés-Providencia Creole]], [[Bocas del Toro Creole]], [[Colón Creole]], [[Rio Abajo Creole]] and [[Limónese Creole|Limón Coastal Creole]].

Population estimates are difficult; virtually all of the more than 70,000 Creoles in [[Belize]] speak Kriol. In the 2010 Belize Census, 25.9% claimed [[Belizean Creole people|Creole ethnicity]] and 44.6% claimed to speak Kriol.&lt;ref name="census2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Belize Population and Housing Census 2010: Country Report|url=http://www.sib.org.bz/Portals/0/docs/publications/census/2010_Census_Report.pdf|publisher=Statistical Institute of Belize|accessdate=11 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127084833/http://www.sib.org.bz/Portals/0/docs/publications/census/2010_Census_Report.pdf|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as many as 85,000 Creoles have migrated to the United States and may or may not still speak the language. This puts the number at over 150,000.  Kriol is the [[lingua franca]] of [[Belize]] and is the first language of some [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]s, [[Mestizo]]s, [[Maya peoples|Maya]], and other ethnic groups. It is a second language for most others in the country.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Melissa A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3985885 ''The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras'']. ''Environmental History'', Vol. 8, No. 4 (October 2003), pp. 598–617.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the National Kriol Council began standardizing the [[orthography]] for Kriol, it decided to promote the spelling ''Kriol'' only for the language but to continue to use the spelling ''Creole'' to refer to the people in English.&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;Decker, Ken (2005), ''The Song of Kriol: A Grammar of the Kriol Language of Belize''. Belize City: Belize Kriol Project, pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Crosbie, Paul, ed. (2007), ''Kriol-Inglish Dikshineri: English-Kriol Dictionary''. Belize City: Belize Kriol Project, pp. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Belize Kriol is derived mainly from English. Its [[substratum|substrate languages]] are the Native American language [[Miskito language|Miskito]], and the various [[West African|West]] African and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] languages which were brought into the country by slaves. These include [[Akan language|Akan]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Ga language|Ga]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kriol.org.bz/|title=Kriol - Complete Web Solutions Provider|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous [[Creole language#Creole genesis|theories as to how creole languages form]]. A language emerged from the contact of English landowners and their West African slaves to ensure basic communication. The [[Baymen]] first began to settle in the area of Belize City in the 1650s. Decker (2005:3)&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt; proposes that the creole spoken in Belize previous to 1786 was probably more like Jamaican than the Belize Kriol of today. By the [[Convention of London (1786)|Convention of London]] in 1786 the British were supposed to cease all logwood cutting operations along the Caribbean coast of Central America, except for the Belize settlement. Many of the settlers from the [[Miskito Coast]] moved to Belize, bringing their [[Miskito Coast Creole]] with them. The immigrants outnumbered the Baymen five to one.&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;Floyd, Troy S. (1967). ''The Anglo-Spanish Struggle for Mosquitia''. University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The local Kriol speech shifted to become something more like the [[Miskito Coast Creole]].&lt;ref name="johnson" /&gt;

Today, Belize Kriol is the first or second language of the majority of the country's inhabitants. Many of them speak standard English as well, and a rapid process of [[decreolization]] is going on. As such, a [[Post-creole speech continuum|creole continuum]] exists and speakers are able to [[code-switching|code-switch]] among various [[mesolect]] registers between the most [[basilect]] to the [[acrolect]] ("[[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic]]") varieties. It should be noted that the acrolect, much like the basilect, is rarely heard.&lt;ref name="escure"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Escure |first=Geneviève |year=1999 |title=The pragmaticization of past in creoles |journal=American Speech |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=165–202 |jstor=455577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 travel guide in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper reported that Belize Kriol is “a language that teases but just escapes the comprehension of a native speaker of English.”

== English taught in Belizean schools ==
English taught in the schools of Belize is based on [[British English]]. However, this is often influenced by the teachers' Kriol speech. The 1999 Ministry of Education: School Effectiveness Report (p.&amp;nbsp;84) notes “Creole is spoken as the first language in most homes.” Kriol is “di stiki stiki paat” that holds Belize together. Belizean people speak English, Kriol, and often Spanish, while learning the English system of writing and reading in schools. It is a slightly different system of communication from the standard forms.&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
Kriol shares [[phonology|phonological]] similarities with many [[Caribbean]] [[English-based creole languages|English Creoles]] as well as to English, its [[Superstrate|superstrate language]].&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt; [[Pidgin]] languages have a general tendency to simplify the phonology of a language in order to ensure successful communication. Many Creoles keep this tendency after creolization. Kriol is no exception in this point.

Kriol uses a high number of nasalized vowels, palatalizes non-labial stops and prenasalizes voiced stops. Consonant clusters are reduced at the end of words and many sylables are reduced to only a consonant and vowel.

1. Like most creole languages, Kriol has a tendency to an open syllabic structure, meaning there are many words ending in vowels. This feature is strengthened by its tendency to delete consonants at the end of words, especially when the preceding vowel is unstressed.

2. Nasalization is phonemic in Kriol, caused by the deletion of final nasal consonants. The nasal feature is kept, even if the consonant has been dropped.

3. Many Kriol speakers tend to palatalize the velar consonants {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} preceding {{IPA|/ɑː/}}. Sometimes they also palatalize alveolar consonants, such as {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/n/}}.{{fix|text=in which context?}}

4. Like all other creoles, Kriol also has a tendency to reduce consonant clusters no matter where they occur. Final consonant clusters are almost always reduced by dropping the second consonant. Initial and medial occurrences are reduced much less consistently.

5. When {{IPA|/r/}} occurs finally, it is always deleted. When it occurs in the middle of a word, it is often deleted leaving a residual vowel length.

6. Although its [[superstratum|superstrate]] language, English, makes extensive use of dental fricatives ({{IPA|/θ/ /ð/}}), Belizean Kriol does not use them. It rather employs the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}. However, due to the ongoing process of decreolization, some speakers include such dental fricatives in their speech.

7. Unstressed initial vowels are often deleted in Kriol. Sometimes this can lead to a glottal stop instead.

8. Vowels tend to be alternated for the ones used in English, f.i. {{IPA|/bwɑi/}} or {{IPA|/bwoi/}} (''boy'') becomes {{IPA|/boi/}}, {{IPA|/ɑnɡri/}} (''angry'') becomes {{IPA|/ænɡri/}} and so on.&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

9. Stress is evenly distributed across syllables, meaning that the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of Kriol is different than its [[lexifier]]. It is reserved mainly for content words an appears to only have High and Low tones &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages.|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=9789027252722|location=|pages=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants and vowels ===
Kriol uses three voiced plosives ({{IPA|/b/ /d/ /ɡ/}}) and three voiceless plosives({{IPA|/p/ /t/ /k/}}). The voiceless stops can also be [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]. However, aspiration is not a constant feature, therefore the aspirated and non-aspirated forms are [[allophone|allophonic]]. The language employs three nasal consonants, ({{IPA|/m/ /n/ /ŋ/}}). It makes extensive use of fricatives and, both unvoiced ({{IPA|/f/ /s/ /ʂ/}}) and voiced ({{IPA|/v/ /z/ /ʐ/}}. Its two liquids, {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, are articulated alveo-palatally. The tongue is more lax here than in American English, its position is more similar to British English. Kriol's glides {{IPA|/w/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/h/}} are used extensively. Glottal stops occur rarely and inconsistently. Kriol makes use of eleven vowels; nine monophthongs, three [[diphthong]]s and [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}}. The most frequently occurring diphthong, {{IPA|/ai/}} is used in all regional varieties. Both {{IPA|/au/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} can occur, but they are new additions and are viewed as a sign of decreolization. The same is perceived of four of the less productive monophthongs.&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
Unlike most creoles, Kriol has a standardized [[orthography]].

Consonants: b, ch, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, v, w, y, z, zh
{| class="wikitable"

|}

The symbol choices for lengthened vowels come from ways those vowels are spelled in English, not the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt;
There is a dictionary for Kriol with over 5000 entries, including sample sentences for each word.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

== Morphology ==

=== Tense ===
The present tense verb is not marked overtly in Kriol. It also does not indicate [[grammatical number|number]] or [[grammatical person|person]]. As an unmarked verb, it can refer both to present and to [[perfective]]. The English past tense marker |{{IPA|d}}| at the end of the verbs indicates acrolectal speech. However, there is the possibility to mark [[imperfect|past]] by putting the tense marker |{{IPA|mi}}| before the verb. Overt marking is rare, however, if the sentence includes a semantic temporal marker, such as "yestudeh" (yesterday) or "laas season" (last season).

The future tense is indicated by employing the preverbal marker ''{{IPA|wa}}'' or ''{{IPA|a}}''. Unlike the marking of past tense, this marking is not optional.&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

=== Aspect ===

==== The progressive aspect ====
The preverbal marker ''{{IPA|di}}'' expresses the progressive aspect in both past and present tense. However, if the past is not marked overtly (lexically or by using ''{{IPA|mi}}''), an unambiguous understanding is only possible in connection to context. ''{{IPA|di}}'' is always mandatory. In past progressive, it is possible to achieve an unambiguous meaning by combining ''{{IPA|mi}}'' + ''{{IPA|di}}'' + verb.

Progressive action in the future can be expressed by using ''{{IPA|bi}}'' in conjunction with ''{{IPA|wɑ}}''. The correct combination here would be ''{{IPA|wɑ}}'' + ''{{IPA|bi}}'' + verb.

==== The habitual aspect ====
Kriol does not have a habitual aspect in its own right. Other creoles have a general tendency to merge the habitual with completive, the habitual with progressive, or the habitual with future. Kriol however, does not clearly merge it with anything. Thus, we can only assume that the habitual is expressed through context and not through morphological marking.

==== The completive aspect ====
The completive aspect is expressed either without marking, that is, by context only, or by the use of a completive preverbal markers, such as ''{{IPA|don}}'' or ''{{IPA|finiʂ}}''.&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

=== Mood and voice ===

==== Conditional ====
The conditional mood is expressed through the conditional verbs ''{{IPA|wuda}}'', ''{{IPA|mi-wa}}'', and ''{{IPA|mia}}''. The short version, ''{{IPA|da}}'', is employed only in the present tense; past tense requires the longer forms.

==== Passive voice ====
There is no overt lexical marking of active and passive in Kriol. It is only the emphasis of a sentence which can clarify the meaning, together with context. Emphasis can be strengthened by adding emphatic markers, or through repetition and redundancy.

=== Verb usage ===

==== Special verbs ====
There are four forms of "be" in Kriol: ''{{IPA|de}}'', two uses of ''{{IPA|di}}'', and the absence of a marker. The equative form ''{{IPA|di}}'' is used as a copula (when the complement of the verb is either a noun or a noun phrase). ''{{IPA|de}}'' is the locative form which is used when the verb's complement is a prepositional phrase. No overt marking is used when the complement is an adjective. ''{{IPA|di}}'', finally, is used in the progressive aspect.

The verb "to go" is irregular in Kriol, especially when set in the future progressive. It does not use the progressive marker ''{{IPA|di}}'' but is exchanged by the morpheme and ''{{IPA|ɡwein}}''. In past tense, this is similar: instead of employing ''{{IPA|mi}}'', it uses the lexical item ''{{IPA|ɡaan}}''.

A verb which is used extensively in each conversation is ''{{IPA|mek}}''. It can be used like a modal in casual requests, in threats and intentional statements, and, of course, like the standard verb "to make".&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

=== Noun usage ===

==== Plural formation ====
Plurals are usually formed in Kriol by inserting the obligatory postnomial marker ''{{IPA|de}}''. Variations of this marker are ''{{IPA|den}}'' and ''{{IPA|dem}}''. As decreolization is processing, the standard English plural ending ''{{IPA|-s}}'' occurs far more frequently. Sometimes, the ''{{IPA|de}}'' is added to this form, f.i. in "shoes de" – shoes.

The absence of a plural marker occurs rarely.

=== Loan words ===
Many Spanish, Maya, and Garifuna words refer to popular produce and food items:&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

:''panades''
:''garnaches''
:''tamales''
:''hudut''
:''wangla''
:''goma''
:''reyeno''
:''bundiga''
:''comadre''
:''compadre''

== Syntax ==

=== Syntactic ordering ===
The construction of sentences in Kriol is very similar to that in English. It uses a Subject-Verb-Object order (SVO). All declarative and most interrogative sentences follow this pattern, the interrogatives with a changed emphasis. The construction of the phrases follows Standard English in many ways.

=== Locatives ===
Locatives are more frequently used in Kriol and much more productive than in Standard English. The general locative is expressed by the morpheme ''{{IPA|da}}'' ("at" or "to"). It is possible to use ''{{IPA|to}}'' or ''{{IPA|pɑn}}'' ("on") instead. This is an indication of either emphasis or decreolization. Another morpheme which is more specific than ''{{IPA|dɑ}}'' is ''{{IPA|inɑ}}'' ("into"). It is used in contexts where ''{{IPA|dɑ}}'' is not strong enough.

Together with the verb "look", however, ''{{IPA|dɑ}}'' is not used and denoted as incorrect. To express "to look at", it is wrong to say "luk da". The correct version would be "luk pan".&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

=== Noun plus pronoun ===
In a noun phrase, Kriol can employ a structure of both noun and pronoun to create emphasis. The ordering then is noun + pronoun + verb (f.i. "mista filip hi noa di ansa" – Mr Philip knows the answer).

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives are employed predicatively and attributively. They can be intensified either by the postposed adverb modifier ''{{IPA|bad}}'', by iteration, or by the use of the adverb modifier ''{{IPA|onli}}''. Iteration is here the usual way. Comparatives and superlatives are constructed according to morphosyntactic rules. A comparative is made by adding ''{{IPA|-a}}'' to the stem ("taal" – "taala" – tall). The morpheme ''{{IPA|den}}'' is employed to form comparative statements, f.i. "hî tɑlɑ dan shee" – He is taller than she. Superlatives are created by adding ''{{IPA|-es}}'' to the stem. In all cases, the use of the definite article ''{{IPA|di}}'' is obligatory. The copula is present if the superlative is used predicatively. An example could be: "She dah di taales" – She is the tallest.

=== Adverbs ===
Adverbs are used much as they are in Standard English. In almost all cases, they differ from adjectives not in form but in function. There are, however a few exceptions, such as "properli" (properly), "errli" (early) or "po:li" (poorly). Adverbs can be intensified by reduplication.

=== Conjunctions ===
Most Kriol conjunctions are very similar to English and employed in the same way. The main difference is that Kriol allows double negation, so that some conjunctions are used differently. Some examples for Kriol conjunctions are: "an" (and), "but" (but), "if" (if), "o:" (or) etc.

Questions usually take the same form in Kriol as they do in Standard English: question word + subject + verb. The "[[do-support]]" does not occur here either. The rising intonation at the end of the sentence may increase even more if no question word is necessary. Thus, most declarative sentences can become interrogative with the right intonation. "Which" has various translations in Kriol. If the speaker means "which", he uses ''{{IPA|witʂ}}'', but he can also use ''{{IPA|witʂ wan}}'' for "which one".&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

== Grammar ==

The tense/aspect system of Kriol is fundamentally unlike that of English. There are no morphological marked past tense forms corresponding to English -ed -t. There are three preverbial particles: "mi" and "did" for the past, "di" as an "aspect marker", and a host of articles to indicate the future ("(w)a(n)", "gwein", "gouɲ"). These are not verbs, they are simply invariant particles which cannot stand alone like the English "to be". Their function differs also from the English.

The progressive category is marked by {{IPA|/di~de/}}. Past habitual is marked by {{IPA|/doz/}} or {{IPA|/juustu/}}. Present habitual aspect is unmarked but can be indicated by "always", "usually", etc. (i.e. is absent as a grammatical category).&lt;ref name="Song" /&gt; Mufwene (1984) and Gibson and Levy (1984) propose a past-only habitual category marked by {{IPA|/juustu doz/}} as in {{IPA|/weh wi juustu doz liv ih noh az koal az ya/}} ("where we used to live is not as cold as here") &lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Kean (1988), "The Habitual Category in Guyanese and Jamaican Creoles", American Speech, 63 (3): 195–202, doi:10.2307/454817&lt;/ref&gt;

For the present tense, an uninflected verb combining with an iterative adverb marks habitual meaning as in {{IPA|/tam aalweiz noa entaim keiti tel pɑn hii/}} ("Tom always knows when Katy tells/has told about him").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1984|p=218}} cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Gibson|1988|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"mi" is a "tense indicator"
*"di" is an "aspect marker"
*"(w)a(n)", "gwein", "gouɲ") are used to indicate the future&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;
*{{IPA|/ai mi run/}}
**I run (habitually); I ran
*{{IPA|/ai di run/}}
**I am running
*{{IPA|/ai mi di run/}}
**I was running
*{{IPA|/ai mi run/}}  ''or'' {{IPA|/Ai ɡaan run/}}
**I have run; I had run
*{{IPA|/ai ɡouŋ run/}}, {{IPA|/ai wa(n) run/}} ''or'' {{IPA|/ai ɡwein run/}}
**I am going to run; I will run

Like many other Caribbean Creoles {{IPA|/fi/}} and {{IPA|/fu/}} have a number of functions, including:&lt;ref&gt;Winford, Donald (1985), "The Syntax of Fi Complements in Caribbean English Creole", Language, 61 (3): 588–624, doi:10.2307/414387&lt;/ref&gt;
*Directional, dative, or benefactlve preposition
**{{IPA|/den di fait fu wii/}} ("They are fighting for us")&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Beryl, L (1966). Jamaican Creole Syntax. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Genitive]] preposition (that is, marker of possession)
**{{IPA|/da buk da fu mii /}} or /Dat da mi buk/ ("That's my book")
*Modal auxiliary expressing obligation or futurity
**{{IPA|/hi fu kom op ya/}} ("He should be coming here")
*Pre-infinitive complementizer
**{{IPA|/unu hafu ker sontiŋ fu deŋ ɡarifuna fi biit deŋ miuzik/}} ("You (plural)  have to contribute something to the [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] People for playing their music")&lt;ref name="patrick"&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (1995), "Recent Jamaican Words in Sociolinguistic Context", American Speech, 70 (3): 227–264, doi:10.2307/455899&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The pronominal system ===
The pronominal system of Standard English has a four-way distinction of person, number, gender and case. Some varieties of Kriol do not have the gender or case distinction, though most do; but it does distinguish between the second person singular and plural (you).&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

*I = {{IPA|/ai/}} (occasionally ''mii'' in negations)
* me = {{IPA|/mii/}} (exception is ''Ai'', as in, "Mek ai tel yu")
* my, my, mine (possessive) = {{IPA|/mi~mai~mainz/}}
* you, you = {{IPA|/ju/}}
* your, yours = {{IPA|ju~jurs}}
*he, him = {{IPA|/hi/}} (pronounced {{IPA|/i/}} in the basilect varieties)
*she, her = {{IPA|/ʃi/}} (pronounced {{IPA|/i/}}. No gender distinction in basilect varieties)
*him, her = {{IPA|/a/}} (no gender distinction in basilect varieties)
*him = {{IPA|/hi/}}
*her = {{IPA|/ʃi/}}
*we, us = {{IPA|wi~wii}}
*us (3 or more)= {{IPA|/all a wii/}}
*our, ours = {{IPA|/fuwii; wai ; wainz/}}
*you (plural) = {{IPA|/unu; all a ju/}}
*they, them = {{IPA|/den; dem/)}}
*those = {{IPA|/dende/}}

=== Interrogatives ===
The question words found in Kriol are:&lt;ref name="escure" /&gt;

*What? = {{IPA|/Waat?; Wah?/}}
*Why? = {{IPA|/Wai?/}}
*Where? = {{IPA|/Weh?; Wehpaat?/}} (What part?)
*Who? = {{IPA|/Huu?/}}
*Whose? = {{IPA|/Fihuu?/}} (For whom?)
*The supporting ''That'' = {{IPA|/Weh/}}

=== Copula ===

*the Kriol equative verb is also "da"
**e.g. {{IPA|/Ai da di tiicha/}} ("I am the teacher")
*Kriol has a separate locative verb "deh"
**e.g. {{IPA|/wi de da london/}} ''or'' {{IPA|/wi de iina london/}} ("we are in London")
*with true adjectives in Kriol, no copula is needed

Contrast of Copula Forms

Copula = helping verb forms of “be”

Kriol: Ai da di teecha

English: I am the teacher.

Kriol: Yu da di teecha.

English: You are the teacher

Kriol: Ih da di teecha.

English: He/She is the teacher.

Kriol: Ah da-mi di teecha

English: I was the teacher

Kriol: Yu da-mi di teecha

English: You were the teacher.

Kriol: She/Ih da-mi di teecha.

English: She/He was the teacher.

=== Negation ===

*{{IPA|/no/}} is used as a present tense negator:
**{{IPA|/if wa cow neva no ih cu swalla ɡrass, ih neva mi wa try it/}} ("If the cow didn't know that he could swallow grass, he wouldn't have tried it")&lt;ref name="lawton"&gt;Lawton, David (1984), "Grammar of the English-Based Jamaican Proverb", American Speech, 2: 123–130, doi:10.2307/455246&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|/kiaa/}} is used in the same way as English 'can't'
**{{IPA|/hii da wa sikli lii ting weh kiaa iiven maʃ wa ant/}} ("He is a sickly thing that can't even mash an ant")&lt;ref name="lawton" /&gt;
*{{IPA|/neva/}} is a negative past participle.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Alison (2004), "A Good Command of the English Language: Phonological Variation in the Jamaican Acrolect", Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, 19 (1): 41–76, doi:10.1075/jpcl.19.1.03irv&lt;/ref&gt;
**{{IPA|/dʒan neva teef di moni/}} ("John did not steal the money")

'''Cat and mouse''', often expressed as '''cat-and-mouse game''', is an English-language [[idiom]] dating to 1675 that means "a contrived action involving constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes."&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cat%20and%20mouse |title=cat and mouse |accessdate=2008-07-23 |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "cat" is unable to secure a definitive victory over the "mouse", who despite not being able to defeat the cat, is able to avoid capture. In extreme cases, the idiom may imply that the contest is never-ending. The term is derived from the hunting behavior of [[Cat|domestic cats]], which often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior may arise from an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do cats play with their food?|url=http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial usage, it has often been generalized to mean the advantage constantly shifts between the contestants, leading to an [[impasse]] or ''[[de facto]]'' stalemate.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}  In classical [[game theory]], cat and mouse classifies as a "[[copycat game|copycat]]" archetype whereby there exists no [[social equilibrium|equilibrium]], and most importantly, no [[wikt:endgame|endgame]], its two protagonists, [[Dot and Ditto]], running amok in their [[Normal-form game|game space]] to infinity, with no endpoint to their game anywhere in site attributable to a defective reward system; conflicting incentives. Theoretical [[Moral|active reading]] on "cat and mouse," or "Dot and Ditto" is ominous in its implication; multiple protagonists, each armed a [[passive strategy]], can remain theoretically locked in total perpetual war indefinitely, wholly unable to rise to a plateau sufficient to intellectualize their plight.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}

'''Clothed female, naked male''' ('''CFNM'''), or '''clothed male, naked female''', is a genre of [[erotica]] based on the real or imagined interaction of one or more [[nudity|nude]] men and one or more clothed women.  It is sometimes a [[sexual fantasy]] of women or men, depicting an  [[exhibitionist]] or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male [[striptease]], a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as  a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a [[dominatrix]] over the nude male.

The opposite of CFNM is [[clothed male, naked female]] (CMNF).

==Portrayal of male nudity==
[[File:Torii Kiyonobu I -By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern early 1700s.jpg|thumb|''By the Light of a Hexagonal Lantern'', woodblock print by [[Torii Kiyonobu I]], early 1700s.]]

[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs, 1846.jpg|thumb|''Jeunes Grecs faisant battre des coqs'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1846).]]
In [[classical antiquity]], the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed.&lt;ref name="Goldhill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Love, sex &amp; tragedy how the ancient world shapes our lives |author=Simon Goldhill |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-226-30119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Titian]]'s ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|treatment of Perseus and Andromeda]]'' in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour.

Depictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] culture if the setting was clearly "classical", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in ''Combat de coqs'' (1847) by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]].

== Sexual objectification of men by women ==
[[Feminist]] authors [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] and [[Naomi Wolf]] have written that women's sexual liberation has led many women to a [[role reversal]], whereby they view men as [[sex object]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Christina Hoff. 1994. ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]''. New York. Simon and Schuster (pp.264-265), {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hc), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. 1994.

''Yes (feminist women who like sex)'' Esquire. February 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in a manner similar to what they criticize in men's treatment of women.

{{Politics}}
'''Conviction politics''' is the practice of campaigning based on a politician's own fundamental values or ideas rather than attempting to represent an existing consensus or simply take positions that are popular in polls.

On the right, the term has been adopted by politicians like [[Margaret Thatcher]], who declared, "I am not a consensus politician. I am a conviction politician" in 1979, a few months before her election as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916773-6,00.html | work=Time | title=A Tory Wind of Change | date=1979-05-14 | access-date=2016-09-26 | subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are a number of arguments for conviction politics. One is that it is more honest; conviction politicians simply say what they believe rather than shading their opinions to be more palatable to their audience. Another is that by voicing strong opinions, they push public debate forward and promote a genuine discussion of political issues. Even if the candidates lose, they will have promoted their particular political ideas and persuaded some voters of their value.

There are also more instrumental reasons. By arguing forcefully for their positions during the campaign, politicians are more able to pursue the goals once in office. Also, proponents argue that conviction politicians are more likely to win. When he was a candidate, [[Tom Perriello]] stated that, "More often, the deepest connection with another person comes from when I disagree with them and admit it, because at least they know I will tell the truth. While some strategists focus on positioning candidates on issue after issue, I believe most voters focus more on whether the candidate integrity and character on the whole, demonstrated by the conviction to take a stand."&lt;ref name="periello" /&gt;

US politician Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], for example, frequently heard voters tell him, "I don't always agree with you, but I like it that I know where you stand." He found that when he announced his opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], an unpopular position at the time, he jumped to a five-point lead in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellstone.org/about-us/wellstone-legacy/articles/populism-organization-and-conviction|title=Populism, organization and conviction|date=4 May 2006|first=Jeff|website=www.wellstone.org|publisher=Wellstone Action!|last=Blodgett|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107105127/http://www.wellstone.org/about-us/wellstone-legacy/articles/populism-organization-and-conviction|archivedate=7 January 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, 87% of voters in one poll said they think politicians are "pretty much willing to say whatever it takes in order to get themselves elected."&lt;ref&gt;Shorenstein Center Poll, March 2000. USSHOREN.031300.R15&lt;/ref&gt; By saying what they believe and ignoring the polls, conviction politicians distinguish themselves from other politicians.

==History==
[[File:Thatcher - Reagan c872-9.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Thatcher with close ally and friend, [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], 1981]]

Thatcher, like her contemporary [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, argued that her leadership should be a time for big, bold changes, grounded in the central principles of her ideology. "It was not a set of policies cobbled together from minute to minute, begged, borrowed or stolen from other people," she said while describing her government. "It was successful because it was based on clear, firmly-held principles."&lt;ref name="thatcher2"&gt;{{cite book

We are told we must work and use our talents to create wealth."&lt;ref name="Thatcher1988"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1988thatcher.html|title=Margaret Thatcher: Christianity and Wealth|publisher=Modern History Sourcebook|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her thinking on the subject was influenced by [[Keith Joseph]], sometimes considered the "intellectual leader"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDe9IiwPm4EC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22conviction+politics%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5i8GScmoOZKUM4C36OoK&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA7,M1 |title=Thatcher and Thatcherism |author= Eric J. Evans  |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of modern British conservatism and the man Thatcher called "my closest political friend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/prof_keithjoseph.html |title=Commanding Heights|author= Keith Joseph  |publisher=PBS.org |date=1979-03-28 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph had developed an intellectual critique of the reigning postwar and Keynesian consensus and criticized the "consensus politics" that continued to promote it.

In 2007, the British Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]] announced he too was "a conviction politician" after private talks with Thatcher in a [[10 Downing Street]] visit. He was criticised for the gaffe as being inappropriate for a Labour Party politician to identify with the 81-year-old former Conservative prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6993269.stm|title=Brown welcomes Thatcher to No 10|date=13 September 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] was a major proponent of conviction politics from the left, promoting peace, environmental and labor protections, and health care. After Wellstone's death in 2002, his longtime aide and campaign manager, [[Jeff Blodgett]], founded [[Wellstone Action]], which promotes conviction politics through education and training.

Virginia Representative [[Tom Perriello]] explicitly ran his successful campaign based on "conviction politics."&lt;ref name="periello"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2007/10/29/conviction_politics_in_practic/|title=Conviction Politics... in Practice|date=29 October 2007|first=Tom|last=Perriello|website=tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com|publisher=TPM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021073714/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2007/10/29/conviction_politics_in_practic/|archivedate=21 October 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The conviction politics practiced by [[George W. Bush]] has been called a "hard ideology" with "religious and chauvinistic underpinnings" and "contributed to the call by [[Muslim]] [[Muslim fundamentalists|fundamentalists]] to a broader [[jihad]]" that has "redefined the [[war on terror]] and alienated Arab and Muslim public opinion."&lt;ref name="conviction"&gt;{{cite book

The concept of cross-cutting cleavages is perhaps most heavily used in the field of [[Political Science]]. Cross-cutting cleavages were originally suggested as a mechanism for political stability, as no group can align all its members along a uniform cleavage-based platform, but rather has to appeal to members of the group that are spread throughout the groups created by other cleavages.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
The most in-depth discussion of this process is that by [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] in his 1960 book ''[[Political Man]]''.  

[[Stein Rokkan]] wrote a classic essay on crosscutting cleavages in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour Martin, and Stein Rokkan. 1967. "Cleavage Structures, Party Systems,and Voter Alignments."  In: Party Systems and Voter Alignments: Cross-National Perspectives, eds. Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan. New York: The Free Press
pp. 1–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein Rokkan, "Geography,Religion and Social Class: Cross Cutting Cleavages in Norwegian Politics," in S. M. Lipset and S. Rokkan, eds., Party Systems and Voter Alignments (New York, 1967), 368-369&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cross-cutting theory was applied to such topics as social order, political violence, voting behaviour, political organization and democratic stability, for example Truman's ''The Governmental Process'', Dahl's ''A Preface to Democratic Theory'', among others.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  Around the same{{which|date=July 2017}} time, several scholars (including Lipset himself) suggested ways to measure the concept, the best-known being Rae and Taylor's in their 1970 book ''The Analysis of Political Cleavages''. Due to data limitations, these theories were generally left untested for a couple of decades.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

[[Diana Mutz]] revived the concept in the early 2000s, looking at political participation and democratic theory using survey data in the US and other Western European democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mutz |first=Diana C. |date=March 2002 |title=Cross-cutting Social Networks: Testing Democratic Theory in Practice |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/crosscutting-social-networks-testing-democratic-theory-in-practice/2E570E31F3BB84B723CEF2A48A3C6741 |journal=American Political Science Review |language=en |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=111–126 |doi=10.1017/S0003055402004264 |issn=1537-5943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mutz |first=Diana C. |date=2002 |title=The Consequences of Cross-Cutting Networks for Political Participation |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3088437 |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=838–855 |doi=10.2307/3088437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have written on how cross-cutting cleavages relates to ethnic voting,&lt;ref&gt;THAD DUNNING and LAUREN HARRISON [http://thaddunning.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CrossCutting_APSR-preprint.pdf Cross-cutting Cleavages and Ethnic Voting: An Experimental Study of Cousinage in Mali] American Political Science Review,Vol. 104, No. 1, February 2010, doi:10.1017/S0003055409990311&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil war]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshua R. Gubler, Joel Sawat Selway. Horizontal Inequality, Crosscutting Cleavages, and Civil War. Journal of Conflict Resolution. Volume 56, issue 2, pages 206-232, April 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnic censuses (Lieberman and Singh 2012) and economic growth (Selway 2011).{{cn|date=July 2017}}  

Selway (2011) suggested a new measure for crosscutting cleavages and published a crossnational dataset on crosscutting cleavages among several dimensions (ethnicity, class, geography and religion).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2017), in the ''American Economic Review'', derive and discuss several measures of cross-cuttingness and compute them using data on ethnic identity and cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg|first=|date=September 2017|title=Culture, Ethnicity and Diversity|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150243|journal=American Economic Review|volume=107|pages=2479-2513|via=American Economic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociologists have used the term, especially in the sub-field of Macro Sociology. Peter Blau's work is the most well-known.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Michael Blau and Joseph E. Schwartz, ''Crosscutting Social Circles: Testing a Macrostructural Theory of Intergroup Relations'' (Orlando, Fla.: Academic Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egyptian Arabic''', [[#Naming|locally known as]] the ''' Egyptian colloquial language''' or '''Masri''', meaning simply "Egyptian", is spoken by most contemporary [[Egyptians]].

Egyptian is a [[North African]] [[dialect]] of the [[Arabic language]] which is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language family]]. It originated in the [[Nile Delta]] in [[Lower Egypt]] around the capital [[Cairo]]. Egyptian Arabic evolved from the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic Arabic]] which was brought to [[Egypt]] during the seventh-century AD [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Muslim conquest]] that aimed to spread the [[Islam|Islamic faith]] among the Egyptians. Egyptian Arabic is very highly influenced by the [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic language]] which was the native language of the Egyptians prior to the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest]],&lt;ref&gt;Nishio, Tetsuo. "Word order and word order change of wh-questions in Egyptian Arabic: The Coptic substratum reconsidered". ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference of L'Association Internationale pour la Dialectologie Arabe''. Cambridge: [[University of Cambridge]]. 1996, pp. 171-179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bishai, Wilson B. "Coptic grammatical influence on Egyptian Arabic". Journal of the American Oriental Society. No.82, pp. 285-289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youssef (2003), below.&lt;/ref&gt; and later it had small influences by other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://raseef22.com/life/2016/10/25/13-لغة-أجنبيّة-تشكّل-العاميّة-المصريّة/|title=13 foreign languages within the Egyptian Arabic dialect}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[English language|English]]. The 94 million Egyptians speak a [[dialect continuum|continuum of dialects]], among which Cairene is the most prominent. It is also understood across most of the [[Arab World|Arabic-speaking countries]] due to the predominance of Egyptian influence on the region as well as Egyptian media including Egyptian cinema which has had a big influence in the [[MENA]] region for more than a century along with the [[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] industry, making it the most widely spoken and one of the most widely studied [[varieties of Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbsjournal.arabmediasociety.com/Archives/Fall05/Dick.html|title=TBS 15 The State of the Musalsal: Arab Television Drama and Comedy and the Politics of the Satellite Era by Marlin Dick|publisher=|access-date=2015-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002737/http://tbsjournal.arabmediasociety.com/Archives/Fall05/Dick.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is essentially a spoken language, it is encountered in written form in novels, plays, and poems ([[vernacular literature]]), as well as in comics, advertising, some newspapers, and transcriptions of popular songs.
In most other written media and in television news reporting, [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] is used. Literary Arabic is a standardized language based on the language of the [[Quran]], that is, [[Classical Arabic]]. The Egyptian [[vernacular]] is almost universally written in the [[Arabic alphabet]] for local consumption, although it is commonly transcribed into [[Latin letters]] or in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] in linguistics text and textbooks aimed at teaching non-native learners. Also, it is written in [[Arabic chat alphabet#Comparison table|ASCII Latin alphabet]] mainly online and in [[SMS]]s.

The term Egyptian Arabic is usually used synonymously with '''Cairene Arabic''', which is technically a dialect of Egyptian Arabic. The country's native name, ''Maṣr'', is often used locally to refer to Cairo itself. Like the role played by Parisian [[French language|French]], Cairene Arabic is by far the most dominant dialect in all areas of national life.

== Geographic distribution ==

The total number of Egyptian Arabic users in all countries is over 64.5 million, 62.3 million of which are native speakers in Egypt, including several regional dialects. In addition, there are immigrant Egyptian communities in the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Australia]] and [[South East Asia]]. Among the spoken [[varieties of Arabic]], standard Egyptian Arabic (based on the dialect of the Egyptian capital) is the only one to have become a [[lingua franca]] in other parts of the Arabic-speaking world for two main reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Haeri (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Siona. ''Egyptian Arabic Phrasebook''. [[Lonely Planet|Lonely Planet Publications]], 2001. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; the proliferation and popularity of Egyptian films and other media in the region since the early 20th century as well as the great number of Egyptian teachers and professors who were instrumental in setting up the education systems of various countries in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and also taught there and in other countries such as [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]]; although this is changing as [[Damascus Arabic]] is taking its rule in the media. Also, many Lebanese artists choose to sing in Egyptian and [[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese]]. Standard Egyptian Arabic when used in documents, broadcast media, prepared speeches, and sometimes in liturgical purpose, is Cairene Arabic with loanwords from Modern Standard Arabic origin or code-switching between Cairene Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.

== History ==
The [[Egyptians]] slowly adopted the Arabic as a [[written language]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in the seventh century. Until then, they had spoken either [[Koine Greek]] or [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] in its [[Coptic language|Coptic]] form. A period of Coptic-Arabic bilingualism in [[Lower Egypt]] lasted for more than three centuries. The period would last much longer in the south. Arabic may have been already familiar to Egyptians through pre-Islamic trade with [[Bedouin]]s in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the easternmost part of the [[Nile Delta]]. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in [[Fustat]], the first Islamic capital of Egypt, now part of [[Cairo]].

One of the earliest linguistic sketches of Egyptian Arabic is a 16th-century document entitled ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Dafʿ al-ʾiṣr ʿan kalām ahl Miṣr}}'' ({{lang|ar|دفع الإصر عن كلام أهل مصر}}, "The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Egypt") by [[Yusuf al-Maghribi]] ({{lang|ar|يوسف المغربي}}). It contains key information on early Egyptian Arabic and the language situation in [[Egypt in the Middle Ages]]. The main purpose of the document was to show that while the Egyptians' vernacular contained many critical "errors" vis-à-vis Classical Arabic, according to al-Maghribi, it was also related to Arabic in other respects. With the ongoing [[Islamization]] and [[Arabization]] of the country, Egyptian Arabic slowly supplanted spoken Coptic. Local chroniclers mention the continued use of Coptic as a spoken language until the 17th century by peasant women in [[Upper Egypt]]. Coptic is still the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

== Official status ==
Egyptian Arabic has no official status and is not officially recognized as a language. [[Modern Standard Arabic]], a modernized form of [[Classical Arabic]] (also called Qur'anic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see [[diglossia]]). Interest in the local [[vernacular]] began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national movement for [[self-determination]] was taking shape. For many decades to follow, questions about the reform and the modernization of Arabic were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing [[neologism]]s to replace archaic terminology in Modern Standard Arabic to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules and the introduction of [[colloquialism]]s to even complete "Egyptianization" (''tamṣīr'') by abandoning the so-called Modern Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.&lt;ref name="Gershoni"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gershoni, I., J. Jankowski. |title=Egypt, Islam, and the Arabs |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of language reform in Egypt included [[Qasim Amin]], who also wrote the first Egyptian feminist treatise, former President of the [[Cairo University|Egyptian University]], [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and noted intellectual [[Salama Moussa]]. They adopted a modernist, [[secular]] approach and disagreed with the assumption that Arabic was an immutable language because of its association with the [[Qur'an]]. The first modern Egyptian novel in which the dialogue was written in the vernacular was [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]]'s [[Zaynab (novel)|''Zaynab'']] in 1913. It was inly in 1966 that Mustafa Musharafa's ''Kantara Who Disbelieved'' was released, the first novel to be written entirely in Egyptian Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/18/62/50815/Books/Review/Book-Review-First-novel-written-in-colloquial-Arab.aspx|title=Book Review: First novel written in colloquial Arabic republished - Review - Books - Ahram Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable novelists, such as [[Ihsan Abdel Quddous]] and [[Yusuf Idris]], and poets, such as [[Salah Jahin]], [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]] and [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]], helped solidify vernacular literature as a distinct literary genre.&lt;ref name="Gershoni" /&gt;

Amongst certain groups within Egypt's elite, Egyptian Arabic enjoyed a brief period of rich literary output. That dwindled with the rise of Egyptian [[Arab nationalism]], which had gained wide popularity in Egypt by the final years of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], as demonstrated vividly by Egypt's involvement in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] under King [[Farouk of Egypt]]. The [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]], led by [[Mohammed Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], further enhanced the significance of Arab nationalism, making it a central element of Egyptian state policy. The importance of Modern Standard Arabic was reemphasised in the public sphere by the revolutionary government, and efforts to accord any formal language status to the Egyptian vernacular were ignored. Egyptian Arabic was identified as a mere dialect, one that was not spoken even in all of Egypt, as almost all of [[Upper Egypt]] speaks [[Sa'idi Arabic]]. Though the revolutionary government heavily sponsored the use of the Egyptian vernacular in films, plays, television programmes, and music, the prerevolutionary use of Modern Standard Arabic in official publications was retained.

Linguistic commentators have noted the multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt's first [[president of Egypt|president]], Mohammed Naguib exhibited a preference for using Modern Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] was renowned for using the vernacular and for punctuating his speeches with traditional Egyptian words and expressions. Conversely, Modern Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. That was especially true of Egypt's national broadcasting company, the [[ERTU|Arab Radio and Television Union]], which was established with the intent of providing content for the entire [[Arab world]], not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard, rather than the vernacular, language. The [[Voice of the Arabs]] radio station, in particular, had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Modern Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.

As the status of Egyptian Arabic as opposed to [[Classical Arabic]] can have such political and religious implications in Egypt, the question of whether Egyptian Arabic should be considered a [[Dialect#"Dialect" or "language"|"dialect" or "language"]] can be a source of debate. In [[sociolinguistics]], Egyptian Arabic can be seen as one of many distinct [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] that, despite arguably being languages on ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages|abstand]]'' grounds, are united by a common ''[[abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|dachsprache]]'' in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

== Publications ==
During the early 1900s many portions of the Bible were published in Egyptian Arabic.  These were published by the Nile Mission Press.  By 1932 the whole New Testament and some books of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Psalms and The Prophets) had been published in Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script.

== Spoken varieties ==
[[Sa'idi Arabic|Sa‘īdi Arabic]] is a separate variety from Egyptian Arabic in [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec Ethnologue.com] and [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=aec ISO 639-3] and in other sources,&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory&lt;br /&gt;William Bright, 1992, ''The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two varieties have limited [[mutual intelligibility]]. It carries little prestige nationally but continues to be widely spoken, with 19,000,000 speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec|title=Arabic, Sa'idi Spoken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in the north by rural migrants who have adapted partially to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the Sa‘īdi genitive exponent is usually replaced with Egyptian ''{{transl|arz|bitāʿ&amp;nbsp;}}'', but the realization of {{IPAslink|ʔ}} as {{IPAblink|ɡ}} is retained.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Second-and third-generation migrants are [[monolingual]] in Egyptian Arabic but maintain cultural and familial ties to the south.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The traditional division between [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] and their respective differences go back to ancient times. Egyptians today commonly call the people of the north '''{{transl|arz|baḥarwa}}''' ({{IPA|[bɑˈħɑɾwɑ]}}) and those of the south '''{{transl|arz|ṣaʿayda}}''' ({{IPA|[sˤɑˈʕɑjdɑ]}}). The differences throughout Egypt, however, are more wide-ranging and do not neatly correspond to the simple division. The language shifts from the eastern to the western parts of the [[Nile Delta]], and the varieties spoken from [[Giza]] to [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] are further grouped into a Middle Egypt cluster. Despite the differences, there are features distinguishing all the Egyptian Arabic varieties of the Nile Valley from any other varieties of Arabic. Such features include [[vowel reduction|reduction of long vowels]] in open and unstressed syllables, the postposition of demonstratives and interrogatives, the modal meaning of the imperfect and the integration of the participle.&lt;ref&gt;Versteegh, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Libyan Arabic|Western Egyptian Bedawi Arabic]] variety&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayl|title=Arabic, Libyan Spoken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the western desert differs from all other Arabic varieties in Egypt in that it linguistically is part of [[Maghrebi Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory&lt;/ref&gt; The same was formerly true of the Egyptian form of [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judaeo-Arabic]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Northwest Arabian Arabic]] is also distinct from Egyptian Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=avl|title=Arabic, Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Spoken|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
{{main|Egyptian Arabic phonology}}
Egyptian Arabic has a phonology that differs slightly from that of other varieties of Arabic and has its own inventory of consonants and vowels.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
In contrast to CA and MSA, nouns are not inflected for case and lack [[nunation]] (with the exception of certain fixed phrases in the accusative case, such as {{lang|ar|شكراً}} {{IPA|[ˈʃokɾɑn]}}, "thank you"). As all nouns take their [[pausal pronunciation|pausal]] forms, singular words and [[broken plural]]s simply lose their case endings. In sound plurals and dual forms, where, in MSA, difference in case is present even in pausal forms, the genitive/accusative form is the one preserved. Fixed expressions in the [[construct state]] beginning in ''abu'', often geographic names, retain their ''-u'' in all cases.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Behnstedt &amp; Woidich (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian Arabic object pronouns are [[clitic]]s, in that they attach to the end of a noun, verb or preposition, with the result forming a single phonological word rather than separate words.  Clitics can be attached to the following types of words:
*A clitic pronoun attached to a noun indicates possession: ''béet'' "house", ''béet-i'' "my house"; ''sikkíina'' "knife", ''sikkínt-i'' "my knife";  ''ʔább'' "father", ''ʔabúu-ya'' "my father".  Note that the form of a pronoun may vary depending on the phonological form of the word being attached to (ending with a vowel or with one or two consonants), and the noun being attached to may also have a separate "construct" form before possessive clitic suffixes.
*A clitic pronoun attached to a preposition indicates the object of the preposition: '''fill in examples'''
*A clitic pronoun attached to a verb indicates the object of the verb: ''ʃúft'' "I saw", ''ʃúft-u'' "I saw him", ''ʃuft-áha'' "I saw her".

With verbs, indirect object clitic pronouns can be formed using the preposition ''li-'' plus a clitic.  Both direct and indirect object clitic pronouns can be attached to a single verb: ''agíib'' "I bring", ''agíb-hu'' "I bring it", ''agib-húu-lik'' "I bring it to you", ''m-agib-hu-lkíi-ʃ'' "I do not bring it to you".

===Verbs===
Verbs in Arabic are based on a stem made up of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]].

Each particular [[lexical verb]] is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses along with as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender, while to the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the "dictionary form" used to identify a verb, similar to the [[infinitive]] in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning "write" is often specified as ''kátab'', which actually means "he wrote".  In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as ''kátab/yíktib'' (where ''kátab'' means "he wrote" and ''yíktib'' means "he writes"), indicating the past stem (''katab-'') and non-past stem (''-ktib-'', obtained by removing the prefix ''yi-'').

The verb classes in Arabic are formed along two axes.  One axis (described as "form I", "form II", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], and involves varying the stem form.  For example, from the root K-T-B "write" is derived form I '''kátab/yíktib''' "write", form II '''káttib/yikáttib''' "cause to write", form III '''ká:tib/yiká:tib''' "correspond", etc.  The other axis is determined by the particular consonants making up the root.  For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. '''ráma/yírmi''' "throw" from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. '''gá:b/yigí:b''' "bring" from G-Y-B).

==== Strong verbs ====
Strong verbs are those that have no "weakness" (e.g. W or Y) in the root consonants.
Each verb has a given vowel pattern for Past (a or i) and Present (a or i or u). Combinations of each exist.

=====Regular verbs, form I=====

Form I verbs have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' or '''i''') and present ('''a''', '''i''' or '''u'''). Combinations of each exist:

Note that, in general, the present indicative is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of ''bi-'' (''bi-a-'' is elided to ''ba-'').  Similarly, the future is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of ''ḥa-'' (''ḥa-a-'' is elided to ''ḥa-'').  The ''i'' in ''bi-'' or in the following prefix will be deleted according to the regular rules of vowel syncope:
*'''híyya b-tíktib''' "she writes" ('''híyya''' + '''bi-''' + '''tíktib''')
*'''híyya bi-t-ʃú:f''' "she sees" ('''híyya''' + '''bi-''' + '''tiʃú:f''')
*'''an-áktib''' "I write (subjunctive)" ('''ána''' + '''áktib''')

Boldfaced forms indicate the primary differences from the corresponding forms of '''katab''':
*The prefixes ''ti-'', ''yi-'', ''ni-'' have elision of ''i'' following ''bi-'' or ''ḥa-'' (all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant behave this way).
*The imperative prefix ''i-'' is missing (again, all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant behave this way).
*Due to the regular operation of the stress rules, the stress in the past tense forms '''''darrís-it''''' and '''''darrís-u''''' differs from '''''kátab-it''''' and '''''kátab-u'''''.

The primary differences from the corresponding forms of '''darris''' (shown in boldface) are:

*In the non-past, the stem '''rmi''' becomes '''rm-''' before a (vowel initial) suffix, and the stress remains on the prefix, since the stem vowel has been elided.
*Note also the accidental homonymy between masculine '''tí-rmi, í-rmi''' and feminine '''tí-rm-i, í-rm-i'''.

This verb type is quite similar to the defective verb type '''ráma/yírmi'''.  The primary differences are:
*The occurrence of ''i'' and ''a'' in the stems are reversed: ''i'' in the past, ''a'' in the non-past.
*In the past, instead of the stems '''ramé:-''' and '''rám-''', the verb has '''nisí:-''' (with a consonant-initial suffix) and '''nísy-''' (with a vowel initial suffix).  Note in particular the |y| in '''nísyit''' and '''nísyu''' as opposed to '''rámit''' and '''rámu'''.
*Elision of ''i'' in '''nisí:-''' can occur, e.g. '''ána nsí:t''' "I forgot".
*In the non-past, because the stem has ''a'' instead of ''i'', there is no homonymy between masculine '''tí-nsa, í-nsa''' and feminine '''tí-ns-i, í-ns-i'''.

Note that some other verbs have different stem variations, e.g. '''míʃi/yímʃi''' "walk" (with ''i'' in both stems) and '''báʔa/yíbʔa''' "become, remain" (with ''a'' in both stems).  The verb '''láʔa/yilá:ʔi''' "find" is unusual in having a mixture of a form I past and form III present (note also the variations '''líʔi/yílʔa''' and '''láʔa/yílʔa''').

Verbs other than form I have consistent stem vowels.  All such verbs have ''a'' in the past (hence form stems with ''-é:-'', not ''-í:-'').  Forms V, VI, X and IIq have ''a'' in the present (indicated by boldface below); others have ''i''; forms VII, VIIt, and VIII have ''i'' in both vowels of the stem (indicated by italics below); form IX verbs, including "defective" verbs, behave as regular doubled verbs:
* Form II: '''wádda/yiwáddi''' "take away"; '''ʔáwwa/yiʔáwwi''' "strengthen"
* Form III: '''ná:da/yiná:di''' "call"; '''dá:wa/yidá:wi''' "treat, cure"
* Form IV (rare, classicized): '''ʔárḍa/yírḍi "please, satisfy"
* '''Form V''': '''itʔáwwa/yitʔáwwa''' "become strong"
* '''Form VI''': '''itdá:wa/yitdá:wa''' "be treated, be cured"
* ''Form VII'' (rare in the Cairene dialect): '''inḥáka/yinḥíki''' "be told"
* ''Form VIIt'': '''itnása/yitnísi''' "be forgotten"
* ''Form VIII'': '''iʃtára/yiʃtíri''' "buy"
* '''Form IX''' (very rare): '''iḥláww/yiḥláww''' "be/become sweet"
* '''Form X''': '''istákfa/yistákfa''' "have enough"
* Form Iq: ''need example''
* '''Form IIq''': ''need example''

==== Hollow verbs ====
Hollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant.  Note that for some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II ''ʕáyyin/yiʕáyyin'' "appoint" from ʕ-Y-N, form III ''gá:wib/yigá:wib'' "answer" from G-W-B).

This verb works much like '''dárris/yidárris''' "teach".  Like all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant, the prefixes differ in the following way from those of regular and defective form I verbs:
*The prefixes ''ti-'', ''yi-'', ''ni-'' have elision of ''i'' following ''bi-'' or ''ḥa-''.
*The imperative prefix ''i-'' is missing.

In addition, the past tense has two stems: '''gíb-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''gá:b-''' elsewhere (third person).

This verb class is identical to verbs such as '''gá:b/yigí:b''' except in having stem vowel ''u'' in place of ''i''.

==== Doubled verbs ====

Doubled verbs have the same consonant as middle and last root consonant, e.g. '''ḥább/yiḥíbb''' "love" from Ḥ-B-B.

===== Doubled verb, form I, fáʕʕ/yifíʕʕ =====

Example: '''ḥább/yiḥíbb''' "love"

This verb works much like '''gá:b/yigí:b''' "bring".  Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are '''ḥabbé:-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''ḥább-''' elsewhere (third person).  Note that ''é:-'' was borrowed from the defective verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *'''ḥabáb-''', e.g. *'''ḥabáb-t'''.

Other verbs have ''u'' or ''a'' in the present stem: '''baṣṣ/yibúṣṣ''' "to look", '''ṣaḥḥ/yiṣáḥḥ''' "be right, be proper".

As for the other forms:
*Form II, V doubled verbs are strong: '''ḥáddid/yiḥáddid''' "limit, fix (appointment)"
*Form III, IV, VI, VIII doubled verbs seem non-existent
*Form VII and VIIt doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''inbáll/yinbáll''' "be wetted", '''itʕádd/yitʕádd'''
*Form VIII doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''ihtámm/yihtámm''' "be interested (in)"
*Form IX verbs (automatically behave as "doubled" verbs, same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''iḥmárr/yiḥmárr''' "be red, blush", '''iḥláww/yiḥláww''' "be sweet"
*Form X verbs '''''(stem vowel either ''a'' or ''i'' in non-past)''''': '''istaḥáʔʔ/yistaḥáʔʔ''' "deserve" vs. '''istaʕádd/yistaʕídd''' "be ready", '''istamárr/yistamírr''' "continue".

==== Assimilated verbs ====

Assimilated verbs have W or Y as the first root consonant.  Most of these verbs have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. '''wázan/yíwzin''' "to weigh" or '''wíṣíl/yíwṣal''' "to arrive".  Only a couple of irregular verbs remain, e.g. '''wíʔif/yúʔaf''' "stop" and '''wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ''' "fall" (see below).

==== Doubly weak verbs ====

"Doubly weak" verbs have more than one "weakness", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants.  This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal defective verbs (e.g. '''káwa/yíkwi''' "iron (clothes)" from K-W-Y, '''ʔáwwa/yiʔáwwi''' "strengthen" from ʔ-W-Y, '''dá:wa/yidá:wi''' "treat, cure" from D-W-Y).

==== Irregular verbs ====

The irregular verbs are as follows:

*'''ídda/yíddi''' "give" (endings like a normal defective verb)
*'''wíʔif/yúʔaf''' "stop" and '''wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ''' "fall" (''áʔaf, báʔaf, ḥáʔaf'' "I (will) stop"; úʔaf "stop!")
*'''kal/yá:kul''' "eat" and '''xad/yá:xud''' "take" (''kalt, kal, kálit, kálu'' "I/he/she/they ate", also regular ''ákal, etc.'' "he/etc. ate"; ''á:kul, bá:kul, ḥá:kul'' "I (will) eat", ''yáklu'' "they eat"; ''kúl, kúli, kúlu'' "eat!"; ''wá:kil'' "eating"; ''mittá:kil'' "eaten")
*'''gé/yí:gi''' "come".  This verb is extremely irregular (with particularly unusual forms in boldface):

==== Table of verb forms ====

In this section all verb classes and their corresponding stems are listed, excluding the small number of irregular verbs described above.  Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:
*F = first consonant of root
*M = middle consonant of three-consonant root
*S = second consonant of four-consonant root
*T = third consonant of four-consonant root
*L = last consonant of root
Hence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-ʕ-L and F-ʕ-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers, since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving ''ʕ''.)

The following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number and gender, and the stem form to which they are added.  The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix, and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NP&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, are highlighted in silver.  The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix, and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, are highlighted in gold.  The forms involving a no suffix, and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NP&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, are unhighlighted.

|}

The following table lists the verb classes along with the form of the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun, in addition to an example verb for each class.

Notes:
*Italicized forms are those that follow automatically from the regular rules of vowel shortening and deletion.
*Multisyllabic forms without a stress mark have variable stress, depending on the nature of the suffix added, following the regular rules of stress assignment.
*Many participles and verbal nouns have acquired an extended sense.  In fact, participles and verbal nouns are the major sources for lexical items based on verbs, especially derived (i.e. non-Form-I) verbs.
*Some verb classes do not have a regular verbal noun form; rather, the verbal noun varies from verb to verb.  Even in verb classes that do have a regular verbal noun form, there are exceptions.  In addition, some verbs share a verbal noun with a related verb from another class (in particular, many passive verbs use the corresponding active verb's verbal noun, which can be interpreted in either an active or passive sense).  Some verbs appear to lack a verbal noun entirely. (In such a case, a paraphrase would be used involving a clause beginning with ''inn''.)
*Outside of Form I, passive participles as such are usually non-existent; instead, the active participle of the corresponding passive verb class (e.g. Forms V, VI, VIIt/VIIn for Forms II, III, I respectively) is used.  The exception is certain verbs in Forms VIII and X that contain a "classicized" passive participle that is formed in imitation of the corresponding participle in [[Classical Arabic]], e.g. ''mistáʕmil'' "using", ''mustáʕmal'' "used".
*Not all forms have a separate verb class for hollow or doubled roots.  When no such class is listed below, roots of that shape appear as strong verbs in the corresponding form, e.g. Form II strong verb ''ḍáyyaʕ/yiḍáyyaʕ'' "waste, lose" related to Form I hollow verb ''ḍá:ʕ/yiḍí:ʕ'' "be lost", both from root Ḍ-Y-ʕ.

=== Negation ===
{{main|Negation in Arabic}}
One characteristic of Egyptian syntax which it shares with other North African varieties as well as some southern Levantine dialect areas is in the two-part negative verbal circumfix {{IPA|/ma-...-ʃ(i)/}}

* Past: {{IPA|/ˈkatab/}} "he wrote" {{IPA|/ma-katab-ʃ(i)/}} "he didn't write" ما كتبشِ
* Present: {{IPA|/ˈjik-tib/}} "he writes" {{IPA|/ma-bjik-tib-ʃ(i)/}} "he doesn't write" ما بيكتبشِ

{{IPA|/ma-/}} comes from the Classical Arabic negator {{IPA|/maː/}}.  {{IPA|/-ʃ(i)/}} is a development of Classical {{IPA|/ʃajʔ/}} "thing".  This negating [[circumfix]] is similar in function to the [[French language|French]] circumfix ''ne ... pas''.

The structure can end in a consonant {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or in a vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, varying according to the individual or region. The fuller ending {{IPA|/ʃi/}} is considered rural, and nowadays [[Cairo|Cairene]] speakers usually use the shorter {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. However, {{IPA|/ʃi/}} was more common in the past, as attested in [[Egyptian films of the 1940s|old films]].

The negative circumfix often surrounds the entire verbal composite including direct and indirect object pronouns:
* {{IPA|/ma-katab-hum-ˈliː-ʃ/}}  "he didn't write them to me"
However, verbs in the future tense typically instead use the prefix /miʃ/:
* {{IPA|/miʃ-ħa-ˈjiktib/}} (or {{IPA|/ma-ħa-jikˈtibʃ/}}  "he won't write"
Interrogative sentences can be formed by adding the negation [[clitic]] "(miʃ)" before the verb:
* Past: {{IPA|/ˈkatab/}} "he wrote"; {{IPA|/miʃ-ˈkatab/}} "didn't he write?"
* Present: {{IPA|/ˈjiktib/}} "he writes"; {{IPA|/miʃ-bi-ˈjiktib/}} "doesn't he write?"
* Future: {{IPA|/ħa-ˈjiktib/}} "he will write"; {{IPA|/miʃ-ħa-ˈjiktib/}} "won't he write?"
Addition of the circumfix can cause complex changes to the verbal cluster, due to the application of the rules of vowel syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion and elision described above:
* The addition of /ma-/ may trigger elision or syncope:
**A vowel following /ma-/ is elided: (ixtáːr) "he chose" → ({{IPA|maxtárʃ}}).
**A short vowel /i/ or /u/ in the first syllable may be deleted by syncope: (kíbir) "he grew" → (makbírʃ).
* The addition of {{IPA|/-ʃ/}} may result in vowel shortening or epenthesis:
** A final long vowel preceding a single consonant shortens: (ixtáːr) "he chose" → (maxtárʃ).
** An unstressed epenthetic /i/ is inserted when the verbal complex ends in two consonants: /kunt/ "I was" → (makúntiʃ).
* In addition, the addition of {{IPA|/-ʃ/}} triggers a stress shift, which may in turn result in vowel shortening or lengthening:
** The stress shifts to the syllable preceding {{IPA|/ʃ/}}: (kátab) "he wrote" → (makatábʃ).
** A long vowel in the previously stressed syllable shortens: (ʃáːfit) "she saw" → (maʃafítʃ); (ʃá:fu) "they saw" ''or'' "he saw it" → (maʃafú:ʃ).
** A final short vowel directly preceding {{IPA|/ʃ/}} lengthens: (ʃáːfu) "they saw" ''or'' "he saw it" → (maʃafú:ʃ).

In addition, certain other morphological changes occur:
* (ʃafúː) "they saw him" → (maʃafuhúːʃ) (to avoid a clash with (maʃafúːʃ) "they didn't see/he didn't see him").
* (ʃáːfik) "He saw you (fem. sg.)" → (maʃafkíːʃ).
* (ʃúftik) "I saw you (fem. sg.)" → (maʃuftikíːʃ).

== Syntax ==
In contrast with Classical Arabic, but much like the other [[varieties of Arabic]], Egyptian Arabic prefers [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) [[word order]]; CA and to a lesser extent MSA prefer [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO). For example, in MSA "Adel read the book" would be {{lang|ar|قرأَ عادل الكتاب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qaraʾa ʿĀdilu l-kitāb}}'' &lt;!--MSA as pronounced by Egyptians:--&gt;{{IPA-ar|ˈqɑɾɑʔɑ ˈʕæːdel ol keˈtæːb|IPA}} whereas EA would say {{lang|arz|عادل قرا الكتاب}} ''{{transl|arz|ʕādil ʔara l-kitāb}}'' {{IPA-arz|ˈʕæːdel ˈʔɑɾɑ lkeˈtæːb|IPA}}.

Also in common with other Arabic varieties is the loss of unique [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in the dual form: while the dual remains productive to some degree in nouns, dual nouns are analyzed as plural for the purpose of agreement with verbs, demonstratives, and adjectives. Thus "These two Syrian professors are walking to the university" in MSA (in an SVO sentence for ease of comparison) would be "{{lang|ar|هذان الأستاذان السوريان يمشيان إلى الجامعة}}" ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Haḏān al-ʾustāḏān as-Sūriyyān yamšiyān ʾilā l-ǧāmiʿah}}'' &lt;!--MSA as pronounced by Egyptians:--&gt;{{IPA-ar|hæːˈzæːn æl ʔostæːˈzæːn as suːrejˈjæːn jæmʃeˈjæːn ˈʔelæ lɡæːˈmeʕæ|IPA}}, which becomes in EA "{{lang|arz|الأستاذين السوريين دول بيمشو للجامعة}}" ''{{transl|arz|il-ʔustazēn il-Suriyyīn dōl biyimʃu lil-gamʕa}},'' {{IPA-arz|el ʔostæˈzeːn el soɾejˈjiːn ˈdoːl beˈjemʃo lelˈɡæmʕæ|IPA}}.

Unlike most other forms of Arabic, however, Egyptian prefers final placement of [[question word]]s in interrogative sentences. This is a feature characteristic of the [[#Coptic substratum|Coptic substratum of Egyptian Arabic]].

== Coptic substratum ==
Egyptian Arabic appears to have retained a significant [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] in its [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]]. Coptic is the latest stage of the indigenous [[Egyptian language]] spoken until the mid-17th century when it was finally completely supplanted among Egyptian Muslims and a majority of Copts by the Egyptian Arabic. Some features that Egyptian Arabic shares with the original ancient Egyptian language include certain prefix and suffix verbal conjugations, certain emphatic and glottalized consonants, as well as a large number of biliteral and triliteral lexical correspondences.

Two syntactic features that are particular{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}{{dubious|date=April 2015}} to Egyptian Arabic inherited from Coptic&lt;ref&gt;Nishio, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* postposed demonstratives "this" and "that" are placed ''after'' the noun.
:Examples: {{IPA|/ir-rˤaːɡil da/}} "this man" (lit. "the man this"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/haːðaː r-raɡul/}}) and {{IPA|/il-bitt di/}} "this girl" (lit. "the girl this"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/haːðihi l-bint/}}).

* [[interrogative word|''Wh'' words]] (i.e. "who", "when", "why" [[wh-in-situ|remain]] in their "logical" positions in a sentence rather than being preposed, or moved to the front of the sentence, as in Literary Arabic or English).
:Examples:
** {{IPA|/rˤaːħ masˤrI ʔimta/}} ({{lang|arz|راح مصر إمتا؟}}) "When ({{IPA|/ʔimta/}}) did he go to Egypt/Cairo?" (lit. "He went to Egypt/Cairo when?")
** {{IPA|/rˤaːħ masˤrI leːh/}} ({{lang|arz|راح مصر ليه؟}}) "Why ({{IPA|/leːh/}}) did he go to Egypt/Cairo? (lit. "He went to Egypt/Cairo why?")
** {{IPA|/miːn rˤaːħ masˤr/}} or {{IPA|/miːn illi rˤaːħ masˤr/}} ({{lang|arz|مين [اللى] راح مصر؟}}) "Who ({{IPA|/miːn/}}) went to Egypt/Cairo? (literally - same order)
:The same sentences in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (with all the question words (''wh''-words) in the beginning of the sentence) would be:
** {{lang|ar|متى ذهب إلى مصر؟}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|/mataː ðahaba ʔilaː misˤr/}}
** {{lang|ar|لِمَ ذهب إلى مصر؟}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|/lima ðahaba ʔilaː misˤr/}}
** {{lang|ar|من ذهب إلى مصر؟}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA|/man ðahaba ʔilaː misˤr/}}

Also since Coptic, like other North African languages, lacked [[interdental consonant]]s it could possibly have influenced the manifestation of their occurrences in [[Classical Arabic]] {{IPAslink|θ}} {{IPAslink|ð}} {{IPAslink|ðˤ}} as their dental counterparts {{IPAslink|t}} {{IPAslink|d}} and the emphatic dental {{IPAslink|dˤ}} respectively. (see [[Egyptian Arabic phonology#Consonants|consonants]])

==Sociolinguistic features==
Egyptian Arabic is used in most social situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic generally being used only in writing and in highly-religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, there is a wide range of variation. [[El-Said Badawi]] identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: ''ʿĀmmiyyat al-Musaqqafīn'' (Cultured Colloquial or [[Formal Spoken Arabic]]), ''ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn'' (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and ''ʿĀmmiyyat al-'Ummiyīn'' (Illiterate Colloquial).&lt;ref name="Badawi Hinds Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Badawi|first1=El-Said|last2=Hinds|first2=Martin|authorlink1=El-Said Badawi|authorlink2=Martin Hinds|title=A Dictionary of Egyptian Arabic|date=1986|publisher=Libraire du Liban|isbn=9781853410031|pages=VII–X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is still Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA and closer attention to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly ''[[ق|qāf]]''). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, it is understood fairly well across the Arab world.&lt;ref name="Badawi Hinds Dictionary" /&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost-exclusively Arabic vocabulary; the few loanwords generally are very old borrowings (e.g. {{lang|arz|جمبرى}} ''{{transl|arz|gambari}}'', {{IPA|[ɡæmˈbæɾi]}} "[[shrimp]]," from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gamberi'', "shrimp" (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. {{lang|arz|تلفزيون}} ''{{transl|arz|tel(e)vezyōn/tel(e)fezyōn}}'' {{IPA|[tel(e)vezˈjoːn, tel(e)fezˈjoːn]}}, [[television]]).&lt;ref name="Badawi Hinds Dictionary" /&gt; Enlightened Colloquial (''ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn'') is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to items of popular culture, consumer products and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Egyptian cinema]] and television.&lt;ref name="Badawi Hinds Dictionary" /&gt;

In contrast to MSA and most other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic has a form of the [[T-V distinction]]. In the singular, {{lang|arz|انت}} ''enta''/''enti'' is acceptable in most situations, but to address clear social superiors (e.g. older persons, superiors at work, certain government officials), the form {{lang|arz|حضرتك}} ''{{transl|arz|ḥaḍretak/ḥaḍretek}}'', meaning "Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]" is preferred (compare [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[Spanish pronouns#The use of vusted and vuestra merced|usted]]'').

This use of ''{{transl|arz|ḥaḍretak/ḥaḍretek}}'' is linked to the system of [[honorifics]] in daily Egyptian speech. The honorific taken by a given person is determined by their relationship to the speaker and their occupation.

==Regional variation==
Egyptian Arabic varies regionally across its ''sprachraum'', with certain characteristics being noted as typical of the speech of certain regions.

===Alexandria===
The dialect of [[Alexandria]] (West Delta]) is noted for certain [[shibboleth]]s separating its speech from that of Cairo (South Delta). The ones that are most frequently noted in popular discourse are the use of the word ''[[falafel]]'' as opposed to ''ṭa`meyya'' for the fava-bean fritters common across the country and the pronunciation of the word for the [[Egyptian pound]] as {{IPA-arz|ˈɡeni|}}, rather than the Cairene {{IPA-arz|ɡeˈneː|}} (closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]). The speech of the older Alexandrian families is also noted for use of the first-person plural even when they speak in the singular.

===Port Said===
[[Port Said]]'s dialect (East Delta) is noted for a "heavier", more guttural sound, compared to other regions of the country.

== Study ==
Egyptian Arabic has been a subject of study by scholars and laypersons in the past and the present for many reasons, including personal interest, [[egyptomania]], business, news reporting and diplomatic and political interactions. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is now a field of study in both graduate and undergraduate levels in many higher education institutions and universities in the world. When added to academic instruction, Arabic
-language schools and university programs provide Egyptian Arabic courses in a classroom fashion, and others facilitate classes for online study.

'''Elsie Gunborg Johansson''' (born May 1, 1931 in [[Uppland]], Sweden) is a Swedish writer. She is sometimes considered a [[Proletarian literature|proletarian writer]].

== Biography ==
Elsie Johansson was born in [[Vendel]] as the fifth child of a ''[[statare]]''. Her father would later find work as a lumberjack and construction worker. The Johansson family lived under sparse circumstances in a simple cabin, which would later serve as inspiration for similar housings found in Johansson's novels. Owing to the persuasion of a female teacher, Johansson was allowed to attend ''[[realskola]]'' in [[Uppsala]], from which she graduated in 1948; upon graduation, she found employment as a postal worker. She married at the age of 18, and had a child at 19.

Johansson would work at the post office for another 30 years, before making her literary debut with the poetry collection ''Brorsan hade en vevgrammofon'', at the age of 48. Her first novel, ''Kvinnan som mötte en hund'', followed in 1984. In addition to her poems and novels intended for adult readers, she has written a number of books for children and adolescents.

Her breakthrough as a writer came with the ''Nancy'' trilogy (''Glasfåglarna'', ''Mosippan'' and ''Nancy''), which earned her several awards, amongst others the [[Aniara Prize]]. Johansson also received the [[Litteris et Artibus]] award.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known simply as an '''emote''', is a pictorial representation of a [[facial expression]] using [[Character (symbol)|characters]]—usually [[punctuation mark]]s, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood, or as a time-saving method. The first ASCII emoticons, &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt;, were written by [[Scott Fahlman]] in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO IV]] computer system in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from [[Japan]] popularized a kind of emoticon called '''kaomoji''' ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]]; lit. 顔(kao)=face, 文字(moji)=character(s)) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.&lt;ref name="aist"&gt;{{cite web

As [[SMS]] and the [[internet]] became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages, [[internet forum]]s and [[e-mail]]s. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of "tone" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Origin of the term ==
The word is a [[portmanteau]] word of the [[English language|English]] words "emotion" and "icon". In [[web forum]]s, [[instant messaging|instant messengers]] and [[online game]]s, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called "emoticons" as well. Emoticons for a smiley face &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; and sad face &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in double-byte languages, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].

The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Antecedents ===
The ''National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide'' in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in [[Morse code]] to express "love and kisses" (later reduced to the more formal "best regards"). ''Dodge's Manual'' in 1908 documented the reintroduction of "love and kisses" as the number 88. Gajadhar and Green comment that both [[Morse code abbreviations]] are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as [[LOL (Internet slang)|LOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A ''[[New York Times]]'' transcript of an [[Abraham Lincoln]] speech written in 1862 contains "&lt;code&gt;(applause and laughter ;)&lt;/code&gt;"; there is some debate whether it is a [[typo]], a legitimate punctuation construct, or an emoticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Four vertical typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', with the stated intention that the publication's letterpress department thus intended to "lay out [...] all the cartoonists that ever walked".

In 1912, [[Ambrose Bierce]] proposed "an improvement in punctuation&amp;nbsp;– the snigger point, or note of [[wikt:cachinnation|cachinnation]]: it is written thus&amp;nbsp;‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a 1936 ''[[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]]'' article, Alan Gregg proposed (-) for smile, (--) for laugh (more teeth showing), (#) for frown, (*) for wink, and (#) for "intense interest, attention, and incredulity".&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways.

Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi [[fandom]] in the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Benford, "A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com", ''The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction'', Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.

The September 1962 issue of [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] included an article titled "Typewri-toons". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to "Royal Portable", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h "raising its hand".&lt;ref&gt;MAD Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional "Typewri-toons" articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.

In 1963, the "[[smiley]] face", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist [[Harvey Ball]]. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: "How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?" Nabokov answered: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&amp;nbsp;– some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2001, [[Walmart]] opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990. The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was "readily distinguishable" from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.&lt;ref name=serious /&gt;&lt;ref name=back&gt;{{cite web

Starting circa 1972, on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system, emoticons and other decorative graphics were produced as [[ASCII art]], particularly with [[ASCII art#Overprinting (surprint)|overprinting]]: typing a character, backing up, then typing another character. For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces (where the overprinted characters produced the solid background, and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design). This developed into a sophisticated set, particularly in combination with superscript and subscript.&lt;ref name="PLATO"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.

== Western style ==
Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by nose and the mouth. The two character version &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; which omits the nose is also very popular.

=== Common Western examples ===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Less than three]] --&gt;
{{Main|List of emoticons}}The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, &lt;code&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt; equals sad and &lt;code&gt;:((&lt;/code&gt; equals very sad. Weeping can be written as &lt;code&gt;:'(&lt;/code&gt;. A blush can be expressed as &lt;code&gt;:"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Others include wink &lt;code&gt;;)&lt;/code&gt;, a grin &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt;, smug &lt;code&gt;:-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and tongue out &lt;code&gt;:P&lt;/code&gt;, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also &lt;code&gt;&lt;3&lt;/code&gt; for a heart, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;/3&lt;/code&gt; for a broken heart. &lt;code&gt;:O&lt;/code&gt; is also sometimes used to depict shock.

A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; &lt;code&gt;XD&lt;/code&gt; and the addition of further "D" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. &lt;code&gt;XDDDD&lt;/code&gt;. There are hundreds of other variations including &lt;code&gt;&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt; for anger, or &lt;code&gt;&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt; for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of &lt;code&gt;D:&lt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;=K&lt;/code&gt; for vampire teeth, &lt;code&gt;:s&lt;/code&gt; for grimace, and &lt;code&gt;;P&lt;/code&gt; can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a [[double entendre|second meaning]] in the sentence preceding it.&lt;ref&gt;Dresner &amp; Herring (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

As computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The '[[shrug]]' emoticon, &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;, uses the glyph [[ツ]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.

=== Variation ===
{{Main|ASCII art}}

An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an "o" as in &lt;code&gt;=O)&lt;/code&gt; . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:^)&lt;/code&gt;. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age.{{how|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; are placed right beside each other. However, the &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; version a rarity. [[Diacritic]]al marks are sometimes used. The letters &lt;code&gt;Ö&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ü&lt;/code&gt; can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of &lt;code&gt;:O&lt;/code&gt; (meaning that one is surprised) and &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt; (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.

Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example &lt;code&gt;D:&lt;/code&gt; which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt;.

== {{Anchor|East Asian style|Asian style}}Japanese style ("Kaomojis") ==
[[File:It's all about the smilies (3578588882).jpg|thumb|200px|Kaomojis on a Japanese NTT Docomo mobile phone]]
[[File:Kaomoji! (2334722446).jpg|thumb|200px|A Kaomoji painting in Japan]]
Users from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]], ''kaomoji, lit.'' "face characters") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on [[ASCII Corporation#History|ASCII NET]], an early Japanese online service, in 1986.&lt;ref name="aist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whatjapanthinks2007" /&gt; Similar-looking emoticons were used on the [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to &lt;code&gt;(*_*)&lt;/code&gt;. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.

Different emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, "T" can be used to express crying or sadness: &lt;code&gt;(T_T)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;T_T&lt;/code&gt; may also be used to mean "unimpressed".  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;.  Looks of stress are represented by the likes of &lt;code&gt;(x_x)&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;(-_-;)&lt;/code&gt; is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced [[sweat drop]] (discussed further below).  &lt;code&gt;///&lt;/code&gt; can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(^.^)&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(^^)&lt;/code&gt;.

Parentheses are sometimes replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]] or [[Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]], e.g. &lt;code&gt;{^_^}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[o_0]&lt;/code&gt;. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt; &gt;.&lt; &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;o_O&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;O.O&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e_e&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;e.e&lt;/code&gt;. A quotation mark &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;, apostrophe &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;, or semicolon &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in [[manga]] and [[anime]].

Microsoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.

Communication software allowing the use of [[Shift JIS]] encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as &lt;code&gt;(^ム^)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(益)&lt;/code&gt;.

Modern communication software generally utilizes [[Unicode]], which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in &lt;code&gt;(`Д´)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(◕‿◕✿)&lt;/code&gt;.

Further variations can be produced using Unicode [[combining character]]s, as in &lt;code&gt;٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt; ᶘᵒᴥᵒᶅ&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Western use of Japanese style ===
English-language [[anime]] forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in English{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;(&amp;nbsp;^.^&amp;nbsp;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(^_^&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(o_o&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(&amp;nbsp;-'.'-&amp;nbsp;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;('.'-^)&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;(&gt;';..;')&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs &lt; or &gt;) also are often referred to as "{{not a typo|Kirbys}}" in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]].  The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]] for the emoticon in question, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^_________^&lt;/code&gt; for very happy. The emoticon {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;t(-_-t)&lt;/code&gt;}} uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [[The finger|"middle-finger flick-off"]] using a "t" as the arm, hand, and finger. Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like &lt;code&gt;*,..,*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;`;..;´&lt;/code&gt; to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.

=== Mixture of Western and Japanese style ===
Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format.  The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as &lt;code&gt;-O-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-3-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-w-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'_'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;_;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;T_T&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.V.&lt;/code&gt; are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example &lt;code&gt;^_^'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&gt;_&lt;!&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;@&gt;_____&lt;@&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;O;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;*u*&lt;/code&gt;.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example &lt;code&gt;=0=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=3=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=w=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=A=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;=7=&lt;/code&gt;.

In Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in &lt;code&gt;ò_ó&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ó_ò&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;õ_o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ù_u&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;o_Ô&lt;/code&gt;.

=== 2channel style ===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[ಠ ಠ]] --&gt;
Users of the Japanese discussion board [[2channel]], in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], as in  &lt;code&gt;ಠ_ಠ&lt;/code&gt; (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by [[4chan]] and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Monā]].

== Korean style ==
In [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos &lt;code&gt;ㅅ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅁ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ㅂ&lt;/code&gt; as the mouth/nose component and &lt;code&gt;ㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅎ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ㅍ&lt;/code&gt; for the eyes. For example: &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅅㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅂㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅁㅇ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-ㅅ-&lt;/code&gt;. Faces such as &lt;code&gt;'ㅅ'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"ㅅ"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'ㅂ'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'ㅇ'&lt;/code&gt;, using quotation marks &lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt; and apostrophes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: &lt;code&gt;ㅜㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠㅠ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;뉴뉴&lt;/code&gt; (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash "—" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in &lt;code&gt;ㅜ.ㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠ.ㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠ.ㅡ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅜ_ㅠ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅡ^ㅜ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ㅜㅇㅡ&lt;/code&gt;. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or – they depict a bad feeling. Examples: &lt;code&gt;-;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅡㅡ;;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-_-;;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-_^&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;^^, ^오^&lt;/code&gt; means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: &lt;code&gt;~_~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-6-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+0+&lt;/code&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as 囧rz. The character existed in [[Oracle bone script]], but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.&lt;ref name="nownews-56E7"&gt;{{cite web

Other ideographic variants for 囧 include 崮 (king 囧), 莔 (queen 囧), 商 (囧 with hat), 囧興 (turtle), 卣 ([[Bomberman]]).

The character 槑 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for "plum" (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This [[stick figure]] can represent failure and despair.&lt;ref name="boing-orz" /&gt; It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, a Japanese personal website. At the "Techside FAQ Forum" (TECHSIDE教えて君BBS(教えてBBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing {{nowrap|"＿&amp;#124;￣&amp;#124;○"}} to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://210.136.179.189/cgi-bin/ch/log/log.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030430024441/http://210.136.179.189/cgi-bin/ch/log/log.html |archive-date=April 30, 2003 |title=TECHSIDE FF11板の過去ログです |language=ja |access-date=September 17, 2018 |df= |quote=＜正直＞アフターバーナー予約してしまいました＿{{!}}￣{{!}}○←早速使ってみるｗ 　(12/23 00:20)&lt;br/&gt;＜ルン＞/土下座＿{{!}}￣{{!}} ○のび助　　・・・駄目だ、完全に遅れた 　(12/23 23:09) |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. By 2005, Orz spawned a [[subculture]]: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and [[URL shortening]] services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase "[[nice guy]]"{{spaced ndash}}that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like "You are a nice guy."&lt;ref name="boing-orz" /&gt;

Orz should not be confused with '''[[wikt:m(  )m|m(_&amp;nbsp;_)m]]''', which means "Thank you" or an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sakura-house.com/blog/blog/2014/03/21/the-30-emoticons-that-the-japanese-use-the-most/ |title=The 30 emoticons that the Japanese use the most ! |author=Clothilde |website=Sakura House |language=en-US |access-date=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multimedia variations ==
A portmanteau of ''emotion'' and ''[[sound]]'', an '''emotisound''' is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional [[subtext]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;ref name="Journal of effectus for college of law"&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007, [[MTV]] and [[Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of [[viral marketing]] for the second season of the show ''The Hills''. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley &amp; Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as "greeting cards that just happen to be selling something".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 AdWeek Article about Emoticlip] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225011527/http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 |date=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based application allows users to create a short animation.

During the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion. These videos lack an established name, and there are several ways to designate them: "emoticlips" (named above), "emotivideos" or more recently "emoticon videos". These are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone or other device to another. Current video compression codecs such as [[H.264]] allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable. The popular computer and mobile app [[Skype]] uses these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the "emoticon videos" between parentheses.

== Emoticons and intellectual property rights ==
[[File:USpatent6987991 emoticon.jpg|thumb|Patented drop down menu for composing phone mail text message with emoticons. {{cite patent|US|6987991}}]]

In 2000, [[Despair, Inc.]] obtained a U.S. [[trademark]] registration for the "frowny" emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; when used on "greeting cards, posters and art prints". In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website [[Slashdot]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, John. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/technology/29LOGO.html Compressed Data; Don't Mind That Lawsuit, It's Just a Joke] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817050840/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/technology/29LOGO.html |date=2016-08-17 }}", ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[patent application]]s have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have been issued as US [[patent]]s. {{cite patent|US|6987991}}, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu. The stated advantage over the [[prior art]] was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.

The emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European [[Community Trademark]] (CTM). In [[Finland]], the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STT |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2012081315947358_uu.shtml |title=Hymiölle ei saa tavaramerkkiä &amp;#124; Kotimaan uutiset |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=(&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tavaramerkkilehti | journal = Tavaramerkkilehti | issue = 10 | pages = 27–28 | publisher = National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland | date = May 31, 2006 | url = http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/lehti/tm/Tavaramerkkilehti10S_2006.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = June 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against [[Siemens]] by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt; emoticon.&lt;ref name="bbcwink" /&gt;

In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt; emoticon. A license would not "cost that much{{spaced ndash}}tens of thousands of dollars" for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.&lt;ref name="bbcwink"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7778767.stm |title=Russian hopes to cash in on ;-) |work=BBC News|date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unicode ==
{{Main|Emoticons (Unicode block)}}

Some smiley faces were present in Unicode since 1.1.0, including a white [[frowning]] face, a white [[smiling]] face, and a black smiling face. ("Black" refers to a glyph which is filled, "white" refers to a glyph which is unfilled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emojipedia.org/glossary/#white|title=📖 Emoji Glossary|website=''emojipedia.org''|access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unicode chart Miscellaneous Symbols|emoticons}}

The [[Emoticons (Unicode block)|Emoticons]] block was introduced in [[Unicode]] Standard version 6.0 (published in October 2010) and extended by 7.0. It covers Unicode range from U+1F600 to U+1F64F fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-6.0/U60-1F600.pdf |title=Emoticons |website=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Unicode chart Emoticons}}

After that block had been filled, Unicode 8.0 (2015), 9.0 (2016) and 10.0 (2017) added additional emoticons in the range from U+1F910 to U+1F9FF. Currently, U+1F90C{{snd}}U+1F90F, U+1F93F, U+1F94D{{snd}}U+1F94F, U+1F96C{{snd}}U+1F97F, U+1F998{{snd}}U+1F9CF (excluding U+1F9C0 which contains the [[cheese|🧀]] emoji) and 1F9E7{{snd}}1F9FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode 10.0 (2017).

{{Unicode chart Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs}}

For historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities and professions instead of emotions, are also found in [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs#Table of emojis with modifiers|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] (especially U+1F466{{snd}}U+1F487) and [[Transport and Map Symbols#Diversity|Transport and Map Symbols]]. Body parts, mostly hands, are also encoded in the [[Dingbat#Diversity|Dingbat]] and [[Miscellaneous Symbols#Diversity|Miscellaneous Symbols]] blocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9795">'''Energy forecasting''' is a broad term that refers to "''forecasting in the energy industry''". It includes but is not limited to forecasting demand ([[Electrical load|load]]) and [[Electricity pricing|price of electricity]], [[fossil fuel]]s (natural gas, oil, coal) and [[Renewable Energy Resources|renewable energy sources]] (RES; hydro, wind, solar). The term is used to describe both point and [[Probabilistic forecasting|probabilistic]] (i.e., interval and density).

== Background ==
When electricity sectors were regulated, utility monopolies used short-term load forecasts to ensure the reliability of supply and long-term demand forecasts as the basis for planning and investing in new capacity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Market Operations in Electric Power Systems: Forecasting, Scheduling, and Risk Management|url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/047122412X|doi = 10.1002/047122412x|first = Mohammad|last = Shahidehpour|first2 = Hatim|last2 = Yamin|first3 = Zuyi|last3 = Li|year = 2002|publisher = Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electricity price forecasting: A review of the state-of-the-art with a look into the future|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001083|journal = International Journal of Forecasting|date = 2014|pages = 1030–1081|volume = 30|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.08.008|first = Rafał|last = Weron|others = [Open Access]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the early 1990s, the process of [[deregulation]] and the introduction of [[Electricity market|competitive electricity markets]] have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. In many countries worldwide, electricity is now traded under market rules using [[Spot contract|spot]] and [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modelling Prices in Competitive Electricity Markets|publisher = Wiley|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-470-84860-9|location = |pages = |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047084860X.html|editor-last = Bunn|editor-first = Derek W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the corporate level, electricity load and price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision making mechanisms. The costs of over- or undercontracting and then selling or buying power in the balancing market are typically so high that they can lead to huge financial losses and [[bankruptcy]] in the extreme case.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling and Forecasting Electricity Loads and Prices: A Statistical Approach|last = Weron|first = Rafał|publisher = Wiley|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-470-05753-7|location = |pages = |url = http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047005753X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Energy Markets|last = Kaminski|first = Vincent|publisher = Risk Books|year = 2013|isbn = 9781906348793|location = |pages = |url = http://riskbooks.com/energy-markets}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect [[Electric utility|electric utilities]] are the most vulnerable, since they generally cannot pass their costs on to the retail customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = California's Electricity Crisis|url = http://oxrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/3/365|journal = Oxford Review of Economic Policy|date = 2001|issn = 0266-903X|pages = 365–388|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1093/oxrep/17.3.365|first = Paul L.|last = Joskow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been a variety of empirical studies on point forecasts (i.e., the "best guess" or expected value of the spot price), [[Probabilistic forecasting|probabilistic]] - i.e., interval and density - forecasts have not been investigated extensively to date.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electric Load Forecasting: Fundamentals and Best Practices|last = Hong|first = Tao|publisher = OTexts|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = https://www.otexts.org/book/elf|last2 = Dickey|first2 = David A.|access-date = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is changing and nowadays both researchers and practitioners are focusing on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Probabilistic Electric Load Forecasting: A Tutorial Review|url = http://blog.drhongtao.com/2015/08/probabilistic-electric-load-forecasting-a-tutorial-review.html|website = blog.drhongtao.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29|last = Hong|first = Tao|last2 = Fan|first2 = Shu}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Global Energy Forecasting Competition]] in 2012 was on point forecasting of electric load and wind power, the 2014 edition aimed at probabilistic forecasting of electric load, wind power, solar power and electricity prices.

== Benefits from reducing electric load and price forecast errors ==
Extreme [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of [[Electricity market|wholesale electricity prices]], which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has forced market participants to hedge not only against volume risk but also against price movements. A generator, utility company or large industrial consumer who is able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading. Yet, since load and price forecasts are being used by many departments of an energy company, it is very hard to quantify the benefits of improving them. A rough estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the [[mean absolute percentage error]] (MAPE) for a utility with 1GW [[Load profile|peak load]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.energybiz.com/magazine/article/404587/crystal-ball-lessons-predictive-analytics|title = Crystal Ball Lessons in Predictive Analytics|last = Hong|first = Tao|date = 2015|journal = EnergyBiz Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = |pages = 35–37|volume = Spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* $500,000 per year from long-term load forecasting,
* $300,000 per year from short-term load forecasting,
* $600,000 per year from short-term load and price forecasting.

== Main areas of interest ==
The most popular (in terms of the number of research papers and techniques developed) subfields of energy forecasting include:
* [[Load forecasting]] (electric load forecasting, electric demand forecasting). Although "[[Electrical load|load]]" is an ambiguous term, in load forecasting the "load" usually means demand (in [[Kilowatt|kW]]) or energy (in [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]) and since the magnitude of power and energy is the same for hourly data, usually no distinction is made between demand and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Energy Forecasting: Load, Demand, Energy and Power|url = http://blog.drhongtao.com/2014/09/load-demand-energy-power.html|website = blog.drhongtao.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Load forecasting involves the accurate prediction of both the magnitudes and geographical locations over the different periods of the planning horizon. The basic quantity of interest is typically the hourly total system (or zonal) load. However, load forecasting is also concerned with the prediction of hourly, daily, weekly and monthly values of load and of the [[Load profile|peak load]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* [[Electricity price forecasting]]
* [[Wind power forecasting]]
* [[Solar power forecasting]]

== Forecasting horizons ==
It is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting, but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be:
* ''Short-term forecasting'' generally involves horizons from a few minutes up to a few days ahead, and is of prime importance in [[unit_commitment_problem_in_electrical_power_production|day-to-day market operations]]. In load forecasting, ''very short-term forecasting'' with lead times measured in minutes is often considered as a separate class of forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Energy Forecasting: Very Short, Short, Medium and Long Term Load Forecasting|url = http://blog.drhongtao.com/2014/10/very-short-short-medium-long-term-load-forecasting.html|website = blog.drhongtao.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Medium-term'' ''forecasting'', from a few days to a few months ahead, is generally preferred for [[Balance sheet|balance sheet calculations]], [[risk management]] and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives pricing]]. In many cases, especially in [[electricity price forecasting]], evaluation is based not on the actual point forecasts, but on the distributions of prices over certain future time periods. As this type of modeling has a long-standing tradition in [[finance]], an inflow of "finance solutions" is observed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''Long-term'' ''forecasting'', with lead times measured in months, quarters or even years, concentrates on [[Investment analysis|investment profitability analysis]] and planning, such as determining the future sites or fuel sources of power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electricity market modeling trends|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421503003161|journal = Energy Policy|date = 2005|pages = 897–913|volume = 33|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2003.10.013|first = Mariano|last = Ventosa|first2 = Álvaro|last2 = Baı́llo|first3 = Andrés|last3 = Ramos|first4 = Michel|last4 = Rivier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Feldpost''''' is the [[Germany|German]] [[military mail]] service. Its history dates back to the 18th century in the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] and [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] and has existed ever since in different forms and shapes.

==History==
===World War II===
During 1937-39, the German [[Wehrmacht]] had a military mailing service that provided free postal services within Germany. On September 3, 1939, the first changes to the service occurred. Postcards and letters up to 250 g including newspapers could be mail free of charge by the German para-military and military organizations. Later in 1939, packages weighing up to 1000 g were included at the nominal rate of 20 [[Reichspfennig (Third Reich)|Reichspfennig]] fee. All German military branches had its own organic postal administration in charge of receiving and delivering mail. For ''Feldpost'' offices closest to the combat zone a mobile facility usually processed mail for all military branches.

In 1940 further changes were introduced followed through the rapid conquest of [[Europe]]. Eventually a series of postal agreements were set up between Germany and the occupied countries providing an extended usage of Feldpost service. Countries such as the [[Netherlands]] had close to 50,000 pro-Nazi volunteers that during the course of the war used the Feldpost service. Eventually these postal agreements were settled between Germany and other countries, including neutral countries such as [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Turkey]], which had volunteers within the German forces.

[[File:Feldpost letter 1944.jpg|thumb|1944 German Feldpost [[cover (philately)|cover]] with battalion [[Feldpost number|code number]] 03498/L]]
To preserve the secrecy of troop movements, each battalion was assigned a five digit code number called [[Feldpost number]] (FPN). By the end of 1939, letter prefixes "L" and "M" were attached in front of each FPN to units belonging to the [[Luftwaffe]] and [[Kriegsmarine]]. A breakdown by military units was added by attaching letter prefixes "A" through "E" at the end of each FPN. The letter A generally signified headquarters company, the others stood for line companies. 

The sequence of an FPN does not necessarily mean that the location of the units were at the same area. The postal cover/postcard itself was usually stamped with a military ''Feldpost Cancellation'' and ''Official Military Unit Seal''. Feldpost numbers were sometimes reassigned to other units, particularly when a unit ceased to exist. Normally Feldpost mail could not be dispatched nor received by civil post offices. If a soldier wanted to send mail through a civil post office, full postage was collected.

==Sumgait Massacres==

In 1988 based on his orders Hrazdan region law enforcement bodies launched clandestine activities to register the testimonies of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijani city Sumgait.

In 1989 on Kotanjian’s initiative, as a result of negotiations with Azerbaijani relevant authorities, an unprecedented swap of 3000 Azerbaijanis living in Hrazdan region with Armenians from Baku was implemented. The financial and property interests of all people involved in the program were guaranteed&lt;ref&gt;Հ. Ս.

The government was working during the period of the Soviet sanctions against Armenia as a result of latter rejection to participate in the March 1991 referendum on the Soviet Union based the new Federative Union treaty organized by Mikhail Gorbachov.

The government in exile supported the authorities of Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh to make sober assessments of threats eliminating from the collapse of the USSR. The utmost significance for both Armenia and Karabakh was the assessment on perspectives of the coup d’état, organized in Moscow in August 1991. The consultations delivered by the government in exile were instrumental in the process of elaboration of key decisions on the proclamation of Nagorno Karabakh Republic on September 2, 1991, organizing the September 21, 1991 independence Referendum in Armenia and December 10, 1991 Independence Referendum in Nagorno Karabakh. The formation of government in exile by USSR MP Zory Balayan and the acting Armenian Interior Minister Ashot Manucharyan was an extraordinary step, implemented in the extreme unfavorable conditions for the establishment of Armenia and Artsakh sovereignty.

'''Hieratic''' ({{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|ə|ˈ|r|æ|t|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-grc|ἱερατικά|hieratiká|priestly}}) is a [[cursive]] writing system used for [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]], and the principal script used to write that language from its development in the 3rd millennium BCE until the rise of [[Demotic script|Demotic]] in the mid 1st millennium BCE. It was primarily written in ink with a reed pen on [[papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=William B.|title=Linguistics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-twBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-48339-3|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the second century, the term ''hieratic'' was first used by [[Clement of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Goedicke 1988:vii; Wente 2001:2006. The reference is made in Clement's ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book5.html Stromata]'' 5:4.&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the Greek for "priestly writing" ({{lang-grc-koi|γράμματα ἱερατικά}}), as at that time, hieratic was used only for religious texts and literature, as had been the case for the previous eight and a half centuries.

''Hieratic'' can also be an [[adjective]] meaning "[o]f or associated with sacred persons or offices; [[wikt:sacerdotal|sacerdotal]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hieratic Definition of hieratic], Free Online Dictionary. Retrieved 2011-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Hieratic developed as a cursive form of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]] in the [[Naqada III]] period, roughly 3200–3000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Hoffmann (2012), '' Hieratic And Demotic Literature'', OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[manuscript hieroglyphs|handwritten printed hieroglyphs]] continued to be used in some formal situations, such as manuscripts of the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]], noncursive hieroglyphic script became largely restricted to monumental inscriptions. 

Hieratic was used into the [[Hellenistic period]]. Around 660 BCE, the even more-cursive [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic script]] arose in northern Egypt and replaced hieratic and the southern shorthand known as [[abnormal hieratic]] for most mundane writing, such as personal letters and mercantile documents. Hieratic continued to be used by the [[priest]]ly class for religious texts and literature into the third century BCE.

==Uses and materials==
[[File:Heratic script limestone.jpg|right|thumb|One of four official letters to [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Khay copied onto fragments of limestone (an [[ostracon]]).]]
Through most of its long history, hieratic was used for writing administrative documents, accounts, legal texts, and letters, as well as mathematical, medical, literary, and religious texts. During the Græco-Roman period, when Demotic (and later [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]) had become the chief administrative script, hieratic was limited primarily to religious texts. In general, hieratic was much more important than hieroglyphs throughout Egypt's history, being the script used in daily life. It was also the writing system first taught to students, knowledge of hieroglyphs being limited to a small minority who were given additional training.&lt;ref&gt;Baines 1983:583.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is often possible to detect errors in hieroglyphic texts that came about due to a misunderstanding of an original hieratic text.

Most often, hieratic script was written in [[ink]] with a [[Phragmites|reed]] [[brush]]&lt;ref&gt;During the Roman period reed [[pen]]s (''calami'') were also used.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[papyrus]], [[wood]], [[stone]] or [[pottery]] [[ostracon|ostraca]]. Thousands of limestone ostraca have been found at the site of [[Deir al-Madinah]], revealing an intimate picture of the lives of common Egyptian workmen. Besides papyrus, stone, ceramic shards, and wood, there are hieratic texts on leather rolls, though few have survived. There are also hieratic texts written on cloth, especially on linen used in [[Mummy|mummification]]. There are some hieratic texts inscribed on stone, a variety known as lapidary hieratic; these are particularly common on [[stela]]e from the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]].

During the late [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|6th Dynasty]], hieratic was sometimes incised into mud tablets with a [[stylus]], similar to [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. About five hundred of these tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat),&lt;ref&gt;Soukiassian, Wuttman, Pantalacci 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and a single example was discovered from the site of Ayn al-Gazzarin, both in the [[Dakhla Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Posener-Kriéger 1992; Pantalacci 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20120514 Scribes and craftsmen: the noble art of writing on clay.] Feb 29, 2012; UCL Institute of Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of [[papyrus]] production.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson and Quirke 1995:20.&lt;/ref&gt; These tablets record inventories, name lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters. Of the letters, many are internal letters that were circulated within the palace and the local settlement, but others were sent from other villages in the oasis to the governor.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Scribe's exercise tablet 1.jpg|right|thumb|Exercise tablet with hieratic excerpt from ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat|The Instructions of Amenemhat]]''.  [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Dynasty XVIII]], reign of [[Amenhotep I]], {{nowrap|{{circa|1514}}–1493 BC.}}  Text reads: "Be on your guard against all who are subordinate to you ... Trust no brother, know no friend, make no intimates."]]
Hieratic script, unlike inscriptional and [[manuscript hieroglyphs]], reads from right to left. Initially, hieratic could be written in either columns or horizontal lines, but after the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] (specifically during the reign of [[Amenemhat III]]), horizontal writing became the standard.

Hieratic is noted for its cursive nature and use of [[Ligature (palaeography)|ligatures]] for a number of characters. Hieratic script also uses a much more standardized [[orthography]] than hieroglyphs; texts written in the latter often had to take into account extra-textual concerns, such as decorative uses and religious concerns that were not present in, say, a tax receipt. There are also some signs that are unique to hieratic, though [[Egyptologist]]s have invented equivalent hieroglyphic forms for hieroglyphic transcriptions and typesetting.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Several hieratic characters have diacritical additions so that similar signs could easily be distinguished. 

Hieratic is often present in any given period in two forms, a highly ligatured, cursive script used for administrative documents, and a broad [[uncial]] [[bookhand]] used for literary, scientific, and religious texts. These two forms can often be significantly different from one another. Letters, in particular, used very cursive forms for quick writing, often with large numbers of abbreviations for formulaic phrases, similar to [[shorthand]].

A highly cursive form of hieratic known as "Abnormal Hieratic" was used in the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] area from the second half of the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] until the beginning of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Wente 2001:210. See also Malinine [1974].&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the script of Upper Egyptian administrative documents and was used primarily for legal texts, land leases, letters, and other texts. This type of writing was superseded by Demotic—a Lower Egyptian scribal tradition—during the 26th Dynasty, when Demotic was established as a standard administrative script throughout a re-unified Egypt.

==Influence==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Hieratic has had influence on a number of other writing systems. The most obvious is that on [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], its direct descendant. Related to this are the Demotic signs of the [[Meroitic script]] and the borrowed Demotic characters used in the [[Coptic alphabet]] and [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]].

Outside of the Nile Valley, many of the signs used in the [[Byblos syllabary]] were apparently borrowed from [[Old Kingdom]] hieratic signs.&lt;ref&gt;Hoch 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that early [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] used [[Egyptian numerals|hieratic numerals]].&lt;ref&gt;Aharoni 1966; Goldwasser 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode==

The Unicode standard considers hieratic characters' font variants of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the two scripts have been unified.&lt;ref name="Unicode"&gt;The [[Unicode]] Standard, Version 5.2.0, Chapter 14.17, ''Egyptian Hieroglyphs'' [https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0/ch14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphs themselves were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2. To date, there is no known Unicode font with hieratic.

'''Hokkien''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|k|i|ɛ|n|,_|h|ɒ|ˈ|k|iː|ɛ|n}};{{efn|They are the most common pronunciations while there is another one cited from [[OxfordDictionaries.com]], {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|ˈ|k|iː|n}}, which is almost never used actually.}} from {{zh|t={{linktext|福建話}}|c=|s=|p=Fújiànhuà}}; [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]]: ''Hok-kiàn-ōe''){{efn|also '''Quanzhang''' ([[Quanzhou]]-[[Zhangzhou]] / Chinchew–Changchew; [[Bbánlám Hōngggián Pīnyīn Hōngàn|BP]]: Zuánziū–Ziāngziū)}} or {{cns|'''Minnan Proper'''|date=December 2017}} (閩南語/闽南话), is a [[Southern Min]] Chinese dialect group originating from the [[Minnan region]] in the south-eastern part of [[Fujian Province]] in [[Southeastern China]] and [[Taiwan]], and spoken widely there and by the Chinese diaspora in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]] and other parts of [[Southeast Asia]], and by other [[overseas Chinese]] all over the world. It is the mainstream form of [[Southern Min]].

It is closely related to [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], though it has limited [[mutual intelligibility]] with it, whereas it is more distantly related to other variants such as [[Hainanese]] and [[Leizhou dialect]].

Hokkien historically served as the [[lingua franca]] amongst overseas Chinese communities [[Han Chinese subgroups|of all dialects and subgroups]] in Southeast Asia, and remains today as the most spoken [[variety of Chinese]] in the region, including in [[Singaporean Hokkien|Singapore]], [[Penang Hokkien|Malaysia]], [[Medan Hokkien|Indonesia]], [[Philippine Hokkien|Philippines]] and some parts of [[Indochina]] (particularly Thailand, Laos and Cambodia).{{sfnp|West|2010|pp=289-90}}

The [[Betawi Malay]] language, spoken by some five million people in and around the Indonesian capital [[Jakarta]], includes numerous Hokkien loanwords due to the significant influence of the [[Chinese Indonesian]] diaspora, most of whom are of Hokkien ancestry and origin.

==Names==
Chinese speakers of the Quanzhang variety of Southern Min refer to the mainstream Southern Min language as

* ''Bân-lâm-gú / Bân-lâm-ōe'' ({{zh|s=闽南语/闽南话|t=閩南語/閩南話|labels=no}}, literally 'language or speech of Southern Min') in Mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ws.moe.edu.tw/001/Upload/6/RelFile/0/1459/guantsik_960523.pdf|title=臺灣閩南語漢字之選用原則|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tâi-gí'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|臺語}}, literally 'Taiwanese language') in Taiwan.
* ''Hok-kiàn-ōe'' ({{zh|s=福建话|t=福建話|labels=no}}, literally 'Fujian speech') in Burma, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
* ''Lán-lâng-ōe'' ({{lang|zh|咱儂話}}, literally 'our people's language') in the Philippines.

In parts of Southeast Asia and in the English-speaking communities, the term ''Hokkien'' ({{IPA|[hɔk˥kiɛn˨˩]}}) is etymologically derived from the [[Southern Min]] pronunciation for [[Fujian]] ({{Lang-zh|c=福建|p=Fújiàn|poj=Hok-kiàn}}), the province from which the language hails. In Southeast Asia and the English press, ''Hokkien'' is used in common parlance to refer to the Southern Min dialects of southern Fujian, and does not include reference to dialects of other Sinitic branches also present in Fujian such as [[Eastern Min]] or [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]. In [[Chinese linguistics]], these dialects are known by their classification under the '''Quanzhang division''' ({{zh|c=泉漳片|p=Quánzhāng piàn|links=no}}) of [[Min Nan]], which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers of [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]].

==Geographic distribution==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Hokkien originated in the southern area of [[Fujian]] province, an important center for trade and migration, and has since become one of the most common Chinese varieties overseas. The major pole of Hokkien varieties outside of Fujian is Taiwan, where, during the 200 years of [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule]], thousands of immigrants from Fujian arrived yearly. The [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese dialect]] mostly has origins with the [[Quanzhou dialect|Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou]] variants, but since then, the [[Amoy dialect]], also known as the Xiamen dialect, is becoming the modern [[prestige dialect|prestige standard]] for the language in [[Mainland China]]. Both ''[[Amoy]]'' and ''[[Xiamen]]'' come from the Chinese name of the city ({{zh|s=厦门|t=廈門|p=Xiàmén|poj=Ē-mûi}}); the former is from Zhangzhou Hokkien, whereas the later comes from Mandarin.

There are many Minnan (Hokkien) speakers among [[overseas Chinese]] in Southeast Asia as well as in the [[United States]] ([[Hoklo Americans]]). Many ethnic [[Han Chinese]] emigrants to the region were [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma ([[Myanmar]]), [[Indonesia]] (the former [[Dutch East Indies]]) and present day [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] (formerly [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and the [[British Straits Settlements]]). Many of the Minnan dialects of this region are highly similar to [[Xiamen dialect]] (Amoy) and Taiwanese Hokkien with the exception of foreign loanwords. Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 80% of the [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese people]] in the [[Philippines]], among which is known locally as '''[[Lan-nang]]''' or '''Lán-lâng-oē''' ("Our people’s language"). Hokkien speakers form the largest group of overseas Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Southern [[Fujian]] is home to three principal Minnan Proper (Hokkien) dialects: [[Quanzhou dialect|Chinchew]], [[Amoy dialect|Amoy]], [[Zhangzhou dialect|Chiangchew]], originating from the cities of [[Quanzhou]], [[Xiamen]] and [[Zhangzhou]](respectively).

Traditionally speaking, Quanzhou dialect spoken in Quanzhou is the '''Traditional Standard Minnan''', it is the dialect that is used in Liyuan Opera (梨园戏) and Nanying music (南音). Being the '''Traditional Standard Minnan''', Quanzhou dialect is considered to have the purest accent and the most conservative Minnan dialect.

In the late 18th to the early 19th century, Xiamen (Amoy) became the principal{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} city of southern Fujian. Xiamen (Amoy) dialect is adopted as the '''Modern Standard Minnan'''. It is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. It has played an influential role in history, especially in the relations of [[Western world|Western]] nations with China, and was one of the most frequently learnt dialect of Quanzhang variety by Westerners during the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

Same as Amoy dialect, the '''Modern Standard''' form of Quanzhang accent spoken around the city of Tainan in Taiwan is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. All Quanzhang dialects spoken throughout the whole of Taiwan are collectively known as [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] or just Taiwanese. Used by a majority of the population, it bears much importance from a [[socio-political]] perspective, forming the second (and perhaps today most significant) major pole of the language due to the popularity of Taiwanese-language media.

===Southeast Asia===

The varieties of Hokkien in [[Southeast Asia]] originate from these dialects.

The Singaporeans, Southern Malaysians and people in Indonesia's [[Riau]] and surrounding [[Riau Islands|islands]] variant is from the Quanzhou area. They speak a distinct form of Quanzhou Hokkien called [[Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien]] (SPMH).

Among ethnic Chinese inhabitants of [[Penang]], and other states in Northern Malaysia and [[Medan]], with other areas in [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], a distinct form of Zhangzhou Hokkien has developed. In Penang, it is called [[Penang Hokkien]] while across the [[Malacca Strait]] in Medan, an almost identical variant is known as [[Medan Hokkien]].

The Philippines variant is mostly from Quanzhou or Amoy (Xiamen), as most of their ancestors are from the aforementioned area.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Variants of Hokkien dialects can be traced to two sources of origin: [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]]. Both [[Amoy Hokkien|Amoy]] and most [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] are based on a mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects, while the rest of the Hokkien dialects spoken in South East Asia are either derived from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, or based on a mixture of both dialects.

===Quanzhou===
During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of ancient China, there was constant warfare occurring in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] of China. Northerners began to enter into [[Fujian]] region, causing the region to incorporate parts of northern [[Chinese dialects]]. However, the massive migration of northern [[Han Chinese]] into Fujian region mainly occurred after the [[Disaster of Yongjia]]. The [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jìn]] court fled from the north to the south, causing large numbers of northern [[Han Chinese]] to move into Fujian region. They brought the [[Old Chinese]] spoken in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] of China from the prehistoric era to the 3rd century into [[Fujian]]. This then gradually evolved into the Quanzhou dialect.

===Zhangzhou===
In 677 (during the reign of [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]]), [[Chen Zheng (Tang Dynasty)|Chen Zheng]], together with his son [[Chen Yuanguang]], led a military expedition to suppress a rebellion of the [[She people]]. In 885, (during the reign of [[Emperor Xizong of Tang]]), the two brothers [[Wang Chao (Tang Dynasty)|Wang Chao]] and [[Wang Shenzhi]], led a military expedition force to suppress the [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 120
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These two waves of migration from the north brought the language of northern [[Middle Chinese]] into the [[Fujian]] region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.

===Xiamen===
[[Amoy dialect]] is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of [[Xiamen]] and its surrounding regions of [[Tong'an District|Tong'an]] and [[Xiang'an District|Xiang'an]], both of which are now included in the greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late [[Ming dynasty]] when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began traveling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. A need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, [[dialect leveling]] occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.

===Early sources===
Several playscripts survive from the late 16th century, written in a mixture of Quanzhou and Chaozhou dialects.  The most important is the ''[[Romance of the Litchi Mirror]]'', with extant manuscripts dating from 1566 and 1581.&lt;ref name="Chappell Peyraube"&gt;{{cite book

* ''Huìjí yǎsútōng shíwǔyīn'' (彙集雅俗通十五音 "Compilation of the fifteen elegant and vulgar sounds") by Xie Xiulan (謝秀嵐) describes the Zhangzhou dialect.  The oldest extant edition dates from 1818.
[[Walter Henry Medhurst]] based his 1832 dictionary on the latter work.

==Phonology==
Hokkien has one of the most diverse [[phoneme]] inventories among Chinese varieties, with more [[consonant]]s than [[Standard Mandarin]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese]]. [[Vowel]]s are more-or-less similar to that of Standard Mandarin. Hokkien varieties retain many pronunciations that are no longer found in other Chinese varieties. These include the retention of the {{IPA|/t/}} initial, which is now {{IPA|/tʂ/}} (Pinyin 'zh') in Mandarin (e.g. 'bamboo' 竹 is ''tik'', but ''zhú'' in Mandarin), having disappeared before the 6th century in other Chinese varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Daniel |title=The Chinese language: its history and current usage|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2006|pages=100–102|isbn=978-0-8048-3853-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initials===
Southern Min has [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], unaspirated as well as [[voice (phonetics)|voiced consonant]] initials. For example, the word ''khui'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|開}}; "open") and ''kuiⁿ'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|關}}; "close") have the same vowel but differ only by aspiration of the initial and [[nasalization|nasality]] of the vowel. In addition, Southern Min has [[labial consonant|labial initial consonant]]s such as '''''m''''' in ''m̄-sī'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|毋是}}}}; "is not").

Another example is 'da-po͘-kiáⁿ'' ({{linktext|查埔囝}}; "boy") and ''cha-bó͘-kiáⁿ'' ({{linktext|查某囝}}; "girl"), which differ in the second syllable in consonant voicing and in [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

Unlike Mandarin, Hokkien retains all the final consonants corresponding to those of [[Middle Chinese]]. While Mandarin only preserves the '''n''' and '''ŋ''' finals, Southern Min also preserves the '''m''', '''p''', '''t''' and '''k''' finals and developed the '''ʔ''' ([[glottal stop]]).

===Vowels===
The vowels of Hokkien are {{IPA|/i, y, ɨ, u, e, ə, ɤ, o, ɛ, ɔ, a, ɐ/}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. 

The following table illustrates some of the more commonly seen vowel shifts. Characters with the same vowel are shown in parentheses.

===Tones===
In general, Hokkien dialects have 5 to 7 [[phonemic]] [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s. According to the traditional Chinese system, however, there are 7 to 9 tones if the two additional [[entering tone]]s (see the discussion on [[Chinese tone]]). [[Tone sandhi]] is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=August 1, 2007 |url=http://www.ntcu.edu.tw/tailo/g_in/form/f_05.html |script-title=zh:無標題文件 |publisher=Ntcu.edu.tw |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are minor variations between the [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]] tone systems. Taiwanese tones follow the patterns of Amoy or Quanzhou, depending on the area of Taiwan. Many dialects have an additional phonemic tone ("tone 9" according to the traditional reckoning), used only in special or foreign loan words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=周長楫 |script-title=zh:闽南方言大词典 |language=Chinese |publisher=福建人民出版社 |year=2006 |pp=17, 28 |isbn=7-211-03896-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison==
The [[Amoy dialect]] (Xiamen) is a hybrid of the [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]] dialects. [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] is also a hybrid of these two dialects. Taiwanese in northern and coastal [[Taiwan]] tends to be based on the Quanzhou variety, whereas the Taiwanese spoken in central, south and inland Taiwan tends to be based on Zhangzhou speech. There are minor variations in pronunciation and vocabulary between Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. The grammar is generally the same. Additionally, extensive contact with the [[Japanese language]] has left a legacy of Japanese loanwords in Taiwanese Hokkien. On the other hand, the variants spoken in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] have a substantial number of loanwords from [[Malay language|Malay]] and to a lesser extent, from [[English language|English]] and other Chinese varieties, such as the closely related [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and some [[Cantonese]].

[[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]] are based on Zhangzhou dialect, whereas [[Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien]] is based on Quanzhou dialect.

===Mutual intelligibility===
The Quanzhou dialect, Xiamen dialect, Zhangzhou dialect and Taiwanese are generally [[mutually intelligible]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nan|title=Chinese, Min Nan|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overseas varieties such as [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Singaporean Hokkien]] are slightly less intelligible to speakers of mainland Min Nan and Taiwanese dialects due to the existence of foreign loanwords.

The Min Nan varieties of [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and Amoy are 84% phonetically similar,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and 34% [[lexical similarity|lexically similar]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} whereas Mandarin and Amoy Min Nan are 62% phonetically similar{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and 15% lexically similar.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}  In comparison, German and English are 60% lexically similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=deu |title=German |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hainanese]], which is sometimes considered Southern Min, has almost no mutual intelligibility with any form of Hokkien.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Grammar==
Hokkien is an [[analytic language]]; in a sentence, the arrangement of words is important to its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ratte|first=Alexander T.|date=May 2009|title=A DIALECTAL AND PHONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF PENGHU TAIWANESE|publisher=Williams College|location=Williamstown, Massachusetts|page=4|url=http://sanders.phonologist.org/Papers/ratte-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A basic sentence follows the [[subject–verb–object]] pattern (i.e. a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] is followed by a [[verb]] then by an [[object (grammar)|object]]), though this order is often violated because Hokkien dialects are [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]]. Unlike [[synthetic language]]s, seldom do words indicate [[time]], [[gender]] and [[plural]] by inflection. Instead, these concepts are expressed through adverbs, aspect markers, and grammatical particles, or are deduced from the context. Different particles are added to a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] to further specify its status or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

A verb itself indicates no [[grammatical tense]]. The time can be explicitly shown with time-indicating adverbs. Certain exceptions exist, however, according to the pragmatic interpretation of a verb's meaning. Additionally, an optional [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] particle can be appended to a verb to indicate the state of an action. Appending interrogative or exclamative particles to a sentence turns a statement into a question or shows the attitudes of the speaker.

Hokkien dialects preserve certain grammatical reflexes and patterns reminiscent of the broad stage of [[Archaic Chinese]]. This includes the [[Serial verb construction|serialization of verb phrases]] (direct linkage of verbs and [[verb phrase]]s) and the infrequency of [[nominalization]], both similar to Archaic Chinese grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Y.C.|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan studies|editor=John McCoy, Timothy Light|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1986|chapter=Historical significance of certain distinct grammatical features in Taiwanese|isbn=978-90-04-07850-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{ruby-zh-p|你|Lí}} {{ruby-zh-p|去|khì}} {{ruby-zh-p|買|bé}} {{ruby-zh-p|有|ū}} {{ruby-zh-p|錶仔|pió-á}} {{ruby-zh-p|無|bo}}？
:You-go-buy-have watch-no (Gloss)
:"Did you go to buy a watch?"

Choice of grammatical function words also varies significantly among the Hokkien dialects. For instance, 乞 ''khit'' (denoting the causative, passive or dative) is retained in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]] (also unique to the Jinjiang dialect is 度 ''thoo'') and in [[Jieyang]], but not in [[Longxi County, Fujian|Longxi]] and [[Xiamen]], whose dialects use 互 (''hoo'') instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lien|first=Chinfa|year=2002|title=Grammatical Function Words 乞, 度, 共, 甲, 將 and 力 in Li Jing Ji 荔鏡記 and their Development in Southern Min|journal=Papers from the Third International Conference on Sinology|publisher=National Tsing Hua University|pages=179–216|url= http://intranet.ling.sinica.edu.tw/eip/FILES/journal/2007.6.23.25251406.1786841.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===
Hokkien dialects differ in their preferred choice of pronouns. For instance, while the second person pronoun ''lí'' (你) is standard in Taiwanese Hokkien, the Teochew loanword ''lú'' (汝) is more common among Hokkien-speaking communities in Southeast Asia. The plural personal pronouns tend to be [[nasalized]] forms of the singular ones. Personal pronouns found in the Hokkien dialects are listed below:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! style="width: 4em" | Person
! style="width: 8em" | Singular
! style="width: 8em" | Plural
|-
!| First person
|我&lt;br/&gt;''góa''
|阮&lt;sup&gt;1, 3&lt;/sup&gt;''gún'', ''góan''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;咱&lt;sup&gt;2, 3&lt;/sup&gt; or 俺&lt;br/&gt;''lán'' or ''án''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;我儂&lt;br/&gt;''góa-lâng''
|-
!| Second person

| 恁&lt;br/&gt;''lín''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;恁儂&lt;br/&gt;''lín lâng''
|-
!| Third person
| 伊&lt;br/&gt;''i''
| 𪜶&lt;br/&gt;''in''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;伊儂&lt;br/&gt;''i lâng''
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Inclusive
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Exclusive
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 儂 (''-lâng'') is typically suffixed in Southeast Asian Hokkien dialects

[[Possessive pronoun]]s are marked by the particle ''ê'' (的), or its literary version ''chi'' (之). Plural pronouns are typically unmarked (the nasalized final serves as the possessive indicator):&lt;ref name="wt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klöter|first=Henning|title=Written Taiwanese|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2005|isbn=978-3-447-05093-7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{ruby-zh-p|阮|góan}} {{ruby-zh-p|翁|ang}} {{ruby-zh-p|姓|sèⁿ}} {{ruby-zh-p|陳|Tân}}。
:"My husband's surname is Tan."

[[Reflexive pronoun]]s are made by appending the pronouns ''ka-kī, ka-tī'' (家己) or ''chū-kí'' (自己).

Hokkien dialects use a variety of differing [[demonstrative pronoun]]s, which are as follows:
*this - ''che'' (這, 即), ''chit-ê'' (這個, 即個)
*that - ''he'' (許, 彼), ''hit-ê'' (彼個)
*here - ''chia'' (者), ''hia/hiâ'' (遮, 遐), ''chit-tau'' 這兜)
*there - ''hia'' (許, 遐), ''hit-tau'' (彼兜)

The interrogative pronouns are:
*what - ''siáⁿ-mih'' (啥物), ''sīm-mi̍h'' (甚麼)
*when - ''tī-sî'' (底時), ''kī-sî'' (幾時), ''tang-sî'' (當時), ''sīm-mi̍h-sî-chūn'' (甚麼時陣)
*where - ''to-lo̍h'' (倒落), ''tó-uī'' (佗位, 叨位)
*who - ''siáⁿ-lâng'' (啥人) or ''siáⁿ'' (啥)
*why - ūi-siáⁿ-mih (為啥物), ''ūi-sīm-mi̍h'' (為甚麼), ''án-chóaⁿ'' (按怎), ''khah'' (盍)
*how - ''án-chóaⁿ'' (按怎) ''lû-hô'' (如何) ''chóaⁿ-iūⁿ'' (怎樣)

=== Copula ("to be") ===

States and qualities are generally expressed using [[stative verbs]] that do not require the verb "to be":
:{{ruby-zh-p|我|goá}} {{ruby-zh-p|腹肚|pak-tó͘}} {{ruby-zh-p|枵|iau}}。
:"I am hungry." (lit. I-stomach-hungry)

With noun complements, the verb ''sī'' (是) serves as the verb "to be".

:{{ruby-zh-p|昨昏|cha-hng}} {{ruby-zh-p|是|sī}} {{ruby-zh-p|八月節|peh-go̍eh-cheh}}。
:"Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn festival."

To indicate location, the words ''tī'' (佇) ''tiàm'' (踮), ''teh/leh'' (咧), which are collectively known as the locatives or sometimes coverbs in Chinese linguistics, are used to express "(to be) at":

:{{ruby-zh-p|我|goá}} {{ruby-zh-p|踮|tiàm}} {{ruby-zh-p|遮|chia}} {{ruby-zh-p|等|tán}} {{ruby-zh-p|你|lí}}。
:"I am here waiting for you."

:{{ruby-zh-p|伊|i}} {{ruby-zh-p|這馬|chit-má}} {{ruby-zh-p|佇|tī}} {{ruby-zh-p|厝|chhù}} {{ruby-zh-p|裡|lí}} {{ruby-zh-p|咧|teh}} {{ruby-zh-p|睏|khùn}}。
:"He's sleeping at home now."

===Negation===
Hokkien dialects have a variety of negation particles that are prefixed or affixed to the verbs they modify. There are five primary negation particles in Hokkien dialects:
#''m̄'' (毋, 呣, 唔)
#''bē, bōe'' (袂, 未)
#''mài'' (莫, 勿)
#''bô'' (無)
#''put'' (不) - literary

Other negative particles include:
#''biàu'' (嫑) - a contraction of ''bô iàu'' (無要), as in ''biàu-kín'' (嫑緊) {{citation needed|reason=wrong analysis of 無要緊|date=December 2016}}
#''bàng'' (甭)
#''bián'' (免)
#''thài'' (汰)

The particles ''m̄'' (毋, 呣, 唔) is general and can negate almost any verb:
:{{ruby-zh-p|伊|i}} {{ruby-zh-p|毋|m̄}} {{ruby-zh-p|捌|bat}} {{ruby-zh-p|字|jī}}。
:"He cannot read." (lit. he-not-know-word)

The particle ''mài'' (莫, 勿), a concatenation of ''m-ài'' (毋愛) is used to negate imperative commands:
:{{ruby-zh-p|莫|mài}} {{ruby-zh-p|講|kóng}}!
:"Don't speak!"

The particle ''bô'' (無) indicates the past tense:
:{{ruby-zh-p|伊|i}} {{ruby-zh-p|無|bô}} {{ruby-zh-p|食|chia̍h}}。
:"He did not eat."

The verb 'to have', ''ū'' (有) is replaced by ''bô'' (無) when negated (not 無有):
:{{ruby-zh-p|伊|i}} {{ruby-zh-p|無|bô}} {{ruby-zh-p|錢|chîⁿ}}。
:"He does not have any money."

The particle ''put'' (不) is used infrequently, mostly found in literary compounds and phrases:
:{{ruby-zh-p|伊|i}} {{ruby-zh-p|真|chin}} {{ruby-zh-p|不孝|put-hàu}}。
:"He is truly unfilial."

== Vocabulary ==
The majority of Hokkien vocabulary is [[monosyllabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lim|first=Beng Soon|title=Malay Lexicalized Items in Penang Peranakan Hokkien|publisher=Regional Language Centre (RELC)|location=Singapore|page=165|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/soon1998malay.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2016}} Many Hokkien [[word]]s have [[cognate]]s in other Chinese varieties. That said, there are also many indigenous words that are unique to Hokkien and are potentially not of [[Sino-Tibetan]] origin, while others are shared by all the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects (e.g. 'congee' is 糜 ''mê'', ''bôe'', ''bê'', not 粥 ''zhōu'', as in other dialects).

As compared to [[Standard Chinese]] (Mandarin), Hokkien dialects prefer to use the monosyllabic form of words, without suffixes. For instance, the Mandarin noun suffix 子 (zi) is not found in Hokkien words, while another noun suffix, 仔 (á) is used in many nouns. Examples are below:
*'duck' - 鸭 ''ah'' or 鴨仔 ''ah-á'' (SC: 鸭子 ''yāzi'')
*'color' - 色 ''sek '' (SC: 顏色 ''yán sè'')

In other bisyllabic morphemes, the syllables are inverted, as compared to Standard Chinese. Examples include the following:
*'guest' - 人客 ''lâng-kheh'' (SC: 客人 ''kèrén'')

In other cases, the same word can have different meanings in Hokkien and standard written Chinese. Similarly, depending on the region Hokkien is spoken in, loanwords from local languages (Malay, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], Burmese, among others), as well as other Chinese dialects (such as Southern Chinese dialects like [[Cantonese]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), are commonly integrated into the vocabulary of Hokkien dialects.

=== Literary and colloquial readings ===

The existence of [[literary and colloquial reading]]s is a prominent feature of some Hokkien dialects and indeed in many Sinitic varieties in the south. The bulk of literary readings ({{lang|zh-tw|文讀}}, ''bûn-tha̍k''), based on pronunciations of the vernacular during the [[Tang Dynasty]], are mainly used in formal phrases and written language (e.g. philosophical concepts, surnames, and some place names), while the colloquial (or vernacular) ones ({{lang|zh-tw|白讀}}, ''pe̍h-tha̍k'') are basically used in spoken language and vulgar phrases. Literary readings are more similar to the pronunciations of the Tang standard of Middle Chinese than their colloquial equivalents. &lt;!-------Referring to Min Dong? ------The recent contact with [[Standard Mandarin]] has led to the creation of another strata of literary readings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zheng|first=Rongbin|title=The Zhongxian (中仙 ) Min Dialect: A Preliminary Study of Language Contact and Stratum-Formation|url=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fchinalinks.osu.edu%2Fnaccl-20%2Fproceedings%2F30_zheng-r.pdf&amp;ei=Dc4VTq3yM6nzmAXeqIgQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmj6Cp3fSfeM48Awc2Aelm407CGg|work=Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20). 2008. Volume 1.|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; loaned from Mandarin which may either be similar to Mandarin or, due to the formal nature, may revisit the Tang pronunciations.--------&gt;

However, some dialects of Hokkien, such as [[Penang Hokkien]] as well as [[Philippine Hokkien]] overwhelmingly favor colloquial readings. For example, in both Penang Hokkien and Philippine Hokkien, the characters for 'university,' 大學, are pronounced ''tōa-o̍h'' (colloquial readings for both characters), instead of the literary reading ''tāi-ha̍k'', which is common in Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese dialects.

The pronounced divergence between literary and colloquial pronunciations found in Hokkien dialects is attributed to the presence of several strata in the Min lexicon. The earliest, colloquial stratum is traced to the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE - 220 CE); the second colloquial one comes from the period of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420 - 589 CE); the third stratum of pronunciations (typically literary ones) comes from the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE) and is based on the [[prestige dialect]] of [[Chang'an]] (modern day [[Xi'an]]), its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chappell|first=Hilary|author2=Alain Peyraube|title=The Analytic Causatives Of Early Modern Southern Min In Diachronic Perspective|journal=Linguistic studies in Chinese and neighboring languages|publisher=Centre de Recherches Linguistiques sur l’Asie Orientale|location=Paris, France|pages=1–34|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/18/07/07/PDF/causatives_early_S_MIN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commonly seen sound correspondences (colloquial → literary) are as follows:
*p- ({{IPA|[p-]}}, {{IPA|[pʰ-]}})  → h ({{IPA|[h-]}})
*ch-, chh- ({{IPA|[ts-]}}, {{IPA|[tsʰ-]}}, {{IPA|[tɕ-]}}, {{IPA|[tɕʰ-]}}) → s ({{IPA|[s-]}}, {{IPA|[ɕ-]}})
*k-, kh- ({{IPA|[k-]}}, {{IPA|[kʰ-]}}) → ch ({{IPA|[tɕ-]}}, {{IPA|[tɕʰ-]}})

=== Semantic differences between Hokkien and Mandarin ===
Quite a few words from the variety of [[Old Chinese]] spoken in the state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]], where the ancestral language of Min and Wu dialect families originated, and later words from [[Middle Chinese]] as well, have retained the original meanings in Hokkien, while many of their counterparts in [[Mandarin Chinese]] have either fallen out of daily use, have been substituted with other words (some of which are borrowed from other languages while others are new developments), or have developed newer meanings. The same may be said of Hokkien as well, since some lexical meaning evolved in step with Mandarin while others are wholly innovative developments.

This table shows some Hokkien dialect words from Classical Chinese, as contrasted to the written Chinese standard, Mandarin:

=== Words from Minyue ===
Some commonly used words, shared by all{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{dubious|date=November 2016}} [[Min Chinese]] dialects, came from the ancient [[Minyue language]]s. [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] suggested that these languages were [[Austroasiatic]]. Some terms are thought be cognates with words in [[Tai Kadai]] and [[Austronesian]] languages. They include the following examples, compared to the [[Fuzhou dialect]], a [[Min Dong language]]:

=== Loanwords ===
[[Loanword]]s are not unusual among Hokkien dialects, as speakers readily adopted indigenous terms of the languages they came in contact with. As a result, there is a plethora of loanwords that are not mutually comprehensible among Hokkien dialects.

[[Taiwanese Hokkien]], as a result of linguistic contact with [[Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan |script-title=zh:臺灣閩南語外來詞|year=2011|publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C. |language=Chinese |accessdate=8 July 2011 |location=Taiwan |url=http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/index/fulu_wailaici.jsp }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Formosan languages]], contains many loanwords from these languages. Many words have also been formed as [[calque]]s from Mandarin, and speakers will often directly use Mandarin vocabulary through codeswitching. Among these include the following examples:
*'toilet' - ''piān-só͘'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|便所}}}}) from Japanese {{nihongo4||便所|benjo}}
*:Other Hokkien variants: {{lang|zh-hant|屎礐}} (''sái-ha̍k''), {{lang|zh-hant|廁所}} (''chhek-só͘'')
*'car' - ''chū-tōng-chhia'' ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|自動車}}}}) from Japanese {{nihongo4||自動車|jidōsha}}
*:Other Hokkien variants: {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|風}}車}} (''hong-chhia''), {{lang|zh-hant|汽車}} (''khì-chhia'')
*'to admire' - ''kám-sim'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|感心}}}})  from Japanese {{nihongo4||感心|kanshin}}
*:Other Hokkien variants: {{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|感動}}}} (''kám-tōng'')
*'fruit' - ''chúi-ké / chúi-kóe / chúi-kér'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|水果}}}}) from Mandarin ({{zh|labels=no |c=水果|p=shuǐguǒ}})
*:Other Hokkien variants: {{lang|zh|果子}} (''ké-chí / kóe-chí / kér-chí'')

[[Singaporean Hokkien]], [[Penang Hokkien]] and other Malaysian Hokkien dialects tend to draw loanwords from [[Malay language|Malay]], [[English language|English]] as well as other Chinese dialects, primarily [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]. Examples include:
*'but' - ''tapi'', from Malay
*:Other Hokkien variants: 但是 （''tān-sī''）
*'doctor' - 老君 ''lu-gun'', from Malay ''dukun''
*:Other Hokkien variants: 醫生(''i-sing'')
*'stone/rock' - ''batu'', from Malay ''batu''
*:Other Hokkien variants: 石头(''tsio-tau'')
*'market' - 巴剎 ''pa-sat'', from Malay	''pasar'' from Persian ''[[bazaar]]'' (بازار)&lt;ref name="似懂非懂2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=似懂非懂|title=卑南覓|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6grAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1873#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=8 December 2006|publisher=Hyweb Technology Co. Ltd.|pages=1873–|id=GGKEY:TPZ824QU3UG}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Other Hokkien variants: 市場 (''chhī-tiûⁿ'')
*'they' - 伊儂 ''i lâng'' from Teochew (i1 nang5)
*:Other Hokkien variants: 𪜶 (''in'')
*'together' - 做瓠 ''chò-bú'' from Teochew 做瓠 (jo3 bu5)
*:Other Hokkien variants: 做夥 (chò-hóe), 同齊 (tâng-chê) or 鬥陣 (tàu-tīn)
*茶箍 (Sap-bûn) from Malay ''sabun'' from Arabic ''ṣābūn'' (صابون).&lt;ref name="似懂非懂2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://banlam.tawa.asia/2012/10/soap-feizhao-hokkien-sabun.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watters1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Watters|title=Essays on the Chinese Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxMTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA346 |year=1889|publisher=Presbyterian Mission Press|pages=346–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippine Hokkien]] dialects, as a result of centuries-old contact with both Philippine language and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] also incorporate words from these languages. Examples include:
*'cup' - ''ba-su'', from Spanish ''vaso'' and Tagalog ''baso''
*:Other Hokkien variants: 杯子 (''poe-á'')
*'office' - ''o-pi-sin'', from Spanish ''oficina'' and Tagalog ''opisina''
*:Other Hokkien variants: 辦公室 (''pān-kong-sek'')
*'soap' - ''sa-bun'', from Spanish ''jabon'' and Tagalog ''sabon''
*:Other Hokkien variants:
*'but' - ''ka-so'', from Tagalog ''kaso''
*:Other Hokkien variants: 但是 (''tan-si'')
*: (''em-ko'')

==Standard Hokkien==
Hokkien originated from [[Quanzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiwan.cn/twzlk/twgk/yywz/200512/t20051226_222977.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2016}} After the [[Opium War]] in 1842, [[Xiamen]] (Amoy) became one of the major [[treaty port]]s to be opened for trade with the outside world. From the mid-19th century onwards, [[Xiamen]] slowly developed to become the political and economical center of the Hokkien speaking region in China. This caused [[Amoy dialect]] to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]]. From the mid-19th century until the end of [[World War II]], {{citation needed|date=November 2016}} western diplomats usually learned Amoy as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the Hokkien-speaking populace in China or South-East Asia. In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Taiwan]]{{who|date=November 2016}} also held [[Amoy Minnan]] as its standard and tended to incline towards Amoy dialect.

However, from the 1980s onwards, the development of [[Hokkien pop|Taiwanese Min Nan]] pop music and media industry in [[Taiwan]] caused the Hokkien cultural hub to shift from [[Xiamen]] to [[Taiwan]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The flourishing [[Hokkien entertainment media|Taiwanese Min Nan entertainment and media industry]] from Taiwan in the 1990s and early 21st century led Taiwan to emerge as the new significant cultural hub for Hokkien.

In the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and [[mother tongue]] movement in Taiwan, [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, [[Taiwan]] became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhu.edu.tw/~society/e-j/45/45-16.htm |script-title=zh:《網路社會學通訊期刊》第45期，2005年03月15日 |publisher=Nhu.edu.tw |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mother tongue]] movement in Taiwan even influenced [[Xiamen]] (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, [[Xiamen]] also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4d3f04b40100ibvw.html |script-title=zh:有感于厦门学校“闽南语教学进课堂”_博客臧_新浪博客 |website=[[Sina Weibo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] in [[Taiwan]] also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tai-lo]] as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Taiwanese degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education. Taiwan also has its own Hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in Hokkien.

Thus by the 21st century, Taiwan is one of the most significant Hokkien cultural hubs of the world. The historical changes and development in Taiwan had led [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] to become the more influential pole of the Hokkien dialect after the mid-20th century. Today, [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] [[prestige dialect]] (Taiyu Youshiqiang/Tongxinqiang {{lang|zh-hant|台語優勢腔/通行腔}}), which is based on [[Tainan]] variant and heard on Taiwanese Hokkien media.

==Writing systems==
{{main|Written Hokkien}}
{{further|Comparison of Hokkien writing systems}}

===Chinese script===

Hokkien dialects are typically written using [[Chinese character]]s ({{lang|zh-hant|漢字}}, ''Hàn-jī''). However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on [[classical Chinese]], not the vernacular and spoken form. Furthermore, the character inventory used for Mandarin (standard written Chinese) does not correspond to Hokkien words, and there are a large number of informal characters ({{lang|zh|替字}}, ''thè-jī'' or ''thòe-jī''; 'substitute characters') which are unique to Hokkien (as is the case with [[written Cantonese|Cantonese]]). For instance, about 20 to 25% of Taiwanese morphemes lack an appropriate or standard Chinese character.&lt;ref name="mothertongue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/readings/mair/taiwanese.html|title=How to Forget Your Mother Tongue and Remember Your National Language|last=Mair|first=Victor H. |authorlink=Victor H. Mair |date=2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Hokkien morphemes have standard designated characters, they are not always etymological or phono-semantic. Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters are commonly borrowed or substituted to represent a particular morpheme. Examples include "beautiful" ({{lang|zh|美}} ''bí'' is the literary form), whose vernacular morpheme ''suí'' is represented by characters like {{lang|zh|媠}} (an obsolete character), {{lang|zh|婎}} (a vernacular reading of this character) and even {{lang|zh|水}} (transliteration of the sound ''suí''), or "tall"  ({{lang|zh|高}} ''ko'' is the literary form), whose morpheme ''kôan'' is {{lang|zh-hant|懸}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Iûⁿ, Ún-giân |script-title=zh:台語線頂字典 |language=Taiwanese, Chinese |trans-title=Taiwanese Hokkien Online Character Dictionary |url=http://210.240.194.97/TG/jitian/tgjt.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common grammatical particles are not exempt; the negation particle ''m̄'' (not) is variously represented by {{lang|zh|毋}}, {{lang|zh|呣}} or {{lang|zh|唔}}, among others. In other cases, characters are invented to represent a particular morpheme (a common example is the character {{lang|zh|[[wikt:𪜶|𪜶]]}} ''in'', which represents the personal pronoun "they"). In addition, some characters have multiple and unrelated pronunciations, adapted to represent Hokkien words. For example, the Hokkien word ''bah'' ("meat") has been reduced to the character {{lang|zh|肉}}, which has etymologically unrelated colloquial and literary readings (''he̍k'' and ''jio̍k'', respectively).{{sfnp|Klöter|2005|p=21}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |script-title=zh:臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典 |trans-title=Dictionary of Frequently-Used Taiwan Minnan |at=#2607 |publisher=Ministry of Education, R.O.C. |date=2013 |language=Chinese |url=http://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/mobile/result_detail.jsp?n_no=2607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case is the word 'to eat,' ''chia̍h'', which is often transcribed in Taiwanese newspapers and media as {{lang|zh|呷}} (a Mandarin transliteration, ''xiā'', to approximate the Hokkien term), even though its recommended character in dictionaries is {{lang|zh|食}}.&lt;ref name="tw-mand"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hsieh|first=Shelley Ching-yu|date=October 2005|title= Taiwanese Loanwords in Mandarin Chinese: Language Interaction in Taiwan|journal=Taiwan Papers|publisher=Southern Taiwan University of Technology|volume=5|url=http://myweb.ncku.edu.tw/~shelley/publication/38._Taiwanese_Loan_Words_in_Mandarin_Chinese-Hsieh_Ching-yu.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, unlike Cantonese, Hokkien does not have a universally accepted standardized character set. Thus, there is some variation in the characters used to express certain words and characters can be ambiguous in meaning. In 2007, the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Republic of China]] formulated and released a standard character set to overcome these difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.tw/files/bulletin/M0001/300iongji_960523.pdf|script-title=zh:參、臺灣閩南語|work=National Languages Committee|publisher=ROC Ministry of Education|language=Chinese|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standard Chinese characters for writing [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] are now taught in schools in Taiwan.

===Latin script===
Hokkien, especially [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], is sometimes written in the [[Latin script]] using one of several alphabets. Of these the most popular is [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]], developed first by [[Presbyterian]] [[missionaries]] in China and later by the indigenous [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. Use of this script and orthography has been actively promoted since the late 19th century. The use of a mixed script of Han characters and Latin letters is also seen, though remains uncommon. Other Latin-based alphabets also exist.

Min Nan texts, all Hokkien, can be dated back to the 16th century. One example is the ''[[Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china]]'', presumably written after 1587 by the Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in the [[Philippines]]. Another is a [[Ming Dynasty]] script of a play called ''[[Tale of the Lychee Mirror]]'' (1566), supposedly the earliest Southern Min colloquial text, although it is written in [[Teochew dialect]].

Taiwan has developed a Latin alphabet for [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], derived from POJ, known as [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Tai-lo]]. Since 2006, it has been officially promoted by Taiwan's [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] and taught in Taiwanese schools. [[Xiamen University]] has also developed an alphabet based on Pinyin called [[Bbánlám pìngyīm]].

===Computing===
[[File:亻因 (in).png|thumb|The character for the third person pronoun (they) in some Hokkien dialects, 𪜶 (''in''), is now supported by the Unicode Standard at U+2A736.]]
Hokkien is registered as "Southern Min" per RFC 3066 as [http://www.iana.org/assignments/lang-tags/zh-min-nan zh-min-nan].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso639/iana-lang-assignments.html |title=RFC 3066 Language code assignments |publisher=Evertype.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing Hokkien in [[Chinese characters]], some writers create 'new' characters when they consider it impossible to use directly or borrow existing ones; this corresponds to similar practices in character usage in [[Written Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Chữ Nôm|Vietnamese chữ nôm]], [[Hanja|Korean hanja]] and [[Kanji|Japanese kanji]]. Some of these are not encoded in [[Unicode]] (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: [[Universal Character Set]]), thus creating problems in computer processing.

All [[Latin]] characters required by [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] can be represented using [[Unicode]] (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: [[Universal Character Set]]), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than ''o'', written with a '''dot above right''', was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character ''[[Interpunct]]'' (U+00B7, ''·'') or less commonly the combining character ''dot above'' (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC [[working group]] in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070628163947/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/wg2/ ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2]—to encode a new combining character ''dot above right''. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents [http://www.evertype.com/standards/la/taioan.html N1593], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311082219/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n2507 N2507], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928065416/http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n2628 N2628],

Hokkien (or Min Nan) can trace its roots through the [[Tang Dynasty]] and also even further to the people of the [[Baiyue]], the indigenous non-Han people of modern-day southern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 2002, the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], a party with about 10% of the [[Legislative Yuan]] seats at the time, suggested making Taiwanese a second official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lin Mei-chun |title=Hokkien should be given official status, says TSU |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2002/03/10/0000127068 |work=Taipei Times|date=10 Mar 2002 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal encountered strong opposition not only from [[Mainland Chinese|Mainlander]] groups but also from [[Hakka]] and [[Taiwanese aboriginal]] groups who felt that it would slight their home languages, as well as others including Hoklo who objected to the proposal on logistical grounds and on the grounds that it would increase ethnic tensions. Because of these objections, support for this measure was lukewarm among moderate [[Taiwan independence]] supporters, and the proposal did not pass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14460">'''Imperial Manila''' is a [[pejorative]] [[epithet]] used by sectors of [[Filipino people|Philippine]] society and non-[[Manileño]]s to express the idea that all the affairs of the [[Philippines]], whether in [[politics of the Philippines|politics]], [[economy of the Philippines|economy and business]] or [[culture of the Philippines|culture]], are decided by what goes on in the capital region, [[Metro Manila]] without considering the needs of the rest of the country, largely because of [[centralized government]] and urbanite [[snob]]bery.&lt;ref name=Mnez1&gt;{{cite book|last=Martínez|first=David|title=A Country of Our Own: Partitioning the Philippines|page=202|publisher=Bisaya Books|year=2004|place=Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-9760613-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sentiment is sometimes expressed by the proverb "Not a leaf can fall in our country without [[Malacañang]]'s permission."{{efn|An example of this proverb's use can be found the following quote from David C. Martínez: &lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e've left sacred and untouched, spotless and unsullied, the same centralist authority where near-absolute political power continues to reside: Imperial Manila.

==History==
It is unknown when the term was first used, but there are political writers, particularly those living outside Metro Manila, who associate this term with the [[People Power Revolution]] because it was believed that the country's former president, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], was toppled from his position without the participation of Filipinos living in areas outside of the capital region. In the 1970s, Marcos borrowed $2.5 billion USD from the World Bank in order to establish Manila as a globally-competitive city. The funding facilitated government-backed expenditures on infrastructure and urban developments that displaced and relocated the urban poor while benefitting elites, who were able to profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortega|first=Arnisson Andre C.|date=2016-03-01|title=Manila's metropolitan landscape of gentrification: Global urban development, accumulation by dispossession &amp; neoliberal warfare against informality|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718516300458|journal=Geoforum|volume=70|pages=35–50|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], Amando Doronila wrote that:

{{cquote|People power movements have been an Imperial Manila phenomenon. Their playing field is [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. They have excluded the ''provincianos'' from their movement with their insufferable arrogance and snobbery...ignoring the existence of the toiling masses and peasants in agrarian Philippines.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news| first=Amando| last=Doronila| title=Time for paradigm shift| date=August 28, 2006| pages=A1| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Uses==

===Politics===
The term was used by Philippine President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] in her 2006 [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]], which she said has "slowed down progress, has become open to over-competition and oppressed the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and its people".&lt;ref name=Sona&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.ph/sona/sonatext2006.asp| title=2006 State of the Nation Address of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo| date=July 24, 2006| language=Tagalog| accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was because of the country's centralized government that provincial governments favor [[constitutional amendment]]s for a shift to [[Federalism in the Philippines|federal government]], as well as supporting Arroyo and rejecting calls from Manila-based activist groups demanding for her resignation due to [[Political corruption|corruption]] charges particularly the [[Philippine National Broadband Network controversy]].&lt;ref name=Federalism&gt;{{cite news| title=Arroyo pushing for federal government| date=August 2, 2004| publisher=Taipei Times| url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/08/02/2003181423| accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramos&gt;{{cite news| first=Cynthia| last=Balanan| title=Ramos still for Arroyo; governors go all out| date=February 14, 2008| publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer| url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080214-118734/Ramos-still-for-Arroyo-governors-go-all-out|display-authors=et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local [[opinion poll]]s have also been lambasted for solely sampling "Imperial Manila-based residents" when it comes to surveys that deal with nationwide issues.&lt;ref name=Editorial&gt;{{cite web| author=Cruz, Rafael A.| url=http://www.pbs.gov.ph/inc_archive%20mar%202206.asp| title=Lucrative Industry| publisher=Philippine Broadcasting Service| date=March 22, 2006| language=Tagalog| accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the term also appears in government websites such as those of the [[League of Provinces of the Philippines|League of Provinces]] and the [[Bohol|Province of Bohol]].&lt;ref name=League&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpp.gov.ph/aug07-news5.html |title=Govs give PGMA ovation for her SONA and social payback programs |publisher=League of Provinces of the Philippines official website |date=August 14, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904144018/http://www.lpp.gov.ph/aug07-news5.html |archivedate=September 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohol&gt;{{cite news|first=June S. |last=Blanco |title=Guv calls for sobriety |date=February 16, 2007 |publisher=Bohol.gov.ph |url=http://www.bohol.gov.ph/news/news.php?newsid=210 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326205021/http://www.bohol.gov.ph/news/news.php?newsid=210 |archivedate=March 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
{{See also|Internal colonialism}}
Officials of [[Mindanao]]-based rebel group [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] have blamed "Imperial Manila" for making the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Muslim Mindanao region]] the poorest in the country, stating that "the consequence of [[Internal colonialism#Philippines|neocolonialism]] has deprived our people to run themselves unfettered and unhampered." Government figures show that the region's poverty incidence in 2006 is at 55.3%, with three of its six provinces (namely [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Maguindanao]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]) listed among the country's ten poorest provinces.&lt;ref name=ARMM&gt;{{cite news| title='Imperial Manila' blamed for poverty in ARMM| publisher=GMANews.tv| date=March 10, 2008| url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/83995/Imperial-Manila-blamed-for-poverty-in-ARMM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Imperial Manila" is also used by many in the business sector in reference to the notion that [[advertising]] or [[marketing]] a product only requires a single campaign that would work in [[Mega Manila]] (another Manilacentric term used most frequently by the [[Media of the Philippines|media]]), thinking that it would also attract customers in the provinces. Advertising agencies in Metro Manila are also faulted for publishing print advertisements in Manila-based newspapers that would reach other cities by mid-morning (when the residents have already read their own local daily) or running a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]] at a [[Prime time|primetime]] slot of 21:00 in Manila while the rest of the country is already asleep.&lt;ref name=Customer&gt;{{cite web| url=http://adformatix.com/site/customer_is_out_there.html| title=The Myopia of Manila Marketers| publisher=Adformatix.com| accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, economists from the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[World Bank]] made statements encouraging the [[Philippine government]] to further concentrate national economic activity within Metro Manila rather than [[Federalism in the Philippines|disperse it]] around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economists say Manila should become more dense|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/01/12/09/economists-say-manila-should-become-more-dense|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=ABS-CBNNews.com|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in some parts of [[Luzon]], in some scattered areas in [[Visayas]] and in [[Mindanao]], [[rolling blackout]]s happen almost daily. Metro Manila commuters, too, many of whom have had to [[Internal migration|leave their families]] in other parts of the country in order to [[Economic migrant|look for work]], suffer from the effects of traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/764749/elections-2016-agenda-next-president-traffic-voteph2016 | title=Agenda of the next president: Traffic &amp;#124; Inquirer News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magkilat, B.

===Culture===

The term is also used, particularly in [[Cebu Province|Cebu]], in conjunction with the perceived [[Linguistic imperialism|imposition]] of the [[Tagalog language]],&lt;ref name=Insulto&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tawaghustisya.com/sakal1.html| author=Quimco, Ver| title=Insulto, Insulto, Insulto| publisher=Call for Justice, Inc. official website| language=Cebuano| accessdate=2008-02-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325200017/http://www.tawaghustisya.com/sakal1.html |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Almario, V.

The legal imposition of Tagalog as a national symbol also has social implications, such as pressure to use the words ''po'' and ''opo'' (a contraction of ''oo po'', [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorifics]] used for elders and persons of authority),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/280857/lifestyle/artandculture/reconnecting-to-our-inner-anting-anting | title=Reconnecting to our inner anting-anting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daly P.

Notably, Tagalog-speakers themselves who are not from the capital region (e.g. [[CALABARZON]] or [[MIMAROPA]]) are often derided as unsophisticated ''promdi'' (hicks or country bumpkins) because of their accent, grammar, vocabulary or rural customs.&lt;ref&gt;Ranada, P.

The '''IOB format''' (short for inside, outside, beginning) is a common tagging format for tagging tokens in a chunking task in computational linguistics, (ex. [[named-entity recognition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entity Recognition|url=http://www.evalita.it/2009/tasks/entity}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was presented by Ramshaw and Marcus in their paper "Text Chunking using Transformation-Based Learning", 1995 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=Text Chunking using Transformation-Based Learning|author=Ramshaw and Marcus|year=1995|arxiv=cmp-lg/9505040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B- prefix before a tag indicates that the tag is the beginning of a chunk, and an I- prefix before a tag indicates that the tag is inside a chunk. The B- tag is used only when a tag is followed by a tag of the same type without O tokens between them. An O tag indicates that a token belongs to no chunk.

Another similar format which is widely used is IOB2 format, which is the same as the IOB format with the difference that the B- tag is used in the beginning of every chunk (i.e. all chunks start with the B- tag).

A readable introduction to entity tagging is given in Bob Carpenter's blog post, "Coding Chunkers as Taggers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coding Chunkers as Taggers: IO, BIO, BMEWO, and BMEWO+|url=https://lingpipe-blog.com/2009/10/14/coding-chunkers-as-taggers-io-bio-bmewo-and-bmewo/|author=Bob Carpenter|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'BIO' is plausibly a synonym for 'IOB'.

An example with IOB format:

&lt;pre&gt;Alex I-PER
is O
going O
to O
Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC&lt;/pre&gt;An example with IOB2 format:&lt;pre&gt;
Alex B-PER

Los B-LOC
Angeles I-LOC
&lt;/pre&gt;

The '''International Association of Multilingualism (IAM)''' is an academic, [[scientific]] professional association whose members undertake research in all areas of [[linguistics]] dealing with all facets of [[multilingualism]]. Research has focused on tri- and quadruple language acquisition by children, as well as on societal instances of multilingualism or on cases of individual multilingual repertoires, for example. IAM members work in various linguistic fields, including [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[educational linguistics]], [[language acquisition]] and [[applied linguistics]].

== History ==

The IAM was founded in 2003 by [[Jasone Cenoz]], [[Britta Hufeisen]], and [[Ulrike Jessner]] during the conference at the [[Institute of Technology in Tralee]], Ireland.

== Presidents ==
*2005-2009 Britta Hufeisen
*2009–2014 Ulrike Jessner
*2014-2016 Jasone Cenoz

Current board members are from universities in Germany, Israel, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, UK and the US.

== Activities ==
The members organize biannual conferences:
*1999 1st conference at the University of Innsbruck, Austria
*2001 2nd conference at the [[Institute of Technology in Tralee]], Ireland
*2003 3rd conference at the [[Stenden Hogeschool|Stenden Hogeschool Leeuwarden]], Netherland
*2005 4th conference at the [[University of Fribourg]], Switzerland
*2007 5th conference at the [[University of Stirling]], UK

*2011 7th conference at [[Warsaw University]], Poland
*2012 8th conference in [[University Jaume I|UniversityJaume I, Castelló de la Plana]], Spain
*2014 9th conference in Uppsala, Sweden.

Although the dominant language of conference is English, all languages are welcome and papers are often held in other languages besides English, such as French, German or Spanish.

In 2010 a biannual Round Table Discussion on specific topics was founded by founding member [[Jean-Marc Dewaele]] at [[Birkbeck College]] in the United Kingdom, which was followed by a Round Table Discussion in 2012 in the United States at the MIT, organized by Suzanne Flynn, and 2013 at the [[University of Szczyrk]] in Poland, organized by Danuta Gabrys-Barker.
The IAM held a Research Network meeting at the [[Association Internationale de la Linguistique Appliquée|AILA]] conferences in Essen, Germany in 2008 and is a member of the Professional Network Forum with the [[European Center for Modern Languages]] in Graz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecml.at/Aboutus/professionalnetworkforum/tabid/137/language/en-GB/Default.aspx The ECML and the Professional Network Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 2004 the IAM has had a publication venue, the [[International Journal of Multilingualism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rmjm20/current#.UmN6ZhXwC1s International Journal of Multilingualism on Taylor &amp; Francis Online]&lt;/ref&gt; originally edited by Jasone Cenoz, Spain, and Ulrike Jessner, Austria. The current editors are Danuta Gabrys-Barker, Poland, and Eva Vetter, Austria. After several years of two issues annually, it is now published four times annually. The language of publication is English.
A newsletter is also distributed to association members approximately twice annually.
A book series on multilingualism and multiple language learning and acquisition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paedagogik.de/index.php?m=subclass2&amp;subgrp=Mehrsprachigkeit%20und%20multiples%20Sprachenlernen&amp;grp=Mehrsprachigkeit Book series on multilingualism and multiple language learning and acquisition on Schneider Verlag Hohengehren GmbH]&lt;/ref&gt; is linked to the IAM via the editorial board, which is identical to the board of the IAM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4848">A '''mancation''' is a male-only [[Tourism|vacation]]. The term is believed to have come about in [[2000s (decade)|the decade of the 2000s]], although the concept had existed considerably before then.

==Travel industry trend==
The concept of a gender specific trip has "been around since the first caveman took his club and went hunting with the others in the tribe."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Jayne. [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-12-28-mancations_x.htm "Need to get away? Make it a guy thing; Male bonding goes to the next level: ‘Mancations’"], USA Today, Dec. 29. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, mancation has become a buzzword in the travel business lately.{{when|date=January 2013}} Tapping into the success of marketing all-girls getaway packages, hotels and resorts have started featuring [[male bonding|all-male bonding]] vacation packages that include everything from [[poker]], to [[extreme sports]], to [[spa treatment]]s.&lt;ref name="Morago"&gt;Morago, Greg. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29077100_ITM "BOYS GONE WILD; TIME OFF NO LONGER A TIMEOUT FOR FUN-LOVING GUYS"], Hartford Courant, Dec. 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Golfing is the most popular activity for all-male vacation groups,&lt;ref name="Shattuck"/&gt; but destinations have developed unique programs to accommodate the growing trend. The latest mancation packages offer spiritual healing, culinary instruction, yoga, and sexual reawakening.&lt;ref name="Morago"/&gt;

In promoting mancations, some organizers "have discovered that men tend to create ‘micro affinity groups’ in childhood, college, or grad school, and that the groups often take trips together."&lt;ref&gt;Lebovits, Susan Chaityn. [http://www.boston.com/yourlife/articles/2007/02/27/fly_a_mig_swim_with_sharks_theyre_in/ "Fly a MiG? Swim with sharks? They're In!"], The Boston Globe, Feb. 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one online survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imin.com/imin/iminHome/about/press.jsp|title=I'm in! - About Us|work=I'm in!|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 34% of male respondents take at least one mancation every year. It is estimated that about 20 million American men go on mancations every year and collectively spend between $10 billion to $12 billion during these excursions.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; The majority of these men are married and between the ages of thirty to fifty-five years old.&lt;ref name="Morago"/&gt;

During the summer of 2006, half of the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotel]] chain’s 50 properties in the United States created mancation packages. For example, the Fairmont Chicago mancation package consists of a three-course steak dinner, a cocktail seminar, whiskey tasting, cigars, and poker.&lt;ref name="Chicago"/&gt;

A 2008 study conducted by the Synovate research firm showed that 42% of men have taken a mancation, and 42% would like to in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Jim Beam and Knob Creek Bourbons Celebrate National Bourbon Heritage Month with a Bourbon Inspired Mancation|publisher=Beam Global Spirits &amp; Wine |date=2008-08-04 |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080804/aqm010.html?.v=61 |format= |language= |accessdate=2008-08-07 |quote=Male Bonding Booms with Affordable Guys' Getaway Options; 64 Percent of Men Prefer Kentucky's Bourbon Trail over 'Vegas-type' Experience for Guys' Weekend. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jim Beam]] and [[Knob Creek (bourbon)|Knob Creek]] bourbon brands used the statistics to promote a guys' trip to the Bourbon Trail in Kentucky for [[National Bourbon Heritage Month]], occurring annually in September.

==Etymology==
During the summer of 2006, actor [[Vince Vaughn]] said it in the romantic comedy film ''[[The Break-Up]]'', written by Jay Lavender and Jeremy Garelick, stating: "I’m excited. I look at it like I’m on a mancation." &lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Pellizzari, Chris. "MEN ON VACATION; Hotels and resorts are now offering guys the perfect mancations", Chicago Tribune, Oct. 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2007, New Line Cinema and Benderspink [[green-light]]ed a comedy written by [[Jared Bush]] entitled ''Mancation'', which follows a man who believes his younger brother’s manhood has been robbed by marriage. In an attempt to regain this manhood, he takes his little brother on a "testosterone-filled 'mancation.'" &lt;ref&gt;McNary, Dave. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963288.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Mancation "New Line, Bush take a 'Mancation'"], Daily Variety, April 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other slang terms associated with getaways for groups of men are "mancursions", "man trips" or "fellas trips".&lt;ref name="Shattuck"&gt;Shattuck, Harry. "Hang out with your buds on men-only ‘mancation’", The Houston Chronicle, Jan. 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moshe Zalman Feiglin''' ({{lang-he-n|משה פייגלין}}, born 31 July 1962) is an [[Israel]]i politician and columnist, and the leader of [[libertarian]] [[Zionist]] party [[Zehut]]. A former member of [[Likud]], he headed the [[Manhigut Yehudit]] (''Jewish Leadership'') faction within the party, and represented Likud in the [[Knesset]] between 2013 and 2015.

Prior to becoming a Knesset member, Feiglin co-founded the [[Zo Artzeinu]] ("This is our Land") movement with [[Shmuel Sackett]] in 1993 to protest the [[Oslo Accords]]. On 8 August 1995, eighty intersections throughout the country were blocked in a massive act of civil disobedience against the Oslo process. As a result of his activities, Feiglin was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for [[sedition]] against the state by Israel's Supreme Court. The sentence was later commuted to community service.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081215005437/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYCCZRWjMCmnGrgrArL6LX2zSdCA ''Anti-Arab hopeful irks Israel's Netanyahu'', AFP December 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1996, Feiglin established the Manhigut Yehudit movement; it joined Likud in 2000, with Feiglin declaring that he would be a candidate for chairmanship of the party as a springboard for premiership of the State of Israel.

In early January 2015, Feiglin announced that he was leaving the Likud and forming his own party, after his poor showing in the Likud primaries the previous month. However, he was unable to form a new party in time for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|Knesset elections]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ezra|first1=Hezki|title=Moshe Feiglin Leaves Likud, Forms New Party|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/189546#.VLLKcGTF9WQ|website=Israel National News|publisher=Arutz Sheva 7|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Feiglin was born in [[Haifa]] in 1962, the son of Ya'akov Zvi and Esther Feiglin. His ancestors moved to Palestine from [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] during the [[First Aliyah]].&lt;ref name=MY&gt;[https://www.jewishisrael.org/moshe-feiglin-biography/ Moshe Feiglin: Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090658/https://www.jewishisrael.org/moshe-feiglin-biography/ |date=2015-04-02 }} Manhigut Yehudit&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was the first child born in [[Metula]], and some of his ancestors were among the founders of several settlements, including [[Mishmar HaYarden (moshava)|Mishmar HaYarden]], [[Hadera]], and [[Kinneret, Israel|Kinneret]].&lt;ref name=MY/&gt; His father served in the [[Jewish Settlement Police]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate era]]. His family later moved to [[Rehovot]], where he attended the local Tachkemoni school of the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi movement]], and subsequently graduated from Rabbi [[Haim Drukman]]'s [[Yeshivat Or Etzion]].

=== Army service and early career===
Feiglin enlisted in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] for the full mandatory three-year term, despite the fact that the commonly accepted enlistment path among religiously observant Israelis is through the [[Hesder]] program, which allows Orthodox Jewish men to pursue religious studies for a year and a half at an approved Yeshiva, and have that time deducted from their mandatory service. During his [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] national service, Feiglin served in the [[Engineering Corps (Israel)|Engineering Corps]].&lt;ref name=MY/&gt; He later signed on to one additional year as a career soldier, and attained the rank of Captain. He fought in the [[1982 Lebanon War]].

Feiglin once ran a company that used rope [[rappelling]] in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yashar|first1=Ari|title=Police Suspect Prior Incident Connected to Rappeler's Murder|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/185671#.VFfeLYfXOHk|accessdate=3 November 2014|agency=Israel National News|publisher=Arutz Sheva|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
===Manhigut Yehudit===
Feiglin co-founded the Manhigut Yehudit movement in 1996. It began as a brainchild of Feiglin and a friend of his, Moti Karpel, who established the organization as the continuation of the Zo Artzeinu protest movement. The main tactical difference between the two in Feiglin's thought is that Zo Artzeinu protested government policy without suggesting an alternative, whereas Manhigut Yehudit seeks to become the government and be the alternative.

Lacking the tools to do this, and without a political party with which to stake his run, he was approached by a founding member of the Likud party and participant in the Zo Artzeinu protests who proposed that Feiglin register for the Likud party and register, in turn, the thousands who participated in the protests, thereby building a support base for himself in the party, from which he could run for the party presidency and, in turn, Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Feiglin, Moshe.&lt;u&gt;מלחמת החלומות&lt;/u&gt;, Manhigut Yehudit: 2005, pp. 378–382&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Feiglin's own words, Manhigut Yehudit was started to "return the country to the people and lead the State of Israel through authentic Jewish values".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/moshe-feiglin-religious-jew-who-might-be-future-israeli-prime-minister-1105029 Moshe Feiglin: The Religious Jew Who Might Be A Future Israeli Prime Minister] International Business Times, 26 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin has demanded that Israeli schools stop teaching the Arab view of the history of Israel, such as describing the creation of the State of Israel as a disaster (''nakba'' in Arabic).

Feiglin says that the movement's leadership will arise from "those who have a deep commitment to [[Torah]] values". Still, 30 percent of its present members are secular (2005).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He opposes the surrender of what he regards as Jewish land, and has demanded the government take action against the estimated 50,000 illegal Arab structures built throughout the country. Feiglin has stated that Likud had "given up true Likud values and acquiesced in the [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Gaza evacuation]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?ID=1005&amp;t=Likud-Leans-Farther-To-Right Likud Leans Farther To Right] IsraCast, 9 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Feiglin has been on public record supporting the transfer of those Arab citizens of Israel who do not accept Jewish sovereignty over the state. This emigration would be encouraged with financial incentives.

===Likud===
[[File:Feiglin-2012-campaign.jpg|thumbnail|right|Moshe Feiglin campaigning with supporters for the Likud leadership primaries, 2012]]
In December 2005, Feiglin ran for Likud chairman and won 12.5% of the votes, coming third out of seven candidates, after [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and [[Silvan Shalom]]. He attempted to run for a slot on the party's [[Knesset]] list, but encountered severe opposition from Netanyahu, who delayed party elections and advocated making changes to its charter to bar "anyone who has served three or more months in prison" from running as a Likud MK. This would have prevented Feiglin, who served a six-month sentence in the mid-1990s for civil disobedience, from running for either an MK or leadership position in the future. Feiglin withdrew from the race on 3 January 2006, following the release of a statement from the Likud party election chairman declaring, in agreement with a prior decision by the Israeli High Court, that Feiglin's conviction was not for "dishonorable" violations of the law, allowing him to participate in future Likud affairs.

In the 14 August 2007 primaries, Feiglin nearly doubled his previous showing and received 23.4% of the votes to Netanyahu's 72.8%. Netanyahu, fearing a strong showing by Feiglin, tried to have him ousted from the party prior to the vote, and said he would continue such efforts. On 10 December 2008, Feiglin was won twentieth place in the Likud primaries.&lt;ref name=likudprimary&gt;{{Cite news

In an article written in 2009, Feiglin stated: "Sad to say, Prime Minister Netanyahu is a pitiful puppet of [[Shimon Peres|Peres]] and his cohorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=How to Save Israel from the Impending Danger|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article029.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121175401/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article029.html|archive-date=21 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feiglin ran against Netanyahu again in the [[Likud leadership election, 2012|2012 Likud leadership election]], held on 31 January 2012, and again received 23% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Likud MK's fear Feiglin will drive centrist voters away|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/likud-mks-fear-feiglin-will-drive-centrist-voters-away-1.410498|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=Haaretz|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Likud primaries held in late 2012 to select candidates for the 2013 elections, Feiglin finished thirteenth,&lt;ref name="Nov. 26, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lis|first=Jonathan|title=In the Likud primaries held inn 2012 to select candidates for the 2013 elections, Feiglin was the 13th highest vote getter on the Likud ticket.|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/likud-party-takes-a-right-turn-in-primaries-sidelining-moderates-1.480731|publisher=Ha'aretz|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]].

Feiglin served as Deputy Speaker in the 19th Knesset. He and his Manhigut Yehudit faction suffered a serious setback in the [[Likud leadership election, 2014|December 2014 Likud primaries]], held in the run-up to the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 Knesset elections]], when he fell to the 36th position on the Likud list, making it unlikely he would be returned to the Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tzipi Hotovely Likely to Lose her Knesset Seat 99% of votes in: Hotovely in 26th spot, likely out as polls give Likud no more than 24 MKs.

Shortly after the elections, he announced that the new party was to be called [[Zehut]] (''Identity'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Feiglin-to-register-new-political-party-395625 Feiglin to register new political party] The Jerusalem Post, 30 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
Feiglin has openly stated that, though he is not opposed to peace, peace is not his goal,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6fUdpbejmM, time index 2:10&lt;/ref&gt; and would not be on the top of his agenda as Prime Minister. Rather, Feiglin's focus is on reforming Israel as an essentially Jewish State by acting on several campaigns on the religious, social, legal, and security fronts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishisrael.org/liberty-identity-meaning/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feiglin on liberty===
In a September 2014 article, Israel National News website wrote that, "MK Feiglin is widely recognized as a brilliant intellectual with highly original thoughts on numerous issues, including a libertarian philosophy that appeals to many non-religious people."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In a May 2012 article on liberty&lt;ref name="jewishisrael.org"&gt;http://www.jewishisrael.org/identity-liberty-meaning/&lt;/ref&gt; that originally appeared on the [[Maariv (newspaper)|NRG ''Maariv'']] Hebrew website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/364/934.html&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin wrote: "Liberty means fighting against coercion of all kinds; religious, anti-religious, economic, cultural, educational, and more. Liberty means allocating state land to the citizen. It means privatization of government firms to the public, and not to core shareholders. Liberty means liberalized communication - broadcasting license and not broadcast franchise. You want to open up a television or radio station? Buy a wavelength and broadcast as you please within the framework of the law. Liberty means restoring the responsibility for education to the parents, using the education coupon method. It means a gradual transfer to a professional volunteer army. Liberty means prohibiting biometric data bases or any other type of human designation. There is no difference in principle between sophisticated biological marking and tattooing an ID number; both turn our identities into the property of a third party. In both, we lose our freedom. Simply put: We have one G-d above us, and we should not be enslaved to another person or mechanism. The state is ours, and under no circumstance is the opposite true."

===Religious front===
Even though Feiglin is [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], he is against religious coercion, and is even against the establishment of religious political parties. He has come out against legislation such as the Chametz Law, which forbids selling leavened products on the Passover Holiday, when eating or owning leavened food products is prohibited by [[Halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/081/292.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a proponent of the civil marriage initiative in Israel which would allow any Israeli citizen to marry without the auspices of a religious cleric.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mflikud.co.il/contents/maamarim/maamarim69.1/maamarim69031.html&lt;/ref&gt; At present, [[marriage in Israel]] is impossible outside the confines of a religious system; hence, for tens of thousands of people with problematic religious status, it is impossible ever to get married in the country. The present system also places the power of divorce in the hand of the Religious courts, who are answerable only to the Supreme Courts. The civil marriage initiative would make the religious nature of marriage entirely voluntary, effectively separating religion and state in this matter.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Temple Mount===

Feiglin has advocated removing the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf]]'s control over the entire [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|al-Aqsa complex]], and suggested a synagogue should be established on the Temple Mount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Feiglin-to-question-legal-authority-legitimacy-of-Temple-Mount-Waqf-326184 Feiglin to question legal authority, legitimacy of Temple Mount Waqf]. Jerusalem Post. September 15, 2013. Retrieved September 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, at Feiglin's insistence, the Knesset debated the status of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Stormy-debate-Knesset-hosts-first-ever-parley-on-Temple-Mount-sovereignty-in-plenum-343562 Stormy debate: Knesset hosts first-ever parley on Temple Mount sovereignty in plenum]. Jerusalem Post. February 26, 2014. Retrieved September 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Feiglin's platform states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have to internalize that this is our Land - exclusively... Most important: We must expel the Moslem [[wakf]] from the Temple Mount and restore exclusive Israeli sovereignty over this most holy site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=Feiglin Platform|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/73/article7320.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119084252/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/73/article7320.html|archive-date=19 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Achieving Quiet in Gaza"===
In July 2014, during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], Feiglin outlined steps toward "achieving quiet in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]". His plan included attacking all of Gaza, its infrastructure and military sites, without regard to civilian "human shields". After conquering and annexing Gaza into Israel, that portion of Gaza's "enemy population that is innocent of wrong-doing and separated itself from the armed terrorists will be treated in accordance with international law and will be allowed to leave". After becoming part of Israel, Gaza would be re-populated by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/15326#.U9JOA7HPSSq My Outline for a Solution in Gaza] Israel National News, July 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He said the civilians of Gaza could go to [[Sinai]], and his plan would also "ease the housing crisis in Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/israel-far-right-gaza-moshe-feiglin_n_5621667.html 'Our Soldiers Are The Only Innocents In Gaza': Here's What Israel's Far-Right Is Saying]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2014, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper alleged that Feiglin had called for concentration camps in Gaza, "the conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters", and also for shipping the people living in Gaza across the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2715466/Israeli-official-calls-concentration-camps-Gaza-conquest-entire-Gaza-Strip-annihilation-fighting-forces-supporters.html#ixzz39RVFMrLb] Daily Mail, August 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In a TV show with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Feiglin denied that claim, saying he was talking about creating "sheltered areas" for the civilians of Gaza so that Israel could stop rockets by Hamas in a more effective way. He also said that he "definitely" supported "tent encampments" before the people in Gaza can be relocated to another place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/WATCH-CNNs-Blitzer-grills-Likud-MK-Feiglin-over-calls-for-Gaza-concentration-camp-370223 WATCH: CNN's Blitzer grills MK Feiglin over whether he called for 'Gaza concentration camp']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace plan==
Feiglin has proposed a plan to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14366&amp;Itemid=86 "Pay Gazans to leave, right-wing leader says"], in the Canadian Jewish News, 3 April 2008. By Sheri Shefa. Note that the article mistranslates "Yesha", an acronym for Judea, Samaria and Gaza, as merely Gaza. Feiglin's proposal was for all three of these regions.&lt;/ref&gt; His plan would include annexing all post-1967 land currently in Israel's hands and offering financial incentive for Palestinian families in these areas to emigrate to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/likud-hardliner-suggests-paying-palestinian-families-to-emigrate-from-west-bank Likud hardliner suggests paying Palestinian families to emigrate from West Bank] Times of Israel, January 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Feiglin pointed to a poll by An-Najah University in Nablus, which showed that one in three Palestinian Arabs would emigrate to other countries even without a financial incentive,&lt;ref name="TVNZ_898332"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425824/898332 |title=Palestinian emigration soars |date=22 November 2006 |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kokhavivpublications.com/2001/israel/oct/05/0110050920.html |title=The secret Exodus -- Palestinian Emigration |access-date=2008-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217112414/http://www.kokhavivpublications.com/2001/israel/oct/05/0110050920.html |archive-date=2009-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as supporting his plan. Feiglin also proposed that Israel actively encourage [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arabs]] to emigrate to the [[Arab world]], and provide assistance to any Arab who chooses to do so.

===Feiglin's views on Israel's Arab citizens===
About 20% of Israel's citizens are [[Israeli Arabs]]. Feiglin was asked about Israel's status as a "Jewish and democratic state" in a 2004 interview, and stated: "Why should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state?... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Jeffrey|title=Among the Settlers|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/31/040531fa_fact2_a?currentPage=4|publisher=New Yorker Magazine|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2003 posting on the Manhigut Yehudit website (Hebrew version) setting forth a 20-point political program of his most important policy changes, Feiglin proposed replacing the Knesset with a bicameral legislature, whose upper house, which would control all "national affairs", would be "composed exclusively of Jews". The article was entitled, "Feiglin's First Hundred Days as Prime Minister". Point three in the program states that he will enact a new [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]] which will set forth a detailed proposal for a constitution. The Law will replace the at-large election of the Knesset with regional representatives, and would also create a lower house to handle municipal issues, in which Israeli Arabs could be represented. The posting was taken down on Dec. 9, 2008, the day after Feiglin won twentieth place in the Likud primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Yair|title=Feiglin's missing manifesto: Israel should quit UN, cut off water to Palestinians|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/feiglin-s-missing-manifesto-israel-should-quit-un-cut-off-water-to-palestinians-1.259202.|publisher=Ha'aretz|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the posting had been archived by Israeli scholar Tomer Persico prior to being removed, and Persico wrote a 2012 article analyzing Feiglin's program, referencing the 2003 posting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Persico |first=Tomer|title=A 'truly' Jewish democracy: On the ideology of Likud's Moshe Feiglin|url=http://972mag.com/a-truly-jewish-democracy-on-the-ideology-of-likuds-moshe-feiglin/62170/|publisher=+972blog|accessdate=1 April 2013|language=English|date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2005 book "War of Dreams", Feiglin wrote that his program was: "Israeli citizenship to Jews only [and] the immediate expulsion of any person of another people who claims any sort of sovereignty in the Land of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=מלחמת ("The War of Dreams") (Hebrew only)|year=2005|publisher=Milkhemet Ha’Khalomot|location=Jerusalem, Israel|page=436|url=http://972mag.com/a-truly-jewish-democracy-on-the-ideology-of-likuds-moshe-feiglin/62170|accessdate=1 April 2013|language=Hebrew|chapter=The Jewish State - Democracy and regime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are busy fighting for [[Yesha]], and refuse to recognize the more dangerous front against the [[fifth column]] inside Israel." "We established a state so that we could stop being different and start being normal. If only Jews can be Israelis, then we will never be normal. . . .The fundamental solution is leadership that is not looking for normalcy. The solution is leadership that emphasizes our Jewish identity. Paradoxically, it is only when the Arabs understand that the Israelis do not need them to help them to forget that they are Jews - will we be able to live here in peace with non-Jews who unequivocally accept the fact that Israel is a Jewish state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=Israel's Establishment Needs the Arabs|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article001.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123071824/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article001.html|archive-date=23 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It appears that the Israeli Arabs identify with our enemies. There are laws in this country that deal with treason and they should be applied when required. If Israeli Arabs are found helping our enemies, they should be stripped of their citizenship. In addition, if they are citizens, they should not be exempt from paying taxes; they should serve in the IDF, or at least in Sherut Le'umi, the National Service. . . . .If they are against us, we must make every effort to ensure that they leave. If they collaborate with our enemy, they must be removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/107mag/feiglin/feiglin.htm Moshe Feiglin, A Different Type of Politician] Jewish Magazine, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feiglin's 2013 campaign set forth his legislative agenda regarding Israeli Arabs: "Zero tolerance for Arab citizens' defiance. Enforcement of laws of treason. Enforcement of laws against robbery, rape, and vandalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/arabs/arabs.html|publisher=Manhigit Yehudit|accessdate=18 April 2013|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120022116/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/arabs/arabs.html|archive-date=20 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin has repeatedly made clear his view that only Jews deserve to be full citizens of Israel.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The momentum toward citizenship for all residents of Israel, regardless of their religion, is part of the Zionist ideology based on Western culture. If not checked, it will effectively transform Israel from a Jewish state to a state with some Jewish citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/about/crisis.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 April 2013|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122202022/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/about/crisis.html|archive-date=22 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Arab sector is not loyal to the state, and does not serve in the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ronen|first=Gil|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154303#.UW2T31sjrSd|publisher=Israal National News|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feiglin, responding to a report that Israel's first permanent Arab Supreme Court judge [[Salim Joubran]] had refused to sing Israel's national anthem, asserted that Joubran "must return his Israeli ID card and make do with the status of 'permanent resident'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/233445#.UW26NFsjrSd|publisher=Israel National News|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
===Comments on Arabs===
Of [[Israeli Arabs]], Feiglin said, "They will have to seek the right to self-determination in Arab states. Israel will encourage the Arabs to emigrate to their countries and assist any Arab who wishes to do so." Feiglin was quoted as saying:&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt; He insisted there is no such thing as a Palestinian people, and that they and Israeli Arabs should relocate, citing a text he had posted on the website of his Manhigut Yehudit ("Jewish Leadership") movement. In a 2004 interview with [[Yedioth Ahronoth]], he spoke of "a voluntary transfer to the 22 neighbouring Arab states" of the some 1.4 million Israeli Arabs, who make up 20 percent of Israel's population. "Arabs are not the sons of the desert, but its father", he quoted Sir Claude Jarvis, British governor of Sinai from 1923.&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arabs are "a gang of bandits that never produced anything and never wanted to produce anything - a gang of bandits that for over one thousand years (since Islam was born) has lived on robbery and terror. . . . Since their establishment, the Arab states have produced nothing but poverty, suffering, wars - and fantastic wealth for their leaders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=Beware: A Palestinian State|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article044.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123072010/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/69/article044.html|archive-date=23 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Arabs engage in typical [[Amalek]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=I Samuel 15|quote="Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys."}}&lt;/ref&gt; behaviour. I can't prove this genetically but this is the behaviour of Amalek.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott S. Horowitz]] (2006) Reckless Rites: Purim and the Legacy of Jewish Violence Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-12491-4}} p 1 Jeffrey Goldberg reported in the New Yorker about a series of disturbing interviews he had recently conducted with Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We shall offer them human rights without civil rights, so long as they prove their loyalty to their Jewish state host and accept Jewish sovereignty over their land. In such a situation they will be given legal-resident status and they can carry on their private affairs without anyone infringing on their human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1045106.html Ha'aretz] Feiglin's missing manifesto: Israel should quit UN, cut off water to Palestinians By Yair Ettinger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2004 report by Jeffrey Goldberg in the New Yorker magazine, Feiglin was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state?... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them... You can’t teach a monkey to speak and you can’t teach an Arab to be democratic. You’re dealing with a culture of thieves and robbers.The Arab destroys everything he touches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/31/040531fa_fact2_a?currentPage=4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his website, Feiglin wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We all know that most of the fires in Israel are caused by arson. Arson perpetrated by Arabs. Not by nut-jobs, not by criminals. Arson motivated by nationalism. Arson by Arab citizens of Israel. ... Wherever the Arab goes, he brings the desert with him. ... There is not and there never will be democracy in the Arab states - and their economies will never flourish. Israel produces more than all its neighbors combined. That is not because we are extremely industrious. It is because true economic vitality cannot exist in a culture of robbery. ... Arab culture is anti-productive.

In an interview with the U.S.-based Jewish Press, Feiglin said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You can find places where we say the same things. You can also find places where we are different. I was in the army when Meir, Hashem yikom damo [may God avenge his blood], was [most] active, so I didn't get to know him so well. But I can definitely say that the slogan "Kahane tzadak - Kahane was right" has proven itself many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Resnik|first=Elliot|title=A Messianic Vision: An Interview with Likud MK Moshe Feiglin|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/interviews-and-profiles/a-messianic-vision-an-interview-with-likud-mk-moshe-feiglin/2013/02/21/0/|publisher=The Jewish Press, Feb. 21, 2013|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a 2012 article in ''[[Haaretz]]'' daily, Feiglin condemned [[Baruch Goldstein]] over his killing of 29 Palestinian Muslims in a mosque in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/feiglin-israel-s-clear-and-present-danger.premium-1.484748|title=Feiglin: Israel's clear and present danger |date=13 December 2012|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|quote=Despite this rejection of force, a chilling passage in Feiglin's book is a meditation on Baruch Goldstein and the murder of 29 innocent Muslim supplicants at Hebron's Tomb of the Patriachs/Ibrahimi mosque in February 1994, a passage that seemingly condemns the means - but not the motivations - behind Goldstein's terrorist attack.}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he did not condemn Goldstein's motivations.

===Controversy over Hitler comments===
In an article in Ha'aretz, Yossi Sarid quoted Feiglin, in the context of demonstrations against the democratically chosen Oslo accords, as saying, "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was an unparalleled military genius. [[Nazism]] promoted [[Germany]] from a low to a fantastic physical and ideological status. The ragged, trashy youth body turned into a neat and orderly part of society and Germany received an exemplary regime, a proper justice system and public order. Hitler savored good music. He would paint. This was no bunch of thugs. They merely used thugs and homosexuals." Feiglin clarified his position to the Maariv newspaper that just because he considers Hitler a military genius, this does not mean he admires him.&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt; In an interview on Israeli television, Feiglin accused Sarid and other left-wing journalists of a smear campaign against him by quoting him out of context. He explained his point as saying that just because Germany was a democracy, this does not give legitimacy to what Hitler had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ahsEOvPvkKo|Moshe Feiglin's response to the accusation that he admires Hitler (Hebrew)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banned from Britain===
Feiglin is banned from entering the [[United Kingdom]] due to a decision by [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]], made public in March 2008, excluding Feiglin on the grounds that his presence in the country "would not be conducive to the public good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1204546432524&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull ''Jerusalem Post'', March 9, 2008]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter to Feiglin from the Home Office said that Smith based her decision on an assessment that his activities "foment or justify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs; seek to provoke others to terrorist acts; foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to serious criminal acts; and foster hatred, which might lead to inter-community violence in the UK".&lt;ref name=HSL&gt;[http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?AId=58606&amp;ATypeId=1&amp;search=true2&amp;srchstr=feiglin&amp;srchtxt=0&amp;srchhead=1&amp;srchauthor=0&amp;srchsandp=0&amp;scsrch=0 Home Secretary's Letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005065438/http://website.thejc.com/home.aspx?AId=58606&amp;ATypeId=1&amp;search=true2&amp;srchstr=feiglin&amp;srchtxt=0&amp;srchhead=1&amp;srchauthor=0&amp;srchsandp=0&amp;scsrch=0 |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=962850&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1 Ha'aretz] Britain bans Likud's Moshe Feiglin from entering country By Nadav Shragai&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin responded, "Seeing that renowned terrorists like Hizbullah member [[Ibrahim Mousawi]] are welcomed in your country in open arms, I understand that your policy is aimed at encouraging and supporting terror."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3517462,00.html Feiglin banned from entering UK - ynetnews March 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to Oslo Accords===
Feiglin was arrested for organizing mass acts of resistance and blocked highways across Israel during the period in which the [[Oslo accords]] were debated and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E1DC1E39F937A35751C1A963958260&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=Moshe+Feiglin&amp;st=nyt Assassin Hints a Bodyguard Helped Him Kill Rabin]&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin was charged with "break[ing] the barrier of obedience to the rule of law" and incitement to commit crimes. Regarding his organization of peaceful demonstrations and the blocking of intersections without a permit, Feiglin was quoted as stating, "We will do all that it's possible to do, including breaking the law."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DA153DF937A2575AC0A963958260&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=Moshe+Feiglin&amp;st=nyt Israeli Police Put Down Rightist Protest Against Pact with PLO]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for [[sedition]], and the sentence was later performed via community service.

===Reaction from Likud members===
Relations between Feiglin and his fellow Likud members have been mixed. Likud [[Knesset]] member [[Limor Livnat]] stated that Feiglin and his friends are "not real Likudniks", and that his faction "cannot be allowed to prevail".&lt;ref name="web.israelinsider.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306014128/http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/3158.htm Livnat: Criminals are trying to take over Likud]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the [[Jerusalem Post]], Livnat explained that Feiglin and his faction must be prevented "from taking over, or the party and the state will be in danger", adding that, "this is not democracy, this is [[anarchy]]".&lt;ref name="web.israelinsider.com"/&gt;

Despite criticism from fellow Likud members, Feiglin has displayed favorable relations with a significant number of former Likud Knesset members. This was manifest during a Feiglin rally at Jerusalem's Ramada Hotel that took place before the 2008 Likud primary after Feiglin promised to throw all his votes to them if they showed up. Former Likud Knesset members [[Gila Gamliel]], [[David Mena]], [[Daniel Benlulu]], and [[Ayoub Kara]] attended the event, despite warnings from Netanyahu's advisers not to do so. Gila Gamliel, who did not vote against the Disengagement from Gaza, eventually took Feiglin's votes and placed 19th, one spot ahead of Feiglin. This ultimately resulted in Feiglin getting pushed down to the 36th spot, and out of the [[Eighteenth Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1227702335803&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 158 Likud candidates to run for Knesset]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Jonathan Pollard===
Feiglin is a highly vocal supporter of [[Jonathan Pollard]], a former American naval [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] analyst who formerly served a sentence in the American Federal prison system for spying for Israel. Feiglin, who has called Pollard a hero,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishvoiceandopinion.com/a/jvo200703a.html Gedolim in Israel and the US Ask President Bush to Free Pollard before Pesach: And, after 22 Years, They Think He’ll Do It] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032108/http://jewishvoiceandopinion.com/a/jvo200703a.html |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has written a number of articles in support of Pollard. In a recent article, Feiglin stated that, "Pollard is a [[Jew]] who saved the Israelis from [[United States|American]] treachery."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/12788.htm Hug for a Betrayed Brother] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524050703/http://web.israelinsider.com/Views/12788.htm |date=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of U.S. Vice President Biden===

Feiglin referred to U.S. Vice President [[Joseph Biden]] as a "diseased leper" in a 2010 op-ed column published by Israel's third-largest news outlet, [[Maariv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=Lessons of the Holocaust Still Relevant in 2010|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/092/003.html|language=Hebrew|publisher=Maariv Online Edition|accessdate=8 March 2013|quote=When the state’s leadership lets Biden or Erdogan or any other diseased leper [also translated as "filthy vermin"] humiliate us, it sows the hope and uncontrollable desire of destroying us.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for cannabis legalization ===

As part of his [[libertarian]] political philosophy, Feiglin supports the full legalization of cannabis in Israel, stating of legalization in Amsterdam: "I don't see Amsterdam as a bad thing. .. There's no chaos, there's more freedom for citizens. [Legalization] didn't upend the way of life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2013/11/19/life-religion/sometimes-theres-a-man-feiglin-leads-charge-for-israeli-marijuana-legalization#ixzz2woGIMcfW Likud’s Moshe Feiglin: Cool on Palestinians, hot for pot] Jewish Telegraphic Agency, By Ben Sales, November 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; And stating that, "This may be one of the reasons why marijuana is illegal. God owns the patent on cannabis, and the large pharmaceutical companies do not appreciate such an intervention in their market and exert their influence accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4284110,00.html God owns cannabis patent] Moshe Feiglin, ynetnews, Published: 09.20.12&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition of the Knesset Health committee to Feiglin's proposals have led to multiple controversial confrontations in the Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/174872#.Uy8hm41F3IU Feiglin: Medical Marijuana Law Harms Patients] By Tova Dvorin, 12/6/2013, Israel National News&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin says that, "When I expressed my opinion on this issue over a year ago, I had no idea that I had climbed atop such a potent barrel of social dynamite... The debate is not about cannabis. Cannabis is just the tip of the iceberg. The debate is about liberty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/columns/moshe-feiglin/cannabis-and-liberty/2013/10/24/ Cannabis and Liberty] Moshe Feiglin, Published: October 24th, 2013, The Jewish Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach to homosexuals===
Feiglin wrote an article in 2009 entitled "I Am A Proud Homophobe".&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Elis|first=Niv|title=Feiglin tells 'Post': I am not a homophobe|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=302560|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he wrote several posts on his Facebook page detailing his views on gays. "The gay pride parade isn't about rights. It's about forcing the values of the minority onto the majority, effectively locking the majority into the proverbial closet. Homosexual "rights" undermine the normative family, the foundation of our nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/JewishLeadership/timeline?filter=1|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;""Throughout history", Feiglin explained, "from Rome to Europe in our day, the approval and spread of homosexuality presaged the decline of nations and cultures. If one reads the Torah portion 'Noah' - this comes as no surprise. . . .The organizers of a pride parade do not wish to gain rights. They strive to force homosexuality as a culture upon the public sphere. . . . A minority has no right to take over public assets. Let the marchers kindly go back to their individual closets. And let them do it without whining, because no one interferes with their affairs in there. Let them give up their attempts at takeovers, and leave the public sphere to normal people. . . .Feiglin added in an additional post: "I have no problem with homosexuals, most of whom are, most likely, good and talented people and no one wants to interfere in their private lives. I have a problem with homosexuality as a culture. This culture subverts the status of the family. And without the family there is no nation, and without a nation there is no civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ronen|first=Gil|title=Gays, Kindly Return to Your Closets|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/158545#.UW298VsjrSd|publisher=Israel International News|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Feiglin refused to meet with a gay faction within the Likud, and was quoting as stating: "[A]s individuals I can’t tell them how to lead their lives and I can cooperate with them on different subjects, but as a group that tries to promote an ideology of their sexual orientation, I don’t think they have legitimacy, especially not in the Likud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Gill|title=Feiglin Backtracks from meeting with gay group|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=260482|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Feb. 7, 2013, Feiglin met with an Israeli gay advocacy group in Tel Aviv, and said he was no longer a homophobe. News accounts of the meeting reported Feiglin's views: "'I am in favor of you having all your human rights, but I am not prepared by the way to invalidate the special value of the classic family', he said and made it clear that he still opposed gay marriage and same-sex parenting. 'Every child in the world has a right to a mother and father. It has nothing to do with religion, but with my basic perception of the good of the child', he said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lior|first=Ilan|title=Far-right Likud MK declares he is no longer a homophobe|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/far-right-likud-mk-declares-he-is-no-longer-a-homophobe.premium-1.502238|publisher=Ha'aretz|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his election to the Knesset, Moshe Feiglin met with homosexual groups. Although he does not identify with their lifestyle choices, he told them, he supports their rights as individuals and will fight to ensure that those rights are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|h9dVF4jjCCc|Video (3:06)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by a lesbian supporter if he would support her running in the primaries for the Zehut party, Feiglin was enthusiastically positive about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman|first=Gil|title=Orthodox lesbian running for Knesset in new right-wing party|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Orthodox-lesbian-running-for-Knesset-in-Feiglins-party-504724|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remarks on women===

During his 2013 campaign, Feiglin reiterated his view that women's role in Israeli society should be based on Jewish Biblical principles. In response to a question about feminism, Feiglin was quoted as saying: "'Tel Aviv has become a city that has erased masculinity and where being a man is considered a sickness' and added that feminism has destroyed family values, something essential to Judaism. . . . Pressed further, he stated that 'the man is the family while the woman is the home [literally "house"]' and that in our current culture we are forgetting 'what it means to be a man.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Gabriel|title=Moshe Feiglin Is Now Mainstream|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/07/moshe-feiglin-is-now-mainstream.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Jerusalem city government voted to permit sex-segregated public buses, according to the wishes of some ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) Jews, Feiglin supported the action: "I see discrimination against women as despicable. But it is unreasonable to force an ultra-Orthodox bus company to institute mixed seating on its buses against the wishes of its customers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/73/article7320.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 April 2013|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420202238/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/articles/73/article7320.html|archive-date=20 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin also opposes the Israeli army's decision to allow women into combat units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|title=Inverted Values of Beit Hanoun|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/6699#.UWonz1sjrSc|publisher=Israel National News|accessdate=18 April 2013|quote=Jewish morals dictate removing women from the army's combat units. An army guided}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of saying that we no longer need families, our lexicon now includes single parent families or same gender marriage. These newly introduced concepts are not contrived for the good of those parents raising their children without the support of a spouse (who should be benefiting from aid when needed). Instead, they revise the way we think of the traditional family -- compromising its preeminence and relegating it to "just another option" status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feiglin|first=Moshe|url=http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/society/society.html|publisher=Manhigut Yehudit|accessdate=18 April 2013|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316082208/http://www.jewishisrael.org/eng_contents/society/society.html|archive-date=16 March 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 2014 military operation in Gaza, Feiglin criticized lawmaker Aliza Lavie for discussing legislation on sexual violence, protesting that in wartime, no one should be "talking about things like flowers and sexual assault".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/gaza-a-mans-war-israel-gender/375689/ Gaza: It's a Man's War] The Atlantic, 7 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Christians and Christianity===

Feiglin has criticized certain Christian supporters of Israel, such as [[Glenn Beck]], and challenged the sincerity of Christians who have defended Israel, as well as Israeli Jews who supported Beck. "Glenn Beck doesn't back the Jewish mission. What drives him is the Christian mission. I have no problem doing business with him, but he has to respect me when he comes here just like I don’t try to force my identity on him when I come to him. Jews like it when [[goyim]] finally smile at them, but sometimes, a smile is more dangerous than a scowl, and this is one of those occasions", Feiglin said.&lt;ref name="Ronen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ronen|first=Gil|title=Feiglin objects to Beck Jerusalem event|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=234853|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feiglin also said he had a “deep problem” with Efrat Chief Rabbi Shlomo Riskin participating as a featured speaker at a Christian prayer rally Glenn Beck organized at the Caesarea Amphitheater in Israel.&lt;ref name="Ronen"/&gt; [[Danny Danon]] responded to Feiglin, saying: "Israel has too many real foes and very few genuine friends like Glenn Beck. I cannot understand the urge to reject his friendship with pseudo-theological argumentation... Rejecting friendship is not a sign of national pride but a proof of very low self confidence."&lt;ref name="Ronen"/&gt;

===Petition by "Scholars for Israel and Palestine"===
In December 2014, a group of academics who are part of the anti-[[BDS movement]] and members of [[The Third Narrative]], a [[Labor Zionist]] organization, have called on the U.S. and E.U. to impose sanctions on Feiglin and three other Israelis "who lead efforts to insure permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and to annex all or parts of it unilaterally in violation of international law".&lt;ref&gt;"i24news 'Academic initiative seeks to sanction Israeli far-right individuals' (Dec 12, 2014)" http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/54202-141212-academic-initiative-seeks-to-sanction-israeli-far-right-individuals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213023700/http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/54202-141212-academic-initiative-seeks-to-sanction-israeli-far-right-individuals |date=2014-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These academics, calling themselves [[Scholars for Israel and Palestine]] (SIP) and claiming to be "pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace", are asking the U.S. and EU to freeze Feiglin's foreign assets and impose visa restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;"Cohen, Debra Nussmaum 'Anti-BDS Professors Launch Push To Ban 4 Far Right Israeli Leaders:Zionist 'Third Narrative' Academics Target Naftali Bennett' (Dec. 12, 2014) The Jewish Daily Forward" http://forward.com/articles/210833/anti-bds-professors-launch-push-to-ban--far-right/&lt;/ref&gt; One of the signatories was quoted in [[Haaretz]] as saying the four leaders were chosen because they "were particularly dismissive of Secretary of State Kerry's peace-making efforts, and explicitly call for and work towards the formal annexation of the West Bank or part of it, and thereby push Israel in the direction of violating international law. They are the ones who cross particularly sharp red lines."&lt;ref&gt;"Haaretz 'Anti-BDS academics urge 'personal' sanctions against 'annexationist' Israelis' (Dec 11, 2014)"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631336&lt;/ref&gt; The group of mainly Jewish academics blasted Feiglin for his "straightforward and undisguised extremism" and "annexationist" agenda.&lt;ref&gt;"US academics urge sanctions against Israeli 'annexationists' Anti-BDS professors want US, Europe to impose punitive measures on Bennett, Feiglin and others pursuing ‘destructive’ policies" (Dec 13, 2014) ''The Times of Israel'' http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-academics-urge-sanctions-on-annexationist-israeli-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Majid has carried out extensive on research on [[public administration]], [[Dhaka University]] from the department of [[Public Administration]]. His endless curiosity about the small ethnic minorities living far away from the mainstream has produced pioneering books on ethnic communities like [[Manna]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]] and [[Tripura]] as well as the [[Rakhaine]]s. His research on the existence of [[Mongoloid]] community in Bangladesh is revealing.

==The Rakhaines==

In 2005, the Ph.D. thesis of  Majid was published under the title ''The Rakhaines''. He worked on the Rakhaines for over twenty years. The Rakhaines of the coastal areas of [[Patuakhali]], [[Borguna]] and [[Cox's Bazar]] migrated to what is now Bangladesh from [[Burma]] about two hundred years ago and turned the uncultivable deep forests of the coastal belt into a habitable area. Mustafa Majid informs that the Rakhaines are Mongoloid{{cn|date=April 2016}} who have many problems including tyranny by the mainstream population, but being peace-loving they never choose to go for a protest or struggle. However, some have left the country in search of security. The book has seven chapters in which the author deals with theories of administration, identities of the Rakhaines and a chronicle of Patuakhali district, the anthropological identity of the Rakhaines, their land problems and the unsympathetic role played by the llocal administration in relation to their persistent problems. He suggested for planned governmental effort for their inclusion in the mainstream.

==Publications==
Mustafa Majid has published 34 books so far (2007) including 13 books on [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]]s of Bangladesh and 4 on public administration. He has 8 titles to his credit that are poetry and memoirs. Some of the important titles are: ''Theory of Public Administration'',  ''Bureaucracy of Bangladesh'', ''Military Bureaucracy in Bangladesh'' and ''Nature of Leadership in Bangladesh'', ''Present Day Monologues'' and ''Time and Nation in Transformation'', ''The entity of Manna Garo, Hajong  and Tripura'' and ''The entity of Mongoloid Ethnic Minority in Bangladesh''. He has published six books of verse, one of them being ''Diary of a Nepalese Maoist Guerrilla''. He has also edited the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the collection of [[Mao Zedong]] Poems. He also wrote a biographical book on General [[Ataul Gani Osmani]] who was the Commander-in-Chief of [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971. He has also produced some books for the children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boi-mela.com/booklist.asp?Title=ADVANCED%20SEARCH%20RESULT   Boi-Mela -List of Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2902">{{about||the neighborhood|Namiki, Tokorozawa, Saitama|a Japanese component manufacturing company|Namiki Precision Jewel Co., Ltd.}}

'''Namiki''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[brand]] of [[fountain pens]] and other writing equipment.  Namiki is most famous for their [[maki-e]] ([[lacquer]] work) designs on [[urushiol|urushi]].

== Overview ==
Namiki is the surname of ''Ryosuke Namiki'', the founder of the [[Pilot Pen Corporation|Pilot]], named ''Namiki Manufacturing Company'' until 1938 when it became ''Pilot Pen Co., Ltd.''. The brand name Namiki came to fame in the early 20th Century when [[Alfred Dunhill|Dunhill]] retailed in the west the [[Maki-e]] pens produced by [[Pilot Pen Corporation|Pilot]] under the brand ''Dunhill-Namiki''. This partnership has continued to the present day (occasionally Namiki makes a Limited Edition for Dunhill) although Namiki has always been owned by [[Pilot Pen Corporation|Pilot]].

Namiki's higher ranges include the Emperor, Yukari Royale, and Yukari, and this is the brand used by [[Pilot Pen Corporation|Pilot]] to sell their high valued [[Maki-e]] pens all over the world.

Namiki fountain pens and non-disposable [[Pilot Pen Corporation|Pilot]] fountain pens share the Pilot/Namiki proprietary ink refill cartridge, with inks available in several colors. Converters of both the piston type and squeeze type are also available to allow Namiki and Pilot fountain pens to be filled from ink bottles.

The curve-sided Namiki ink bottle has an inner inkwell to keep the nib steady during filling and also to allow almost the last few drops of ink to be taken from the bottle into a pen.

== Notable Models ==

=== Namiki Emperor Collection ===
The most prestigious collection of the Namiki brand. All models have a base layer of Urushi with Maki-e art drawn on to the base layer. There are seven models in this collection:

- Gold Fish(金魚）

- Dragon(龍）

- Owl(梟）

- Kylin(麒麟）

- Carp on Waterfall(鯉の滝登り）

- Treasure(宝)

==History==
The week consists of independently organized events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/31/school-choice-week-is-almost-over-now-what/|title=School Choice Week is almost over — now what?|author=Shoshana Weissmann|date=|work=Red Alert Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; both large and small, in schools, state capitols, and other public meetings featuring the movement's signature yellow scarves. Additionally there are several national signature events and press opportunities.  In 2011 there were approximately 150 events in over 30 states.  Each year the participation has more than doubled.  In 2014 nearly 6,000 events held in every state had a media contact with over 100 million households in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nina-rees/2014/01/28/national-school-choice-week-highlights-importance-of-empowering-parents|title=National School Choice Week Highlights the Importance of Empowering Parents - US News|author=Nina Rees|date=|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 11,082 events were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kicking Off School Choice Week With 9 Things You Need To Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2015/01/26/kicking-off-school-choice-week-with-9-things-you-need-to-know/|accessdate=2015-09-21|first=Maureen|last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of notable and varied participants have spearheaded these events. Former [[WNBA]] basketball player [[Lisa Leslie]] teamed with Rep. [[Eric Cantor]] for a January 2014 event at Friendship Chamberlain Elementary School in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/students-rally-for-school-choice-in-d-c/|title=Students Rally for School Choice in D.C.|author=|date=|work=Washington Free Beacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KIPP]] co-founder [[Mike Feinberg]] gave an introductory speech at the 2014 National School Choice Week kick-off in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonisd.org/news/2014/01/27/hisd-students-staff-join-national-school-choice-celebration-at-union-station/|title=HISD students, staff join national school choice celebration at Union Station|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Jonas Brothers]] kicked off National School Choice Week with a concert in Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchy.com/2013/01/25/jonas-brothers-kick-off-school-choice-week/|title=Jonas Brothers kick off National School Choice Week|author=|date=|work=Twitchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Highlighting the non-judgmental, non-partisan nature of the organization, the 2014 kick-off event paired conservative Republican Sen. [[Ted Cruz]] and Democratic stalwart Rep. [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] on the same stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/ranch/news/cruz-jackson-lee-to-speak-at-national-school-choice-week/article_bcac7dee-360a-586c-8998-7c687d5dce28.html|title=Cruz, Jackson Lee to speak at National School Choice Week kickoff on Jan. 25|author=|date=|work=www.yourkatynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cruz, "School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st Century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/30/the-issue-bringing-ted-cruz-and-black-democrats-together.html|title=The Issue Bringing Ted Cruz and Black Democrats Together|author=|date=|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, National School Choice Week opened with a nationally televised event in Jacksonville, Florida, featuring speeches NFL star [[Desmond Howard]], Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, and a video greeting by US Senator [[Marco Rubio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redefinedonline.org/2015/01/thousands-celebrate-school-choice-jacksonville/|title=Redefined Online|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nongmaithem Chittaranjan Singh''', more commonly known as '''Nongmaithem Pahari''', was a Manipuri by birth, an [[Demographics of India|Indian]] [[singer]], a [[composer]], a lyricist, [[revolutionary|revolutionist]] and a [[writer]]. He was a Manipuri (a language in the 8th schedule of the  Indian constitution) singer. He was perhaps the most prolific modern Meitei singer before his death on 18 October 2006 in [[Imphal]], [[Manipur]], India.

==Career==
Nongmaithem Pahari's greatest contribution to the culture of [[Manipur]] is the way he introduced a new era of music. He was important in consolidating the popularity of modern Meitei music.

Pahari was born on 28 August 1934 in Imphal, Manipur. His father, Nongmaithem Thanil, represented the nobility of that time and was an avid theatre activist. Pahari's affinity towards music was manifested early in his childhood when he was heavily influenced by the likes of KL Saigal, Pankaj Mallik and Mana Dey.

Of the many albums that Pahari released during his lifetime, ''Undying Melodies'' is considered to be the ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. This is the album that features quite an eclectic number of his all time hits like "Ningsingli meraagi thabaldo", "Eigee eshei saklaroi", "Ahingda khongbee taamna", "Nangee maithong urubada" and "Nangi Napalgi".

The majority of Pahari's songs were written by Manipur [[B. Jayantakumar Sharma]], who composed music for many feature films and many theatre dramas. He had been decorated with almost all the Awards and recognition in the state pertaining to music and culture.

Pahari wrote a book titled ''Eigi Diaridagi'' meaning "From My Dairy". It was mainly about his experiences inside the Imphal and Tripura Jail with brief but important mention of the real genesis of the political and armed revolution in Manipur.

He was one of the founding members of [[United National Liberation Front]], a revolutionary front formed in Manipur on 24 October 1964 which is still one of the largest insurgent groups in Manipur.

Pahari retired as the Station Director of Doordarshan Kendra Imphal(Television broadcasting station of Manipur) before which he served as the Station Director of All India Radio in various places including Imphal, Kohima and Gangtok. He was the President of Manipur Dramatic Union, Imphal and All Manipur Matam Ishei Kanglup. He also headed many other societies and cultural groups of the state.

'''Old Saxon''', also known as '''Old Low German''', was a [[Germanic language]] and the earliest recorded form of [[Low German]] (spoken nowadays in [[Northern Germany]], the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the [[Americas]] and parts of [[Eastern Europe]]). It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language, closely related to the [[Anglo-Frisian]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056981/Old-Saxon-language Old Saxon language at Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into [[Middle Low German]]. It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern [[Netherlands]] by [[Saxon people|Saxons]], a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of [[Old Saxony|Saxony]]. It partially shares [[Anglo-Frisian]]'s ([[Old Frisian]], [[Old English]]) [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]] which sets it apart from [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] and [[Irminonic languages|Irminonic]] languages, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Luxembourgish Language|Luxembourgish]] and [[German language|German]].

The grammar of Old Saxon was fully [[inflection|inflected]] with five [[grammatical case]]s ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]]), three [[grammatical number]]s ([[wikt:singular|singular]], [[plural]], and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]) and three [[grammatical gender]]s ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter gender|neuter]]). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.

Historically, Old Saxon and [[Old Dutch]] were considered to be distinct dialects of an otherwise one unitary language rather than two languages, primarily because they were linked through a [[dialect continuum]] spanning modern Netherlands and Germany. However, while these two languages both shared the same historical origins and some very similar [[writing style]]s, Old Saxon shows a slightly reduced [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] compared to [[Old Dutch]], which kept some grammatical distinctions that Old Saxon abandoned. There are also various differences&lt;!-- or even only: some differences --&gt; in their [[Phonology|phonological evolutions]], Old Saxon being classified as an [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic language]] whereas Old Dutch is one of the [[Istvaeonic|Istvaeonic languages]].

==Characteristics==

===Relation with other West Germanic languages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], a [[dialect continuum]] existed between [[Old Dutch]] and Old Saxon; this was only recently interrupted by the simultaneous dissemination of standard languages within each nation and the dissolution of folk dialects. Despite sharing some features, a number of disparities separate Old Saxon, [[Old English]], and [[Old Dutch]]; one such difference is the Old Dutch utilization of ''-a'' as its plural a-stem noun ending, while Old Saxon and [[Old English]] employ ''-as'' or ''-os''. However, it seems that some [[Middle Dutch]] took the Old Saxon a-stem ending from some [[Middle Low German]] dialects, as modern Dutch still shows the plural ending ''-s'' added to certain words.

Old Saxon (or Old Low German) probably evolved primarily from [[Ingvaeonic]] dialects in the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] branch of [[Proto-Germanic]] in the 5th century. However, Old Saxon, even if it is considered as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language, is not a pure [[Ingvaeonic]] dialect as Old Frisian and Old English are, the two latter sharing some other [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics, like the great vowel shift that took place in both [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. This, plus the large number of different forms that the language took, often showing different [[West Germanic languages|West-Germanic]] features, led some [[philologists]] to mistakenly think that Old Dutch and Old Saxon were variations of the same language, and that Old Saxon was indeed an [[Istvaeonic]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative Grammar of the Teutonic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXYKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Grammar+of+the+Teutonic&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ndj6UfXZFtP20gWYhIGIAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Grammar%20of%20the%20Teutonic&amp;f=false|first=Jacob |last=Helfenstein|publisher=Stanford University Library|year=1901|isbn=1440056625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Middle Low German===
Old Saxon naturally evolved into Middle Low German over the course of the 11th and 12th century, with a great shift from [[Latin]] to Low German writing happening around 1150, so that the development of the language can be traced from that period.

The most striking difference between Middle Low German and Old Saxon is in a feature of speech known as [[vowel reduction]], which took place in the other [[West Germanic languages]] and some Scandinavian dialects such as [[Danish language|Danish]], reducing all unstressed vowels to [[schwa]]. Thus, such Old Saxon words like ''gisprekan'' (spoken) or ''dagō'' (days'&amp;nbsp;– gen. pl.) became ''gesprēken ''and ''dāge''.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Old Saxon phonology}}

===Early developments===
Old Saxon did not participate in the [[High German consonant shift]], and thus preserves stop consonants ''p'', ''t'', ''k'' that have been shifted in [[Old High German]] to various [[fricative]]s and [[affricate]]s. The Germanic diphthongs ''ai'', ''au'' consistently develop into long vowels ''ē'', ''ō'', whereas in Old High German they appear either as ''ei'', ''ou'' or ''ē'', ''ō'' depending on the following consonant.

Old Saxon, alone of the West Germanic languages except for Frisian, consistently preserves Germanic ''-j-'' after a consonant, e.g. {{lang|osx|hēliand}} "savior" ({{lang-goh|heilant}}, {{lang-ang|hǣlend}}, {{lang-got|háiljands}}). [[Germanic umlaut]], when it occurs with short ''a'', is inconsistent, e.g. {{lang|osx|hebbean}} or {{lang|osx|habbian}} "to have" ({{lang-ang|habban}}). This feature was carried over into the descendant-language of Old Saxon, Middle Low German, where e.g. the adjective ''krank'' (sick, ill) had the comparative forms ''krenker'' and ''kranker''. Apart from the ''e'', however, the umlaut is not marked in writing.

Notes:

* The voiceless spirants {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, and {{IPA|/s/}} gain voiced allophones ({{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, and {{IPA|[z]}}) when between vowels. This change is only faithfully reflected in writing for {{IPA|[v]}} (represented with letters such as {{angbr|ƀ}} and {{angbr|u}}). The other two allophones continued to be written as before.
*Fricatives were devoiced again word-finally. Beginning in the later Old Saxon period, [[stop consonant|stops]] became devoiced word-finally as well.
* Most consonants could be [[Gemination|geminated]]. Notably, geminated {{IPA|/v/}} gave {{IPA|/bb/}}, and geminated {{IPA|/ɣ/}} probably gave {{IPA|/ɡɡ/}}. Geminated {{IPA|/h/}} resulted in {{IPA|/xx/}}.
* Germanic ''*h'' is retained as {{IPA|[x]}} in these positions and thus merges with devoiced {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

Notes:

* The closing diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}} sometimes occur in texts (especially in [[Old Saxon Genesis|Genesis]]), probably under the influence of [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] or [[High German dialect]]s, where they replace Old Saxon developments {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/ɔː/}} (which evolved from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{IPA|/ai/}} and {{IPA|/au/}}).
* The situation for the front opening diphthongs is somewhat unclear in some texts. Words written with ''io'' in the [[Heliand]], the most extensive record of Old Saxon writing, are often found written variably with ''ia'' or even ''ie'' in most other texts, notably the later ones. The diphthong eventually merges into {{IPA|/eː/}} in almost every Middle Low German dialect.
* There also existed 'long' diphthongs {{IPA|/oːu/}}, {{IPA|/aːu/}} and {{IPA|/eːu/}}. These were, however, treated as two-syllable sequences of a long vowel followed by a short one, not proper diphthongs.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Old Saxon grammar}}

===Morphology===
Unlike modern English, but like Old English, Old Saxon is an [[inflected language]], rich in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] diversity. It kept several distinct cases from [[Proto-Germanic]]: the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]] and (vestigially in the oldest texts) [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

Old Saxon also had three [[grammatical number]]s ([[wikt:singular|singular]], and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]) and three [[grammatical gender]]s ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter gender|neuter]]). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of exactly two.

===Nouns===
Old Saxon nouns were inflected in very different ways following their classes. Here are the endings for ''dag'', "day" an a-stem masculine noun:

{| border=1 width=30% style="text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #999 solid; border-collapse:collapse;"
| style="background:#afefef;" colspan="5"|'''dag''' 'day' ''m.''
|-
! style="background:#FBEC5D;"|Case
! style="background:#FBEC5D;"|Singular
! style="background:#FBEC5D;"|Plural
|-
| style="background:#CCCCFF;"|'''Nominative''' || dag || dagos
|-
| style="background:#CCCCFF;"|'''Accusative''' || dag || dagos
|-
| style="background:#CCCCFF;"|'''Genitive''' || dages, -as || dago
|-
| style="background:#CCCCFF;"|'''Dative''' || dage, -a || dagum, -un
|}

At the end of the Old Saxon period, distinctions between noun classes began to disappear, and endings from one were often transferred to the other declension, and vice versa. This happened to be a large process, and the most common noun classes started to cause the least represented to disappear. As a result, in Middle Low German, only the former weak n-stem and strong a-stem classes remained. These two noun inflection classes started being added to words not only following the historical belonging of this word, but also following the root of the word.

===Verbs===
The Old Saxon verb inflection system reflects an intermediate stage between Old English and Old Dutch, and further Old High German. Unlike Old High German and Old Dutch, but similarly to Old English, it did not preserve the three different verb endings in the plural, all featured as ''-ad'' (also ''-iad'' or ''-iod'' following the different verb inflection classes). Like Old Dutch, it had only two classes of weak verb, with only a few relic verbs of the third weak class (namely four verbs: [[wikt:libbian#Old Saxon|libbian]], [[wikt:seggian#Old Saxon|seggian]], [[wikt:huggian#Old Saxon|huggian]] and [[wikt:hebbian#Old Saxon|hebbian]]).

This table sums up all the seven Old Saxon strong verb classes and the three weak verb classes:

It should be noticed that the third weak verb class includes only four verbs (namely [[wikt:libbian#Old Saxon|libbian]], [[wikt:seggian#Old Saxon|seggian]], [[wikt:huggian#Old Saxon|huggian]] and [[wikt:hebbian#Old Saxon|hebbian]]); it is a remnant of an older and larger class that was kept in Old High German.

===Syntax===
Old Saxon syntax is mostly different from that of [[English language|English]]. Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection&amp;nbsp;– e.g., word order was generally freer.  In addition:
*The default [[word order]] was [[verb-second]], very close to that of [[Dutch language|modern Dutch]] or [[German language|modern German]].
*There was no [[do-support|''do''-support]] in questions and negatives.
*Multiple negatives could stack up in a sentence and intensify each other ([[negative concord]]), which is not always the case in modern English, modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or modern [[German language|German]].
*Sentences with subordinate clauses of the type "when X, Y" (e.g. "When I got home, I ate dinner.") did not use a ''wh-''type conjunction, but rather used a ''th-''type [[correlative conjunction]] (e.g. ''thô X, thô Y'' in place of "when X, Y").  The ''wh-''type conjunctions were used only as [[interrogative pronoun]]s and [[indefinite pronouns]].
*Similarly, ''wh-'' forms were not used as [[relative pronoun]]s (as in "the man who saw me" or "the car which I bought"). Instead, an indeclinable word ''the'' was used, often in conjunction with the [[definite article]] (which was declined for case, number and gender).

==Orthography==
Old Saxon comes down in a number of different manuscripts whose spelling systems sometimes differ markedly. In this section, only the letters used in normalized versions of the [[Heliand]] will be kept, and the sounds modern scholars have traditionally assigned to these letters. Where spelling deviations in other texts may point to significant pronunciation variants, this will be indicated.

In general, the spelling of Old Saxon corresponds quite well to that of the other ancient [[Germanic languages]], such as Old High German or [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

* ''c'' and ''k'' were both used for {{IPA|[k]}}. However, it seems that, as in other [[West Germanic languages|West-Germanic]] dialects, when {{IPA|[k]}} was followed by ''i'' or ''e'', it had the pronunciation {{IPA|/ts/}} or {{IPA|/kʲsʲ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lasch|Lasch 1914]], §339&lt;/ref&gt; The letters ''c'' and ''x'' were preferred for the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalisations]], ''k'' and even sometimes ''ch'' being rather used before ''u'', ''o'' or ''a'' for {{IPA|/k/}} (''kuning'' for {{IPA|[kʏnɪŋk]}} 'king', modern ''köning'' ; crûci for {{IPA|[kryːtsi]}} ; forsachistu for {{IPA|[forsakistuː]}}).
* ''g'' represented {{IPA|[ɣ]}} or its allophone {{IPA|[ɡ]}}: ''brengian'' {{IPA|[brɛŋɡjan]}} 'to bring', ''seggian'' {{IPA|[sɛɡɡjan]}} 'to say', ''wege'' {{IPA|[wɛɣe]}} 'way' (dative).
* ''g'' seems, at least in a few dialects, to have had the pronunciation {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[ʝ]}} at the beginning of a word, only when followed by ''i'' or ''e''. Thus we find ''giār'' {{IPA|[jaːr]}} 'year' and even ''gēr'' {{IPA|[jeːr]}} 'year', the latter betraying a strong Old Frisian influence.
* ''h'' represents {{IPA|[h]}} and its allophone {{IPA|[x]}}: ''holt'' {{IPA|[hɔlt]}} 'wood', ''naht'' {{IPA|[naxt]}} 'night' (mod. ''nacht'').
* ''i'' is used for both the vowels {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and {{IPA|[iː]}} and the consonant {{IPA|[j]}}: ''ik'' {{IPA|[ɪk]}} 'I' (mod. ''ick, ik''), ''iār'' {{IPA|[jaːr]}} 'year'.
* ''qu'' and ''kw'' always represents {{IPA|[kw]}}: ''quāmun'' {{IPA|[kwaːmʊn]}} 'they came'.
* ''s'' represented {{IPA|[s]}}, and between two vowels also {{IPA|[z]}}.
* ''th'' is used to indicate {{IPA|[θ]}}: ''thōhtun'' {{IPA|[θoːxtun]}} 'they thought'. ''ð'' is used for {{IPA|[ð]}}, occasionally also written ''dh''.
* ''u'' represented the vowels {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[uː]}}, or the consonant {{IPA|[β]}} ~ {{IPA|[v]}}, which was denoted sporadically across manuscripts by either ⟨ƀ⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨u⟩, ⟨v⟩, or ⟨f⟩'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Altsächsische Grammatik|pages= 126-128, 161|author-link= Gallée, Johan Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''uu'' was normally used to represent {{IPA|[w]}}, predating the letter ''w''.
* ''z'' only appeared in a few texts due to [[Old High German]] influence.

==Literature==
[[File:Heliand Excerpt.jpg|thumb|[[Heliand]] excerpt from the German Historical Museum]]
Only a few texts survive, predominantly baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of [[Charlemagne]]. The only literary texts preserved are  ''[[Heliand]]'' and fragments of the [[Old Saxon Genesis]].

* [[Heliand]]
* [[Beda]] homily (''Homilie Bedas'')
* ''Credo'' (''Abrenunciatio diaboli et credo'') → Old Saxon baptismal vow.
*''Old Saxon '''Genesis''''' fragments
* ''Essener Heberegister''
* [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]] ({{lang-de|[[:de:Sächsisches Taufgelöbnis|Sächsisches Taufgelöbnis]]}})
* Penitentiary (''altsächsische Beichte, altwestfälische Beichte'')
* ''Trierer Blutsegen'' ({{ws|[[:de:s:Ad catarrum dic|de]]}})
* ''Spurihalz'' (''Wiener Pferdsegen'') ({{ws|[[:de:s:De hoc quod spurihalz dicunt|de]]}}) 
* ''Wurmsegen'' (''Wiener Wurmsegen'') ({{ws |[[:de:s:Contra vermes|de)]]}} 
* Psalms commentary (''Gernroder Psalmenkommentar'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">'''Prepress''' is the term used in the [[printing]] and [[publishing]] industries for the processes and procedures that occur between the creation of a print layout and the final printing. The prepress procedure includes the manufacture of a printing plate, image carrier or form, ready for mounting on a printing press, as well as the adjustment of images and texts or the creation of a high-quality print file.
In today's prepress shop, the form of delivery from the customer is usually electronic, either a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or application files created from such programs as [[Scribus]], [[Adobe InDesign]] or [[QuarkXPress]].

==Processes==

The following items have each been considered part of prepress at one time or another: 
# [[Typesetting]] involves the presentation of textual material in graphic form on paper or some other medium. Before the advent of desktop publishing, typesetting of printed material was produced in print shops by compositors or typesetters working by hand, and later with machines.
# [[Copy-editing]], is the work that an editor does to improve the formatting, style, and accuracy of a manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209034733/http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/misc/links.html American Printing History Association] &amp;mdash; Numerous links to Online Resources and Other Organizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prepressure.com/library/prepress-history History of prepress] &amp;mdash; Overview of the evolution of digital pre-press from 1984 onwards&lt;/ref&gt; Copy-editing is done prior to the work of proofreaders, who handle documents before final publication.
# [[Markup language|Markup]] is an artificial language using a set of annotations to text that give instructions regarding the structure of text or how it is to be displayed. Markup languages have been in use for centuries, and in recent years have also been used in computer typesetting and word-processing systems.
# [[Prepress proofing|Proofing]] involves creating an accurate facsimile of the artwork before beginning production runs. This serves as a bond between the printer and their customer that the final product meets an agreed upon standard. Proofs in general can be done for all parts (images, illustrations, texts and colors) of print product. In this part, three types of proofing should be checked and printed out: the print-ready PDF files, the printer's proof and the imposition proof. Print-ready PDF files should be made after the layout using preflight at the printing house. The printer's proof should be printed out in high-resolution and checked by the customer. The imposition proof, which is usually done by the printers, should also be printed out to check and adjust the printing press.  
# [[Proofreading]] traditionally means reading a proof copy of a text in order to detect and correct any errors. Modern proofreading often requires reading copy at earlier stages as well. 
# [[Screening (printing)|Screening]] and adjustment of a continuous tone of images such as photographs
# [[Imposition]], or the combination of many pages into a single signature form. 
#  Separation, or specifying images or text to be put on plates applying individual printing media (inks, varnishes, etc.) to a common print. 
# Manufacturing of plates. The usage of different materials of plates should meet the needs of printing method. Usually rubber, plastic and aluminum are used for plates as well as film which is the photomechanical exposure and processing of light-sensitive emulsion on a printing plate. Manufacturing of plates should be well planned and delivered beforehand. Also, the cost should be calculated as well.
# Manufacturing of a high-quality print (PDF) file, which is used for the final printing.
# Paper select, choosing a proper paper is also a very important step in prepress.

In most modern publishing environments, the tasks related to content generation and refinement are carried out separately from other prepress tasks, and are commonly characterized as part of [[graphic design]]. Some companies combine the roles of graphic design and prepress production into [[desktop publishing]] usually called DTP.

The set of procedures used in any particular prepress environment is known as a [[workflow]]. Workflows vary, depending on the printing process (e.g., [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], [[Offset printing|offset]], [[digital printing]], [[screen-printing|screen printing]]), the final product (books, newspapers, product packaging), and the implementation of specific prepress technologies. For example, it is not uncommon to use a computer and image-setter to generate film which is then stripped and used to expose the plate in a vacuum frame; this workflow is hybrid because separation and [[halftone|halftoning]] are carried out via digital processes while the exposure of the plate is an analog one. That demonstrates that the borders around the prepress are very fluid. Furthermore, – depending on the printing method and the print product – the elements of the prepress of a graphic print production can differ from case to case. This circumstance requires a management of the workflow. It is necessary to manage the responsibility for each part of the workflow. That can mean that employees, who are actually responsible for other parts of the production (e.g. Layout), have to attend to parts of the prepress.

==History==

During the 1980s and 1990s, computer-aided prepress techniques began to supplant the traditional dark room and [[light table]] processes, and by the early 2000s the word ''prepress'' became, in some ways, synonymous with '''digital pre-press'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpdecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/history-of-digital-pre-press.pdf History of Digital Pre-Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003723/http://wpdecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/history-of-digital-pre-press.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} (last checked on 2008-02-11)&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately before the mainstream introduction of computers to the process, much of the industry was using large format [[camera]]s to make emulsion-based (film) copies of text and images. This film was then assembled (planning (UK) or [[stripping (printing)|stripping]]) and used to expose another layer of emulsion on a plate, thus copying images from one emulsion to another. This method is still used; however, as digital pre-press technology has become less cost intensive, more efficient and reliable, and as the knowledge and skill required to use the new hardware and especially software have become more widespread within the labor force, digital automation has been introduced to almost every part of the process. Some topics related to digital but not analog prepress include [[pre-flight (printing)|preflighting]] (verifying the presence, quality and format of each digital component), [[color management]], and [[Raster image processor|RIPping]].

PDF workflows also became predominant. Vendors of Prepress systems, in addition to the offset printing industry, embraced a subset of the [[PDF]] format referred to as PDF/X1-a.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090317075743/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF (PDF/X1-a)] &amp;mdash; For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from PDF files. (last checked on 2009-03-13)&lt;/ref&gt; This industry specific subset is one version of the [[PDF/X]] (PDF for eXchange) set of standards.

In more recent years, prepress software has been developed which is designed to find as many efficiencies in prepress workflow as possible.  These tools are accessed online, and allow different workers to work on one project at the same time, often from different locations.  Key functionality automates common steps to reduce errors, reinforce quality standards and speed up production.  Examples include automatically re-folioing pages, digital dummies for soft proofs, live linking with Adobe InDesign and pre-flight checking.  These tools revolve around a [[Flatplan]] and are used in all sorts of prepress including book, magazine and catalog production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Regulated rewriting''' is a specific area of [[formal languages]] studying grammatical systems which are able to take some kind of control over the production applied in a derivation  step. For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are  also called "Grammars with Controlled Derivations". Among such grammars can be noticed:

== Matrix Grammars ==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Matrix Grammar, &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;, is a four-tuple &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where&lt;br /&gt;
1.- &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of non-terminal symbols&lt;br /&gt;
2.- &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.- &lt;math&gt;M = {m_1, m_2,..., m_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences  
&lt;math&gt;m_{i} = [p_{i_1},...,p_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;, 
with &lt;math&gt;k(i)\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, where each 
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} 1\leq j\leq k(i)&lt;/math&gt;, is an ordered pair
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} = (L, R)&lt;/math&gt;
being
&lt;math&gt;L \in (N \cup T)^*N(N\cup T)^*, R \in (N\cup T)^*&lt;/math&gt;
these pairs are called "productions", and are denoted
&lt;math&gt;L\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. In these conditions the matrices can be written down as
&lt;math&gt;m_i = [L_{i_{1}}\rightarrow R_{i_{1}},...,L_{i_{k(i)}}\rightarrow R_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4.- S is the start symbol

'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;MG = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; be a matrix grammar and let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
the collection of all productions on matrices of &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;.
We said that &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt; is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, or "increasing length" 
or "linear" or "without &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-productions" if and only if the grammar &lt;math&gt;G=(N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; has the corresponding property.

===The classic example ===
:''Note: taken from Abraham 1965, with change of nonterminals names''
The context-sensitive language 
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
is generated by the &lt;math&gt;CFMG&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;G =(N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the set of matrices is defined as
&lt;math&gt;M :&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow abc\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow aAbBcC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow aA,B\rightarrow bB,C\rightarrow cC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow a,B\rightarrow b,C\rightarrow c\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Time Variant Grammars==
'''Basic concepts''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Definition'''&lt;br /&gt;
A Time Variant Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, v)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;v: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a function from the set of natural
numbers to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

== Programmed Grammars ==
'''Basic concepts'''

===Definition===
A Programmed Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, s)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;s, f: P\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''success'' and ''fail'' functions from the set of productions
to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

==Grammars with regular control language==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Grammar With Regular Control Language, 
&lt;math&gt;GWRCL&lt;/math&gt;, is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, e)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a regular expression over the alphabet of the set of productions.

===A naive example===
Consider the CFG
&lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the productions set is defined as
&lt;math&gt;P = \{p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6\}&lt;/math&gt;
being 
&lt;math&gt;p_0 = S\rightarrow ABC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_1 = A\rightarrow aA&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_2 = B\rightarrow bB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_3 = C\rightarrow cC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_4 = A\rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_5 = B\rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;p_6 = C\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly,
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^*b^*c^*\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now, considering the productions set 
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as an alphabet (since it is a finite set),
define the regular expression over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;e=p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6)&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the CFG grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the regular expression
&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the CFGWRCL 
&lt;math&gt;(G,e)
=(G,p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6))&lt;/math&gt;
which generates the language
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Besides there are other grammars with regulated rewriting, the four cited above are good examples of how to extend [[context-free grammars]] with some kind of control mechanism to obtain a [[Turing machine]] powerful grammatical device.

'''Reserve wine''' is [[wine]] of a higher quality than usual, or a wine that has been aged before being sold, or both. Traditionally, winemakers would ''reserve'' some of their best wine rather than sell it immediately, coining the term.

In some countries the use of the term "reserve", "''reserva''" or "''riserva''" is regulated, but in many places it is not. Sometimes, reserve wine originates from the best [[vineyards]], or the best barrels, making it more special. Additionally, reserve wines may be made in a style suited to longer [[aging (wine)|aging]] periods. However, in regions where the use is not regulated the presence of the term "reserve" on a wine label may be nothing but a [[marketing]] strategy. Indeed, in the case of one of the largest-selling premium wines, [[Kendall-Jackson]] [[Chardonnay]], every bottle produced is "Vintner's Reserve". To indicate a traditional reserve wine, Kendall-Jackson uses the term "Grand Reserve".{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Like the term "[[old vines]]", "reserve" traditionally indicates a wine that is special, or at least different in flavor or aging potential. The presence of a non-reserve bottling with a producer that also sells reserve wine makes it more likely that "reserve" is being used in its traditional sense. Partly because of the often vague meaning of "reserve", many [[winery|wineries]] produce named [[cuvée]]s instead. Typically these are reserve wines in the traditional meaning of the word.

==Reserva in Iberia==
[[Image:Spain.Rioja.Vino.Baron.de.Chirel.Reserva.2001.jpeg|thumb|Bottles of [[Rioja wine|Rioja]] Reserva]]
In [[Portugal wine|Portugal]] and [[Spain wine|Spain]], reserva is a regulated term controlled by law, at least ensuring that reserve wines get some additional [[aging wine|ageing]]. In practice it is very difficult to regulate quality, so the term primarily deals with ageing and alcoholic strength. In Portuguese and Spanish wines, the requirements varies between regions, but typically, when used on a label "Reserva" means that the wine was aged for at least three years in the [[aging barrel|cask]] and [[wine bottle|bottle]], at least one of which must have been in the cask.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Those that have been aged for five years (two in cask, three in bottle) or more are labelled '''{{visible anchor|Gran Reserva}}'''.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Gran Reservas are intended to be made only in exceptional vintages, but this is up to the producer.

In [[Portugal]] the term indicates that the wine has an [[alcohol]] level of at least 0.5 percent above the regional minimum, and that it was made from a rated [[vintage]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

==Reserve wine in Champagne==
In the [[Sparkling wine production|production]] of "non-vintage" [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], a certain amount of aged still wine is used for blending with still wine of the youngest vintage, before this blended base wine undergoes second [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] in bottle to become sparkling Champagne. This aged still wine is called reserve wine, and this practice is meant to ensure that a certain Champagne house's non-vintage product has a consistent style over the years. Since the reserve wine is used in the production process, it is never bottled and sold as it is, but the proportion and age of the reserve wine is often seen as one of the indicators of the quality of a Champagne and the producer's level of ambition.

==Austrian DACs==
In the Austrian [[Districtus Austriae Controllatus]] (DAC) system, most DACs have an additional ''Reserve'' designation for a wine which has slightly more strict requirements.

==German Cabinet==
Before the 1971 German wine law, a term corresponding to reserve wine existed in ''kabinett'', sometimes written as ''Kabinettwein''. In 1971, the similar-sounding term ''[[Kabinett]]'' was instead introduced as the lowest level of the ''[[Prädikatswein]]'' category, i.e., with a completely different meaning. Therefore, in the present [[German wine classification]] no legally defined term corresponding to reserve wine exists.

'''Rushani''' is one of the [[Pamir languages]] spoken in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. 

The Roshan area is located in the northern part of the [[Shighnan District]], in the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan.{{fix|text=what about Tajikistan?}} Roshan consists of six villages, five of which are located on the bank of the river [[Panj]], which meets{{what|date=June 2015}} at the border of Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="Muller, Katja. 2010"&gt;Muller, K. 2010: ''Language in Community-Oriented and Contact-Oriented Domains: The Case of the Shughni of Tajakistan.'' SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Rushani speakers belong to the [[Ismaili]] branch of [[Shi'a Islam]].&lt;ref name="Muller, Katja. 2010"/&gt;

==Language use==
Rushani, like other Shugni dialects, is only used in unofficial settings. All of the children in the community learn Rushani as their first language and rely heavily on it until they enroll in school. It is only then that they learn the official language of the country.&lt;ref name="Muller, Katja. 2010"/&gt; Adult speakers are all bi- or tri-lingual in [[Tajik language|Tajik]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

Traditionally Rushani was not a written language, with Rushani speakers writing in Tajik.&lt;ref name="Dodykhudoeva, Leila. 2007"&gt;Dodykhudoeva, L. 2007: ''Revitalization of minority languages: comparative dictionary of key cultural terms in the languages and dialects of the Shugni-Rushani group. London: SOAS.&lt;/ref&gt;. Writing systems have been developed for the language using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts, for example for use in translation of parts of the bible by the [[Institute for Bible Translation]].

==Verbs==
Rushani is unusual in having a [[transitive case]] – a so-called ''double-[[oblique case|oblique]]'' clause structure – in the past tense. That is, in the past tense,&lt;ref&gt;or perhaps [[perfective aspect]]&lt;/ref&gt; the agent and object of a transitive verb are both marked, while the subject of an intransitive verb is not. In the present tense, the object of the transitive verb is marked, the other two roles are not – that is, a typical [[nominative–accusative]] alignment.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Payne, 'Language Universals and Language Types', in Collinge, ed. 1990. ''An Encyclopedia of Language''. Routledge. From Payne, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[transitive case]] for examples.

==More on Rushani Dialect==
Rushani people were a part of the West Pamir ethnic groups that belonged to the Nizari Branch. The Nizari branch was led by the leader Agha Khan the Fourth. The Rushani language group is amongst the few groups that is genetically related and is located close to other locations, all in one region.&lt;ref&gt;R Dodykhudoeva, Leila.

'''Safaliba''' is a [[Gur language]] of [[Ghana]].

A recent project has developed a writing system for the language in order to enable its use in  adult education and early school instruction. The Safaliba writing system is based on the work (1996) of Edmund Kuŋi Yakubu, a Safaliba teacher and activist&lt;ref&gt;Writing &amp; Pedagogy,"[https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/WAP/article/view/30379 Talk to Text Safaliba Literacy Activism: Grassroots Ghanaian Educational Language Policy]" Volume 9, No 1, 2017,&lt;/ref&gt;; a few changes in that system were made by Paul and Jennifer Schaefer, based on their phonological work, but the writing system for the most part stayed the same. &lt;ref&gt;[http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/learn-to-read-safaliba-helps-learn-english/2737208.html Learning to Read in Safaliba Helps Ghanaian Kids Learn English]," 1 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sedang''' is an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic language]] spoken in eastern [[Laos]] and [[Kon Tum Province]] in south central [[Vietnam]]. The Sedang language has the most speakers of any of the languages of the [[North Bahnaric language]] group, a group of languages known for their range of [[vowel]] [[phonation]]s.

Sedang itself has 24 pure vowels: 7 vowel qualities, all of which may be plain ([a]), [[nasal vowel|nasalized]] ([ã]), and [[creaky voice|creaky]] ([a̰]) and three of which /i a o/ may be both nasal and creaky ([ã̰]). While it does not have the length distinctions of other North Bahnaric languages, it has more [[diphthong]]s, between 33 and 55 vowel sounds altogether. Sedang is thus sometimes claimed to have the largest vowel inventory in the world. However, other Bahnaric languages have more vowel qualities (Bahnar, for example, has 9) in addition to phonemic vowel length so the language with the record depends closely on how the languages are described and distinct vowels are defined.

'''Shiplap''' is a type of wooden board used commonly as exterior [[siding]] in the construction of residences, barns, sheds, and outbuildings. 

==Exterior walls==
Shiplap is either rough-sawn {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=off|order=flip}} or milled {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[pine]] or similarly inexpensive [[wood]] between {{convert|3|and|10|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide with a {{convert|3/8|-|1/2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[rabbet]] on opposite sides of each edge.&lt;ref&gt;Shiplap Edge Joints, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/edge/shiplap WoodworkDetails.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbet allows the boards to overlap in this area.  The profile of each board partially overlaps that of the board next to it creating a channel that gives shadow line effects, provides excellent weather protection and allows for dimensional movement.

Useful for its strength as a supporting member, and its ability to form a relatively tight seal when lapped, shiplap is usually used as a type of siding for buildings that do not require extensive maintenance and must withstand cold and aggressive climates. Rough-sawn shiplap is attached vertically in post and beam construction, usually with 6d-8d common [[nail (fastener)|nails]], while milled versions, providing a tighter seal, are more commonly placed horizontally, more suited to two-by-four [[platform framing|frame construction]].

Small doors and shutters such as those found in barns and sheds are often constructed of shiplap cut directly from the walls, with only thin members framing or crossing the back for support.  Shiplap is also used indoors for the rough or rustic look that it creates when used as paneling or a covering for a wall or ceiling.  Shiplap is often used to describe any rabbeted siding material that overlaps in a similar fashion.

==Interior design==
In [[interior design]], shiplap is a style of wooden wall siding characterized by long planks, normally painted white, that are mounted horizontally with a slight gap between them in a manner that evokes exterior shiplap walls. A disadvantage of the style is that the gaps are prone to accumulating dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Frake |first1=Dabney |title=The Downside to Shiplap Walls You Might Not Know About |url=https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/shiplap-wall-siding-pros-cons-259016 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |work=Apartment Therapy |date=22 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1442">'''Starckdeutsch''' (literally, ''strong [[German language|German]]'', albeit with ''ck'' for ''k'', as dictated by the conventions of the variant) is an [[constructed language|imagined language]] created by '''Matthias Koeppel''', a German painter and poet and self-proclaimed ''Sprachkünstler'' (artist of language). It exaggerates stereotypical (mostly phonetic and orthographic) traits of older stages of German and some modern (especially [[Upper German]]) dialects in an impressionistic way, rather than in a rigorously systematic fashion.

Matthias Koeppel started to write humorous poems in "Starckdeutsch" in 1972. A collection of them was published as ''Starckdeutsch. Sämtliche Gedichte'' in 1981.

A '''straight ally''' or '''heterosexual ally''' is a [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] person who supports equal [[civil rights]], [[gender equality]], [[LGBT social movements]], and challenges [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]] and [[transphobia]]. Despite this, some people who meet this definition do not identify themselves as straight allies. A straight ally believes that LGBT people face discrimination and thus are socially and economically disadvantaged. They aim to use their position as heterosexual or cisgender individuals in a society focused on [[heteronormativity]] to fight homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Most LGBT organizations have straight members involved; others actively encourage straight participation. A [[gay–straight alliance]] is a student-run club that brings together LGBT and straight students to create a platform for activism to fight homophobia and transphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsanetwork.org/what-we-do  |title= What We Do: Gay-Straight Alliance|publisher=Gsanetwork.org |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some groups that unite the LGBT community to work together with straight allies. Founded in 1973, [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) is the original straight ally organization, started by [[Jeanne Manford]], mother of the Straight Ally movement. Based in the United States, PFLAG unites parents, families, friends, and straight allies with the LGBT community to move equality forward for LGBT people. In 2007, the organization launched a new project, Straight for Equality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightforequality.org |title=Straight for Equality website |publisher=Straightforequality.org |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help more straight allies become engaged in the LGBT movement in the workplace, healthcare, and now in faith communities. [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]] (GLAD) is another organization specifically formed to group allies of this cause.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Some children of LGBT couples are straight allies, notably Iowan [[Zach Wahls]], the son of two lesbians, though he has expressed a different view of his relationship to the LGBT community:&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Blade'': [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/05/23/that-kid-from-youtube-grows-up/ Phil Reese, "'That kid from YouTube'," May 23, 2012], accessed June 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To be clear, I don't consider myself an ally. I might be [a] straight cisgender man, but in my mind, I am a member of the LGBT community. I know the last thing that anyone wants is to add another letter to the acronym, but we need to make sure as a movement we're making a place for what we call "queer-spawn" to function and to be part of the community. Because even though I'm not gay, I do know what its like to be hated for who I am. And I do know what its like to be in the closet, and like every other member of the LGBT community, I did not have a choice in this. I was born into this movement.}}

Straight allies may receive criticism for a variety of reasons. For example, some believe that straight allies are unable to step outside their own heteronormative world to advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeTurk|first=Sara|title=Allies in Action: The Communicative Experiences of People Who Challenge Social Injustice on Behalf of Others.|journal=Communication Quarterly|date=2011|volume=59|issue=5|pages=569–590|doi=10.1080/01463373.2011.614209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight allies are also criticized for using LGBTQ advocacy as a means to gain popularity and status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Becker|first=Ron|title=Gay-Themed Television and the Slumpy Class: The Affordable, Multicultural Politics of the Gay Nineties|journal=Television News Media|date=2006|volume=7|pages=184–215|doi=10.1177/1527476403255830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9528">A '''teachable moment''', in education, is the time at which learning a particular topic or idea becomes possible or easiest.

==In education==
The concept was popularized by [[Robert J. Havighurst|Robert Havighurst]] in his 1952 book, ''Human Development and Education.'' In the context of [[education theory]], Havighurst explained,  
:"A developmental task is a task which is learned at a specific point and which makes achievement of succeeding tasks possible. When the timing is right, the ability to learn a particular task will be possible. This is referred to as a 'teachable moment.' It is important to keep in mind that unless the time is right, learning will not occur. Hence, it is important to repeat important points whenever possible so that when a student's teachable moment occurs, s/he can benefit from the knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Havinghurst, Robert James, (1952). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OBl-AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=human+development+and+education&amp;dq=human+development+and+education&amp;client=firefox-a  ''Human Development and Education,'' p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept pre-dates Havighurst's book, as does use of the phrase,&lt;ref&gt;For example, "...this opportune time, this most teachable moment..."  Brandenburg, Walter E. (1917).  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-L1215r80i0C&amp;pg=PA84 The Philosophy of Christian Being]''.  Sherman, French, p. 84. Retrieved on 2009-08-01.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is credited with popularizing it.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Barbara Frankel. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0212/issue/letters-footnote.html  Letters: "Footnote to a headline,"] ''University of Chicago Magazine.'' Vol. 95, No. 2 (December 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase sometimes denotes not a developmental stage, but rather "that moment when a unique, high interest situation arises that lends itself to discussion of a particular topic."&lt;ref&gt;Lozo, Fredric (2005).

In July 2009, [[Harvard]] professor [[Henry Louis Gates]] was arrested at his home; the incident garnered media attention throughout the [[United States]].  The mayor of Cambridge, [[E. Denise Simmons]], said that she hoped that the result would be a "teachable moment".&lt;ref&gt;CBS Broadcasting, Inc. [http://wbztv.com/local/Henry.Louis.Gates.2.1096348.html [[Deval Patrick|Patrick]] 'Troubled' By Harvard Professor's Arrest]. WBZ-TV, July 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] expressed the same hope as Simmons:

{{quote|My hope is, is that as a consequence of this event this ends up being what's called a 'teachable moment', where all of us instead of pumping up the volume spend a little more time listening to each other and try to focus on how we can generally improve relations between police officers and minority communities, and that instead of flinging accusations we can all be a little more reflective in terms of what we can do to contribute to more unity."&lt;ref&gt;Obama, Barack.

Obama's use of the phrase attracted considerable comment in the American media and blogosphere. Gates himself echoed the same theme, stating, "I told the President that my entire career as an educator has been devoted to racial healing and improved race relations in this country. I am determined that this be a teaching moment."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Peter and Helene Cooper.

July 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2011, Professor Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor of the [[University of Melbourne]], used the term in an article&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111001010558/http://www.campusreview.com.au/pages/section/article.php?s=News&amp;idArticle=21394 ]&lt;/ref&gt; in Campus Review, describing the Australian Higher Education Base Funding Review as a rare opportunity to educate a wider public about how public tertiary education is supported. Davis argued that Australian Universities must show why Australia's public universities returned to the community the money spent providing higher education, and that this constituted a teachable moment.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Pragmatic use==
A teachable moment is often best demonstrated with a significant emotional or traumatic event, the emphasis being on the 'moment' versus the lesson. An example would be,  after a high-speed [[motor vehicle accident]], when the use of a [[seat belt]] has obviously saved a life, or conversely, when the lack of a seat belt has caused loss of life.

[[Law enforcement agency|Law enforcement]] and [[first responder]]s are often taught and encouraged to use appropriate situations to 'teach' the public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Trust and the creation of teachable moments==
Teachable moments are not limited to episodes following error or miscreancy, where vulnerability opens the learner to teaching.  There is also much work on the mechanisms and psychology by which teachable moments are created in relationships.

Recent work by developmental psychologists Gyorgy Gergely and Gergely Csibra&lt;ref&gt;Gergely Csibra and Gyorgy Gergely (2011) "Natural pedagogy as evolutionary adaptation" Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B  366, 1149–1157.  http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1567/1149&lt;/ref&gt; that has been picked up by other psychologists and psychotherapists, especially [[Peter Fonagy]] and Elizabeth Allison,&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter; Allison, Elizabeth (2014) The role of mentalizing and epistemic trust in the therapeutic relationship. Psychotherapy, Vol 51(3), Sep 2014, 372-380.&lt;/ref&gt; describes a "natural pedagogical stance": this is accessed only when "epistemic trust" is created in the "learner", and epistemic trust is created when the learner experiences (''recognises'') his or her own mind in that "teachable moment" as having been accepted and understood by the "teacher".  This is what triggers curiosity in the contents of the understanding mind of the teacher, and a readiness to ''generalise'' the information taken in from the teacher to other contexts and people.  Some impressive experimental evidence supports this theory.  They argue that this learning pathway is almost entirely human-specific, requiring as it does the linked psychological function of [[mentalization]] to have occurred.

The logical corollary of this line of thinking is that in creating the "teachable moment" the "teacher's" first job is not to consider how to change the learner's mind, but ''how to change his or her own mind'', in order to better represent that mind of the learner ''as it is now'', and create conditions (through utterances, facial expression and other cues) in which it can be recognised by the learner.

'''Universal pragmatics''' ('''UP'''), more recently placed under the heading of '''formal pragmatics''', is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an [[understanding]] through [[communication]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] coined the term in his essay "What is Universal Pragmatics?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and the Evolution of Society|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|publisher=Beacon Press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he suggests that human [[competition]], conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of [[modal logic|modal]] confusions.  The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social [[Group conflict|conflict]].

By coming to an "understanding," he means at the very least, when two or more [[social actor]]s share the same [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]] about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s (or a "mutually recognized [[normative background]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Habermas, the [[Objective (goal)|goal]] of coming to an understanding is "intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and accord with one another".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas' goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the [[Coordination game|social coordination]] needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives (a form of action termed "[[communicative action]]").

As an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from [[pragmatics]], [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], [[informal logic]], and the [[philosophy of language]], through [[social philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]], to [[ethics]], especially [[discourse ethics]], and on to [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

==History==
Universal pragmatics (UP) seeks to overcome three dichotomies:  the dichotomy between ''body and mind'', between ''theory and practice'', and between ''[[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is part of a larger project to rethink the relationship between philosophy and the individual [[science]]s during a period of social crisis. The project is within the tradition of [[Critical Theory]], a program that traces back to the work of [[Max Horkheimer]].

The term "universal pragmatics" includes two different traditions that Habermas and his collaborator, colleague, and friend [[Karl-Otto Apel]] have attempted to reconcile. On the one hand, ideas are drawn from the tradition of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], wherein words and concepts are regarded as universally valid [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealizations]] of shared meanings. And, on the other hand, inspiration is drawn from the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] tradition (feat. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Charles W. Morris]]), for whom words are usually arbitrary signs devoid of intrinsic meaning, and whose function is to denote the things and processes in the objective world that surrounds the speakers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

UP shares with [[speech act]] theory, semiotics, and [[linguistics]] an interest in the details of language use and communicative action. However, unlike those fields, it insists on a difference between the linguistic data that we ''observe'' in the '[[Analysis|analytic]]' mode, and the ''[[rational reconstruction]] of the rules of symbol systems'' that each reader/listener possesses intuitively when interpreting strings of words. In this sense, it is an examination of the two ways that language usage can be analyzed: as an object of scientific investigation, and as a 'rational reconstruction' of intuitive linguistic 'know-how'.

==Goals and methods==
Universal pragmatics is associated with the philosophical method of ''rational reconstruction''.

The basic concern in universal pragmatics is ''utterances'' (or ''[[speech acts]]'') in general.  This is in contrast to most other fields of linguistics, which tend to be more specialized, focusing exclusively on very specific sorts of utterances such as ''sentences'' (which in turn are made up of ''[[word]]s'', ''[[morpheme]]s'', and ''[[phoneme]]s'').

For Habermas, the most significant difference between a sentence and an utterance is in that sentences are judged according to how well they make sense ''grammatically'', while utterances are judged according to their ''communicative validity'' (see section 1). (1979:31)

Universal pragmatics is also distinct from the field of [[sociolinguistics]], because universal pragmatics is only interested in the meanings of utterances ''if they have to do with claims about truth or rightness'', while sociolinguistics is interested in all utterances in their social contexts. (1979:31, 33)

==Three aspects of universal pragmatics==
There are three ways to evaluate an utterance, according to UP. There are ''theories that deal with elementary propositions'', ''theories of first-person sentences'', and ''theories of speech acts''.

A theory of elementary propositions investigates those things in the real world that are being ''[[Theory of reference|reference]]d'' by an utterance, and the things that are implied by an [[utterance]], or ''predicate'' it. For example, the utterance "The first [[Prime Minister]] of Canada" refers to a man who went by the name of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]. And when a speaker delivers the utterance, "My [[husband]] is a [[lawyer]]", it implies that the speaker is married to a man.

A theory of first-person sentences examines the expression of the ''intentions'' of the actor(s) through language and in the first-person.

Finally, a theory of speech acts examines the setting of standards for interpersonal relations through language. The basic goal for speech act theory is to explain how and when utterances in general are ''[[performative]]''. (1979:34) Central to the notion of speech acts are the ideas of [[illocutionary force]] and [[Perlocutionary act|perlocutionary force]], both terms coined by philosopher [[J.L. Austin]]. ''Illocutionary force'' describes the intent of the speaker, while ''perlocutionary force'' means ''the effect an utterance has in the world'', or more specifically, the effect on others.

A performative utterance is a sentence where an action being performed is done by the utterance itself. For example: "I inform you that you have a moustache", or "I promise you I will not burn down the house". In these cases, the words are also taken as significant actions: the act of informing and promising (respectively).

Habermas adds to this the observation that speech acts can either succeed or fail, depending on whether or not they succeed on ''[[Influence (sociology)|influencing]]'' another person in the intended way. (1979:35)

This last method of evaluation—the theory of speech acts—is the domain that Habermas is most interested in developing as a ''theory of communicative action''.

==Communicative action==

There are a number of ways to approach Habermas's project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication. Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]]. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.

The coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. [[Rational choice theory]] and [[game theory]] are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of ''communicative action''. (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication are inseparable.

Habermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining [[social action]]. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, ''the system'' and ''the [[lifeworld]]''. These designate two distinct modes of [[social integration]]:
* The kind of social integration accomplished in the system is accomplished through ''the functional integration of the consequences of actions''. It bypasses the consciousness of individuals and does not depend upon their being oriented towards acting collectively. Economic and industrial systems are great examples, often producing complex forms of social integration and interdependence despite the openly competitive orientations of individuals.
* The social integration accomplished in the lifeworld, by contrast, depends upon ''the coordination of action plans and the conscious action-orientations of individuals''. It relies on processes of human interaction involving symbolic and cultural forms of meaning. More specifically, as Habermas maintains, the coordination of the lifeworld is accomplished through communicative action.

Thus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of [[society]]. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and [[socialization|socializing]] individuals.

However, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates ''communicative action'' from ''strategic action''. The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.

Strategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding. Both involve the symbolic resources of the lifeworld and occur primarily by way of linguistic interaction. On the one hand, actors employing communicative actions draw on the uniquely impelling force of mutual understanding to align the orientation of their action plans. It is this subtle but insistent binding force of communicative interactions that opens the door to an understanding of their meanings. On the other hand, actors employing strategic actions do not exploit the potential of communication that resides in the mutual recognition of a shared action-oriented understanding. Instead strategic actors relate to others with no intention of reaching consensus or mutual understanding, but only the intention of accomplishing pre-determined ends unrelated to reaching an understanding. Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction. Reaching a reciprocally defined understanding is communication's basic function.

Keeping in mind this delineation of the object domain, the formal pragmatics of communication can be more readily laid out. The essential insight has already been mentioned, which is that communication is responsible for irreplaceable modes of social integration, and this is accomplished through the unique binding force of a shared understanding. This is, in a sense, the pragmatic piece of formal pragmatics: communication does something in the world. What needs to be explained are the conditions for the possibility of what communication already does. This is, in a sense, the formal piece of formal pragmatics: a rational reconstruction of the deep generative structures that are the universal conditions for the possibility of a binding and compelling mutual understanding.

From here, Habermas heads the analysis in two directions. In one direction is a kind of [[linguistic analysis]] (of speech acts), which can be placed under the heading of the validity dimensions of communication. The other direction entails a categorization of the idealized presuppositions of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=T|date=1984|title=Reason and the Rationalization of Society|url=|journal=The Theory of Communicative Action|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicative competence===

Habermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.

# That they have ''uttered something'' understandably — or ''their statements are intelligible'';
# That they have given other people ''something to understand'' — or are speaking ''something true'';
# That ''the speaker'' is therefore understandable — or their ''intentions are recognized and appreciated'' for what they are; and,
# That they have come to an understanding ''with another person'' — or, they have used ''words that both actors can agree upon''. (1979:4)

Habermas is emphatic that these claims are universal—no human communication oriented at achieving mutual understanding could possibly fail to raise all of these validity claims.  Additionally, to illustrate that all other forms of communication are derived from that which is oriented toward mutual understanding, he argues that there are no other kinds of validity claims whatsoever.  This is important, because it is the basis of Habermas' critique of [[postmodernism]].

The fundamental orientation toward mutual understanding is at the heart of universal pragmatics, as Habermas explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task of universal pragmatics is to identify and reconstruct universal conditions of possible mutual understanding... other forms of social action—for example, conflict, competition, strategic action in general—are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding.  Furthermore, since language is the specific medium of reaching understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution, I want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1976, "What is universal pragmatics?" p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any meaning that meets the above criteria, and is recognized by another as meeting the criteria, is considered "''vindicated''" or ''communicatively competent''.

In order for anyone to speak validly — and therefore, to have his or her comments vindicated, and therefore reach a genuine consensus and understanding — Habermas notes that a few more fundamental commitments are required. First, he notes, actors ''have to treat this formulation of validity so seriously that it might be a precondition for any communication at all''. Second, he asserts that ''all actors must believe that their claims are able to meet these standards of validity''. And third, he insists that there must be a common conviction among actors that all validity claims ''are either already vindicated or could be vindicated''.

===Examining the validity of speech===

Habermas claims that communication rests upon a non-egoistic understanding of the world, which is an idea he borrowed from thinkers like [[Jean Piaget]]. A subject capable of a de-centered understanding can take up three fundamentally different attitudes to the world. Habermas refers to such attitudes as ''dimensions of validity''. Specifically, this means individuals can recognize different standards for validity—i.e., that the validation of an [[empirical]] truth claim requires different methods and procedures than the validation of subjective truthfulness, and that both of those require different methods and procedures of validation than claims to normative rightness.

These dimensions of validity can be summarized as claims to ''truth (IT), truthfulness (I),'' and ''rightness (WE)''. So the ability to differentiate between the attitudes (and their respective "worlds") mentioned above should be understood as an ability to distinguish between types of validity claims.

M. Cooke provided the only book length treatment of Habermas's [[communication theory]]. Cooke explains:
:"when we adopt an objectifying attitude we relate, in the first instance to the objective world of facts and existing states of affairs [IT]; when we adopt a norm-conformative attitude we relate, in the first instance, to the social world of normatively regulated interactions [WE]; when we adopt an expressive attitude we relate, in the first instance to the subjective world of inner [[experience]] [I]". (Cooke 1994)

This is fundamental to Habermas's analysis of communication. He maintains that the performance of any speech act necessarily makes reference to these dimensions of validity, by raising at least three validity claims.

One way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs which are not the case (IT);
# does not conform to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises doubts about the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

Of course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs that are true (IT);
# conforms to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises no doubts concerning the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

This means that when engaging in communication the speaker and hearer are inescapably oriented to the validity of what is said. A speech act can be understood as an offering, the success or failure of which depends upon the hearer's response of either accepting or rejecting the validity claims it raises. The three dimensions of validity pointed out above are implicated in any attempt at communication.

Thus, communication relies on its being embedded within relations to various dimensions of validity. Any and every speech act is infused with inter-subjectively recognized claims to be valid. This implicitly ties communication to argumentation and various [[discourse|discursive]] procedures for the redemption of validity claims. This is true because to raise a validity claim in communication is to simultaneously imply that one is able to show, if challenged, that one's claim is justified. Communication is possible because speakers are accountable for the validity of what they say. This assumption of responsibility on the part of the speaker is described by Habermas as a ''"warranty"'', because in most cases the validity claims raised during communication are taken as [[wikt:justify|justified]], and communication proceeds on that basis. Similarly, the hearer is accountable for the stance he or she takes up in relation to the validity claims raised by the speaker. Both speaker and hearer are bound to the validity claims raised by the utterances they share during communication. They are bound by the weak obligations inherent in pursuing actions oriented towards reaching an understanding. Habermas would claim that this obligation is a rational one:

:"With every speech act, by virtue of the validity claims it raises, the speaker enters into an interpersonal relationship of mutual obligation with the hearer: The speaker is obliged to support her claims with reasons, if challenged, and the hearer is obliged to accept a claim unless he has good reason not to do so. The obligation in question is, in the first instance, not a moral one but a rational one -- the penalty of failure to fulfill it is the charge not of immorality but of irrationality -- although clearly the two will often overlap" (Cooke, 1994).

This begins to point towards the idea of [[communicative rationality]], which is the potential for [[rationality]] that is implicit in the validity basis of everyday communication, the shape of reason that can be extracted from Habermas's formal-pragmatic analyses.

:"The modern -- decentered -- understanding of the world has opened up different dimensions of validity; to the extent that each dimension of validity has its own standards of truth and falsity and its own modes of justification for determining these, one may say that what has been opened up are dimensions of rationality" (Cooke, 1994).

However, before the idea of communicative rationality can be described, the other direction of Habermas's formal pragmatic analyses of communication needs to be explained. This direction looks towards the idealized presuppositions of communication.

===Ideal presuppositions of communication===

When individuals pursue actions oriented towards reaching an understanding, the speech acts they exchange take on the weight of a mutually recognized validity. This means each actor involved in communication takes the other as [[accountable]] for what they have said, which implies that good reasons could be given by all to justify the validity of the understanding that is being achieved. Again, in most situations the redemption of validity claims is not an explicit undertaking (except in ''discourses'', see below). Instead, each actor issues a ''"warranty"'' of accountability to the other, which only needs to be redeemed if certain validity claims are thrown into question. This suggests that the validity claims raised in every communicative interaction implicitly tie communication to argumentation.

It is here that the idealized presuppositions of communication arise. Habermas claims that all forms of argumentation, even implicit and rudimentary ones, rest upon certain "idealizing suppositions," which are rooted in the very structures of action oriented towards understanding. These "strong idealizations" are always understood as at least approximately satisfied by participants in situations where argumentation (and communication) is thought to be taking place. Thus, when during communication it is discovered that the belief that these presuppositions are satisfied is not justified it is always taken as problematic. As a result, steps are usually taken to reestablish and maintain the belief that they are approximately satisfied, or communication is simply called off.

# The most basic of these idealized presuppositions is the presupposition that ''participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way''. This is an obvious but interesting point, which clearly illustrates what an idealized presupposition is. It is a presupposition because communication would not proceed if those involved did not think it was at least approximately satisfied (in this case that a shared language was being used). It is idealized because no matter how closely it is approximated it is always [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] (because, in this case, the fact is that all meanings are to some degree personally defined).
# Another, basic idealized presupposition of argumentation is the presupposition that ''no relevant argument is [[self-censorship|suppressed]] or excluded by the participants''.
# Another is the presupposition that ''no [[persuasion|persuasive]] force except that of the better argument is exerted''.
# There is also the presupposition that ''all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument''.
# There is the presupposition of attributing a ''context-transcending significance to validity claims''. This presupposition is controversial but important (and becomes expanded and clarified in the presuppositions of discourse, see below). The idea is that participants in communication instill their claims with a validity that is understood to have significance beyond the specific context of their agreement.
# The presupposition that ''no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation'';
# The presupposition that ''everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate'', and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires.

In sum, all these presuppositions must be assumed to be approximately satisfied in any situation of communication, despite their being necessarily counterfactual. Habermas refers to the positing of these idealized presuppositions as the "simultaneously unavoidable and trivial accomplishments that sustain communicative action and argumentation".

Habermas calls ''discourses'' those forms of communication that come sufficiently close to actually satisfying these presuppositions. Discourses often occur within [[institutional]]ized forms of argumentation that self-reflectively refine their procedures of communication, and as a result, have a more rigorous set of presuppositions in addition to the ones listed above.

A striking feature of discourse is that validity claims tend to be explicitly thematized and there is the presupposition that all possible [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]]s would agree to the universal validity of the conclusions reached. Habermas especially highlights this in what he calls ''theoretical discourses'' and ''practical discourses''. These are tied directly to two of the three dimensions of validity discussed above: theoretical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized regarding objective states of affairs (IT); practical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized concerning the rightness of norms governing social interactions (WE).

Habermas understands presupposition (5) to be responsible for generating the self-understanding and continuation of theoretical and practical discourses. Presupposition (5) points out that the validity of an understanding reached in theoretical or practical discourse, concerning some factual knowledge or normative principle, is always expanded beyond the immediate context in which it is achieved. The idea is that participants in discourses such as these presuppose that any understanding reached could attain universal [[Consensus|agreement]] concerning its universal validity if these discourses could be relieved of the constraints of time and space. This idealized presupposition directs discourses concerning truth and normative certainty beyond the contingencies of specific communicative situations and towards the idealized achievements of universal consensus and universal validity. It is a rational reconstruction of the conditions for the possibility of earnest discourses concerning facts and norms. Recall that, for Habermas, rational reconstructions aim at offering the most acceptable account of what allows for the competencies already mastered by a wide range of subjects. In order for discourse to proceed, the existence of [[fact]]s and [[Norm (philosophy)|norms]] must be presupposed, yet the certainty of an absolute [[knowledge]] of them must be, in a sense, postponed.

Striking a Piagetian and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]an chord, Habermas understands the deep structures of collective inquiry as [[Developmental psychology|development]]al. Thus, the presupposition shared by individuals involved in discourse is taken to reflect this. The pursuit of truth and normative certainty is taken to be motivated and grounded, not in some objective or social world that is treated as a "given", but rather in a learning process. Indeed, Habermas himself is always careful to formulate his work as a [[research project]], open to refinement.

In any case, reconstructing the presuppositions and validity dimensions inherent to communication is valuable because it brings into relief the inescapable foundations of everyday practices. Communicative action and the rudimentary forms of argumentation that orient the greater part of human interaction cannot be left behind. By reconstructing the deep structures of these Habermas has discovered a seed of rationality planted in the very heart of the lifeworld. Everyday practices, which are common enough to be trivial, such as reaching an understanding with another, or contesting the reasons for pursuing a course of action, contain an implicit and idealized rationality.

In other words, communication is always somewhat rational. Communication could not occur if the participants thought that the speech acts exchanged did not carry the weight of a validity for which those participating could be held accountable. Nor would anyone feel that a conclusion was justified if it was achieved by any other means than the uncoerced force of the better argument. Nor could the specialized discourses of [[law]], science and [[morality]] continue if the progress of knowledge and insight was denied in favor of [[relativism]].

====Criticism====
It is a question how appropriate it is to speak of "communication" tenselessly, and of "everyday practices" as though they cut across all times and cultures. That they do cannot be assumed, and [[anthropology]] provides evidence of significant difference. It is possible to ignore these facts by limiting the scope of universal pragmatics to current forms of discourse, but this runs the risk of contradicting Habermas's own demand for (5). Moreover, the initial unease with the classical and [[Liberalism|liberal]] views of rationality had to do precisely with their ahistorical character and refusal, or perhaps inability, to acknowledge their own origins in circumstances of the day. Their veneer of false universality torn off by the likes of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], it remains to be seen whether "universal" pragmatics can stand up to the same challenges posed by [[deconstruction]] and [[skepticism]].

He is especially remembered as a [[Linguistics|linguist]] who made important contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], [[ethnolinguistics]] and to the theory and practice of education.  In particular, he is widely recognized as having been the architect of the [[Humboldtian education ideal]], which was used from the beginning in [[Prussian education system|Prussia]] as a model for its system of education and eventually in countries such as the [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]].

His younger brother, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], was famous as a geographer, naturalist, and explorer.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Klencke, Gustav Schlesier, ''Lives of the brothers Humboldt, Alexander and William'' New York, 1853:13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Humboldt was born in [[Potsdam]], [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], and died in [[Tegel]], [[Province of Brandenburg]].

In June 1791, he married [[Caroline von Humboldt|Caroline von Dacheröden]]. They had eight children, of whom five (one of them [[Gabriele von Bülow|Gabriele von Humboldt]]) survived to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-humboldt/ [[Kurt Mueller-Vollmer]] "Wilhelm von Humboldt", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosopher ==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Humboldt was a [[philosopher]]; he wrote ''[[The Limits of State Action]]'' in 1791–1792 (though it was not published until 1850, after Humboldt's death), one of the boldest defences of the liberties of [[The Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]]. It influenced [[John Stuart Mill|John Stuart Mill's]] essay ''[[On Liberty]]'' through which von Humboldt's ideas became known in the English-speaking world. Humboldt outlined an early version of what Mill would later call the "[[harm principle]]". His house in Rome became a cultural hub, run by Caroline von Humboldt.

The section dealing with education was published in the December 1792 issue of the ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'' under the title "On public state education". With this publication, Humboldt took part in the philosophical debate regarding the direction of national education that was in progress in Germany, as elsewhere, after the French Revolution.

== Educational reforms ==
[[File:Thorvaldsen, Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1808.jpg|thumb|left| Bust of Wilhelm von Humboldt, by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]],  1808.]]

Humboldt had been home schooled and never finished his comparably short university studies at the universities of [[Viadrina European University|Frankfurt (Oder)]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. Nevertheless, he became one of the most influential officials in German education. Actually, Humboldt had intended to become Minister of education, but failed to attain that position. The Prussian King asked him to leave Rome in 1809 and to lead the directorate of education under [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]]. Humboldt did not reply to the appointment for several weeks and would have preferred to stay on at the embassy in Rome. His wife did not return with him to Prussia; the couple met again when Humboldt stepped down from the educational post and was appointed head of the Embassy in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Geier: ''Die Brüder Humboldt''. Reinbek bei Hamburg 2009, pp. 261 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt installed a standardized system of public instruction, from basic schools till secondary education, and founded Berlin University. He imposed a standardization of state examinations and inspections and created a special department within the ministry to oversee and design curricula, textbooks and learning aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Christopher|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|location=United States of America|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt's plans for reforming the Prussian school system were not published until long after his death, together with his fragment of a treatise on the 'Theory of Human Education', which he had written in about 1793. Here, Humboldt states that 'the ultimate task of our existence is to give the fullest possible content to the concept of humanity in our own person […] through the impact of actions in our own lives.' This task 'can only be implemented through the links established between ourselves as individuals and the world around us' (GS, I, p.&amp;nbsp;283).

Humboldt's concept of education does not lend itself solely to individualistic interpretation. It is true that he always recognized the importance of the organization of individual life and the 'development of a wealth of individual forms' (GS, III, p.&amp;nbsp;358), but he stressed the fact that 'self-education can only be continued […] in the wider context of development of the world' (GS, VII, p.&amp;nbsp;33). In other words, the individual is not only entitled, but also obliged, to play his part in shaping the world around him.

Humboldt's educational ideal was entirely coloured by social considerations. He never believed that the 'human race could culminate in the attainment of a general perfection conceived in abstract terms'. In 1789, he wrote in his diary that 'the education of the individual requires his incorporation into society and involves his links with society at large' (GS, XIV, p.&amp;nbsp;155). In his essay on the 'Theory of Human Education', he answered the question as to the 'demands which must be made of a nation, of an age and of the human race'. 'Education, truth and virtue' must be disseminated to such an extent that the 'concept of mankind' takes on a great and dignified form in each individual (GS, I, p.&amp;nbsp;284). However, this shall be achieved personally by each individual, who must 'absorb the great mass of material offered to him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most general, active and harmonious form' (GS, II, p.&amp;nbsp;117).

Humboldt educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote: "There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Profiles of educators: Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) by Karl-Heinz Günther (1988), {{DOI|10.1007/BF02192965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]] criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European  education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] and Humboldt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/45/Bachelor-Kritik|title=Bologna-Prozess: Die Chance zum Kompromiss ist da|last=Nida-Rümelin|first=Julian|date=29 October 2009|work=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|access-date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomat ==
As a successful diplomat between 1802 and 1819, Humboldt was [[plenipotentiary]] Prussian minister at [[Rome]] from 1802, ambassador at [[Vienna]] from 1812 during the closing struggles of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], at the congress of [[Prague]] (1813) where he was instrumental in drawing [[Austria]] to ally with [[Prussia]] and [[Russia]] against [[France]], a signer of the peace treaty at [[Paris]] and the treaty between [[Prussia]] and defeated [[Saxony]] (1815), at [[Frankfurt]] settling post-[[Napoleon]]ic [[Germany]], and at the congress at [[Aachen]] in 1818. However, the increasingly [[reactionary]] policy of the [[Prussia]]n government made him give up political life in 1819; and from that time forward he devoted himself solely to literature and study.

== Linguist ==
[[File:Wilhelm von Humboldt Denkmal - Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Wilhelm von Humboldt]] outside [[Humboldt University]], Unter den Linden, Berlin.]]
Wilhelm von Humboldt was an adept [[linguistics|linguist]] and studied the [[Basque language]]. He translated [[Pindar]] and [[Aeschylus]] into German.

Humboldt's work as a [[philology|philologist]] in [[Basque language|Basque]] has had more extensive impact than his other work. His visit to the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque country]] resulted in ''Researches into the Early Inhabitants of Spain by the help of the Basque language'' (1821). In this work, Humboldt endeavored to show by examining geographical placenames that at one time a race or races speaking dialects allied to modern [[Basque language|Basque]] extended throughout [[Spain]], southern [[France]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]; he identified these people with the ''[[Iberians]]'' of classical writers, and further surmised that they had been allied with the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of northern [[Africa]]. Humboldt's pioneering work has been superseded in its details by modern [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]], but is sometimes still uncritically followed even today. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1820,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldt died while preparing his greatest work, on the ancient [[Kawi language]] of [[Java (island)|Java]], but its introduction was published in 1836 as ''The Heterogeneity of Language and its Influence on the Intellectual Development of Mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1999|title=Wilhelm von Humboldt's Study of the Kawi Language: The Proof of the Existence Of the Malayan-Polynesian Language Culture|url=http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_97-01/991_humboldt_kawi.html|dead-url=yes|journal=[[Fidelio Magazine]]|volume=VIII|author1=Muriel Mirak Weissbach|number=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712080831/http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_97-01/991_humboldt_kawi.html|archivedate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His essay on the philosophy of speech

&lt;blockquote&gt;...first clearly laid down that the character and structure of a language expresses the inner life and knowledge of its speakers, and that languages must differ from one another in the same way and to the same degree as those who use them. Sounds do not become words until a meaning has been put into them, and this meaning embodies the thought of a community. What Humboldt terms the inner form of a language is just that mode of denoting the relations between the parts of a sentence which reflects the manner in which a particular body of men regards the world about them. It is the task of the morphology of speech to distinguish the various ways in which languages differ from each other as regards their inner form, and to classify and arrange them accordingly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is credited with being the first European [[linguistics|linguist]] to identify human language as a rule-governed system, rather than just a collection of words and phrases paired with meanings. This idea is one of the foundations of [[Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] [[transformational grammar|theory of language]]. Chomsky frequently quotes Humboldt's description of language as a system which "makes infinite use of finite means", meaning that an infinite number of sentences can be created using a finite number of grammatical rules. Humboldt scholar Tilman Borsche, however, notes profound differences between von Humboldt's view of language and Chomsky's.&lt;ref&gt;see Tilman Borsche: ''Sprachansichten. Der Begriff der menschlichen Rede in der Sprachphilosophie Wilhelm von Humboldts'', Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Humboldt has also been credited as an originator of the [[linguistic relativity]] hypothesis (more commonly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]), developed by linguists [[Edward Sapir]] or [[Benjamin Whorf]] a century later.

The reception of Humboldt's work remains problematic in English-speaking countries, despite the work of Langham Brown, Manchester and James W. Underhill (Humboldt, Worldview &amp; Language, 2009), on account of his concept of what he called ''Weltansicht'', the linguistic worldview, with ''Weltanschauung'' being translated simply as 'worldview', a term associated with ideologies and cultural mindsets in both German and English. The centrality of distinction in understanding Humboldt's work was set out by one of the leading contemporary German Humboldt scholars, Jürgen Trabant, in his works in both German and French.  Polish linguists at the Lublin School (see [[Jerzy Bartmiński]]), in their research of Humboldt, also stress this distinction between the worldviews of a personal or political kind and the worldview that is implicit in language as a conceptual system.

However, little rigorous research in English has gone into exploring the relationship between the linguistic worldview and the transformation and maintenance of this worldview by individual speakers. One notable exception is the work of Underhill, who explores comparative linguistic studies in both ''Creating Worldviews: Language'', ''Ideology &amp; Metaphor'' (2011) and in ''Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: Truth, Love, Hate &amp; War'' (2012). In Underhill's work, a distinction is made between five forms of worldview: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world and perspective, in order to convey the distinctions Humboldt was concerned with preserving in his ethnolinguistics. Probably the best-known linguist working with a truly Humboldtian perspective writing in English today is [[Anna Wierzbicka]], who has published a number of comparative works on semantic universals and conceptual distinctions in language.

The Rouen Ethnolinguistics Project, in France, published online a 7-hour series of lectures on Humboldt's thought on language, with the Berlin specialist Prof. Trabant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://webtv.univ-rouen.fr/permalink/c1253a18f7e5ecnge8dp/ The Jurgen Trabant Wilhelm von Humboldt Lectures], launched by the Rouen University Ethnolinguistics Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s important summative work, ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity'', (Taylor, 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Charles (2016) ''The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; von Humboldt is given credit, along with [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], for inspiring Taylor's "HHH" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.
