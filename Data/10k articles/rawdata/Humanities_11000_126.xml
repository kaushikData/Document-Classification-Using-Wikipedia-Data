'''''Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization''''' (2004), an archaeological book written about the ancient [[Maya civilization]]. It was written  by [[Arthur Demarest]], Ingram Professor of [[Anthropology]] at [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Maya - Assets - Cambridge - Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Maya - Assets - Cambridge - Cambridge University Press |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/.../9780521592246_frontmatter.pdf |publisher=Cambridge |accessdate=15 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book discusses the complex lifestyle and amazing political history of the Maya states, from the first to eighth centuries. It also gives an explanation of the mystery of the  [[Classic Maya collapse|ninth-century abandonment]] of most of the [[List of Maya sites|great rainforest cities]]. It goes on to conclude that the Maya civilization   has lessons for civilization today.&lt;ref name="Ancient Maya"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Maya|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1150608/?site_locale=en_GB|publisher=Cambridge|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''AFROMET''' (Association For the Return of the Magdala Ethiopian Treasures) is an organization seeking the return of looted treasures to Ethiopia.

==History==
After the [[Battle of Magdala]] in 1868, the victorious British expedition looted a great many books and artifacts not only from the city of Maqdala but also from the Ethiopian Christian church of [[Medhane Alem]].&lt;ref name=pankhurst&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.afromet.org/history/
|title=Maqdala and its loot  
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|accessdate=July 8, 2008|publisher=[[Institute of Ethiopian Studies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Henry M. Stanley]], the loot included "an infinite variety of gold, and silver and brass crosses", as well as "heaps of parchment royally illuminated". Fifteen elephants and almost two hundred mules were required to bear the loot to the nearby Dalanta Plain for auction. Richard Holmes, then Assistant in the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts, purchased 350 manuscripts and various solid goods, such as the crown of the [[Abun]] (Head of the Ethiopian Church).

Most of the loot is still missing; some of it is known to be held in public collections such as the [[British Museum]]. For example, a manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] bears a pencil note: ''"taken from a church at Maqdala in 1868"''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the mid-20th century, world law and opinion gradually came to ban [[looting]], most notably codified in the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]. A problem remained as to the status of goods looted previously. A number of efforts to return cultural items grew up around the world, of which AFROMET is one.

==Progress==
The Ethiopian government started requesting the return of the looted goods within three years of the battle, with some small success.&lt;ref name=pankhurst_2&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2004/06/04-06-04/An.htm
|title=Ethiopian Cultural Restitution
|author=Pankhurst, Richard
|year=2006
|accessdate=February 4, 2007
|publisher=Addis Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, progress in general was slow.

Lady [[Valerie Meux]] bequeathed her collection of Ethiopian manuscripts to Emperor [[Menilek II]], but her will was overturned shortly after her death in 1910, on the grounds that Menilek was dead when Lady Meux died (which, in fact, was untrue; he died in 1913 and in any case he had heirs).

The British Government occasionally returned some of the looted items. In 1965, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] returned to Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] the royal cap and seal of [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]].

AFROMET was formed to lobby systematically for the repatriation of the objects, using legal means and public pressure. So far 10 items have been returned by private donors including a hand-written [[Book of Psalms]], two [[Tabot]]s and a shield. More than 460 items are still being claimed.

"'''Bookland'''" is the informal name for the [[Unique Country Code]] (UCC) prefix allocated in the 1980s for [[European Article Number]] (EAN) identifiers of published [[book]]s, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN [[namespace]] can catalogue books by [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. In other words, Bookland is a fictitious country that exists solely in EAN for the purposes of non-geographically cataloguing books in the otherwise geographically keyed EAN coding system.

== History ==
Until January 1, 2007, all ISBNs were allocated as 9-digit numbers followed by a [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 11 [[checksum]] character that was either a decimal digit or the letter X.  A Bookland EAN was generated by concatenating the Bookland UCC 978, the 9 digits of the book's ISBN other than its checksum, and the EAN checksum digit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isbn-information.com/the-13-digit-isbn.html Anatomy of a 13-digit ISBN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Z5I3gnFh0C&amp;pg=PA265 |title=Elementary number theory with applications |author=Thomas Koshy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since parts of the 10-character ISBN space are nearly full, all books published from 2007 on have been allocated a 13-digit [[ISBN]], which is identical to the Bookland EAN.  Most of UCC 979  (formerly "Musicland") has now been assigned for the expansion of Bookland,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjveruEBBfoC&amp;pg=PT41 |title=Book Marketing Demystified |author=Bruce Trelawny Batchelor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used by publishers in the French language, which can now use the additional prefix "979-10-" in addition to the nearly full "978-2-" prefix (onto which legacy 10-character ISBNs starting with "2-" have been remapped).  Books numbered with prefixes other than 978 will not be mappable to 10-character ISBNs.

The GS1 is the global identification standards organization for retail. Every country has an assigned country code which precedes the company code. The "country codes" 978 and 979 are now officially registered for allocation by the [[International ISBN Agency]], which maintains the official international registry of ISBN numbers allocated to book publishers.

==Similar mappings==

* [[ISSN]]s (which identify [[periodical publication]]s) are mapped into the UCC 977.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKcpAQAAIAAJ |title=International literary market place |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISMN]]s (which identify [[sheet music]]) are mapped into the UCC 979. Since the leading "M" of a legacy 10-digit ISMN number (such as M-345-24680-5) is transcoded as 0, the EAN prefix 979-0 is wholly reserved for sheet music and has been dubbed the fictitious country "Musicland". Like ISBNs, ISMNs have been officially allocated using 13 digits since mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ismn-international.org/download/GuidelinesGeneral.pdf Guidelines for the Implementation of 13-Digit ISMNs]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2154">The '''CSJ Awards''' are an annual event organised by the [[Centre for Social Justice]], a centre right British political thinktank, where grants are awarded to organisations working in the field of [[poverty]] relief. In 2009, a [[Channel 4]] documentary series was made by filmmaker and TV presenter [[Sadie Kaye]] about the award nominees which also featured interviews with the Rt. Hon. [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and awards host [[Esther Rantzen]]. 

==2006 Awards==

The 2006 award ceremony will be held on the 28 June 2006 at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London]]. Grants totalling £25,000 will be given to a number of the 12 short-listed charities nominated this year. All short-listed charities will also be invited to join the [[CSJ Alliance]], a grouping of charities who work in similar fields and wish to cooperate with each other.

==2005 Awards==

The following organisations won grants at the 2005 awards ceremony:

* [[ADAS UK]] (£5000) - providing abstinence-based addiction rehabilitiation in [[Stockport]]
* [[Bristol Community Family Trust]] (£3000) - engaged in relationship education and parenting classes
* [[Eden Failsworth]] - a [[Christian]] youth project in a deprived area of [[Manchester]]
* [[Emmaus UK]] (£1000) - supporting ten communities throughout Britain helping former homeless people
* [[Protest 4]] (£3000) - campaign against people-trafficking

A local authority award (no money) was also made to Salford City Council for its highly developed relationship with voluntary groups as part of its efforts to tackle poverty.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items attached to paintings might include photographic images, clothing, newspaper clippings, [[ephemera]] or any number of [[Dimension|three-dimensional]] objects. The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) who coined the phrase&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/adding-rauschenberg-and-richter-at-moma.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' October 24 2013 "“We are fortunate to have six Combines from the mid-’50s through 1961,” Ms. Temkin said, referring to the term Rauschenberg coined to describe works that incorporate castoff objects like tires, flatware or furniture."]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his own creations. Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder. His Combine ''Broadcast'', featuring three radios blaring at once,&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; was a "melange of paint, grids, newspaper clips and fabric snippets."&lt;ref name="tws08jan012"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, his ''Broadcast'' had three radios playing simultaneously, which produced a sort of irritating static, so that one of the work's owners, at one point, replaced the "noise" with tapes of actual programs when guests visited.&lt;ref name=tws08jan012/&gt; Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' had a pillow attached to a patchwork quilt with paint splashed over it.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; The idea was to promote immediacy.&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt;

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

]]
''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5270">The [[Chinese language]] enjoys the status as [[official language]] in [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. It is also widely used in [[Malaysia]] and some parts of [[Thailand]]. However, the language shows a high degree of regional variation among these territories.

==Linguistic differences==

In many cases, those in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan use different words for the same meaning.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

This section seeks to illustrate the differences in vocabulary by a limited selected examples. Note that language used in Hong Kong is almost identical to that of Macau, and that Malaysian vocabulary is identical to Singaporean vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''The Dark Watchers''' (also known by early Spanish settlers as '''Los Vigilantes Oscuros''') is a name given to a group of entities in [[California]] [[folklore]] purportedly seen observing travelers along the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]].

==Description==
The Dark Watchers are described as tall, sometimes giant sized featureless dark silhouettes often adorned with brimmed hats or walking sticks.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} They are most often reported to be seen in the hours around [[twilight]] and [[dawn]]. They are said to motionlessly watch travelers from the horizon along the [[Santa Lucia Mountain Range]]. According to legend no one has seen one up close and if someone were to approach them they disappear.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4522|number=522|date=7 June 2016|title=Dark Watchers|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
While sometimes attributed to the [[Chumash people]] who historically inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, nothing analogous to the legend appears to exist in their mythology.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarringtonBlackburn1975"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrington|first1=John P.|last2=Blackburn|first2=Thomas C.|title=December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2lC7XcLrzoC|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Spanish Settlers first moved into the area they were said to have witnessed the Dark Watchers whom they dubbed Los Vigilantes Oscuros.&lt;ref name="independent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/nov/13/search-dark-watchers/|title=In Search of the Dark Watchers|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=13 November 2014|first=Mitchell|last= Kriegman}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2018}}

The Dark Watchers are most famously given a brief mention in [[John Steinbeck]]'s "[[Flight (Steinbeck story)|Flight]]", included in the 1938 collection of his short stories, ''[[The Long Valley]]'':
{{quote|"Pepé looked suspiciously back every minute or so, and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead. Once, on a white barren spur, he saw a black figure for a moment; but he looked quickly away, for it was one of the dark watchers. No one knew who the watchers were, nor where they lived, but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them. They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business."||}}

Along with this, "watchers" are also referenced by poet [[Robinson Jeffers]] in the titular poem of his 1937 collection ''Such Counsels You Gave to Me &amp; Other Poems'':&lt;ref name="JeffersHunt1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffers|first1=Robinson|last2=Hunt|first2=Tim|title=The Collected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers: 1928-1938|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTn_okYQeW0C&amp;pg=PA562|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1723-6|page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weirdca.com/location.php?location=179 |title=Dark Watchers |date=8 May 2007 |last=Parzanese |first=Joe |website=Weird California}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{quote|...he thought it might be one of the watchers, who are often seen in this length of coast-range, forms that look human to human eyes, but certainly are not human. They come from behind ridges to watch. But when he approached it he recognized the shabby clothes and pale hair and even the averted forehead and concave line from the eye to the jaw, so that he was not surprised when the figure turning toward him in the quiet twilight showed his own face. Then it melted and merged into the shadows beyond it...}}
John Steinbeck's son [[Thomas Steinbeck]] would grow up to report having seen The Dark Watchers during his childhood and later along with artist Benjamin Brode collaborate on a book titled ''In Search of the Dark Watchers'', where they go into the history of the legend and interview locals who claim to have seen them, such as famed [[Big Sur]] resident Billy Post.&lt;ref name="Brode2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brode|first=Benjamin|title=In Search of the Dark Watchers: Landscapes and Lore of Big Sur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFPioQEACAAJ|date=September 2014|publisher=Studio Brode|isbn=978-0-9906637-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/local/me-billy-post2|title=Billy Post dies at 88; Big Sur's resident authority|first=Elaine|last=Woo|date=2 August 2009|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to newspaper archives in the mid-1960s, a Monterery Peninsula local and former high school principal went on a hiking trip in the Santa Lucias when he suddenly spotted a dark figure standing on a rock and surveying the area. When the principal called out to the other hikers, the creature vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biship|first1=Greg|last2=Oesterle|first2=Joe|last3=Marinacci|first3=Mike|title=Weird California|date=March 2, 2006|publisher=Sterling|isbn=9781402766831|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}

==Explanations==

[[Illusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s or misinterpretation of natural stimulus brought on by [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] or [[solitude|isolation]] have been proposed by psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Reed (psychologist)|Reed, Graham]]. (1988). ''The Psychology of Anomalous Experience''. Prometheus Books. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|0-87975-435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infrasound#Suggested relationship to ghost sightings|Infrasound]], which can be generated by wind, can cause feelings of uneasiness and anxiety in some people and is frequently connected to paranormal sightings.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

An optical illusion known as the [[Brocken spectre]] is a plausible explanation for the legend.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dave; Mitchell, Ian. (1987). ''Mountain Days and Bothy Nights''. Luath. p. 157. {{ISBN|0-946487-15-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Brocken spectre, "mountain spectre" can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto a cloud bank around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Helen. (1975). ''Mist, Murk and Visual Perception''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. p. 658. "The Brocken Spectre (where one's shadow cast by the sun onto a cloudbank appears distant and gigantic)... The shadowy image appearing much farther away than it is, and consequently enlarged to a sufficient extent to give rise to such tales as the Grey Man of Ben MacDhui."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Root digging stick at Rocky Reach Dam Museum 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A digging stick]]
In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], a '''digging stick''', or sometimes '''yam stick''', is a wooden implement used primarily by [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence-based]] cultures to dig out underground food such as roots and tubers or [[burrowing animals]] and anthills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digging-stick The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved July 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The stick may also have other uses in hunting or general domestic tasks.

They are common to the [[Indigenous Australians]] but also other peoples worldwide. The tool normally consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and perhaps hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire. Fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing, it forms a prehistoric [[plow]], and is also a precursor of most modern agricultural handtools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved March 26, 2015, from Britannica.com website: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163245/digging-stick&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a simple [[tool|device]], and has to be tough and hardy in order not to break.

== By region ==

=== Mexico and the Mesoamerican region ===
In Mexico and the [[Mesoamerican region]], the digging stick was the most important agricultural tool throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;tab=two&amp;typ=reg&amp;id=377 Study the Digging Stick] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;id=320&amp;typ=reg Uictli] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''coa'' stick normally flares out into a triangle at the end and is used for cultivating maize. It is still used for agriculture in some indigenous communities, with some newer 20th-century versions having the addition of a little metal tip.

Other digging sticks, according to Native Americans of the Columbia Plateau, have been used since time immemorial to gather edible roots like balsamroot, bitterroot, camas, and varieties of biscuitroot. Typical digging sticks were and are still about 2 to 3 feet in length, usually slightly arched, with the bottom tip shaved off at an angle. A 5 to 8 inch cross-piece made of antler, bone, or wood was fitted perpendicularly over the top of the stick, allowing the use of two hands to drive the tool into the ground. Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks.

=== Ethiopia and the Harar region ===

The most common digging stick found in [[Ethiopia]] is the ''ankassay'' in [[Amharic]], a [[Semitic language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world. The ''ankassay'' is a single shaft that is about 4–5 feet in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip.&lt;ref name="Simoons"&gt;Simoons, Frederick J. "The Forked Digging Stick of the Gurage", "[[Zeitschrift für Ethnologie]]", Berlin, Retrieved February 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other digging sticks are unique to the Harar region located in East-Central [[Ethiopia]], which are considered to be unusual due to their function beyond the basic use of other digging sticks, and the use of one as a plow.

The ''deungora'' is a particularly long digging stick is about 110 centimeters, or approximately 3.6 feet, in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip. What's unique about this digging stick is that a bored stone, about 15 centimeters in diameter, is attached at the opposing end. This stone shares the same form as other bored stones that have been discovered in archaeological sites in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

''Maresha'' is the [[Gurage]] name, also the same word used by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], for a digging stick that differs in construction because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool is used as a plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used to break clods of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for plowing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants. When compared to the ''ankassay'', this digging stick can perform the same duties and in addition can be used as a hoe.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

=== East-Central New Guinea ===

The Kuman people of this region were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more sophisticated tools such as iron spades and pick-axes.&lt;ref name="Nilles"&gt;Nilles, John. "The Kuman people: A study of cultural change in a primitive society in the Central Highlands of New Guinea." Oceania (1953): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of digging sticks both shared a similar shape but differed in size:

* A larger and heavier digging stick with a diameter of about 4 centimeters and 2 meters in length, used for the purpose of turning over the soil surface for new gardens
* A smaller and lighter digging stick with a diameter of about 2 centimeters and 1 meter (or less) in length, mainly used for basic horticulture tasks&lt;ref name="Nilles"/&gt;

The '''Representative Office of Palestine''' in the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] ({{lang-ar|سفارة دولة فلسطين لدى ألمانيا}}) is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in Germany. It is located in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.pna.ps/ar/archives/3272|title=Embassy of the State of Palestine in Germany|publisher=Ministry of foreign affairs of State of Palestine|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR, East Germany) recognized the State of Palestine in 1988 prior to the [[German reunification]] in 1990 with [[West Germany]] although the current government does not recognize the State of Palestine.

[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|right|thumb|The opening page of Spinoza's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Ethics'', in the posthumous Latin first edition]]

'''''Ethics, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order''''' ({{lang-la|Ethica, ordine geometrico demonstrata}}), usually known as the '''''Ethics''''', is a philosophical treatise written in Latin by [[Benedict de Spinoza]]. It was written between 1664 and 1665{{Citation needed|reason=The Baruch Spinoza article states that Ethics was completed in 1676. So who's lying?|date=November 2018}} and was first published posthumously in 1677.

The book is perhaps the most ambitious attempt to apply the [[Euclid's Elements|method of Euclid]] in philosophy. Spinoza puts forward a small number of definitions and axioms from which he attempts to derive hundreds of [[propositions]] and [[corollaries]], such as "When the Mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it",&lt;ref&gt;Part 3, proposition 33.&lt;/ref&gt; "A free man thinks of nothing less than of death",&lt;ref&gt;Part 4, proposition 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The human Mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the Body, but something of it remains which is eternal."&lt;ref&gt;Part 5, proposition 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
===Part I: Of God===
The first part of the book addresses the relationship between God and the [[universe]]. [[Abrahamic religions|Tradition]] held that God exists outside of the universe, created it for a reason, and could have created a different universe if he chose. Spinoza denies each point. According to Spinoza, God ''is'' the natural world. As with many of Spinoza's claims, what this means is a matter of dispute. Spinoza claims that the things that make up the universe, including human beings, are God's "modes". This means that everything is, in some sense, dependent upon God. The nature of this dependence is disputed. Some scholars say that the modes are [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of God in the traditional sense. Others say that modes are [[Causality|effect]]s of God. Either way, the modes are also logically dependent on God's essence, in this sense: everything that happens [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the nature of God, just like how it follows from the nature of a triangle that its angles are equal to two right angles&lt;!--Spinoza's metaphor, not the editor's--&gt;. Since God had to exist with the nature he has, nothing that has happened could have been avoided, and if God has fixed a particular fate for a particular mode, there is no escaping it. As Spinoza puts it, "A thing which has been determined by God to produce an effect cannot render itself undetermined." God's creation of the universe is not a decision, much less one motivated by a purpose.

===Part II: Of Nature &amp; Its Origin===
The second part focuses on the human mind and body. Spinoza attacks several [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] positions: (1) that the mind and body are distinct [[substance theory|substances]] that can affect one another; (2) that we know our minds better than we know our bodies; (3) that our senses may be trusted; (4) that despite being created by God we can make mistakes, namely, when we affirm, of our own free will, an idea that is not clear and distinct. Spinoza denies each of Descartes's points. Regarding (1), Spinoza argues that the mind and the body are [[nondualism|a single thing]] that is being thought of in two different ways. The whole of nature can be fully described in terms of thoughts or in terms of bodies. However, we cannot mix these two ways of describing things, as Descartes does, and say that the mind affects the body or vice versa. Moreover, the mind's self-knowledge is not fundamental: it cannot know its own thoughts better than it knows the ways in which its body is acted upon by other bodies.

Further, there is no difference between contemplating an idea and thinking that it is true, and there is no [[free will|freedom of the will]] at all. Sensory perception, which Spinoza calls "knowledge of the first kind", is entirely inaccurate, since it reflects how our own bodies work more than how things really are. We can also have a kind of accurate knowledge called "knowledge of the second kind", or "reason". This encompasses knowledge of the features common to all things, and includes principles of physics and geometry. We can also have "knowledge of the third kind", or "[[Intuition|intuitive knowledge]]". This is a sort of knowledge that, somehow, relates particular things to the nature of God.

===Part III: The Origin and Nature of Emotions===
In the third part of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza argues that all things, including human beings, strive to persevere in their being. This is usually taken to mean that things try to last for as long as they can. Spinoza explains how this striving ("[[conatus]]") underlies our [[emotion]]s (love, hate, joy, sadness and so on). Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.

===Part IV: Of the Servitude of Humanity, or the Strength of the Emotions===
The fourth part analyzes human passions, which Spinoza sees as aspects of the mind that direct us outwards to seek what gives pleasure and shun what gives pain. The "bondage" he refers to is domination by these passions or "[[affect (philosophy)|affect]]s" as he calls them. Spinoza considers how the affects, ungoverned, can torment people and make it impossible for mankind to live in harmony with one another.

===Part V: Of the Power of the Intellect, or the Liberty of Humanity===
The fifth part argues that reason can govern the affects in the pursuit of virtue, which for Spinoza is [[self-preservation]]: only with the aid of reason can humans distinguish the passions that truly aid virtue from those that are ultimately harmful. By reason, we can see things as they truly are, ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'', "under the aspect of eternity," and because Spinoza treats God and nature as indistinguishable, by knowing things as they are we improve our knowledge of God. Seeing that all things are determined by nature to be as they are, we can achieve the rational tranquility that best promotes our happiness, and liberate ourselves from being driven by our passions.

==Themes==
===God or Nature - ''Deus sive Natura''&lt;!--'God or Nature', 'Deus sive Natura' and 'Deus seu Natura' redirect here--&gt;===
According to Spinoza, God is Nature and Nature is God. This is his [[pantheism]]. In his previous book, ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus|Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', Spinoza discussed the inconsistencies that result when God is assumed to have human characteristics. In the third chapter of that book, he stated that the word "God" means the same as the word "Nature". He wrote: "Whether we say&amp;nbsp;... that all things happen according to the laws of nature, or are ordered by the decree and direction of God, we say the same thing." He later qualified this statement in his letter to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Letter XXI (Van Vloten LXXIII)&lt;/ref&gt; by abjuring [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The supposition of some, that I endeavor to prove in the ''Tractatus Theologico–Politicus'' the unity of God and Nature (meaning by the latter a certain mass or corporeal matter), is wholly erroneous."&lt;/ref&gt; Nature, to Spinoza, is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[Substance theory|substance]], not physical matter.&lt;ref&gt;”Having established that Nature is an indivisible, infinite, uncaused, substantial whole—in fact, the ''only'' substantial whole; that outside of Nature there is nothing; and that everything that exists is a part of Nature and is brought into being by and within Nature with a deterministic necessity through Nature’s laws, Spinoza concludes that God and Nature—the substantial, unique, unified, active, infinitely powerful, necessary cause of everything—are one and the same thing.” (''A Book Forged in Hell'', [[Steven Nadler]], ch.4)&lt;/ref&gt; In this posthumously published book ''Ethics'', he equated God with nature by writing “God or Nature” four times.&lt;ref&gt;Twice in Part IV, Preface (''Deum seu Naturam'', ''Deus seu Natura''); twice in Part IV, Proposition IV, Proof (''Dei sive Naturæ'', ''Dei seu Naturæ'').&lt;/ref&gt; “...For Spinoza, God or Nature—being one and the same thing— is the whole, infinite, eternal, necessarily existing, active system of the universe within which absolutely everything exists. This is the fundamental principle of the ''Ethics''....”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Steven Nadler]], ''A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2011, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza holds that everything that exists is part of nature, and everything in nature follows the same basic laws. In this perspective, human beings are part of nature, and hence they can be explained and understood in the same way as everything else in nature. This aspect of Spinoza’s philosophy — his [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] — was radical for its time, and perhaps even for today. In the preface to Part III of ''Ethics'' (relating to emotions), he writes:

{{quote|Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating rather of matters outside nature than of natural phenomena following nature's general laws. They appear to conceive man to be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom : for they believe that he disturbs rather than follows nature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions, and that he is determined solely by himself. However, my argument is this. Nothing comes to pass in nature, which can be set down to a flaw therein ; for nature is always the same, and everywhere one and the same in her efficacy and power of action ; that is, nature's laws and ordinances, whereby all things come to pass and change from one form to another, are everywhere and always the same ; so that there should be one and the same method of understanding the nature of all things whatsoever, namely, through nature's universal laws and rules.| [[:s: Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 3|''Ethics'', Part 3]]}}

Therefore, Spinoza affirms that the passions of hatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, “follow from this same necessity and efficacy of nature; they answer to certain definite causes, through which they are understood, and possess certain properties as worthy of being known as the properties of anything else”. Humans are not different in kind from the rest of the natural world; they are part of it.&lt;ref name="Pynn"&gt;Cf. [http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf "Introduction to Spinoza’s ''Ethics''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226103559/http://www.niu.edu/~gpynn/322_H8.pdf |date=2015-02-26 }}, by Geoﬀ Pynn, [[Northern Illinois University]], Spring 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza’s [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] can be seen as deriving from his firm commitment to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] ({{small caps|psr}}), which is the thesis that everything has an explanation. He articulates the {{small caps|psr}} in a strong fashion, as he applies it not only to everything that is, but also to everything that is not:

{{quote|Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned, either for its existence, ''or for its non-existence'' — e.g. if a triangle exists, a reason or cause must be granted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted, which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XI]] (emphasis added)}}

And to continue with Spinoza's triangle example, here is one claim he makes about God:

{{quote|From God’s supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things – that is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always flow from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles.| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 1|''Ethics'', Part 1, XVII]]}}

Spinoza rejected the idea of an external Creator suddenly, and apparently capriciously, creating the world at one particular time rather than another, and creating it out of nothing. The solution appeared to him more perplexing than the problem, and rather unscientific in spirit as involving a break in continuity. He preferred to think of the entire system of reality as its own ground. This view was simpler; it avoided the impossible conception of creation out of nothing; and it was religiously more satisfying by bringing God and man into closer relationship. Instead of Nature, on the one hand, and a supernatural God, on the other, he posited one world of reality, at once Nature and God, and leaving no room for the supernatural. This so-called naturalism of Spinoza is only distorted if one starts with a crude materialistic idea of Nature and supposes that Spinoza degraded God. The truth is that he raised Nature to the rank of God by conceiving Nature as the fulness of reality, as the One and All. He rejected the specious simplicity obtainable by denying the reality of Matter, or of Mind, or of God. The cosmic system comprehends them all. In fact, God and Nature become identical when each is conceived as the Perfect Self-Existent. This constitutes Spinoza's ''Pantheism''.&lt;ref name="Pynn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

===Structure of reality===
[[File:Spinoza Ethica Pars1 Prop1.jpg|thumb|300px|Spinoza's original text of ''Ethica'', Part 1]]
According to Spinoza, God has "attributes". One attribute is 'extension', another attribute is 'thought', and there are infinitely many such attributes. Since Spinoza holds that to exist is to ''act'', some readers take 'extension' to refer to an activity characteristic of bodies (for example, the active process of taking up space, exercising physical power, or resisting a change of place or shape). They take 'thought' to refer to the activity that is characteristic of minds, namely thinking, the exercise of mental power. Each attribute has modes. All bodies are modes of extension, and all ideas are modes of thought.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

====Substance, attributes, modes====
Spinoza's ideas relating to the character and structure of reality are expressed by him in terms of ''substance'', ''attributes'', and ''modes''. These terms are very old and familiar, but not in the sense in which Spinoza employs them. To understand Spinoza, it is necessary to lay aside all preconceptions&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/ "Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', publ. 21/08/2007.&lt;/ref&gt; about them, and follow Spinoza closely.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Spinoza, Baruch |volume=20 |pages=687–691 |first=Andrew Seth |last=Pringle-Pattison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also A. Wolf's, "Spinoza, the Man and His Thought", 1933; [[Antonio Damasio]], ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', William Heinemann, 2003, esp. ch. 6, 224–261; [[Richard McKeon]], ''The Philosophy of Spinoza: The Unity of His Thought'', Ox Bow Pr., 1928; Ray Monk &amp; Frederic Raphael, ''The Great Philosophers''. Phoenix, 2000, ''s.v.'' "Spinoza", pp. 135–174. See also the very useful Olli Koistinen (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Spinoza's Ethics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 2009, esp. ch. 7, by Diane Steinberg, pp. 140–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza found it impossible to understand the finite, dependent, transient objects and events of experience without assuming some reality not dependent on anything else but self-existent, not produced by anything else but eternal, not restricted or limited by anything else but infinite. Such an uncaused, self-sustaining reality he called ''substance''. So, for instance, he could not understand the reality of material objects and physical events without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal physical force which expresses itself in all the movements and changes which occur, as we say, in [[space]].

This physical force he called ''extension'', and described it, at first, as a ''substance'', in the sense just explained. Similarly, he could not understand the various dependent, transient mental experiences with which we are familiar without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal consciousness, mental force, or mind-energy, which expresses itself in all these finite experiences of perceiving and understanding, of feeling and striving. This consciousness or mind-energy he called ''thought'', and described it also, at first, as a ''substance''.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;Especially valuable for these specific sections of Spinoza's thought as expounded in his ''Ethics'', have been the online pages by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' at these four links [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-physics/] — which respectively represent an interpretation and commentary of the philosopher's stance on "Modal Metaphysics", "Theory of Attributes", "Psychological Theory", "Physical Theory", and are currently cited as a reference within the present text.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these "substances" he regarded as infinite of its kind (that is, as exhaustive of all the events of its own kind), and as irreducible to the other, or any other, substance. But in view of the intimate way in which Extension and Thought express themselves conjointly in the life of man, Spinoza considered it necessary to conceive of Extension and Thought not as detached realities, but as constituting one organic whole or system. And in order to express this idea, he then described Extension and Thought as ''attributes'', reserving the term ''Substance'' for the system which they constitute between them. This change of description was not intended to deny that Extension and Thought are substances in the sense of being self-existent, etc. It was only intended to express their coherence in one system. The system of course would be more than any one attribute. For each attribute is only ''infinite of its kind''; the system of all attributes is ''absolutely infinite'', that is, exhausts the whole of reality. Spinoza, accordingly, now restricted the term "substance" to the complete system, though he occasionally continued to use the phrase "substance or attribute", or described Extension as a substance.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

As commonly used, especially since the time of [[John Locke|Locke]], the term substance is contrasted with its attributes or qualities as their substratum or bearer. But this meaning must not be read into Spinoza. For Spinoza, Substance is not the support or bearer of the Attributes, but the system of Attributes — he actually uses the expression "Substance or the Attributes."&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt; If there is any difference at all between "Substance" and "the Attributes", as Spinoza uses these terms, it is only the difference between the Attributes conceived as an organic system and the Attributes conceived (but not by Spinoza) as a mere sum of detached forces. Something is still necessary to complete the account of Spinoza's conception of Substance. So far only the two Attributes have been considered, namely, Extension and Thought. Spinoza, however, realised that there may be other Attributes, unknown to man. If so, they are part of the one Substance or cosmic system. And using the term "[[infinity|infinite]]" in the sense of "complete" or "exhaustive", he ascribed to Substance an infinity of Attributes, that is, all the attributes there are, whether known to man or not.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

Now reality, for Spinoza, is activity. Substance is incessantly active, each Attribute exercising its kind of energy in all possible ways. Thus the various objects and events of the material world come into being as ''modes'' (modifications or states) of the attribute Extension; and the various minds and mental experiences come into being as modes of the attribute Thought (or Consciousness). These modes are not external creations of the Attributes, but immanent results — they are not "thrown off" by the Attributes, but are states (or modifications) of them, as air-waves are states of the air. Each Attribute, however, expresses itself in its finite modes not immediately (or directly) but mediately (or indirectly), at least in the sense to be explained now. [[Galileo Galilei|Galilean]] [[physics]] tended to regard the whole world of [[physical phenomena]] as the result of differences of [[motion (physics)|motion]] or [[momentum]]. And, though erroneously conceived, the Cartesian conception of a constant quantity of motion in the world led Spinoza to conceive of all physical phenomena as so many varying expressions of that store of motion (or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[Rest (physics)|rest]]).

Spinoza might, of course, have identified Extension with [[energy]] of motion. But, with his usual caution, he appears to have suspected that motion may be only one of several types of [[physical energy]]. So he described motion simply as a mode of Extension, but as an ''infinite'' mode (because complete or exhaustive of all finite modes of motion) and as an ''immediate'' mode (as a direct expression of Extension). Again, the physical world (or "the face of the world as a whole", as Spinoza calls it)&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt; retains a certain sameness in spite of the innumerable changes in detail that are going on. Accordingly, Spinoza described also the physical world as a  whole as an ''infinite'' mode of extension ("infinite" because exhaustive of all facts and events that can be reduced to motion), but as a ''mediate'' (or indirect) mode, because he regarded it as the outcome of the conservation of motion (itself a mode, though an ''immediate'' mode). The physical things and events of ordinary experience are ''finite'' modes. In essence each of them is part of the Attribute Extension, which is active in each of them. But the finiteness of each of them is due to the fact that it is restrained or hedged in, so to say, by other finite modes. This limitation or determination is negation in the sense that each finite mode is ''not'' the whole attribute Extension; it is not the other finite modes. But each mode is positively real and ultimate as part of the Attribute.&lt;ref name="EBr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

In the same kind of way the Attribute Thought exercises its activity in various mental processes, and in such systems of mental process as are called minds or souls. But in this case, as in the case of Extension, Spinoza conceives of the finite modes of Thought as mediated by infinite modes. The immediate infinite mode of Thought he describes as "the idea of God"; the mediate infinite mode he calls "the infinite idea" or "the idea of all things". The other Attributes (if any) must be conceived in an analogous manner. And the whole Universe or Substance is conceived as one dynamic system of which the various Attributes are the several world-lines along which it expresses itself in all the infinite variety of events.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://archive.org/details/spinozasshorttre00spinuoft ''The Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-being''],  London: A. &amp; C. Black, 2006 – scanned, [[University of Toronto]], Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the persistent misinterpretation of [[Spinozism]] it is worth emphasizing the dynamic character of reality as Spinoza conceived it. The cosmic system is certainly a logical or rational system, according to Spinoza, for Thought is a constitutive part of it; but it is not ''merely'' a logical system — it is dynamic as well as logical. His frequent use of [[geometry|geometrical]] illustrations affords no evidence at all in support of a purely [[logics|logico]]-[[mathematics|mathematical]] interpretation of his philosophy; for Spinoza regarded geometrical figures, not in a [[Plato]]nic or static manner, but as things traced out by moving [[particles]] or [[Line (geometry)|lines]], etc., that is, dynamically.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Marcello Colitti, ''Etica e politica di Baruch Spinoza'', Aliberti, 2010, esp. ''s.v.'' "Etica". {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Portrait of [[Baruch Spinoza]], 1665.]]
{{quotation|''Without intelligence there is not rational life: and things are only good, in so far as they aid man in his enjoyment of the intellectual life, which is defined by intelligence. Contrariwise, whatsoever things hinder man's perfecting of his reason, and capability to enjoy the rational life, are alone called evil.''| [[:s:Ethics (Spinoza)/Part 4|''Ethics'', Part IV, Appendix V]]}}

For Spinoza, reality means activity, and the reality of anything expresses itself in a tendency to self-preservation — to exist is to persist. In the lowest kinds of things, in so-called inanimate matter, this tendency shows itself as a "will to live". Regarded physiologically the effort is called ''appetite''; when we are conscious of it, it is called ''desire''. The moral categories, good and evil, are intimately connected with desire, though not in the way commonly supposed. Man does not desire a thing because he thinks it is good, or shun it because he considers it bad; rather he considers anything good if he desires it, and regards it as bad if he has an aversion for it. Now whatever is felt to heighten vital activity gives pleasure; whatever is felt to lower such activity causes pain. Pleasure coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called love, and pain coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called hate — "love" and "hate" being used in the wide sense of "like" and "dislike". All human feelings are derived from pleasure, pain and desire. Their great variety is due to the differences in the kinds of external objects which give rise to them, and to the differences in the inner conditions of the individual experiencing them.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Spinoza gives a detailed analysis of the whole gamut of human feelings, and his account is one of the classics of [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;For this and other affirmations about Spinoza's "psychology", cf. esp. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-psychological/ "Spinoza's Psychological Theory"], on the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], cit.'', rev. 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For the present purpose the most important distinction is that between "active" feelings and "passive" feelings (or "passions"). Man, according to Spinoza, is active or free in so far as any experience is the outcome solely of his own nature; he is passive, or a bondsman, in so far as any experience is due to other causes besides his own nature. The active feelings are all of them forms of self-realisation, of heightened activity, of strength of mind, and are therefore always pleasurable. It is the passive feelings (or "passions") which are responsible for all the ills of life, for they are induced largely by things outside us and frequently cause that lowered vitality which means pain. Spinoza next links up his ethics with his theory of knowledge, and correlates the moral progress of man with his intellectual progress. At the lowest stage of knowledge, that of "opinion", man is under the dominant influence of things outside himself, and so is in the bondage of the passions. At the next stage, the stage of "reason", the characteristic feature of the human mind, its intelligence, asserts itself, and helps to emancipate him from his bondage to the senses and external allurements. The insight gained into the nature of the passions helps to free man from their domination. A better understanding of his own place in the cosmic system and of the place of all the objects of his likes and dislikes, and his insight into the necessity which rules all things, tend to cure him of his resentments, regrets and disappointments. He grows reconciled to things, and wins peace of mind. In this way reason teaches acquiescence in the universal order, and elevates the mind above the turmoil of passion. At the highest stage of knowledge, that of "intuitive knowledge", the mind apprehends all things as expressions of the eternal [[cosmos]]. It sees all things in God, and God in all things. It feels itself as part of the eternal order, identifying its thoughts with cosmic thought and its interests with cosmic interests. Thereby it becomes eternal as one of the eternal ideas in which the Attribute Thought expresses itself, and attains to that "blessedness" which "is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself", that is, the perfect joy which characterises perfect self-activity. This is not an easy or a common achievement. "But", says Spinoza, "everything excellent is as difficult as it is rare."&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

==Reception==
{{Main|Spinozism}}

Shortly after his death in 1677, Spinoza's works were placed on the Catholic Church's Index of Banned Books. Condemnations soon appeared, such as [[Noel Aubert de Versé|Aubert de Versé]]'s ''L'impie convaincu'' (1685). According to its subtitle, in this work "the foundations of [Spinoza's] atheism are refuted".

For the next hundred years, if European philosophers read this so-called heretic, they did so almost entirely in secret. How much forbidden Spinozism they were sneaking into their diets remains a subject of continual intrigue. Locke, Hume, Leibniz and Kant all stand accused by later scholars of indulging in periods of closeted Spinozism.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Boehm, Omri. 2014. ''Kant's Critique of Spinoza''. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 18th century, a [[Pantheism controversy|controversy]] centering on the ''Ethics'' scandalized the German philosophy scene.

The first known translation of the ''Ethics'' into English was completed in 1856 by the novelist [[George Eliot]], though not published until much later. The book next appeared in English in 1883, by the hand of the novelist [[Hale White]]. Spinoza rose clearly into view for anglophone metaphysicians in the late nineteenth century, during the British craze for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In his admiration for Spinoza, Hegel was joined in this period by his countrymen [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. In the twentieth century, the ghost of Spinoza continued to show itself, for example in the writings of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]. Among writers of fiction and poetry, the students of Spinoza include [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], George Eliot, [[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], and [[Bernard Malamud|Malamud]].

The first published Dutch translations were by the poet [[Herman Gorter]] (1895) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Loman en Funke, The Hague, 1895&lt;/ref&gt; and by Willem Meyer (1896) &lt;ref&gt;publ. Van Looy, Amsterdam, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; .

==Criticism==
{{importance section}}
===Misuse of words===
[[Schopenhauer]] claimed that Spinoza misused words. “Thus he calls ‘God’ that which is everywhere called ‘the world’; ‘justice’ that which is everywhere called ‘power’; and ‘will’ that which is everywhere called ‘judgement’.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', vol, I, “Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,” p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Also, “that concept of ''substance''...with the definition of which Spinoza accordingly begins...appears on close and honest investigation to be a higher yet unjustified abstraction of the concept ''matter''.”&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', vol, I, “Fragments for the History of Philosophy,” § 12, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his repeated objections and critical remarks, Schopenhauer incorporated some of Spinoza's fundamental concepts into his system, especially concerning the theory of emotions; there was also a striking similarity between Schopenhauer's will and Spinoza's substance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry Walter Bran, [http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 ''Philosophy and History''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415153349/http://secure.pdcnet.org/philhist/content/philhist_1971_4_1_0018_0018 |date=2013-04-15 }}, on "Schopenhauer and Spinoza", Vol. 4, Issue 1, 1971, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical influence===
In fact, within the German philosophical sphere, Spinoza’s influence on [[German Idealism]] was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;A very detailed examination of Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism is given in Jean-Marie Vaysse, ''Totalite et Subjectivite: Spinoza dans l’Idealisme Allemand'', Vrin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement: [[Hegel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Fichte]] — who all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his. Schopenhauer, who detested these three philosophers to varying degrees of intensity,&lt;ref&gt;His vicious attacks on Hegel stand out: once he called him "a commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive and ignorant charlatan..."{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/arthursc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007224123/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/arthursc%2Ehtm |archivedate=October 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also had a similarly ambivalent relation to the Dutch philosopher. How Spinoza came to influence Schopenhauer is not clear, but one might speculate: it could have come from his exposure to Fichte’s lectures, from his  conversations with [[Goethe]] or simply from being caught up in the post-[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian attempt to rethink the [[Critical Philosophy]]. Still, his engagement with [[Spinozism]] is evident throughout his writings and attentive readers of his chief work may indeed note his ambivalence toward Spinoza’s philosophy. He sees in Spinoza an ally against the feverish culture of the West. For example, in the context of a rather favourable account of "the standpoint of affirmation" he notes that “[T]he philosophy of [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and that of Spinoza might also bring to this standpoint the person whose conviction was not shaken or weakened by their errors and imperfections”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', trans. E.F.G. Payne, Dover Books, 1958 [Voll. I &amp; II originally published in 1819 and 1844, respectively], Vol. I, 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in discussing Spinoza and Giordano Bruno, Schopenhauer also affirms that:

{{quote|They do not belong either to their age or to their part of the globe, which rewarded the one with death, and the other with persecution and ignominy. Their miserable existence and death in this Western world are like that of a tropical plant in Europe. The banks of the [[Ganges]] were their spiritual home; there they would have led a peaceful and honoured life among men of like mind.|''[[The World as Will and Representation|World]]'', I, 422, n. 2}}

Given Schopenhauer’s respect for [[Hindu philosophy]], comments like these indicate that he too felt intellectual kinship with Spinoza. Elsewhere, Schopenhauer points to more fundamental affinities, but he also criticizes Spinoza. These criticisms deal with fundamental disagreements about the ultimate nature of reality and whether it is to be affirmed or denied.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. essay by Bela Egyed, [http://philosophy.concordia.ca/documents/247.pdf "Spinoza, Schopenhauer and the Standpoint of Affirmation"], on ''PhaenEx'' 2, no. 1 (spring/summer 2007): pp. 110–131. The author argues that "Schopenhauer’s ambivalence toward Spinoza’s philosophy is a reflection of an inner tension within his own doctrine of the denial of the will-to-live, and that his criticisms of Spinoza are related to his rejection of the standpoint of affirmation. In addition ... if this tension is resolved in favour of the standpoint of affirmation, Schopenhauer’s own ethics turns out to be closer to Spinoza’s than he takes it to be." Egyed also offers a suggestion about the possible relation of Schopenhauer’s philosophy to two different strains of [[Buddhist philosophy]]: [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main hypotheses as to the origins of the [[Etruscan civilization]] in the [[Early Iron Age]]. [[Autochthonous population|Autochthonous]] development ''in situ'' out of the [[Villanovan culture]], as claimed by the Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] who described the Etruscans as indigenous people who had always lived in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, Book I Chapters 30 1. &lt;/ref&gt; A migration from the [[Aegean sea]], as claimed by a couple of Greek historians: [[Herodotus]], who described them as a group of immigrants from [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacIntosh Turfa |first=Jean  |date=2013 |title= The Etruscan World|trans-title= |url= |language=English |location=London and New York |publisher= Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-0-415-67308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] who claimed that the Tyrrhenians were the [[Pelasgians]] originally from [[Thessaly]], [[Greece]], who entered Italy at the head of the [[Adriatic sea]]. &lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.17–19 &lt;/ref&gt; The third hypotheses is reported by [[Livy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], and puts the Etruscans in the context of the [[Rhaetian people]] to the north and other populations living in the [[Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome (Ab Urbe Condita), Book 5&lt;/ref&gt;

An autochthonous population that diverged genetically was suggested as a possibility by [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]].&lt;ref name="cavalli-sforza-history"&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L. L., P. Menozzi, A. Piazza. 1994. ''The History and Geography of Human Genes.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton. {{ISBN|0-691-02905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helmut Rix]]'s classification of the [[Etruscan language]] in a proposed [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian language family]] reflects this ambiguity. He finds Etruscan on one hand [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] to the [[Rhaetic language]] spoken in the Alps north of Etruria, suggesting autochthonous connections, but on the other hand the [[Lemnian language]] found on the "Lemnos stele" is closely related to Etruscan, entailing either Etruscan presence in "[[Tyrsenians|Tyrsenian]]" Lemnos, or "Tyrsenian" expansion westward to Etruria.&lt;ref&gt;Rix 1998. ''Rätisch und Etruskisch'' (Innsbruck).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the Lemnian language could have arrived in the [[Aegean Sea]] during the Late Bronze Age, when Mycenaean rulers recruited groups of mercenaries from Sicily, Sardinia and various parts of the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Ligt|first1=Luuk|title=An Eteocretan Inscription from Praisos and the Homeland of the Sea peoples|url=http://www.talanta.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/TAL-40-412008-2009-pag-151-172-DeLigt.pdf|website=talanta.nl|publisher=ALANTA XL-XLI (2008–2009), 151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest [[mtDNA]] study (2013) suggests that the Etruscans appear to fall very close to a [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] population from Central Europe and to other Tuscan populations.&lt;ref name=Ghirotto2013&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3566088|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055519| journal=PLoS ONE | title=Origins and Evolution of the Etruscans' mtDNA | date=2013 | pmid=23405165 | volume= 8| issue= 2| pages= e55519|vauthors=Ghirotto S, Tassi F, Fumagalli E, Colonna V, Sandionigi A, Lari M, et al|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2013PLoSO...855519G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tassi2013&gt;{{cite journal |pmc= |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22319| journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology | title=Genetic evidence does not support an Etruscan origin in Anatolia.| date=2013 | pmid=23900768 | volume=152 | issue= 1| pages= 11–18|vauthors=Tassi F, Ghirotto S, Caramelli D, Barbujani G|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coincides with the Rhaetic language, which was spoken north of the [[Alps]] in the area of the [[Urnfield culture]] of Central Europe. The [[Villanovan culture]] branched from the Urnfield culture around 1100 BC and thus Villanovan culture is ancestral to the Etruscan civilization.

==Autochthonous origin (indigenous)==

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] asserted:&lt;ref name=DHI30&gt;Book I, Section 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Indeed, those probably come nearest to the truth who declare that the nation migrated from nowhere else, but was native to the country, since it is found to be a very ancient nation and to agree with no other either in its language or in its manner of living.}}

With this passage, Dionysius launched the [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] theory, that the core element of the Etruscans, who spoke the Etruscan language, were of "Terra (Earth) itself"; that is, on location for so long that they appeared to be the original or native inhabitants. They are therefore the owners of the [[Villanovan]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Page 52. Pallottino attributes this theory in modern times to the historian, [[Eduard Meyer]], with Ugo Antonielli later associating the Villanovan and the natives. But Mayer soon adopted the oriental theory and Antonielli the northern. Drews in ''The End of the Bronze Age'', page 59, available as a preview on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=etruscan+eduard+meyer&amp;source=web&amp;ots=YTpbjObf7V&amp;sig=fCa7OS4v633NIT8veXE9ugSZ1Fc], reports on Meyer and the views of Antonielli are stated in a review by [[R. A. L. Fell]] of ''Studi Etruschi''. Vol. I. Rassegna di Etruscologia by A. Neppi Modona, the first page of which is found at [https://www.jstor.org/stable/296110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up this theme, Bonfante (2002) states:&lt;ref&gt;Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=...the history of the Etruscan people extends ... from c. 1200 to c. 100 BC. Many sites of the chief Etruscan cities of historical times were continuously occupied from the [[Iron Age]] [[Villanovan]] period on. Much confusion would have been avoided if archaeologists had used the name 'Proto-Etruscan' .... For in fact the people ... did not appear suddenly. Nor did they suddenly start to speak Etruscan.}}

An additional elaboration conjectures that the Etruscans were&lt;ref&gt;Pallottino, page 52, who says that he relies on Alfredo Trombetti and Giacomo Devoto.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=...an ethnic island of very ancient peoples isolated by the flood of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers.}}

In 1942, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[History|historian]] [[Massimo Pallottino]] published a book entitled ''The Etruscans'' (which would be released in [[English language|English]] in 1955). Pallottino presented various hypotheses that gained wide acceptance in the [[Archeology|archeological]] community. He said "no one would dream of asking where Italians or Frenchmen came from originally; it is the formation of the Italian and [[France|French]] nations that we study." He meant that the formation process for Etruscan civilization took place in the [[Etruria]] or nearby.&lt;ref name="pallattino"&gt;{{cite news| author= Eric Pace | title=Massimo Pallottino, 85, Expert On Ancient Etruscans, Is Dead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/20/obituaries/massimo-pallottino-85-expert-on-ancient-etruscans-is-dead.html |publisher=''The New York Times'' |location= | date=1995-02-20 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formulating a different point of view on the same evidence, Pallottino says:&lt;ref name="bookonetheetruscans"&gt;{{cite book|author=Massimo Pallottino |title=The Etruscans |year=1942 | pages=68–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=... we must consider the concept 'Etruscan' as ... attached to ... a nation that flourished in Etruria between the eighth and first centuries BC... We may discuss the provenance of each of these elements but a more appropriate concept ... would be that of formation... the formative process of the nation can only have taken place on the territories of the Etruscans proper; and we are able to witness the final stages of this process.}}

[[J. P. Mallory]] compares the Etruscans to other remnant non Indo-European central Mediterranean populations, such as the [[Basques]] of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France, who absorbed the art styles and alphabet of their Greek neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory (1989).

Certain [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors saw the presence of the Etruscans in Italy as a "historical problem", since they differed from the other civilizations in the area.

In Greco-Roman mythology, [[Aeneas]] (Greek: Αἰνείας, Aineías) was a Trojan hero, the son of prince [[Anchises]] and the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. His father was also the second cousin of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]]. The journey of Aeneas from Troy (led by Venus, his mother), which led to the founding of the city of [[Rome]], is recounted in [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], where the historicity of the Aeneas [[legend]] is employed to flatter the [[Augustus|Emperor Augustus]]. [[Romulus and Remus]], appearing in Roman mythology as the traditional founders of Rome, were of Eastern origin: their grandfather [[Numitor]] and his brother [[Amulius]] were alleged to be descendants of fugitives from Troy.

[[Herodotus]] records the legend that the Etruscans came from [[Lydia]] in [[Asia Minor]], modern [[Turkey]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'' 1.94&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=This is their story: [...] their king divided the people into two groups, and made them draw lots, so that the one group should remain and the other leave the country; he himself was to be the head of those who drew the lot to remain there, and his son, whose name was Tyrrhenus, of those who departed. [...] they came to the [[Ombrici]], where they founded cities and have lived ever since. They no longer called themselves Lydians, but Tyrrhenians, after the name of the king's son who had led them there.}}

The classic scholar [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] commented on this story, writing that it "is based on erroneous etymologies, like many other traditions about the origins of 'fringe' peoples of the Greek world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Michael|title=The Rise of the Greeks|year=1987|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-18536-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeVYyDQqQD8C&amp;pg=PT181&amp;lpg=PT181&amp;dq=Michael+Grant,+Lydians+origins+Etruscans|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant writes there is evidence that the Etruscans themselves spread it to make their trading easier in Asia Minor when many cities in Asia Minor, and the Etruscans themselves, were at war with the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;[Michael Grant, ''The Etruscans'', {{ISBN|0-9650356-8-9}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Greek [[History|Historian]] Dionysius of Halicarnassus objected that the Tyrrhenian (Etruscan) culture and language shared nothing with the Lydian. He stated:&lt;ref name="DHI30" /&gt;
{{quote|text=For this reason, therefore, I am persuaded that the [[Pelasgians]] are a different people from the Tyrrhenians. And I do not believe, either, that the Tyrrhenians were a colony of the Lydians; for they do not use the same language as the latter, nor can it be alleged that, though they no longer speak a similar tongue, they still retain some other indications of their mother country. For they neither worship the same gods as the Lydians nor make use of similar laws or institutions, but in these very respects they differ more from the Lydians than from the Pelasgians.}}

Neither the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan material culture]] or language has provided scholars with conclusive evidence regarding the Etruscans' origins. The language, which has been partly deciphered, has variants and representatives in [[Lemnos stele|inscriptions on Lemnos]], in the Aegean, but these may have been created by travellers or Etruscan colonists, during the period before [[Rome]] destroyed Etruscan political and [[armed forces|military power]].

During the 6th to 5th centuries BC, the word "[[Tyrrhenians]]" was referred specifically to the Etruscans, for whom the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] is named, according to [[Strabo]].&lt;ref name="booksp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo |title=Strabo |year=| page=5.2.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pindar]], the ''Tyrsanoi'' appear grouped with the [[Carthaginians]] as a threat to [[Magna Graecia]]:&lt;ref name="bookpindar"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pindar |title=Pythuan Odes |year=| page=1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=I entreat you, [[Zeus|son of Cronus]], grant that the battle-shouts of the Carthaginians and ''Etruscans'' stay quietly at home, now that they have seen their arrogance bring lamentation to their ships off [[Cumae]].}}
[[Thucydides]] mentions them together with the Pelasgians and associates them with [[Lemnos|Lemnian]] pirates and with the pre-Greek population of [[Attica]]. Lemnos remained relatively free of Greek influence up to Hellenistic times, and the [[Lemnos stele]] of the 6th century BC is inscribed with a language very similar to [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]. This has led to the postulation of a "[[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrrhenian language group]]" comprising Etruscan, Lemnian and [[Raetic language|Raetic]].&lt;ref name="Thucydides"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thucydides |title= Thucydides |year=| page=4.106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is thus linguistic evidence of a relationship between the Lemnians and the Etruscans. Some scholars ascribe this link to Etruscan expansion between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, putting the homeland of the Etruscans in Italy and the [[Alps]] particularly because of their relation to the Alpine Raetic population.&lt;ref name="languageetruscantwo"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Etruscan Language | url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=ett | publisher=''Linguist List.org'' | accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of this latter school of thought point to the legend of Lydian origin of the Etruscans referred to by Herodotus, and the statement of [[Livy]] that the Raetians were Etruscans driven into the mountains by the invading [[Gauls]]. Critics of this theory point to the very scanty evidence of a linguistic relationship of Etruscan with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], let alone Anatolian in particular, and to Dionysius of Halicarnassus who decidedly argues against an Etruscan-Lydian relationship. The Indo-European Lydian language is first attested some time after the Tyrrhenian migrants are said to have left for Italy.&lt;ref name="herodtus"&gt;{{cite book|author= Herodotus |title= Herodotus |year=| page=1.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiating between cultural origin and cultural influence ==
The origin of the civilisation of Etruria is an ancient debate, still currently disputed among scholars, because the terms in which historians have opened and contested theories have relied on out-dated conceptions of origin and culture. The last two millennia of raising inconclusive theories towards a definitive location for the origins of Etruria has led modern scholarship to diverge from traditional approaches to national origins and instead focus on the development of concepts, such as national origin and cultural formation, differentiating between cultural influence and cultural origin.

[[File:Femme étrusque (Terracotta).jpg|thumb|Etruscan terracotta figure of a young woman, late 4th–early 3rd century BC]] 
The initial sources of inquiry for historians studying Etruscan origins are the classical sources provided by ancient scholars such as Herodotus and Dionysus. These writers were naturally interested in where such an advanced civilisation originated. Herodotus initiated the Anatolian theory which told the story of Etruscan origins as a mass migration from Lydia, led by King Tyrsenos. A migration due to the famine experienced shortly after the [[Trojan War]]. [[Larissa Bonfante]] argues that the traditional concept of origin that classical Greek writers subscribed to "had to be explained as the result of a migration, under the leadership of a mythical founding hero".&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, Etruscans Life and Afterlife: A Handbook of Etruscan Studies, Wayne State University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Valeria Forte furthermore has added that the travelling of heroic leaders to foreign land is a "fixed narrative" used to "promote the political and cultural dominance of Eastern civilisations on Italic culture".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Valeria Forte, Etruscan Origins and Italian Nationalism, University of Dallas, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that the "stereotypical images of a maritime immigration into Italy form the East", is typical formula classical writers such as Herodotus applied without any historical investigation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The second key hypothesis was launched by the Augustan historian, Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Being aware that his predecessors were "unanimous in stating that the Etruscans came from the East"&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, Etruscans Life and Afterlife: A Handbook of Etruscan Studies, Wayne State University&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed an alternate hypothesis that the Etruscans were "native to the country",&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius, The Roman Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Book 1 Section 30, Translated by Earnest Cary, Harvard University Press, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and by doing so opened the autochthonous theory. Scholarship has questioned why ancient sources appear "unanimous" towards an Anatolian origin. Bonfante suggests that it is the natural response for Greek writers to connect other civilisation's accomplishments to "Greek heroes" in an attempt to promote a "glorified national narrative".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the other hand, R.S.P Beekes argues that these ancient writers, especially Herodotus, found the famine in Lydia an obvious connection to the migration to Etruria, rather than a debatable area of discussion. The autochthonous theory that Dionysus instigated was a view held by Etruscans themselves, whom he consulted, though how much these Etruscans knew about their own origins is questionable.

The reason modern scholarship, such as [[John Bryan Ward-Perkins|John Bryan Perkins]], sceptically uses ancient sources as evidence to support an argument, is because these sources generally promote a national image and harbour political prejudices. He argues that the ancient interpretation of Etruscan origins has derived from a "hostile tradition, of rivals and enemies; the Greeks and Romans". The extent of "classical prejudice" is exemplified in early records of the Etruscans. Classical literature typically portrayed Etruscans as 'pirates' and 'freebooters'. Massimo Pallottino points out that their reputation for piracy took shape between the time of Homer and the image shown in the Homeric Hymns, and was clearly a product of the intense commercial and territorial rivalry between the Etruscans and Greek traders. Consequentially Perkins concludes that ancient "standards of historical criticism were not ours" in which "a great deal of it is seen through a veil of interpretation, misunderstanding, and at times, plain invention".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;John Bryan Ward-Perkins, The Problem of Etruscan Origins, Harvard University, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient tendency to invent or apply a fabricated account within their historical record is evident in Herodotus' Histories. His use of fanciful story telling contributes to the overarching glorified narrative of Greece in the Persian wars and exemplifies the greatness of Greek conquest. This agenda is problematic when viewing his 'heroic' understanding of Etruscan origins, because Herodotus' stories tend to contribute to the national narrative rather than an intended historical record. His account is seen through, what Perkins refers to as, antiquity's "distorting mirror".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Valeria Forte admits to classical prejudice, however, she argues that political distortion has not ceased, yet rather contemporary "political propaganda and nationalist bias has infiltrated Italian archaeology".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The modern historiography of Etruscan origins is not exempt from political distortion; Etruscology acknowledges that by attempting to answer where the Etruscans came from, consequentially they are shaping the Italian sense of identity. Pride is taken in being the sole connection to such an advanced civilisation, [[D. H. Lawrence]] concludes in his non-fictional research on Etruscan culture that "the present-day Italians were, in fact, much more Etruscan than Roman".&lt;ref&gt;D.H. Lawrence, Etruscan Places: Travels through forgotten Italy, TaurisParke, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Forte points out that Italians use Etruscan civilisation to "represent a model of cultural expression" within their national image.

In the 1950s, Professor Pallottino resurrected the initial autochthonous theory and by doing so contended with traditional scholarship that has "remained fixated on the idea that the origins of the Italic people were to be found in the effects of immigration from outside". The argument has been developed on the basis that the Etruscan culture appears unique to any other known pre historic culture, therefore must have developed nowhere else but within Italy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Massimo Pallottino, The Etruscans', Indiana University Press, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; He admits to foreign contributions to the cultural development of the Etruscans, however, maintains that the mixture of culture took place on Italian soil, the "parent stock" was sufficiently homogeneous and therefore of Italian origin. Indigenous arguments are based on the unique attributes of Etruscan culture, believing that it is an "evolutionary sequence" in which Etruria developed its independent culture, a "formative process of the Etruscan which can only take place on the territory of Etruria itself".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Nevertheless, to subscribe to this thesis a problem arises; Etruscan culture was "no doubt in itself a unique and developing phenomenon", however, this culture has been compounded of and developed from other earlier cultural strains.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The question remains whether these strains were dominant in the finished product; it is difficult to differentiate between a product of a foreign culture and an independent culture with foreign influences.Other historical methodologies, such as linguistics, archaeology and DNA research, have attempted to clarify this distinction and highlight the extent of foreign influence in Etruscan culture.

Linguists have attempted to shed light on the degree of foreign influence on the Etruscan civilisation. R.S.P Beekes places reliance on his linguistic analysis of the Lemnian inscriptions, which he believes "provided the answer to the problem of the origins of the Etruscans".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;R.S.P Beekes, The Origin of the Etruscans , Royal Dutch Academy, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Lemnos stele is a sixth-century stele in a pre-Hellenic tongue found in Lemnos, a Northern Greek island. The inscription shows distinct similarities to the Etruscan language; both languages apply a similar four vowel system, grammar and vocabulary. Beekes argues that autochthonous theories are merely "a desperate attempt to avoid the evident conclusion from the Lemnian inscription".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; He does not suggest that the language shaped the Etruscan culture, but rather that the similarities in the two languages proves that the Etruscans migrated from Asia Minor, as Herodotus suggested.

Alison E. Cooley criticises Beekes assumption that the Eastern features found in the etymological research of the Lemnian inscription "simply settles the question", yet she imposes that the "later Eastern attributes of the Etruscan is often a product of acculturation".&lt;ref&gt;Alison. E Cooley, Critical Review of R.S.P Beekes, The Classical Associations, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Cooley in contrary to Beekes argues that the similarities in the languages are a result of contact with Greek and Lydian civilisation due to commercial trade.

Linguists, such as Beekes, are commonly criticised for the assumption that "because they speak a common language, they must belong to the same race".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, recently linguists such as [[Kari Gibson]] have argued that language is the predominant factor in the cultural formation of a national identity and therefore cannot be discarded as an independent attribute of a cultural identity, but rather the framework that such a civilisation functions. Gibson suggests that language is inextricably linked to national and cultural identity of the speaker, and as a "powerful symbol of national and ethnic identity" determines an individual's perception of their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Gibson, The Myths of Language use and the Homogenization of Bilingual Workers' Identities, University of Hawaii, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; To place this argument in the linguistic debate of Etruscan origins, modern scholars such as Cooley are perhaps being overly dismissive of the impact of language on the development of the Etruscan identity; "Ethnic identity is twin skin to linguistic identity".&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Anzaldua, Borderlands, (page 59), Aunt Lute Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for scholarship to evaluate the degree of influence the Lydian language would have had on the cultural development of Etruria, though language is undeniably a key ingredient in the development of Etruscan culture.

Archaeology has a prominent role in revealing aspects of Etruscan daily life and the social structure of such a sophisticated civilisation, thus exposing foreign influences. The most significant archaeological discoveries of Etruscan civilisation are found in the excavation of gravesites. Bonfante emphasises the unique cultural elements the funerary frescoes in these gravesites illustrate. The well preserved frescoes of the funerary chambers found in the necropolis of [[Monterozzi]], situated on a ridge southeast of the ancient city of Tarquinia, are vital to the reconstruction of Etruscan culture. Scholars of the autochthonous theory tend to draw attention to the frescoes depiction of women. Material evidence for the high social status of Etruscan women can be found on the frescoes in the [[Tomb of the Leopards]], dating to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Banti, Etruscan Cities and their Culture, University of California Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The fresco illustrates women and men conversing together and wearing the same crowns of laurel, which implies that symbols of status in Etruscan society were similar for men and women. This advanced status for women is a unique Etruscan element that is not known from any other culture of its time.

Frescoes found in the [[Tomb of Hunting and Fishing]] marks the earliest time where men are not depicted dominating their environment.In the fresco of birds flying over a boat of men,the men are shown to be proportionally smaller than the birds. Pallottino points out that this is a unique attribute from Etruscan artworks, because it provides an insight into how the Etruscans viewed themselves in comparison to their environment. Ancient works dated prior to this fresco tended to view men dominating their environment. However, the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing illustrates men in the background of the work, rather than typically the foreground, suggesting to scholars such as Pallottino that Etruria had developed a culture and social understanding unlike any other prehistoric civilisation and therefore cannot be a product of any prior culture. [[Alberto Palmucci]] an Italian Etruscanologist believes that the large size of the birds in this fresco is not an innovative element in the history of art, but rather a realistic representation of large [[stork]]s, which were guiding the seasonal voyages of the Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Palmucci, The Etruscan Origins and DNA, University of Bari, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The art works illustrated by Etruscans provide a unique insight into their culture, which has suggested that Etruscan civilisation did not echo prehistoric civilisations, but rather developed a distinctive set of social values.

==Genetic evidence==
There have been a number of genetic studies of Etruscans and modern Tuscans compared with other populations, some of which indicate the local, European origin of Etruscans and others supportive of a Middle Eastern or specifically Anatolian origin. In general, the direct testing of ancient Etruscan DNA has supported a deep, local origin, while the testing of modern Tuscan or Tuscan cattle-breed DNA as a proxy for Etruscans has pointed to non-local origins. Although a direct measure should be considered superior to a proxy measure, debate continues because of mistrust of ancient DNA results and because of the far smaller sample sizes for ancient DNA, compared to the high confidence, vast quantity, and thus greater statistical power of conclusions based on direct medical sampling of current DNA.

The latest very large [[mtDNA]] study from 2013 indicates, based on maternally-inherited DNA, that the Etruscans were most likely a native population.&lt;ref name=Ghirotto2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tassi2013 /&gt; The study extracted and typed the hypervariable region of mitochondrial DNA of 14 individuals buried in two Etruscan necropoleis, analyzing them along with previously analyzed Etruscan mtDNA, other ancient European mtDNA, modern and [[Medieval]] samples from Tuscany, and 4,910 modern individuals from the [[Mediterranean]] basin. The ancient (30 Etruscans, 27 Medieval Tuscans) and modern DNA sequences (370 Tuscans) were subjected to several million computer simulation runs, showing that the Etruscans can be considered ancestral to Medieval and, especially in the subpopulations from Casentino and Volterra, of modern Tuscans; modern populations from Murlo and Florence, by contrast, were shown not to continue the Medieval population. By further considering two Anatolian samples (35 and 123 individuals), it was estimated that the genetic links between [[Tuscany]] and [[Anatolia]] date back to at least 5,000 years ago, strongly suggesting that the Etruscan culture developed locally, and not as an immediate consequence of immigration from the Eastern Mediterranean shores. According to the study, ancient Etruscan mtDNA is closest among modern [[Europe]]an populations and is not particularly close to Turkish or other Eastern Mediterranean populations. Among ancient populations, ancient Etruscans were found to be closest to Neolithic farmers from Central Europe.

This result is largely in line with previous mtDNA results from 2004 (in a smaller study also based on ancient DNA), and contradictory to results from 2007 (based on modern DNA). The 2004 study was based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) from 80 bone samples taken from [[tomb]]s dating from the seventh century to the third century BC in [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vernesi C, Caramelli D, Dupanloup I |title=The Etruscans: a population-genetic study |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=694–704 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15015132 |pmc=1181945 |doi=10.1086/383284 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study found that the ancient DNA extracted from the Etruscan remains had some affinities with modern European populations including Tuscans in Italy. In addition the Etruscan samples possibly revealed more genetic inheritance from the eastern and southern Mediterranean than modern Italian samples contain. The study was marred by concerns that mtDNA sequences from the archeological samples represented severely damaged or contaminated DNA;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bandelt HJ |title=Etruscan artifacts |journal=Am.

In the absence of any dating evidence, there is, however, no direct link between this genetic input and the Etruscans. The Coriell Medical Institute study sampled mtDNA from a small town near Florence, finding a Near Eastern cluster. While the samples were not considered genetically "atypical" of Tuscany, even if the samples were composed of people "who identified themselves as having at least three out of four Tuscan grandparents", the sample providers caution that they "do not necessarily represent all Tuscans, nor all Italians, whose population history is complex"."&lt;ref name="ccr.coriell.org"/&gt; As shown by the results of the 2013 paper and deduced prior to them, the most parsimonious explanation of the contradictions between these studies is that the assumption of genetic continuity between the Etruscans and modern Tuscans is, to some extent, false, meaning that the genetic affinities of Tuscans do not straightforwardly prove anything about the origin of the Etruscans.&lt;ref name=Ghirotto2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tassi2013 /&gt;

Another team of Italian researchers showed that the mtDNA of cattle (''[[Bos taurus]]'') in modern [[Tuscany]] is different from that of cattle normally found elsewhere in Italy, and even in Europe as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pellecchia M, Negrini R, Colli L |title=The mystery of Etruscan origins: novel clues from ''Bos taurus'' mitochondrial DNA |journal=Proc.

Many tribes who have migrated in the past have typically taken their livestock with them as they moved. This [[bovine]] mtDNA study suggests that at least some people whose descendants were Etruscans made their way to Italy from Anatolia or other parts of the Near East. However, the study gives no clue as to when they might have done so. There is the possibility that Etruscan civilization arose locally with [[sailing|maritime]] contacts from all across the Mediterranean, and the genetic presence could have been all along since the [[Neolithic]] and the expansion of the seaborne [[Cardium Pottery]] cultures of same origin.

{{Conservatism US|Schools}}
'''Fiscal conservatism''' (also '''economic conservatism''' or '''conservative economics''') is a political-economic philosophy regarding [[fiscal policy]] and [[fiscal responsibility]] advocating low taxes, reduced government spending and minimal government debt.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=392}} [[Free trade]], [[deregulation]] of the economy, [[Tax cut|lower taxes]], and [[privatization]] are the defining qualities of fiscal conservatism. Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical  outlook of [[classical liberalism]] and [[economic liberalism]].{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=210}} The term has its origins in the era of the [[New Deal]] during the 1930s as a result of the policies initiated by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|reform or modern liberals]], when many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was passing for liberalism.{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=99}}

In the United States the term liberalism has become associated with the welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created as a result of the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the United States, together with [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]] and national defense conservatism.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as [[libertarian]],{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=100}} holding more socially liberal views and advocating a [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist foreign policy]] while supporting lower taxes and less government spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}

==Overview==
===Principles===
Fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure |first=Robert M. |last=Freeman |publisher=Elsevier |year=1999 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of [[deficit spending]], the reduction of overall [[government spending]] and [[national debt]], and ensuring [[balanced budget]]s. In other words, fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt, but will usually choose debt over tax increases.

[[Edmund Burke]], in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied&amp;nbsp;... [T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Factions or subgroups===
Although all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government there are disagreements over priorities.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis.
[[Deficit hawk]]s emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt, viewing government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in present-day tax and spending decisions.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}

A second group put their main emphasis on [[Tax cut#Tax cuts in the United States|tax cuts]] rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace [[supply-side economics]], arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} These additional government revenues, would in the long term reduce debt, they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Some supply-siders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the [[Bush tax cuts]] added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002-2011&lt;ref name=CBO_Change2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463|title=CBO Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001|website=CBO|date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009–2019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes, this group emphasizes reduction in [[Government spending|spending]] rather than tax policy or debt reduction.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}} They argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}}

==History in the United States==

===18th and 19th centuries===
The [[Democratic-Republican Party]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]] supported a weak [[central government]] and a more ''[[laissez-faire]]'' approach than that of the [[Federalist Party]] of Jefferson's rival [[Alexander Hamilton]]. They opposed Hamilton's plan to pay off the debts owed by the states for the expense of the American Revolution, because some of the debt was held by financiers and speculators (rather than the original holders) and because most of the debt was held by northern states. Hamilton passed his legislation and set up taxes to pay the debts. In exchange, he agreed to let Jefferson move the nation's capital to [[Washington, D.C.]]

Jefferson strongly opposed having any national debt, but he relented in 1803 for the sake of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. [[James Madison]] and [[James Monroe]] were elected by the Democratic-Republican Party, but after the fiscal disasters of the [[War of 1812]], they came to support most Federalist positions and decided that the nation needed a central bank and a steady income flow from tariffs.

===Early to mid 20th century===
[[File:Hoover Campaign.jpg|right|thumb|[[Herbert Hoover]] addresses a large crowd in his 1932 campaign.]]
In the early 20th century fiscal conservatives were often at odds with [[progressivism|progressives]] who desired economic reform.
During the 1920s, President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pro-business economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the "Roaring Twenties."  His actions, however, may have been due more to a sense of [[federalism]] than fiscal conservatism: [[Robert Sobel]] notes, "As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coolidge and American Business|url=http://coolidgefoundation.org/resources/essays-papers-addresses-35/|publisher=Calvin-Coolidge.org|accessdate=May 14, 2015|author=Robert Sobel|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative economic and fiscal policies of [[Herbert Hoover]] are often popularly contrasted with the [[New Deal]] deficit spending of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of Truman and Eisenhower. [[Barry Goldwater]] was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative Republicans.

===Reagan era===

{{main|Reaganomics}}
Fiscal conservatism was rhetorically promoted during the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–1989). During Reagan's tenure, the top personal income [[tax bracket]] dropped from 70% to 28%,&lt;ref name="The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates"&gt;{{cite web | author = Daniel J.

Employment grew at about the same rate as population.

According to a [[United States Department of the Treasury]] nonpartisan economic study, the major tax bills enacted under Reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1% of GDP.&lt;ref name=taxtable&gt;{{cite journal|author=[http://www.treasury.gov/offices/tax-policy/offices/ota.shtml Office of Tax Analysis] |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |title=Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills |work=2003, rev.

In fewer than eight years, the U.S. went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26402-2004Jun8.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Reagan Policies Gave Green Light to Red Ink | date=June 9, 2004 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ross Perot===
{{Main|Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992}}
In the 1992 Presidential election, [[Ross Perot]], a successful American businessman, ran as a third-party candidate.  Despite significant campaign stumbles, and the uphill struggles involved in mounting a third-party candidacy, Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote (the largest percentage of any third-party candidate in modern history), largely on the basis of his central platform plank of limited-government, balanced-budget fiscal conservatism.

===Clinton era===
{{main|Clintonomics}}
[[File:Average US Federal Tax Rates 1979 to 2013.png|thumb|350px|The Ominibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the average federal tax rates for the top 1%, while lowering average tax rates for the middle class. President Obama also raised tax rates for higher income persons starting in 2013, through the partial expiration of the [[Bush tax cuts]]. The Clinton and Obama tax increases lowered deficits relative to CBO policy baselines without them.]]
While the mantle of fiscal conservatism is most commonly claimed by Republicans and [[libertarians]], it is also claimed in some ways by many [[Democratic Party (United States)#Centrists|centrist]] or [[Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)#Moderate Democrats|moderate]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who often refer to themselves as "[[New Democrats]]". Although not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the Reagan and Bush administrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-22/news/9307220038_1_income-tax-rolls-tax-code-top-rate|title=Clinton Won't Restore Punitive Taxation-not Today|author=Stephen Chapman|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 22, 1993|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ippqvab /&gt; the New Democrat coalition's primary economic agenda differed from the traditional philosophy held by liberal Democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that a balanced federal budget should take precedence over some spending programs.&lt;ref name=ippqvab&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/108724/brief-history-trickle-down-government|title=A Brief History Of "Trickle-Down Government"|author=Timothy Nolan|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=October 17, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former President [[Bill Clinton]], who was a New Democrat and part of the somewhat fiscally conservative [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] advocating [[Democratic Leadership Council]], is a prime example of this as his administration along with the Democratic-majority congress of 1993 passed on a party-line vote the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] which cut government spending, created a 36% individual income tax bracket, raised the top tax bracket, which encompassed the top 1.2% earning taxpayers, from 31% to 39.6%, and created a 35% income tax rate for corporations.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton’s economic legacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1110165.stm|title= Bill Clinton's economic legacy|author=Steve Schifferes|publisher=BBC News|date= January 15, 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 Budget Act also cut taxes for fifteen million low-income families and 90% of small businesses. Additionally, during the Clinton years, the [[PAYGO]] (pay-as-you-go) system originally introduced with the passing of the [[Budget Enforcement Act of 1990]] (which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with [[deficit hawk]]s) had gone into effect, and was used regularly until the system's expiration in 2002.

In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans ran on a platform that included fiscal responsibility drafted by then-Congressman [[Newt Gingrich]] called the [[Contract with America]], which advocated such things as balancing the budget, providing the president with a [[line-item veto]], and [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]]. After the [[Republican Revolution|elections]] gave the Republicans a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], newly minted [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending, which created a confrontation with the White House that climaxed in the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|1995–1996 government shutdown]]. After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]], which lowered the top [[capital gains tax]] rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.

After this combination of tax hikes and spending reductions, the United States was able to create [[budget surplus]]es from fiscal years 1998-2001 (the first time since 1969), and the longest period of sustained [[economic growth]] in United States history.&lt;ref name="President Clinton announces another record budget surplus"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/27/clinton.surplus/ |title= President Clinton announces another record budget surplus| author=Kelly Wallace|publisher=CNN|date= September 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinton announces record payment on national debt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/01/clinton.debt/|title= Clinton announces record payment on national debt|author=John King|publisher=CNN|date= May 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton|title=The Budget and Deficit Under Clinton|author=Brooks Jackson|date=February 3, 2008|website=FactCheck.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern fiscal conservatism in the United States===
[[File:CBO Forecast Comparison - Obama and GW Bush - v1.png|thumb|right|450px|Comparison of annual federal deficits (CBO 10-year forecast from prior to inauguration vs. the actual amount), during the Obama and G.W. Bush presidencies. Bush added far more to the debt relative to the CBO 2001 forecast than Obama added relative to the CBO 2009 forecast.]]

American businessman, politician, and former [[Mayor of New York City]], [[Michael Bloomberg]], considers himself a fiscal conservative and expressed his definition of the term at the 2007 [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] Conference: &lt;blockquote&gt;"To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets&amp;nbsp;– not running deficits that the next generation can't afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns&amp;nbsp;– and by all indications, we've got one coming."&lt;ref name="Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks At 2007 Conservative Party Conference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2007b%2Fpr348-07.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1|title=Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks At 2007 Conservative Party Conference|publisher=NYC.gov|date= September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The NYT reported in July 2018 that: "The top-earning 1 percent of households — those earning more than $607,000 a year — will pay a combined $111 billion less this year in federal taxes than they would have if the laws had remained unchanged since 2000. That’s an enormous windfall. It’s more, in total dollars, than the tax cut received over the same period by the entire bottom 60 percent of earners." This represents the tax cuts for the top 1% from the [[Bush tax cuts]] and [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Trump tax cuts]], partially offset by the tax increases on the top 1% by Obama.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/opinion/trump-republicans-tax-cuts-inequality.html NYT-David Leonhardt-$111 Billion in Tax Cuts for the Top 1 Percent-July 11, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rest of the world==
As a result of the expansion of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term ''liberalism'' in the United States today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by [[socialist]] or [[social democratic]] parties such as the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] rather than liberal parties.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in Germany being one example.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries liberalism or [[neoliberalism]] is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}}{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=542}}{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=210}}

Fiscal conservatism in the UK was arguably most popular during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who, after a number of years of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget. In 2010, as a result of the deterioration in the UK's public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous Labour government, the [[late-2000s recession]] and by the [[European sovereign debt crisis]]—the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Liberal Democrat-Conservative Coalition]] embarked on an [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity programme]], featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises, in an attempt to halve the [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] and completely eliminate the [[structural deficit]] over the five-year parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundstrategy.co.uk/markets/britain/budget-structural-deficit-to-be-balanced-by-2015/1013834.article|title=Budget: Structural deficit to be balanced by 2015|author=|date=June 22, 2010|website=Fund Strategy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713000832/http://www.fundstrategy.co.uk/markets/britain/budget-structural-deficit-to-be-balanced-by-2015/1013834.article|archive-date=July 13, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the rise of the socialist [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)]] pushed the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] to create and expand the welfare state before and after World War II.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} Fiscal conservatism in Canada is generally referred to as [[Blue Toryism]] when it is present within the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Development of Managerial Culture: A Comparative Study of Australia and Canada|first=Arthur|last=Wolak|publisher=Springer|year=2014|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta, fiscal conservatism is represented by the [[United Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/alberta-election-pits-pcs-red-versus-wildroses-blue-conservatives-experts-say|title=Alberta election pits PC’s 'red' versus Wildrose’s ‘blue’ conservatives, experts say|author=Karen Kleiss|date=April 9, 2012|newspaper=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, fiscal conservatism is represented by the  [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]].

The '''Furietti Centaurs''' (known as the '''Old Centaur''' and '''Young Centaur''', or '''Older Centaur''' and '''Younger Centaur''', when being treated separately) are a pair of Hellenistic or Roman grey-black marble [[sculpture]]s of [[centaur]]s based on [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic models]]. One is a mature, bearded centaur, with a pained expression, and the other is a young smiling centaur with his arm raised. The [[putto|amorini]] are missing that once rode the backs of these centaurs, which are the outstanding examples of a group of sculptures varying the motif.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bieber, ''The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age'', rev. ed. (New York, 1961) figs. 581 and 583. The amorino survives on the Louvre centaur.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongly contrasted moods were intended to remind the Roman viewer of the soul troubled in pain with love or uplifted in joy, themes of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and Hellenistic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Grift, "Tears and Revel: The Allegory of the [[Berthouville Treasure|Berthouville Centaur Scyphi]]" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''88''' (July 1984:377-88) esp. pp. 383, where he gives several literary instances in the context of the Furietti centaurs, notably [[Poseidippus]], who complains in a poem of the [[Palatine Anthology]] of the power of love that drives him alternately "to tears and revel", and Roman references to the paradoxical nature of watered and unwatered wine, which espouse [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[moderation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capitoline Centaurs==
The sculptures were found together at [[Hadrian's Villa]] in [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] by Monsignor [[Giuseppe Alessandro Furietti]] in December 1736; they were the outstanding pieces of his collection of antiquities, which he refused to give to [[Pope Benedict XIV]]— at the cost of a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]'s hat. Furietti was eventually created cardinal priest, by [[Pope Clement XIII]] in the consistory of 24 September 1759. After the cardinal's death, his heirs sold the centaurs and the [[Furietti mosaic]] of four drinking doves for 14,000 ''scudi'', and they have been in the [[Capitoline Museum]] ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Musei Capitolini, acc. nos. 656 and 658; Helbig, 4th ed., no. 1398 (entry by H. von Steuben).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both statues bear the signatures of Aristeas and  Papias of [[Aphrodisias]], a city in Asia Minor— we cannot be certain about the exact relationship of the signatures to the sculptures, whether as originators of the model or sculptors of these versions. Where the sculptures were produced is not sure either: whether in Aphrodisias, or whether the artists, of whom nothing else is known, had come from there to Rome. To judge by the stylistic date these [[Hadrian]]ic copies will date to the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. They are generally assumed to be copies of 2nd century BC bronze&lt;ref&gt;Bronze originals would not have required the tree-stump supports beneath the bellies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hellenistic originals, though recent critical study, notably by [[Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway]], suggests that many sculptural types usually thought to be Hellenistic are in fact Roman pastiches or inventions.

==Louvre==
[[Image:Old Centaur Eros Louvre Ma 562.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Centaur (Louvre)]]
Another copy of the same type as the Old Centaur, this time in white [[marble]], was excavated in Rome in the 17th century (having lost its probable Young Centaur pair). It entered the [[Borghese collection]], but was acquired from [[Camillo Filippo Ludovico Borghese]] by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] in 1807 and is now in the [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre acc. no. 562.&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] on the centaur's back, teasing him, which has not survived on the Capitoline example, though Eros' arm and foot and the centaur's left arm on this example are restorations, and the base and the support beneath the centaur are modern additions. The original right arm  of the centaur is pulled tautly back showing that he has his hands bound tightly behind his back, and "grimaces in pain and sorrow as an amorino pulls the centaur's head back at an abrupt angle."&lt;ref&gt;Van de Grift 1984:383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The pair were popular in the 18th century, as illustrations of centaurs that posed them as civilized patrons of hospitality and learning, like [[Chiron]], rather than bestial half-animals (as at the [[Battle of the Centaurs]]). With their [[erotes]], they were emblems of the joy of young love and the contrasting bondage of maturity to love,&lt;ref&gt;Sexual desires "which torment the old and delight the young", as Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny observed in discussing this pair, in ''Taste and the Antique: the lure of classical sculpture, 1500-1900'', 1981, cat. no. 20, p. 178; they discuss the reception of the Furietti centaurs p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; themes to which a [[Rococo]] audience would easily respond. The observant [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]]&lt;ref&gt;Visconti, ''Monumenti scelti borghesiani'', 1837:29, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; remarked on the Bacchic attributes of the Borghese/Louvre centaur, whose amorino is crowned with berried vine, to suggest that the forces in play were those of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] rather than love. Jon van de Grift, in examining the iconography of a pair of early Imperial Roman silver [[Skyphos|scyphi]] (drinking cups) embossed with motifs of centaurs ridden by erotes, part of the [[Berthouville treasure]],&lt;ref&gt;Van de Grift 1984:38.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that "the motif of an amorino torturing an old sullen centaur, usually within a lively [[Thiasus|Dionysiac procession]], is encountered in Roman mosaics and Dionysiac sarcophagi;"&lt;ref&gt;Van de Grift 1984:382.&lt;/ref&gt; he offers the Furietti centaurs as iconographic parallels.

Casts of them were collected across Europe - for example, the pair at the [[Royal Academy, London]], one at either side of the foot of the main staircase, which are there to this day (in what is now the [[Courtauld Institute]] gallery; or those bought by [[Joseph Nollekens]] from [[Bartolomeo Cavaceppi]] that may still be seen at [[Shugborough Hall]], Staffordshire. Full-sized marble copies were also produced in large numbers - Cavaceppi produced them, and [[Pietro Della Valle]] sculpted one in Rome for the count [[Pierre Gaspard Marie Grimod d'Orsay|Grimod d'Orsay]] - he intended it to be placed on a fountain in the Museum Courtyard&lt;!--Louvre?--&gt; in 1795, but it was in fact placed at Saint-Cloud in July 1802 (it was later brought to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on 23 March 1872, and on 24 September 1924 moved into the Grand Trianon garden there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chateauversailles.fr/en/1_Adopt_a_statue_in_the_Park.php Château de Versailles webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hanging coffins''' are [[coffin]]s which have been placed on cliffs. They can be found in various locations, including [[China]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]]. In China, they are known in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as ''xuanguan'' ({{zh|s={{linktext|悬|棺}}|t={{linktext|懸|棺}}|p=xuán guān}}) which also means "hanging coffin".

Hanging coffins are an ancient [[funeral]] custom of some [[List of past Chinese ethnic groups|ethnic groups]], especially the [[Bo people (China)|Bo people]] of southern China. Coffins of various shapes were mostly carved from one whole piece of wood. Hanging coffins either lie on beams projecting outward from vertical faces such as mountains, are placed in caves in the face of cliffs, or sit on natural rock projections on mountain faces.

It was said that the hanging coffins could prevent bodies from being taken by beasts and also bless the soul eternally.&lt;ref name=chinaculture1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hanging Coffin|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_curiosity/2004-10/26/content_62632.htm|work=The Hanging Coffin|publisher=chinaculture.org|accessdate=10 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151218/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_curiosity/2004-10/26/content_62632.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritually, the Bo people viewed the mountain cliffs as a stairway to heaven and believed that by placing the coffins up high the deceased would be closer to heaven.

The '''Herblock Prize''' for [[editorial cartooning]] is an annual $15,000 after-tax cash prize, and a sterling silver [[Tiffany glass|Tiffany]] trophy.&lt;ref name=official&gt;[http://www.herbblockfoundation.org/herblock-prize "Herblock Prize &amp; Lecture,"] Herblock Foundation website. Accessed Sept. 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed "to encourage editorial cartooning as an essential tool for preserving the rights of the American people through freedom of speech and the right of expression," it is named for the editorial cartoonist [[Herblock]] and sponsored by The Herb Block Foundation.

The rotating three-judge panel that determines the award-winner is typically composed of the previous year's winner, another editorial cartoonist, and a scholar of editorial cartooning. The award is typically presented some time between March and May of each year, at the [[Library of Congress]].

Each award presentation is accompanied by a guest lecturer who discusses contemporary social issues "in the spirit of [[Herblock]]."&lt;ref name=official /&gt; Previous Herblock Prize guest lecturers include [[Ben Bradlee]], President [[Barack Obama]], [[Sandra Day O’Connor]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Tim Russert]], [[Ted Koppel]], [[George Stevens, Jr.]], [[Jim Lehrer]], [[Garry Trudeau]], [[Gwen Ifill]], and [[Bob Woodward]].

== History ==
When [[Herb Block]] died in October 2001, he left $50 million with instructions to create a foundation to support charitable and educational programs that help promote and sustain the causes he championed during his 72 years of cartooning. The Herb Block Foundation is committed to defending the basic freedoms guaranteed all Americans, combating all forms of discrimination and prejudice, and improving the conditions of the poor and underprivileged through the creation or support of charitable and educational programs with the same goals. The Foundation is also committed to improving educational opportunities to deserving students through post-secondary education scholarships and to promoting editorial cartooning through continuing research. The Herb Block Foundation awarded its first grants and the annual Herblock Prize in editorial cartooning in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herbblockfoundation.org/press-release/434 Pat Bagley Wins 2009 Herblock Prize], February{{nbsp}}18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22986">'''Imaging Blackness''' is the complex concept of expressing, recognizing, or assigning specific sets of ideas or values used in the depiction of African Americans. This depiction can be shown through various forms of media: film, television, literature. More specifically in film, the portrayal of African Americans have been imaged and captured throughout history.

==Origin of Term==
"Imaging Blackness" is a term first used by Audrey T. McCluskey in her 2007 book ''Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art''.

==Historical Overview==
From the beginning of modern cinema, images of African Americans have played a primary role in the cinematic imagination of the West. These negative images have promoted a demeaning and undignified image of African Americans as a general group. However, simultaneously film has enabled African Americans to covey their creativity and originality, despite some intentions of whites to confine black humanity or use the African American race as a scapegoat. The beginning of black presence in American film, started with the concept of "blackface". Disguised by the idea of entertainment, white actors painted their faces black and accentuated their lips by covering them with bright red lipstick. Their outer appearance reflected society's curiosity of blackness. The concept of blackness was initially used to ridicule African Americans, showing white superiority to blacks, but then society became attracted to the controversial concept. Consequently, [[blackface]] became a popular fad in American culture. Ideas have developed and changed over time, but film has always had the ability to play on society's racial visions.

==Poster Art==
In the 1890s a new form of visual representation was introduced to America and international audiences. The high literacy rate at the beginning of the twentieth century caused the creation of advertising for newly animated films. The first forms of advertising were vividly colored crates or switchboards used to promote an upcoming film. Seen as a way to preview a story with visual highlights, these advertisements enticed viewers and attracted audiences to movie theatres. This concept created the modern day movie poster. The invention of the movie poster itself is attributed to a Frenchman named [[Jules Chéret]]. He applied a printing process called stone lithography for the creation of his poster. As film technology progressed, evidently there became a need for more movie posters. It became a standardized process used to promote every new movie. The General Film Company standardized the size of a film poster at 27'' x 41'', allowing the poster to fit inside the glass casing outside of theatres. This was called the "one sheet" poster. These posters included texts and images supplied by the movie producing company. A constant dispute amongst associates in the movie producing company was whether to showcase star actors on their movie posters. The producer's objective was to sell their product, the movie, which is done by advertising. On the other hand, the stars demanded that these posters became a reflection of them and their talents. Movie studios hired illustrators to produce posters that were artistic as well as inventive, constantly trying to find ways to appeal to the biggest audience. During the pre-television era of the 1950s, poster art became the typical way of movie advertising, consisting of the desirable image of a movie star with some text or other images explaining a part of the movie history. 										

The portrayal of African Americans on these movie posters was very different from that of whites. American posters had a cross-cultural view of images of African Americans. American posters tended to marginalize the black presence and limit romantic images between African Americans. However, foreign posters showcased African Americans and highlighted their romantic roles. Early American films were concerned with racial imagery. Some films made for black audiences by white producers exhibited extreme racial categories. The "hero" of these films was often a white male of upper class status. For instance, a poster for the Norman Studio produced film ''Regeneration'' (1923) displayed a poster that was a preview for the movie but also reflected a societal stereotype. It showed a fair-skinned woman fearing the advanced of an intimidating dark-skinned man. This implied the threat of rape, which negatively portrayed the African American man as a scary, harmful individual. Posters like these started to create general stereotypes like, all women should fear African American men. Yet, some studios created posters to rebut the negative images of African Americans. Some showed black men as hardworking, which was atypical of Hollywood's defined image of the African American male.  							

In later decades, poster images reflected social- issues presented by "message films". "These included 'passing' in ''Los Boundaries'' (1949), interracial romance in ''Island in the Sun'' (1957), and ''Jungle Fever'' (1991), and the youthful experience of racial prejudice in ''The Learning Tree'' (1969)".&lt;ref name="c"&gt;McCluskey, Audrey T.,  ["Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art"] pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; These images differed from the earlier images of the negative portrayals of African Americans. The new representation of African Americans on film posters showed social, controversial figures, which created an inquisitive, yet uncomfortable society. By the 1960s, during the Civil Rights movement, the first African American Hollywood movie star, Sidney Poitier emerged. The inoffensive posters of his movies like, ''Lilies of the Field'' (1963), depicted him as a protector over others and harmless individual. Thereafter, society became more accepting to non-violent, optimistic images of African Americans. 					

During [[Spike Lee]]'s filmmaking career, topics such as race and sex were presented provocatively in poster art. He wanted the posters to be as racy as his films. He hired graphic artists, like Art Sims who specialized in specifically marketing black films. He created controversial posters, like the film poster of ''Jungle Fever'', a movie about an interracial love affair. The first version of the film poster had the actresses, Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra sucking each other's fingers. This image was rejected because it was seen as too sexual and was replaced by the image of the couple interlocking fingers while holding hands. Another Lee film, ''Bamboozled'' was promoted with a poster of a graphical satire. When the film released in 2000, the advertising was thought of as too offensive and was turned away by many newspapers like the New York Times. Ironically, the film itself exposes and retells the history of African American treatment and portrayal in American entertainment.  					

"Film posters illustrate the artistic and thematic range of racial representation in the American film industry. They present a history that is preserved and partially documented by a clash of art and commerce. As such, these posters are imbued with a broad array of social meanings that continue to engage us".&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

==Action/ Crime==
The 1970s era began with a revolutionary representation of African Americans. Beginning with [[Melvin Van Peeble]]'s film ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song'' (1971) where a black man fights back against racial injustice, Hollywood began showing powerful black men as heroes in action films. [[The Flying Ace]] (1926) claimed the title as the "greatest airline thriller ever filmed". It inspired many African American aviators to fly and form aviation clubs. ''Odds Against Tomorrow'' (1959) is noted as one of the last film noirs and was directed by Robert Wise. It is one of the first films to address white racism towards African Americans. Regardless, some black action films also created controversy because they were based on negative stereotypical representations of African Americans. African American actors were primarily directed by whites, therefore their character usually acted or appeared in a way in which whites viewed African Americans.

==Comedy==
Comedy has been both helpful in advancing the careers of African Americans as well as harmful by mocking their demeanor or appearance. In the American tradition of minstrelsy white men colored their faces and falsely portrayed African American culture. "Black people and black life was the joke".&lt;ref name="d"&gt;McCluskey, Audrey T.,  ["Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art"] pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The white stage performers suggested their superiority over African Americans by using minstrel shows as a daily mockery to their former position in society. Even the representation of African American children as [[pickaninnies]] became the humor for white audiences. Because of the subjugation of African Americans through comic films, comedy became an extremely sensitive topic, especially for independent race films intended for black audiences. There was much confusion on how to provide a comic performance for the audience while not ridiculing the African American race. In the 1930s African American film directors produced comedy films of the same context, however. They mocked African Americans and because of this their black audiences diminished. Frustrated, race filmmakers sought to create a more complex character for African Americans and wanted to positively portray African American culture. Comedy films became the way African Americans entered into the movie industry, even though their beginning performances were degrading. Yet, some African Americans overshadowed and outperformed white actors, showing new talent on stage. The early independent black comedy films that were popular amongst African Americans told stories about black life and culture, revealing the aptitude of black comedians. In the late 1900s, black comedies thrived and became especially popular. [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] became a comic duo in ''Uptown Saturday Night'' (1974), attracting black audiences from various areas. [[Richard Pryor: Live in Concert]] (1979) starring [[Richard Pryor]], who became the most African American popular comedian in Hollywood, changed the industry. He set the path for other African American comedians like modern day Eddie Murphy, The Wayans Brothers, Martin Lawrence, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker, and Bernie Mac.

==Documentary==
Only recently in the late 1900s did the topic of African American life in the United States become a topic of interest to society. Documentary films gave African Americans a chance to voice their opinions about the injustices they felt. These films also showed detailed insight to African American lives that were not known to society. [[William Greaves]] became a famous filmmaker after his television documentary on the lives of African Americans in the United States, called ''Black Journal''. His other documentaries on prominent figures like [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Malcolm X]] show how documentaries serve as a historical source. Greaves' intention was to capture the struggles and triumphs of African Americans in a realistic technique. His view filled a void that was missing in Hollywood's representation of African Americans. He concentrated on issues specific to African American communities like gender differences, racial hierarchies, and family relationships. Documentaries were used as a powerful method to portray African Americans as complex individuals, explaining significant events in their lives.

==Drama==
The "[[separate cinema]]"&lt;ref&gt;The Separate Cinema Archive — chronicles the historic journey of the Black film industry | http://www.separatecinema.com/index2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  of race films directed for black audiences used the drama genre to combat the popular, accepted view of African Americans. The Lincoln Motion Picture Company, established in 1915, was the first black film company to produce films that showed positive qualities in their illustration of African American lives.&lt;ref&gt;Separate Cinema — The Vintage Years - 20 years of Race Film | http://www.separatecinema.com/exhibits_vintageyears.html&lt;/ref&gt;  African American filmmakers used dramatic works to uplift black morale, inspire African Americans and represent black life in an encouraging way. In earlier dramatic films in Hollywood, African American characters would commonly be seen as being disposable to whites. They would either have to sacrifice their lives or their families for the triumph or success of whites. The underlying message told by Hollywood was the importance and dominance of white life over the lives of African Americans. However, in the 1900s independent films like ''Daughters of the Dust'' (1991), ''Beloved'' (1998), and ''Bamboozled'' (2000) showed the history of African Americans in the United States, the challenges they faced, and the benefits they gained from overcoming racial injustice. These films exemplify how dramatic films can be used as an instrument for African Americans to envision and hope for a better and improved future.

==Musical==
"Several cultural critics claim that, in U.S culture, music is one of few arenas within blacks are allowed greatness. This phenomenon is clearly evident in the inception of the all-black cast musical in the Hollywood film tradition, in musicals in race films from the late 1920s and 1930s, and in contemporary culture".&lt;ref name="e"&gt;McCluskey, Audrey T.,  ["Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art"] pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest sound films, ''Hearts if Dixie'' (1929) and ''Hallelujah!'' (1929) allowed African Americans to perform and showcase their said "natural abilities" for song and dance. Rather than the earlier Hollywood musicals where whites put on a blackface, these musicals consisted of all black casts performing black roles. Hollywood studios constructed all black cast musicals designed for white audiences. Even though these films confirmed society's belief of the Negro as the bottom of the social hierarchy, musicals gave African Americans an opportunity to add to the limited role of "blackness" labeled by whites. 										    	

In Hollywood musicals, African Americans were prominently used for the amusement of whites. Including all black cast musicals, Hollywood's musicals were intended for white audiences. Contrasting the "separate cinema", where race films were shown to black audiences throughout the South. These films developed a narrative that demonstrated the strengths of African American performers. These race films also provided African Americans with the opportunity to play lead roles rather than the limited Hollywood roles of servants, maids, or clowns. The existence of the musical genre in both Hollywood and race films generated a segregated society. This segregation allowed society to witness the discrepancies between both sources of entertainment, Hollywood and independent race filmmakers.

==Mystery/ Thriller==
"Mystery/ Thriller films allowed both black- and white- owned race film production companies the opportunity to showcase a wide range of black characters in roles such as doctors, attorneys, judges, bankers, and policemen, depictions that went against the grain of the limited roles mainstream Hollywood films afforded black characters".&lt;ref name="f"&gt;McCluskey, Audrey T.,  ["Imaging Blackness: Race and Racial Representation in Film Poster Art"] pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Black characters were able to transform their mediocre roles as a "spooked servant" into central elements of the film. For instance, in the 1940s [[Stepin Fetchit]] and [[Mantan Moreland]] played unforgettable roles in the [[Charlie Chan]] mysteries, and their characters even become more popular than Charlie Chan himself. Contemporary mystery/thriller films cast African American like [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]] in leading roles.

==Western==
During the early 1900s Western movies became the most popular genre in Hollywood. [[Herb Jeffries|Herbert Jeffrey]] noticed the interest and appeal of the white singing cowboys on screen and the lack of African Americans that were cast in that role. Even though, about one third of all cowboys that settled in the West were in fact African Americans. These cowboys escaped slavery and were often offered save houses with various Indian tribes. Consequently, after Herbert Jeffrey's hard work, the first black cowboy, [[Jeff Kincaid]], made his first appearance on film in ''Harlem on the Prairie'' (1937). Despite the segregation laws set in place, ''Harlem on the Prairie'' was nationally distributed to both black and white theatres across the country. The success of the film inspired many similar films and bettered the view of African Americans to society. For instance, following, the film ''The Bronze Buckaroo'' (1939), the first black western full-length musical, the African American cowboy acts as the lead hero, saving the damsel in distress and then slowly rides off into the sunset.

==Blaxploitation==
"An examination of Black action films produced both independently by African Americans and by major Hollywood studios during the [[Blaxploitation|Black film explosion]] of the 1960s and 1970s raises important questions about the African American film experience of visuality and identity formation, and the ways in which the look and the gaze of the African American are inextricably linked to a culture of oppression".&lt;ref name="g"&gt;Ongiri, Amy Abugo, "Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic" pg.164&lt;/ref&gt; Experts claimed that films could link the fantasies of youth with the visual depiction on film because the lack of nationalistic culture in society. The African American audience often had trouble separating their existence from the visual imagination shown by Hollywood's films. Adult audiences and mature adolescents from middle-class families could view films in the fictional context indented. They, coming from a comfortable home with fulfillment of their needs, regarded films as merely fiction. Contrasting poor African Americans who were susceptible to idolize Hollywood films. The low- income adolescents who did not have a comfortable lifestyle or positive role- models viewed fictional films as reality. Discussions of the Blaxploitation films include, "assumptions about the relation of an African American spectatorship to Hollywood in general often rely on the notion that Black spectatorship is either degraded, infantile, or polluted by the outside forces to which it is subjugated".&lt;ref name="h"&gt;Ongiri, Amy Abugo, "Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic" pg.165&lt;/ref&gt; Blaxploitation films provided a counter narrative to the idea of white supremacy and the traditional portrayals of African Americans in the Hollywood cinema. The Blaxploitation narrative of "ghetto despair" illustrated African American's response to the [[Black Power]] era. In addition, Blaxploitation films provided and developed the concept of masculinity, which was lacking in Hollywood films. Hollywood films had wide- ranging view of males from "the placid, asexual Sidney Poitier model to the plantation Sambo or the comical Steppin Fetchit".&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Ongiri, Amy Abugo, "Spectacular Blackness: the Cultural Politics of the Black Power Movement and the Search for a Black Aesthetic" pg.167&lt;/ref&gt; Blaxploitation films depiction of the destructive inner- city lives of African Americans and the hyper masculine male character both countered and enforced the growing urban African American criminality of the 1960s. The release of the movie ''Shaft'' (1971) featured an African American detective who used his Harlem street smarts to help him win a war wagged against a street mob. The director, Gordon Parks characterized an African American as the lead, authoritative role. He also employed many African Americans to help with the film, giving them positions from the screenwriter to casting them as extras in the film. The inclusion of African Americans in the film and during the filmmaking process added a more realistic urban feel. Including African American in filmmaking made a notable impact and set the precedent for future directors. The genre of Blaxploitation affected Hollywood's vision of African Americans as well as the existing political hierarchy in which they were placed in the United States. The increase in Blaxploitation films generally established and defined African Americans in the post-civil rights ear in the United States. 							

By creating the Blaxploitation genre, new representations of Black Power could be shown to audiences. Since the majority of African American movie-viewers were adolescents, it was determined that horror and action movies sold best to these "ethnic" audiences. Between 1966 and 1975 around seventy Black action films were made either by Hollywood studios or first-time African American production companies. These actions films varied in quality. They ranged from creative narratives to low-budget films. Since during the 1960s and 1970s African Americans first came to become the focus of mainstream entertainment, the creation of the Blaxploitation era formed a visual tradition to refute the stereotypical stigma of African Americans established from history. These films also revealed the limitations and lack of opportunities African Americans were given in society during the period following segregation. 					

However, critics like Clayton Riley from the New York Times argued that Blaxploitation films provided an overly simplistic view of African Americans, which could have had detrimental effects, potentially making African Americans more submissive to societal injustice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20528">{{about|the approach developed by Roy Harris|the approach based on Hans-Heinrich Lieb's work|Integrational linguistics}}
'''Integrationism''' (also known as '''integrational linguistics''') is an approach in the [[theory of communication]] that emphasizes innovative participation by communicators within contexts and rejects rule-based models of language. It was developed by a group of [[linguists]] at the [[University of Oxford]] during the 1980s, notably [[Roy Harris (linguist)|Roy Harris]].

The International Association for the Integrational Study of Language and Communication was founded in 1998 and has members in more than twenty-five countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integrationists.com IAISLC].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and language==
While the integrationist views of [[Roy Harris|Harris]] and Dr Adrian Pablé, among others, differ from those who believe that cognition is [[Distributed cognition|distributed]] (i.e.  Kravchenko and Love), the view on language between the two fields are quite similar.  Both sides criticize the traditional view of linguistics which holds language as an individual internal psychological concern that takes written language as the base from which to begin analysis. Instead, integrationists view knowledge (which includes language) as “(i) linked to an individual’s experience, and therefore dependent on the ‘evidence available’ to that particular individual, but at the same time (ii) unpredictable because any integrational task involving sign-making and sign-interpreting is carried out in actual, time-embedded situations, which are not simply ‘given’, either.”.&lt;ref name=pable2010&gt;Pablé, 2010.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, language usage is intrinsically, and without fail, contextual in all of its uses.  Furthermore, Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe&lt;ref name=phc2010&gt;Pablé, Haas &amp; Christe, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; question whether language is even amenable to scientific description, based upon its contextual nature.
The contextual nature of language leads to a rejection of the notion that language is a ‘fixed code’.  Harris discusses this extensively:

:"When we come across words we do not know, words which apparently did not exist a few years ago, it is difficult to resist two conclusions. One is that if there are verbal ‘codes’, they cannot be fixed: on the contrary, they must be changing all the time. The other conclusion is that if there are such codes, different people use different ones, and these too change. Until yesterday, mine did not include the word moshpit: today it does. But if the code has the kind of instability evidenced by the sudden emergence of new words and meanings, what guarantee of stability is there for ‘old’ words and meanings? The integrationist sees none. And if indeed there is none, then it is the viability of the concept of the code that is itself called in question. For it conspicuously fails to fulfill the theoretical function that is required of a code in semantics; namely to provide a source for those publicly invariant meanings that supposedly underpin verbal communication in the community, and can consequently be both ‘encoded’ and ‘decoded’ by those who know the code.”&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of parts of a fixed code, language is looked at as a resource to conduct action with, an idea that echoes the notions put forth by [[Speech act theory|speech act]] theorists such as [[J.L. Austin|Austin]] and [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Interactional sociolinguistics|interactional sociolinguists]] such as [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]], [[Conversation Analysis|conversation analysts]] such as [[Harvey Sacks|Sacks]], [[Schegloff]], and Goodwin, as well as others such as [[Goffman]], all of whom were or are active in fields outside of linguistics, including language philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Harris claims that to not know what a word means is to not know what to do with the words, to not know “how to integrate the occurrence of the word into enough of our linguistic experience to satisfy the requirement of the [present] case”.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1998 (cited by Pablé, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
Pablé explores the integrationist views of language in terms of the naming practices related to castles in [[Bellinzona, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=pable2009&gt;Pablé, 2009.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By asking locals the directions to castles using non-standard names for the castles, Pablé elicited various forms by which the locals referred to them, highlighting the idea that references to the places were “highly context sensitive” and that the “meaning” is created on the spot,&lt;ref name=pable2009/&gt; and that “speakers always make sense of language in light of their own experience”.&lt;ref name=pable2010/&gt;

According to integrationist principles, the separation of linguistic phenomena into distinct parts of study is a fundamental error in the conceptualization of language. In 'The Language Myth', Harris postulates that the isolation and subsequent segregational approach of orthodox linguistics is a result of the fact of language itself being the descriptive medium for its own study. A problem arises when we consider words as stand-ins for things. When we then have a word for a language, the word misleads us to consider languages to be things out there in the world rather than real time, second order processes undergoing constant adjustment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Epistemological overlaps==
Integrationism overlaps with recent and not so recent epistemologies concerning communication and interaction. It retains an interest in understanding the system of language-making as an emergent, context-bound, and fundamentally human activity. This view is philosophically consistent with sociocultural theories such as activity theory where the historicity of human experience is recognized to have implications on our activities in ways that shape how they unfold.&lt;ref&gt;Cole &amp; Hatano, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrationist linguistics overlaps with pragmatic and phenomenological approaches such as ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. The latter being rightly susceptible to a written and spoken word bias yet this is not without current attempts to broaden and include a wider range of semiotic contingencies into analyses. The more fundamental overlap is epistemological. Harold Garfinkel's (1994) ethnomethodological policies prioritize the context of interaction with strict objection to analytic presupposed systems of any kind other than that which is made so by the sequentially ordered interactions of participants. Conversation analysts have developed an empirical approach stemming from those policies where spoken and written words are centralized. A recent decentralizing move to the analysis and theorization of multimodal sequential analysis is very much consistent with an integrationist point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Streeck, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrationism and identity==
While integrationism has been in existence for over three decades, advocating against the “language myth”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Harris, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicating that linguistic sign alone cannot function as the basis of an independent, self-sufficient form of communication, but depends for effectiveness on its integration with non-verbal activities of many different kinds, some integrationists have recently directed this perspective to revisit another important concept in sociolinguistics – “social identity”.

This integrational view of identity concurs with the sociocultural perspective that identity is not a rigid and static system predetermined on the basis of either social class, gender, ethnicity, age or education, but rather a discursive and constantly emerging experience that is locally shared and situationally evoked. On the other hand, however, stressing that identity cannot be examined exclusively from an individual’s integrational practice (including both linguistic and non-linguistic practice), integrationists cast doubt on the way sociocultural approach analyzes identity by specifically questioning three of the latter’s tenets: (i) data, (ii) phenomenological inductivism,&lt;ref&gt;Allan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) indirect indexicality.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; They point out an intrinsic controversy that while identity, as the speaker’s first-order experience, is highly context-dependent, the attempt to detect identity merely through inspecting the linguistic components in the tape-recorded data and interpret the data through postulating the existence of linguistically pre-labeled “concrete universals” (e.g. ‘varieties of language’, ‘style’) is actually de-contextualizing the speakers’ identity. Also, they identified another conflict in the sociocultural approach of interpreting a speaker’s identity between the claim of a socially indexical value of linguistic features (“social marker”) that is beyond a single occurrence and the one of locally indexical value of linguistic features that is analyzable only in term of one specific local context.

Compared with sociolinguistic perspective on social identity, integrationists emphasize the integrational phenomenon that occurs when we converse with each other. Sociolinguists concentrate on how people utilize linguistic structures and items, cultural norms, and macro identities that they are normatively assigned in conversation. Based on utterances, sociolinguists attempt to capture speakers’ positionality and relationality in terms of identity, emergence of identity, and indexicality of the language that speakers used.&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It is problematic to integrationists that sociolinguists only focus upon what is said. In other words, sociolinguists take language as an independent structure that can be isolated from the ongoing conversation. Integrationists argue that utterances cannot be dissociated from the context where he utters statements. Utterances have to be integrated with the activities, linguistic and non-linguistic, at that moment.

In conclusion, from an integrational view, “social identity” is rather a “meta-discursive label used by lay speakers to cope with their everyday first-order experience”&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; than a term or object of scientific study that is static and communicationally predetermined. In other words, along with their refusal of language as a static code system to be decoded for meaning transmission, they specifically emphasize that identity is not amenable to scientific description, as “sign-making and sign-interpreting are ‘private’ and cannot be detached from an individual’s integrational activities in the here-and-now”.&lt;ref name=phc2010/&gt; The remaining question for integrationists is how to study ‘identity’ then. One suggestion integrationalists may be more up to is to treat what is displayed in the temporal situations as “beings” and “becomings” rather than fixed identities, and study it multimodally, which is to take different modalities and time scales into consideration, instead of merely relying on the pre-labelled linguistic features.

==The implications of first-order and second-order language on reading comprehension==
According to the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104016/http://www.unescobkk.org/resources/online-materials/aims/uis-aims-activities/uis-aims-and-literacy-assessment/ What is Literacy?] (archive), UNESCO Office in Bangkok: UIS-AIMS and Literacy Assessment&lt;/ref&gt; literacy is defined as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. In other words, the ability to read and write does not only to fulfill one’s own need but also to communicate with the community and society where one stays. With regard to it, this section first focuses on the distinction between spoken language (first-order language) and written language (second-order language)&lt;ref name=krav&gt;Kravchenko, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and how reading comprehension is achieved, and then aims at the impact of technology-enhanced interaction on reading comprehension.

Traditionally, spoken language and written language are regarded as the two sides of the same coin&lt;ref name=krav/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, written language is believed to fully represent its corresponding spoken language. Therefore, educators believe by teaching words, or the symbolization of phonetic signs, students are equipped with the literacy to understand the written texts. However, it is often the case that students have a hard time understanding and interpreting a poem even though they know every single word. The glittering example reveals the problem of treating spoken language and written language as the same and implies the need to treat them differently.

According to Kravchenko, spoken language and written language are different in that spoken language is temporal and local, while written language is atemporal and non-local.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; The understanding of spoken language relies on the common knowledge shared by the participants who are involved in the conversation, and the cognition required is situated and highly interactional. As for written language, the understanding takes place when the text is written (product) rather than is being written (process). Therefore, it is less interactional. Despite the difference, the understanding of both linguistic systems calls for the appropriate background knowledge. An example adapted from Kravchenko is that if a traveler wants to check in and the clerk tells him/her, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, the traveler may check the watch and calculate when to come back for the check-in, so he/she does not have to stand at the front desk for 20 minutes. However, if the traveler sees a note on the front desk saying, “I’ll be back in 20 minutes”, he/she may be baffled due to no point of reference, so he/she does not know how long is needed.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; This example shows that it takes more efforts to establish background knowledge for the understanding of written language than spoken language. By extension, successful reading comprehension depends upon the establishment of shared knowledge between writers and readers.

With the development of technologies, written language includes not only printed work but also hypertexts. Because of the new genres of written language, new literacy is needed. Kravchenko maintained that literacy is the knowledge of using knowledge, so students have to develop the ability of reasoning and judgment based on the written texts.&lt;ref name=krav/&gt; Jenkins et al. go further by claiming that the form of reasoning plays a more important role than the content of learning in the era of technology-enhanced interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins et al., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; To put it another way, the content can be easily stored and retrieved by means of technologies, so the practice of reasoning centers on how to generate, evaluate, interpret, and deploy the electronic resources. Different electronic resources can provide different affordances, so one of the aims of teaching new literacy is to help students develop the ability of knowing what functions that the certain electronic resource is good at. For instance, the text mediation through computers can facilitate the thinking, reflecting, and revising of one’s own thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wertsh &amp; Biven, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Videos, with the visual and auditory modality, can better help knowledge acquisition than pictures, which have the visual modality alone.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypertexts available online enable readers to create their own reading paths and recontextualize the resources of websites.&lt;ref name=bt2010&gt;Baldry and Thibault, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the recontextualization, the thematic regions and semiotic formations are more idiosyncratic than fixed. The readers play a role in picking up the meaning through the created reading paths. According to Harris, linguistic signs should be understood with non-verbal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reading the hypertexts, the readers have access to other non-textual resources online, such as pictures, diagrams, videos, etc. The use of those non-verbal semiotic resources within the texts has its function and offers affordances to the readers to make meaning.&lt;ref name=bt2010/&gt;

'''LACITO''' ('''''La'''ngues et '''Ci'''vilisations à '''T'''radition '''O'''rale'') is a multidisciplinary research organisation, principally devoted to the study of [[culture]]s and [[language]]s of [[oral tradition]]. 

LACITO is a branch of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), the principal network of researchers in [[France]]. It is thus occasionally referred to as ''LACITO–CNRS'' or ''CNRS–LACITO''.

==Scientific activities==
Created in 1976 by [[André-Georges Haudricourt]], LACITO is specialized in the [[Linguistic description|description]], [[Language documentation|documentation]] and analysis of [[endangered languages|under-documented languages]] of the world. The members of LACITO are [[linguist]]s and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]].

The main perspective adopted by LACITO’s researchers is that of [[language typology]], as [[grammar|linguistic structures]] are compared in search of [[language universals|universals]], yet with special attention to their [[Linguistic diversity|diversity]]. Besides language documentation and grammatical description, research at LACITO also includes [[historical linguistics]], [[lexicography]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[Oral literature|verbal art]] and [[cultural diversity]]. 

An important contribution of LACITO is the ''[[Pangloss Collection]]'', for the preservation of valuable [[Archiving|audio archives]] in the world's [[endangered languages]].

==Language expertise==

The '''legal year''', in [[English law]] as well as in other [[common law]] jurisdictions, is the calendar during which the judges sit in court.  It is traditionally divided into periods called "terms."

==England==
In England, the year is divided into four terms:

:* [[Michaelmas term]] - from October to December
:* [[Hilary term]] - from January to April
:* [[Easter term]] - from April to May, and
:* [[Trinity term]] - from June to July.

Between terms, the [[Courts of England and Wales|Courts]] are in vacation, and no [[trial (law)|trial]]s or appeals are heard in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  The legal terms apply to the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme courts only,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/term-dates-and-sittings/term-dates&lt;/ref&gt; and so have no application to the [[Crown Court]], [[county courts]], or [[magistrates' court]]s. The longest vacation period is between July and October. The dates of the terms are determined in law by a [[Practice Direction]] in the [[Civil Procedure Rules]]. The Hilary term was formerly from January 11 to 31, during which superior courts of 
England were open.&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;

===Start of the legal year===

The legal year commences at the beginning of October, with a ceremony dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] in which the [[judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] arrive in a procession from the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] to [[Westminster Abbey]] for a religious service, followed by a reception known as the [[Lord Chancellor]]'s breakfast, which is held in [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]]. Although in former times the judges walked the distance from Temple to Westminster, they now mostly arrive by car. The service is held by the [[Dean of Westminster]] with the reading performed by the Lord Chancellor.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The ceremony has been held continuously since the Middle Ages, with the exception of the years 1940 to 1946 because of [[World War II]]. In 1953 it was held in [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's Church]] because Westminster Abbey was still decorated for the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the year is, like England, divided into four terms:

:* [[Michaelmas term]] - from October to December
:* [[Hilary term]] - from January to April
:* [[Easter term]] - from April to May, and
:* [[Trinity term]] - from June to July.
With a Christmas, Easter, Whit and Long Vacation between them respectively. The Michaelmas term, and legal year, is opened with a service in [[St. Michan's Church, Dublin]] attended by members of the Bar and Law Society who then adjourn to a breakfast given in the [[King's Inns]].

==United States==

The [[United States Supreme Court]] follows part of the legal year tradition, albeit without the elaborate ceremony. The Court's year-long term commences on the first Monday in October (and is simply called "October Term"), with a [[Red Mass]] the day before.  The court then alternates between "sittings" and "recesses" and goes into final recess at the end of June.

Several [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] states and some federal courts still use the legal year and stated terms of court.  Like the Supreme Court, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] has a single year-long term with designated sittings within that term, although the Second Circuit begins its term in August instead of October (hence the name "August Term").  The U.S. Tax Court divides the year into four season-based terms starting in January.

Connecticut appellate courts divide the legal year into eight terms starting in September.  New York courts divide the year into 13 terms starting in January.  The Georgia Court of Appeals uses a three-term year starting in January.  The [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] divides the year into six terms starting in January.

Many states, like Ohio and Mississippi, do not have a uniform rule for terms of court, so the number of terms varies greatly from one court to the next because every single court sets out terms of court in its local rules.

However, the majority of U.S. states and most federal courts have abandoned the legal year and the related concept of stated terms of court.  Instead, they reverse the presumption.  They merely mandate that the courts are to be open year-round during business hours on every day that is not Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday.  A typical example is Rule 77(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that "The clerk's office ... must be open during business hours every day except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays." Furthermore, {{usc|28|452}} states: "All courts of the United States shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing proper papers, issuing and returning process, and making motions and orders."

==Taiwan==
The start of the legal year for courts in [[Taiwan]] is referred to as '''Judicial Day''' and marked in early January.

==Hong Kong==

[[Hong Kong]]'s legal year is marked as '''Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year''' with an address by the Chief Justice of Hong Kong and begins in January.

==Canada==

Opening of the Courts is marked in September.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontariocourts.ca/coa/en/ps/ocs/ocs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">[[File:NAMA 128 Athena Lenormant 1.JPG|thumb|Front view of the Lenormant Athena]]
The '''Lenormant Athena''' is the name given to a small Greek statuette which was made in the first century AD.
[[File:NAMA 128 Athena Lenormant 2.JPG|thumb|left|Side view, showing the unworked reverse]]
The Lenormant Athena was discovered in 1859 near the [[Pnyx]] hill in [[Athens]] and identified by [[François Lenormant]] a year later as a small copy of the [[Athena Parthenos]] of [[Phidias]]. The 41&amp;nbsp;cm high [[pentelic marble]] sculpture has thus come to be known by his name. The unfinished work is of great art historical significance, since it not only shows us what Phidias' statue looked like, but also the reliefs on her shield and the base on which she stood, which are otherwise only known from literary sources.

Athena stands in a quiet, graceful pose, resting her weight on her right leg. She is dressed in an Attic [[peplos]]. Her left arm rests on her shield. An [[Amazonomachy]] is depicted on the shield. In her right hand, which rests on a strong support, Athena must have held a [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], which has not survived. The unfinished base depicts the birth of [[Pandora]]. The back is still in an unfinishe state as well.

Today the statuette is stored in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]] with the inventory number 128.

'''Magdalina Stancheva''' ({{lang-bg|Магдалина Михайлова Станчева}}, 7 September 1924-6 October 2014) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] archaeologist and [[museologist]], recognized for her dedication in preserving Sofia's past. As one of the first museologists in the country, she influenced and taught many the scientific principals of conservation. She worked with both the [[International Council of Museums]] and [[UNESCO]] to designate national preservation sites and was recognized by many awards for her efforts in conserving the cultural history of the country, including the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the National Order Of Labour, and a citation as an Honorary Citizen of Sofia.

==Early life==
Magdalina Mihailova Stancheva was born on 7 September 1924 in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria. She completed her secondary education at First Girls' High School in Sofia and the enrolled at the [[Sofia University|University of Sofia "St. Kliment Ohridski"]].{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}} During her schooling, she participated in rescue archaeology projects in the city center of Sofia, which was being rebuilt after [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombings]] from [[World War II]]. She graduated in 1948 with a degree in classical [[philology]] and history.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}}

==Career==
In 1951, Stancheva was hired to work in the Sofia Municipal Museum and simultaneously to work on archaeologic projects of the facility. She proposed that the name be changed to the Historical Museum of Sofia, now known as the [[Sofia Central Mineral Baths|Sofia Regional Historical Museum]], in 1952,{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}} and with the name change, she was hired as the senior curator. The following year she was appointed as head of the archaeology department of the museum.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} As one of the first [[Museology|museologists]] in the country, she led the museum's preservation efforts for the excavations of the [[Church of St Petka of the Saddlers]], the rotunda of the [[Church of St. George, Sofia|Church of St. George]], the eastern gate of the {{ill|Serdica Fortress|bg|Сердика (крепост)}} and many others.{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}} She also led excavations and participated in archaeological surveys of Sofia and throughout the country.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}}

From the 1950s through the 1970s, Stancheva led the effort to preserve archaeological sites, through efforts to have them declared as heritage preservation locations.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} Working with the [[International Council of Museums]] and [[UNESCO]], she presented successful candidacies for such projects as the [[Boyana Church]], the [[Rila Monastery]], and the [[Thracian Tomb of Kazanlak]] to receive recognition as cultural monuments to be preserved and protected.{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=7}} Writing articles on the history and archaeology of Sofia, conservation, the conflicts between the need to urbanize and the need to preserve history, Stancheva published over 600 titles in various languages about [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] and [[Thracians|Thracian]] history. She published for the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Bulgarian Historical Society]] in such volumes as ''Announcements of the Archaeological Institute", ''Announcements of the Bulgarian Historical Society'', ''Archeology'' ({{lang-bg|Археология ISSN 0324-1203}}),{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} ''Museums and Monuments of Culture Magazine'' and ''Sofia Magazine'', among others.{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}} 

In the early 1970s, Stancheva was appointed as a Bulgarian delegate to the International Council of Museums of Paris and the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee. She served as vice president on the committee for six years and broadcast cultural programs on both Radio Sofia and Radio UNESCO to provide cultural education.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} She was awarded the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in both grades I and II for her preservation efforts, as well as being honored with the National Order Of Labour, Silver Class for her years of service, among many other awards. In 1985 Stancheva left the museum and active work as an archaeologist{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}} and began working as a voluntary consultant to the legislature and Ministry of Culture on legal protections for cultural heritage. She also taught at [[Sofia University]] as well as at the [[National Academy of Arts]] and the [[New Bulgarian University]],{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} training dozens of museologists from throughout the country.{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}}

Stancheva's position on archaeology was founded in scientific evidence.{{sfn|Todorova|2009|p=47}} She participated in two commissions over the question of whether [[Vasil Levski]]'s grave had been found at St. Petka's and maintained the position that without proof, linking a person or event to a place, undermined the authority of historians and archaeologists.{{sfn|Todorova|2009|p=45}} [[Nikolai Khaitov]], a popular writer,{{sfn|Todorova|2009|p=3}} accused Stancheva of participating in a conspiracy to prevent investigation into  Levski's burial site and accused her publicly of mishandling the remains.{{sfn|Todorova|2009|pp=69, 71}} She flatly denied that there was any attempt to hide the bones and maintained that when the skeleton labeled "No. 95" arrived at the museum, it was sent, as all other bones were, to Petîr Boev at the Archaeological Institute for examination.{{sfn|Todorova|2009|p=69}} As the bones were lost, the commissions held that no substantive identification could be made.{{sfn|Todorova|2009|pp=45, 69}}

In 1990, Stancheva designed a Cultural Heritage program for the New Bulgarian University and taught the courses in the program until 2004. After she retired from teaching, she continued researching and published two books, ''София: От древността до нови времена'' (Sofia: From antiquity to new times, 2009) and ''Мадарският конник'' (Madara Horseman, 2013).{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} She was unanimously designated as an honorary citizen of Sofia for her life's work in 2010.{{sfn|Sofia Municipal Council|2010|p=8}}

==Death and legacy==
Stancheva died on 6 October 2014 in Sofia.{{sfn|''Дневник''|2014}} Her personal papers, including books and documents from international congresses on archaeology and conservation were donated to the New Bulgarian University Library in 1997.{{sfn|New Bulgarian University|2018}} She is known for having popularized preservation in Sofia and for her

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13472">'''The Comprehensive Permit Act'''&lt;ref&gt;See ''Town of Hingham v. Dept. of Housing and Community Development'', 451 Mass. 501, 502 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Massachusetts]] law which allows developers of affordable housing to override certain aspects of municipal zoning bylaws and other requirements. It consists of Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 40B, Sections 20 through 23, along with associated regulations issued and administered by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development.&lt;ref name = "MGL-40B"&gt;Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 40B, §§ 20-23. Originally enacted via the statutes of 1969, chapter 774.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mass-regulations"&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/hed/economic/eohed/dhcd/legal/regs/760-cmr-56.html Code of Massachusetts Regulations  760 CMR 56]&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 40B was enacted in 1969 to address the shortage of affordable housing statewide by reducing barriers created by local municipal building permit approval processes, local zoning, and other restrictions. Its goal is to encourage the production of [[affordable housing]] in all communities throughout the Commonwealth.

For the purposes of this statute, affordable housing is defined as a unit which could be purchased or rented by a household making up to 80% of the [[median]] income of the area.  Such housing must be subject to affordable housing restrictions to preserve affordability in the long term.

== Comprehensive permitting process ==

Under Chapter 40B, in any municipality where less than 10% of its housing qualifies as affordable under the law, a developer can build more densely than the municipal zoning bylaws would permit, allowing more units per acre of land when building a new development, if at least 25% (or 20% in certain cases&lt;ref&gt;If the affordable units are rented or sold so as to be affordable to households with income not exceeding 50% of the area's median income—instead of the normal 80%--only 20% of the units in the development must be affordable.  See, e.g., [http://www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/hac/decisions/needham2.pdf ‘’Webster Street Green, LLC v. Needham,’’ No. 05-20, slip op. at 2 (Mass. Housing Appeals Committee Sep. 18, 2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;) of the new units have long-term affordability restrictions.

Chapter 40B continues to be controversial and it has not overcome the multiple barriers that exist to building affordable housing in the state. A study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition rated Massachusetts as being the least affordable state in which to rent an apartment in 2003.&lt;ref name="NLIHC-Goodman-2004"&gt;

Despite the law, fewer new affordable housing units are built in Massachusetts compared to the state's needs. The state government as a policy works toward increasing the supply of inexpensive housing. The shortage contributes to sprawl as workers move further away from jobs in order obtain affordably priced houses. The high price of housing is one reason that young adults move away from Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Banner-Serghino-2004-02-15"&gt;{{cite web

Municipalities have occasionally attempted to gain "affordable" classification for existing inexpensive housing units which are not deed restricted to maintain the long-term future affordable status of the units.  Some municipalities have requested that [[mobile home]]s be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Impact==
The goal of the Affordable Housing Law (Chapter 40B) is to make at least 10% of every Massachusetts's community's housing stock affordable for moderate income households.  As of June 30, 2011, 39 communities had met that goal.  Details are available on the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) [http://www.mass.gov/hed/docs/dhcd/hd/shi/shiinventory.pdf Subsidized Housing Inventory].  In addition, 101 communities have developed [http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/40b-plan/housing-production-plan.html Affordable Housing Production Plans] that have been approved by DHCD.  Six of those communities have been certified as meeting the benchmarks in their plans, which entitles them to "safe-harbor" protections from Chapter 40B proposals under 760 CMR 56.03()(b) and 56.03(4)(f).

Over the last decade, the Affordable Housing Law has been directly responsible for approximately 80% of the affordable housing built in Massachusetts outside the major cities. More than 58,000 homes have been created for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities all across the state because of this law. Nearly half of all of the units were created by non-profits, like Habitat for Humanity.&lt;ref name="protectaffordablehousing.org"&gt;http://www.protectaffordablehousing.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
The Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General, from 2005 to 2012, issued several reports criticizing lax enforcement of developers' profit limitations for 40B developments, and described subterfuges used by developers to earn more profit on affordable housing than the statute and regulations permit, and that the municipalities and the state have inadequate supervision, auditing, and enforcement of the municipal agreements with developers and developers' reporting of sales and profits under the agreements and law.

In addition, until he left office in 2012, Massachusetts Inspector General Gregory Sullivan frequently criticized Chapter 40B.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repeal40b.com The Coalition to Repeal 40B] (opinionated ''contra'' Chapter 40B)&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Housing and Community Development has "taken constructive actions to address the identified weaknesses that will strengthen the overall control process exercised by both Chapter 40B rental development owners and project administrators to ensure that only income-qualified households occupy affordable apartments developed under Chapter 40B." &lt;ref name = "IG Ann Rpt"&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/ig/about-us/annual-reports/annrpt2012.pdf Office of the Inspector General, 2012 Annual Report  (April 2013), p. 10] also see [http://www.mass.gov/ig/publications/reports-and-recommendations/chapter-40b-publications/ Office of the Inspector General, 40B Publications].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes in the law, 2008: SJC decisions and revised regulations==
In 2008 the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development issued a comprehensive revision of regulations and guidelines for Chapter 40B. In the same year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court issued seven decisions on  substantive and procedural issues in regard to Chapter 40B law, nearly the number of decisions rendered during the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Suffolk Law School-40B-2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
Historically and at present, there has been opposition to Chapter 40B, with some claiming that it encourages building unaffordable homes at high densities with few affordable units. The law is criticized heavily that it gives real-estate developers tremendous abilities to abuse the law and overthrow any municipal rights by building minimum amounts of low-income housing while turning large profits on many high end properties.

==Campaign to Protect the Affordable Housing Law==
On November 2, 2010, Massachusetts voters rejected an initiative petition (Question 2) that would have repealed Chapter 40B.  The vote was 1,254,759 (58%) against repeal to 900,405 (42%) in favor of repeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elepdf/rov10.pdf Mass. Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.protectaffordablehousing.org Campaign to Protect the Affordable Housing Law], a state ballot committee, had been formed to oppose the elimination of the law.  The campaign was a coalition of more than 950 individuals and organizations, including civic, business, religious, and academic leaders as well as senior, environmental, housing, and civil rights groups.  The campaign was supported by all three gubernatorial candidates, Deval Patrick, Tim Cahill, and Charlie Baker.  The group contended that repealing the affordable housing law would immediately halt the creation of housing that is affordable to seniors and working families in many communities across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="protectaffordablehousing.org"/&gt;

[[File:Wallace Reid in Picture-Play Magazine.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Wallace Reid]] is an example of a matinée idol. The original caption of this image from ''Picture-Play Magazine'' reads: "The only reason why they don’t let Wally play in dress-suit rôles all the time is that the casualties among the ladies would soon empty the picture houses. In fact, we feel that we’re toying with the fan hearts even to print this picture."&lt;ref&gt;(1918).

'''Matinée idol''' is a term used mainly to describe [[film]] or [[theatre]] [[movie star|stars]] who are adored to the point of [[adulation]] by their [[Fan (person)|fans]]. The term almost exclusively refers to adult male actors.

Matinée idols often tend to play [[Romance film|romantic]] and [[Drama film|dramatic]] [[Leading actor|leading]] or [[Supporting actor|secondary leading]] roles and are usually known for having good looks. The term can be taken as faintly pejorative in that it suggests the star's popularity came from the afternoon [[wikt:matinée|matinée]] performances rather than the "big picture" evenings and, hence, a less discriminating audience. Matinée idols often become the subject of [[parody]] during the height of their popularity, an example being [[Stan Laurel]] spoofing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in his film ''[[Mud and Sand]]''.

Now a somewhat old-fashioned term, the phenomenon reached its height from the 1920s to around the 1960s in Hollywood. "[[Teen idol]]" is a similar term, which more often refers to youthful musicians rather than film actors. The term differs from "[[sex symbol]]", which refers to a star's sexual attractiveness in and outside of film more so than their romantic performances on the screen. A sex symbol, however, may also be a matinée idol.

==Famous matinée idols==
[[File:Richard Barthelmess - Mar 1922 Silverscreen.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Photoplay]]'' named [[Richard Barthelmess]] the "idol of every girl in America" in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Barthelmess1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Shadow Stage |url=https://archive.org/stream/phojun22chic#page/n197/mode/2up |journal=[[Photoplay]] |location=New York |publisher=Photoplay Publishing Company |date=February 1922 |access-date=September 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer wrote that "his wonderful black hair and soulful eyes are enough to make any young girl adore him" in 1921.&lt;ref name="Barthelmess2"&gt;G.

===1910s–1920s===
Matinée idols during this time were commonly referred to simply as "lovers". "Latin Lovers", or actors who specialized in characters of Latin American or Romance European descent, became popular in the 1920s after Rudolph Valentino's famous performance as Julio Desnoyers in ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921 film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]''. Other Latin Lovers include [[Ramon Novarro]], [[Antonio Moreno]], and [[Ricardo Cortez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Plot of Today |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturemag27brew#page/n153/mode/2up |journal=Motion Picture Magazine |location=New York |publisher=Brewster Publications |date=March 1924 |access-date=September 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mordkhe Veynger''' (1890–1929) was a Soviet-Jewish linguist.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Veynger_Mordkhe Jews in Eastern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Poltava]], Ukraine, he moved to Warsaw. He studied Germanic philology at the [[University of Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

After World War I he established at Minsk where he became lecturer at the [[Belarusian State University]].&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

He began the first [[Yiddish]] dialect atlas in the 1920s. The atlas is limited to phonology and to Yiddish spoken within the territory of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Neil. ''Yiddish: A Linguistic Introduction''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

MHA was founded in December 1965 at the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) meeting in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] under the leadership of [[Latter-day Saint]] and [[list of historians|historian]], [[Leonard J. Arrington]]. In 1972, MHA became an independent organization with its own annual conferences and publications. ''The Journal of Mormon History'', the official biennial publication of the association, began publication in 1974.

'''Mr. Irrelevant''' is the title bestowed each year upon the last pick of the annual [[National Football League Draft|National Football League draft]]. Although the NFL Draft dates back to 1936, the first person to officially be given the "Mr. Irrelevant" title was [[Kelvin Kirk]], pick number 487 of the [[1976 NFL Draft|1976 draft]]. The current Mr. Irrelevant is [[Trey Quinn]], former wide receiver for the [[SMU Mustangs football]] team, who was picked 256th by the [[Washington Redskins]] in the [[2018 NFL Draft|2018 draft]].

==History==
"Mr. Irrelevant" and "Irrelevant Week" arose in 1976, when former [[USC Trojans Football|Southern California]] and NFL receiver [[Paul Salata]] founded the event in [[Newport Beach, California]]. He continued to announce the final pick of the NFL draft until 2013; from 2014 his daughter took over in announcing the pick. During the summer after the draft, the new Mr. Irrelevant and his family are invited to spend a week in Newport Beach where they enjoy a golf tournament, a [[regatta]], a [[roast (comedy)|roast]] giving advice to the new draftee, and a ceremony awarding him the '''Lowsman Trophy'''. The trophy mimics the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]], but depicts a player [[Fumble|fumbling]] a football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/21474/irrelevant-week-is-pretty-well-relevant|title=Irrelevant Week is pretty, well, relevant|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Irrelevant Week" gave so much publicity to "Mr. Irrelevant" that in [[1979 NFL Draft|1979]] the [[Los Angeles Rams]], with the penultimate pick, intentionally passed to let the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], with the last pick, choose first. The Steelers also wanted the publicity and passed as well. The two teams continued to refuse to choose a player until [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] forced the teams to pick. The incident led to the "Salata Rule", which prohibits teams from passing to get the final pick.&lt;ref name="merron20050418"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/050418/draftdays&amp;num=0 | title=The strangest NFL draft moments | publisher=ESPN | date=April 18, 2005 | accessdate=December 18, 2014 | author=Merron, Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable "winners"==
Since the NFL draft was cut to its current seven-round format in 1994, players  presented with this dubious honor have more often succeeded in making the team that drafted them, with some making significant contributions on the field.
*[[Special teams]] player [[Marty Moore]] became the first Mr. Irrelevant to play in a [[Super Bowl]], with the [[New England Patriots]] in [[Super Bowl XXXI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nesn.com/2010/03/mr-irrelevant-marty-moore-a-major-success-story-for-patriots/|title=‘Mr. Irrelevant’ Marty Moore a Major Success Story for Patriots|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mike Green (defensive back)|Mike Green]] played a significant role in the [[Chicago Bears]] secondary in the 2000s, and played from 2000 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/national/2013/04/nfl_draft_2013_top_5_mr_irrele.html|title=NFL Draft 2013: Top 5 most relevant Mr. Irrelevant selections of all time|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jim Finn]] was on the roster as a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] for the [[New York Giants]] on their victory in [[Super Bowl XLII]].  Prior to the 2007 season, Finn was placed on injured reserve, and never played a game for the Giants on their road to the Super Bowl that year, having been replaced by [[Madison Hedgecock]].  Prior to 2007, he had been the Giants fullback for four seasons.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/where-are-they-now-catching-up-with-20-different-mr-irrelevant-draft-picks|title=20 NFL draft Mr. Irrelevants who worked their way to (some sort of) relevance|date=April 29, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[2008 NFL Draft|2008 winner]] [[David Vobora]] was a starting [[linebacker]] for the [[St. Louis Rams]] during the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]].&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;
*[[2009 NFL Draft|2009 winner]] [[Ryan Succop]] became the starting [[place kicker|kicker]] for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He went on to tie the NFL record for highest field goal percentage by a rookie in a season with 86.2%, and also passed NFL Hall of Famer [[Jan Stenerud]] for most field goals made by a rookie in Chiefs history. Succop was awarded the [[Kansas City Chiefs awards#Mack Lee Hill Award|Mack Lee Hill Award]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kcchiefs.com/news/2010/01/05/rb_jamaal_charles_voted_derrick_thomas_award_winner_k_ryan_succop_wins_mack_lee_hill_award/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113032704/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2010/01/05/rb_jamaal_charles_voted_derrick_thomas_award_winner_k_ryan_succop_wins_mack_lee_hill_award/ |archivedate=January 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; He has been a starting kicker since his rookie season making 81.5% of his field goals and a perfect 100% on extra points. Succop moved on to the [[Tennessee Titans]] for the 2014 season and was signed to a contract extension in early 2018.
*[[2017 NFL Draft|2017 winner]] [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] Quarterback [[Chad Kelly]] is the nephew of former [[Buffalo Bills]] quarterback, and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jim Kelly]]. Drafted last largely because injury and discipline questions had lowered his previously high draft stock, Kelly progressed to become the [[Denver Broncos]]' second-string quarterback by the 2018 preseason before being released October 24, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000930840/article/john-elway-broncos-not-giving-up-on-paxton-lynch | title=John Elway: Broncos not giving up on Paxton Lynch | website=nfl.com | date=May 1, 2018 | accessdate=May 2, 2018 | author=Wesseling, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One "Mr. Irrelevant" (who actually predated the award by nearly a decade) went on to a productive professional career in another sport. [[Jimmy Walker (basketball, born 1944)|Jimmy Walker]] was the final pick in [[1967 NFL Draft|1967]] despite never having played college football. His main sport, however, was [[basketball]], in which he was a consensus All-American and the nation's leading scorer as a senior at [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence College]]. Walker was the first pick in the [[1967 NBA Draft]], and opted for a career in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/mens_basketball/articles/2007/07/03/providence_hoops_legend_jimmy_walker_dies_at_63/?p1=MEWell_Pos4 |title=Providence hoops legend Jimmy Walker dies at 63 |first=Peter |last=May |publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]'' |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik
|title=Pink Ribbon Blues: How Breast Cancer Culture Undermines Women's Health

|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P.

Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6718">'''Old Comedy''' (''archaia'') is the first period of the [[ancient Greek comedy]], according to the canonical division by the [[Alexandrian grammarians]].&lt;ref name="Mastromarco94"&gt;Mastromarco (1994) p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Old Comic playwright is [[Aristophanes]] – whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. 

==Origins and history==
The origins of the Old Comedy were traced by [[Aristotle]] to the [[komos]] or celebratory festival processions of ancient Greece, and the phallic songs that accompanied them.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xvii and p. x&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earliest Athenian comedy, from the 480s to 440s BC, is almost entirely lost, it is clear that comedy had already crystallised into a highly structured form, with the chorus playing a central role.&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. xxx-i&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important poets of the period were [[Magnes (comic poet)|Magnes]], whose work survives only in a few fragments of dubious authenticity, and [[Cratinus]], who took the prize at the [[City Dionysia]] probably sometime around 450 BC. Although no complete plays by Cratinus are preserved, they are known through hundreds of fragments: he was noted in antiquity both for a mastery of plot and for the obscene vehemence of his attacks on [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;J Boardman ed., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1986) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristophanes and his contemporaries==

Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Clouds]]'', and in his racy anti-war farce ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were [[Hermippus]] and [[Eupolis]]. Classical literary criticism placed Aristophanes somewhere between the harshness of Cratinus and the smoothness of Eupolis.&lt;ref&gt;H Nettleship, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Old Comedy writers worked within a highly structured format – [[parados]], [[agon]], and [[parabasis]] – which paradoxically offered maximum scope for improvisatory flights of fancy.&lt;ref&gt;I Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Song, dance, costume, and chorus all played important roles, as did the [[parody]] of the ‘senior’ drama, [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;S H Butcher, ''Harvard Lectures on Greek Subjects'' (London 1904) p. 175 and p. 181-4&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly due to the influence of tragedy was the important role of a heroic figure in Aristophanic comedy: as [[Northrop Frye]] put it, “In Aristophanes there is usually a central figure who constructs his (or her) own society in the teeth of strong opposition”.&lt;ref&gt;N Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; The diminished role of the protagonist (and chorus) in his latest works marks a point of transition to the [[Middle comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later influence/parallels==
*[[Horace]] claimed a formative role for the Old Comedy in the making of [[Roman satirists|Roman satire]].&lt;ref&gt;A Palmer ed., ''The Satires of Horace'' (London 1920) p. 18 and p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Old Comedy subsequently influenced later European writers such as [[Ben Jonson]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], and [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;S Halliwell, ''Aristophanes: Birds and other plays'' (Oxford 1998) p. lx&lt;/ref&gt; Also,[[François Rabelais]],  [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Jonathan Swift]], and [[Voltaire]] may have derived elements from it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Western writers took particular inspiration from Aristophanes' disguising of political attacks as buffoonery. Old Comedy displays similarities to modern-day political satires such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) and the televised buffoonery of [[Monty Python]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="Lerer"&gt;Seth Lerer, ''Comedy through the Ages'' (recorded lecture series), Springfield, Virginia: The Teaching Company, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Neurath''' ({{IPA-de|ˈnɔʏʀaːt|lang}}; 10 December 1882 – 22 December 1945) was an [[Austria]]n [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political economy|political economist]]. Before he fled his native country in 1934, Neurath was one of the leading figures of the [[Vienna Circle]].

==Early life==
Neurath was born in [[Vienna]], the son of [[Wilhelm Neurath]] (1840–1901), a well-known political economist at the time. [[Helene Migerka]] was his cousin.&lt;ref name=Memories&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neurath|first1=edited by Marie|last2=Cohen|first2=Robert S.|title=Empiricism and sociology : the life and work of Otto Neurath.|date=1973|publisher=Reidel|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-9027702593|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied mathematics in Vienna and gained his [[Ph.D.]] in the department of [[Political Science]] and [[Statistics]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]].

He married Anna Schapire in 1907, who died in 1911 while bearing their son, Paul, and then married a close friend, the mathematician and philosopher [[Olga Hahn-Neurath|Olga Hahn]]. Perhaps because of his first wife's blindness and then because of the outbreak of war, Paul was sent to a children's home outside Vienna, where Neurath's mother lived, and returned to live with both of his parents when he was nine years old.

==Career in Vienna==
Neurath taught political economy at the ''[[Vienna Business School|Neue Wiener Handelsakademie]]'' (New College of Commerce, Vienna) until war broke out. Subsequently, he directed the Department of War Economy in the War Ministry. In 1917 or 1918, he became director of the ''Deutsches Kriegswirtschaftsmuseum'' (German Museum of War Economy, later the ''Deutsches Wirtschaftsmuseum'') at Leipzig. Here  he worked with [[Wolfgang Schumann (1887-1964)|Wolfgang Schumann]], known from the [[Dürerbund]] for which Neurath had written many articles. During the [[German Revolution|political crisis]] which led to the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Schumann urged him to work out a plan for socialization in Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;"Otto Neurath: Empiricism and Sociology". edited by [[Marie Neurath]] and [[Robert S. Cohen]]. Dordrecht-Holland/Boston-USA: [[D. Reidel Publishing Company]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Schumann and [[Hermann Kranold]] developed the '' Programm Kranold-Neurath-Schumann''. Neurath then joined the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] in 1918-19 and ran an office for central economic planning in [[Munich]]. When the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was defeated, Neurath was imprisoned but returned to Austria after intervention from the Austrian government. While in prison he wrote "Anti-Spengler", a critical attack on [[Oswald Spengler]]'s "[[The Decline of the West|Decline of the West]]".

In [[Red Vienna]], he joined the Social Democrats and became secretary of the [[Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens]] (''Verband für Siedlungs-und Kleingartenwesen''), a collection of self-help groups that set out to provide housing and garden plots to its members. In 1923, he founded a new museum for housing and city planning called ''Siedlungsmuseum''. In 1925 he renamed it ''[[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] in Wien'' (Museum of Society and Economy in Vienna)&lt;ref&gt;The actual museum's website: http://www.wirtschaftsmuseum.at/wminorg.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and founded an own association for it, in which the Vienna city administration, the trade unions, the Chamber of Workers and the Bank of Workers became members, then mayor [[Karl Seitz]] having acted as first proponent of the association. [[Julius Tandler]], city councillor for welfare and health, served at the first board of the museum together with other prominent social democratic politicians. The museum was provided with exhibition rooms at buildings of the city administration, the most prominent being the People's Hall at the [[Rathaus, Vienna|Vienna City Hall]]. To make the museum understandable for everybody, Neurath worked on [[graphic design]] and visual education. In the late 1920s, graphic designer and communications theorist [[Rudolf Modley]] served as an assistant to Neurath, contributing to a new means of communication: a visual "language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bresnahan|first=Keith|year=2011|title="An Unused Esperanto": Internationalism and Pictographic Design, 1930-70|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the illustrator [[Gerd Arntz]] and with [[Marie Neurath|Marie Reidemeister]] (who he would marry in 1941), Neurath created [[Isotype (pictograms)|Isotype]], a symbolic way of representing quantitative information via easily interpretable icons. At international conventions of city planners, Neurath presented and promoted his communication tools.

In the 1920s, Neurath also became an ardent [[logical positivism|logical positivist]], and was the main author of the [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto. He was the driving force behind the [[Unified Science|Unity of Science]] movement and the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]''. During the 1930s, he also began promoting Isotype as an International Picture Language, connecting it both with the adult education movement and with the Internationalist passion for new and artificial languages, although he stressed in talks and correspondence that Isotype was not intended to be a stand-alone language, and was limited in what it could communicate.

==Exile==
===Netherlands===
During the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934, Neurath had been working in Moscow. Anticipating problems, he had asked to get a coded message in case it would be dangerous for him to return to Austria. As Marie Reidemeister reported later, after receiving the telegram "[[Carnap]] is waiting for you," Neurath chose to travel to [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]], instead of Vienna, to be able to continue his international work. He was joined by Arntz after affairs in Vienna had been sorted out as best they could. His wife also fled to the Netherlands, where she died in 1937.

===British Isles===
After the [[Luftwaffe]] had [[Rotterdam Blitz|bombed Rotterdam]], he and Marie Reidemeister fled to England, crossing the [[English Channel|Channel]] with other refugees in an open boat. He and Reidemeister married in 1941 after a period of being interned on the [[Isle of Man]] (Neurath was in [[Onchan]] Camp). In England, he and his wife set up the [[Isotype Institute]] in [[Oxford]] and he was asked to advise on, and design Isotype charts for, the intended redevelopment of the slums of [[Bilston]], near [[Wolverhampton]].

Neurath died, suddenly and unexpectedly, in December 1945. After his death, [[Marie Neurath]] continued the work of the Isotype Institute, publishing Neurath's writings posthumously, completing projects he had started and writing many children's books using the Isotype system, until her death in the 1980s.

==Work==
[[File:Isotype-neurath.jpg|thumb|[[Isotype (picture language)|Isotype]] picture language by Neurath.]]
Most work by and about Neurath is still available only in German. However he also wrote in English, using Ogden's [[Basic English]]. His scientific papers are held at the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem; the Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection is held in the Department of Typography &amp; Graphic Communication at the [[University of Reading]] in England.

===Philosophy of science and language===
Neurath's work on protocol sentences tried to reconcile an [[Empiricism|empiricist]] concern for the grounding of knowledge in experience with the essential publicity of science. Neurath suggested that reports of experience should be understood to have a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] and hence public and impersonal character, rather than as being first person subjective pronouncements.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] took issue with Neurath's account of protocol sentences in his book ''An Inquiry Into Meaning and Truth'' (p.&amp;nbsp;139ff), on the grounds that it severed the connection to experience that is essential to an empiricist account of truth, facts and knowledge.

One of Neurath's later and most important{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} works, ''Physicalism'', completely transformed the nature of the logical positivist discussion of the program of unifying the sciences. Neurath delineates and explains his points of agreement with the general principles of the positivist program and its conceptual bases:
* the construction of a universal system which would comprehend all of the knowledge furnished by the various sciences, and
* the absolute rejection of [[metaphysics]], in the sense of any propositions not translatable into verifiable scientific sentences.
He then rejects the positivist treatment of language in general and, in particular, some of [[Wittgenstein]]'s early fundamental ideas.

First, Neurath rejects isomorphism between language and reality as useless metaphysical speculation, which would call for explaining how words and sentences could represent things in the external world. Instead, Neurath proposed that language and reality coincide—that reality consists in simply the totality of previously verified sentences in the language, and "truth" of a sentence is about its relationship to the totality of already verified sentences. If a sentence fails to "concord" (or cohere) with the totality of already verified sentences, then either it should be considered false, or some of that totality's propositions must be modified somehow. He thus views truth as internal [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]] of linguistic assertions, rather than anything to do with facts or other entities in the world. Moreover, the criterion of verification is to be applied to the system as a whole (see [[semantic holism]]) and not to single sentences. Such ideas profoundly shaped the ''holistic [[verificationism]]'' of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. Quine's book ''[[Word and Object]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;3f) made famous Neurath's analogy which compares the holistic nature of language and consequently scientific verification with the construction of a boat which is already at sea:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]] discusses this metaphor in context of [[memes]] and [[memeplexes]] and refers to this metaphor as a "[[Neurathian bootstrap]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurath also rejected the notion that science should be reconstructed in terms of sense data, because perceptual experiences are too subjective to constitute a valid foundation for the formal reconstruction of science. Thus, the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] language that most positivists were still emphasizing was to be replaced by the language of mathematical physics. This would allow for the required objective formulations because it is based on spatio-temporal coordinates. Such a ''physicalistic'' approach to the sciences would facilitate the elimination of every residual element of metaphysics because it would permit them to be reduced to a system of assertions relative to physical facts.

"Finally, Neurath suggested that since language itself is a physical system, because it is made up of an ordered succession of sounds or symbols, it is capable of describing its own structure without contradiction."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

These ideas helped form the foundation of the sort of [[physicalism]] which remains the dominant position{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} in metaphysics and especially the [[philosophy of mind]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Economics===
In economics, Neurath was notable for his advocacy of ideas like "[[Calculation in kind|in-kind]]" economic accounting in place of monetary accounting. In the 1920s, he also advocated ''Vollsozialisierung'', that is "complete" rather than merely partial "[[Socialization (economics)|socialization]]".&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, "Socialist Calculation and Environmental Valuation: Money, Markets and Ecology," Science &amp; Society, LXVI/1 (Spring 2002); Joan Martinez-Alier and Klaus Schlupmann, Ecological Economics: Energy, Environment,and Society (1987), 212-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he advocated changes to the economic system that were more radical than those of the mainstream Social-Democratic parties of Germany and Austria. In the 1920s, Neurath debated these matters with leading Social Democratic theoreticians (such as [[Karl Kautsky]], who insisted that money is necessary in a socialist economy). While serving as a government economist during the war, Neurath had observed that "As a result of the war, in-kind calculus was applied more often and more systematically than before.... war was fought with ammunition and with the supply of food, not with money" i.e. that goods were [[Commensurability (economics)|incommensurable]]. This convinced Neurath of the feasibility of economic planning in terms of amounts of goods and services, without use of money.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Chaloupek, "Otto Neurath's Concepts of Socialization and Economic Calculation and his Socialist Critics"(2006), at www.chaloupek.eu/work/NeurathFin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Neurath, ed. T. Uebel and R. S. Cohen, Economic Writings (2004), 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these ideas, [[Ludwig von Mises]] wrote his famous essay of 1920, "Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/econcalc.asp |title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth by Ludwig von Mises |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radicalphilosophy.com/article/in-partial-praise-of-a-positivist|author=John O'Neill| |title=In partial praise of a positivist: The work of Otto Neurath|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=Nov-Dec 1995|accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


For Neurath, war economies showed advantages in speed of decision and execution, optimal distribution of means relative to (military) goals, and no-nonsense evaluation and utilization of inventiveness. Two disadvantages which he perceived as resulting from centralized decision-making were a reduction in productivity and a loss of the benefits of simple economic exchanges; but he thought that the reduction in productivity could be mitigated by means of "scientific" techniques based on analysis of work-flows etc. as advocated by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Neurath believed that socio-economic theory and scientific methods could be applied together in contemporary practice.

Neurath's view on socioeconomic development was similar to the [[materialist conception of history]] first elaborated in classical [[Marxism]], in which technology and the state of epistemology come into conflict with social organization. In particular, Neurath, influenced also by [[James George Frazer]], associated the rise of scientific thinking and empiricism / positivism with the rise of socialism, both of which were coming into conflict with older modes of epistemology such as theology (which was allied with [[idealist]] philosophy), the latter of which served reactionary purposes. However, Neurath followed Frazer in claiming that primitive magic closely resembled modern technology, implying an [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 225-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurath claimed that magic was [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[disenchantment]] could never be complete in a scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the scientific view of the world recognize no authority other than science and reject all forms of metaphysics. Under the socialist phase of history, Neurath predicted that the scientific worldview would become the dominant mode of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/9325/1/auslegung.v16.n02.175-189.pdf |title= Otto Neurath: Marxist member of the Vienna Circle |last1= Jacobs|first1= Straun|last2= Otto |first2= Karl-Heinz |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate= September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Clastres''' ({{IPA-fr|klastʁ|lang}}; 17 May 1934 – 29 July 1977) was a French [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnology|ethnologist]]. He is best known for his contributions to the field of [[political anthropology]], with his [[fieldwork]] among the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] in [[Paraguay]] and his theory of stateless societies. Seeking an alternative to the hierarchized Western societies, he mostly researched indigenous people in which the power was not considered coercive and chiefs were powerless.

With a background in [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], Clastres started studying anthropology with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Alfred Métraux]] since the 1950s. Between 1963 and 1974 he traveled five times to South America to do fieldwork among the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]], the [[Chulupi]], and the [[Yanomami]]. Clastres mostly published essays and, because of his premature death, his work was unfinished and scattered. His signature work is the essay collection ''[[Society Against the State]]'' (1974) and his bibliography also includes ''Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians'' (1972), ''Le Grand Parler'' (1974), and ''Archeology of Violence'' (1980).

==Life and career==
Clastres was born on 17 May 1934, in Paris, France.{{sfn|BnF}} He studied at [[University of Sorbonne]],{{sfn|Dykes|2005|p=122}} obtaining a [[license#Academia|licence]] in [[Literature]] in 1957,{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310}}{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=44}} and a ''[[Diplôme d'études supérieures spécialisées]]'' in [[Philosophy]] the following year.{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310}} He began working in [[Anthropology]] after 1956{{sfn|Plot|2013|p=51}} as student a of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], working at the Laboratory of Social Anthropology of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Centre for Scientific Research]] during the 1960s.{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310}}{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=61}} He was also a student of [[Alfred Métraux]] at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (EPHE) in 1959.{{sfn|Monnier|2003|p=22}}

Clastres's first published article was released in 1962,{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=58}} a year before Clastres went into an eight-month trip to a [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] community in Paraguay with the help of Métraux.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=61}} The Guayaki's study served as base to an article for ''[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]'',{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}} to his 1965 doctoral [[thesis]] in [[ethnology]]—''Social Life of a Nomadic Tribe: The Guayaki Indians of Paraguay''{{efn|The title used is the translation by Bowman in ''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists''. Its original title is ''La vie social d'une tribu nomade: les Indiens Guayaki du Paraguay''.{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310}}}}—,{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310}}{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=44}} to "The Bow and the Basket", as well as to his first book, ''Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians'' (1972).{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}}

{{double image|right|Alfred Métraux.jpg|150|Levi-Strauss and Tacou.jpg|145|Clastres was student of the anthropologists [[Alfred Métraux]] (''left'') and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], whose ideas influenced him.}}

In 1965 Clastres returned to Paraguay and he met the [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]]—this rencontre led him to write ''Le Grand Parler'' (1974).{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}} In 1966 and 1968 Clastres went into expeditions to Paraguayan groups of [[Chulupi]] people in the [[Gran Chaco]] region.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}} This experience was used to produce the essays "What Makes Indians Laugh" and "Sorrows of the Savage Warrior."{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}} In his fourth travel Clastres observed the Venezuelan [[Yanomami]] from 1970 to 1971 and wrote "The Last Frontier".{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=53}} He briefly visited the Guaraní which migrated from Paraguay to Brazil in his last mission in 1974.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=53}}

In 1971 he became [[lecturer]] at the fifth section of the EPHE, and was promoted to director of studies of the religion and societies of South American Indians in October 1975.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=44}} That same year he left his office as researcher of the Laboratory of Social Anthropology—which he occupied since 1961—after conflicts over Lévi-Strauss's theories.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=44}}{{sfn|Glowczewski|2008|p=87}} In 1977 he took in part in the establishment of the journal ''Libre'' alongside the former members of [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]] [[Miguel Abensour]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Marcel Gauchet]], [[Claude Lefort]] and [[Maurice Luciani]].{{sfn|Delacampagne|1997|p=103}} Later that year, Clastres, aged 43, died in [[Gabriac, Lozère]], on 29 July, in a car accident.{{sfn|BnF}}{{sfn|Delacampagne|1997|p=103}}

==Works==

===''Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians''===
Clastres's first book was originally published in France by [[Plon (publisher)|Plon]] in 1972 under the title ''Chronique des indiens Guayaki: ce que que savent les Aché, chasseurs nomades du Paraguay'' (''Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians: The Knowledge of the Aché Hunter Nomads of Paraguay'').{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=310–311}} He was interested on Guayaki because there were a few researches on them since [[Alfredo Stroessner]]'s dictatorship forced them to live under territorial restriction and launched a pacifying campaign between 1959 and 1962.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=61}}{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=9}} In the book, the author describes Guayaki culture with a focus on their cycle of life and their "daily struggles for survival."{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=9}} He describes their [[mores]] on [[rite of passage|rites of passage]], marriage, hunting, warfare, and death,{{sfn|Geertz|1998|p=69}} as well as their relation with non-Indian people and nature.{{sfn|Wallace|1998|p=1}} In 1976 [[Paul Auster]], then a "penniless unknown", translated the book into English but it was only published in 1998 by Zone Books.{{sfn|Geertz|1998|p=69}}{{sfn|Wallace|1998|p=1}} Auster translated the work because he was fascinated by Clastres's prose, which "seemed to combine a poet's temperament with a philosopher's depth of mind."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=61}}

[[File:Paul Auster Brooklyn 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians''{{'}}s literary qualities attracted novelist [[Paul Auster]]; critics, however, qualified it as a "[[romanticism|romantic]]" work.]]

Although its literary qualities have been what attracted Auster,{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=61}} the work has been criticized as "[[romanticism|romantic]]".{{sfn|Geertz|1998|p=69}}{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=10}} Anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] said Clastres had a "[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau#Theory of Natural Human|Rousseauian primitivism]], the view that 'savages' are radically different from us, more authentic than us, morally superior to us, and need only to be protected, presumably by us, from our greed and cruelty."{{sfn|Geertz|1998|p=69}} Bartholomew Dean, writing for the journal ''[[Anthropology Today]]'', declared, "Clastres' ahistoricism, rhetorical romanticism, and museumifaction sadly obscures the ongoing challenges facing indigenous peoples like the Guayaki."{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=10}}

In opposition to Geertz and Dean, [[David Rains Wallace]] said it was an "unsettling" work because it "is not quite the nostalgic view of primitive life that now prevails in literary circles."{{sfn|Wallace|1998|p=1}} Wallace asserted Clastres's "might have misinterpreted" the Guayaki's relation with nature because "he was predisposed to see stronger oppositions between culture and nature" as a [[Structuralism|Structuralist]]. However, he wrote "Whatever the validity ... of Clastres' interpretation of Guayaki thought, his evocation of their lost lives has great charm, an attraction that arises automatically from our civilized fascination with wild people who seem so strange at first, dodging naked through the forest, but who prove to be so much like us in feelings if not in thought and habits."{{sfn|Wallace|1998|p=2}}

In ''Anthropology Today'', Jon Abbink explained the historical context in which Clastres wrote the book and argued, "in presenting them as 'indigenes' with specific cultural values and identity, he has also tried to ground their presence and their historical rights".{{sfn|Abbink|1999}} Abbink also refused the idea it had not a critical perspective; Clastres's focus on the problems Western society could bring to the Guayaki is against "the arrogant idea ... that they should be reformed in our image and respond to our models of social and economic life".{{sfn|Abbink|1999}}

===''Society Against the State''===
{{main|Society Against the State}}
Considered his major work{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}}{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=311}} for introducing the concept of "Society against the State",{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=10}} ''La Société contre l'État. Recherches d'anthropologie politique'' was first published by [[Les Éditions de Minuit]] in 1974.{{sfn|Plot|2013|p=67}} When it was first translated by Urizen Books in 1977 as ''Society Against the State: The Leader as Servant and the Human Uses of Power Among the Indians of the Americas'', however, it did not received major attention.{{sfn|Geertz|1998|p=72}} In 1989, Zone Books republished it as ''Society Against the State: Essays in Political Anthropology''.{{sfn|Clastres|1989}} It is a collection of eleven essays: "Copernicus and the Savages", "Exchange and Power: Philosophy of the Indian Chieftainship", "Independence and Exogamy", "Elements of Amerindian Demography", "The Bow and the Basket", "What Makes Indians Laugh", "The Duty to Speak", "Prophets in the Jungle", "Of the One Without the Many", "Of Torture in Primitive Societies", and the title article "Society Against the State".{{sfn|Clastres|1989|loc="Contents"}}

"Exchange and Power" was originally published in the journal ''[[L'Homme]]'' in 1962.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=58}} In the same journal were published "Independence and Exogamy" in 1963,{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=44}} "The Bow and the Basket" in 1966,{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=90}} "Elements of Amerindian Demography" and "Of Torture in Primitive Societies" in 1973.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}}{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=67}} "What Makes Indians Laugh" was originally published in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' in 1967,{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}} and "Copernicus and the Savages" was published in ''[[Critique (magazine)|Critique]]'' in 1969.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} "Prophets in the Jungle" and "Of the One Without the Many" were both published in ''[[L'Éphémère]]'' in 1969 and 1972 respectively.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} In 1973, "The Duty to Speak" was released on ''[[Nouvelle Revue de Psychanalyse]]''.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}}

===''Le Grand Parler''===
In France, ''Le Grand Parler. Mythes et chants sacrés des Indiens Guaraní'' was published by [[Éditions du Seuil]] in 1974.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} The book was never officially translated into English; Moyn calls it ''The Great Speech: Myths and Sacred Chants of the Guarani Indians'',{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}} while ''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists'' referred to it as ''The Oral Treasury: Myths and Sacred Song of the Guarani Indians''.{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=311}} Clastres had the help of Paraguayan ethnologist [[León Cadogan]] to come in contact with the Guaraní and to translate his ethnographic material.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}} In the book, the focus was towards the "beautiful words" in the [[paean]]s they used to worship their gods.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}}

===''Archeology of Violence''===
''Recherches d'anthropologie politique'', posthumously published in France by Éditions du Seuil in 1980, was first translated into English by [[Semiotext(e)]] in 1994 as ''Archeology of Violence''.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}}{{sfn|Clastres|2010}} The book collects the chapters of a work Clastres started writing before his death—the two last chapters of ''Archeology of Violence''{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=326}}—and Clastres's last essays.{{sfn|MIT Press}} Ranging from articles about [[ethnocide]] and [[shamanism]] to "primitive" power, economy and war,{{sfn|MIT Press}} it is composed by twelve essays: "The Last Frontier", "Savage Ethnography", "The Highpoint of the Cruise", "Of Ethnocide", "Myths and Rites of South American Indians", "Power in Primitive Societies", "Freedom, Misfortune, the Unnameable", "Primitive Economy", "The Return to Enlightenment", "Marxists and Their Anthropology", "Archeology of Violence: War in Primitive Societies", and "Sorrows of the Savage Warrior".{{sfn|Clastres|2010|loc="Contents"}}

"The Last Frontier" and "The Highpoint of the Cruise" were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'' in 1971.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=318}} "Savage Ethnography" and "Of Ethnocide" were published in ''L'Homme'' in 1969 and 1974 respectively.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} For [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]]'s ''Dictionnaire des mythologies et des religions'' (1981), Clastres wrote "Myths and Rites of South American Indians".{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=319}} ''Interrogations'' was the journal in which "Power in Primitive Societies" was released in 1976.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} "Freedom, Misfortune, the Unnameable" was written for a 1976 scolary edition of [[Étienne de La Boétie]]'s ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]''.{{sfn|Plot|2013|p=22}}{{sfn|Curtis|2000|p=XV}} "Primitive Economy" was the title given to the preface Clastres wrote for the French edition of [[Marshall Sahlins]]'s ''Stone Age Economics''.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=319}} "The Return to Enlightenment" was released in ''[[Revue Française de Science politique]]'' in 1977.{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} Both "Archeology of Violence: War in Primitive Societies" and "Sorrows of the Savage Warrior" were published in ''Libre'' in 1977,{{sfn|Cartry|1978|p=45}} and "Marxists and Their Anthropology" was published on the same journal in 1978.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=63}}

==Thought==
{{political anthropology}}
===Structuralism, Marxism and anarchism===
Initially a member of the [[Union of Communist Students]] with influences from the libertarian socialist group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]],{{sfn|Gottraux|1997|p=205}} Clastres became disenchanted with [[Communism]] after the raising of [[Stalinism]] and abandoned the [[French Communist Party]] in 1956,{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=10}} seeking for a new point of view.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=57}} In [[François Dosse]]'s words, for Clastres and other adherents of Lévi-Strauss's Structural anthropology, "it was a matter of locating societies that had been sheltered from the unitary map of [[Hegelianism|Hegelian Marxist]] thinking, societies that were not classified in Stalinist handbooks."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=57}} Although initially adept of Structuralism, Abensour wrote that "Clastres is neither Structuralist, nor [[Marxist]]."{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=53}} Similarly, [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]] declared ''Society Against the State'' and ''Archeology of Violence'' can be considered "the chapters of a virtual book that could be named ''Neither Marxism nor Structuralism''."{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=12}} For Clastres, in Viveiros de Castro's words, "both privileged economic rationality and suppressed political intentionality."{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=12}}

According to [[Samuel Moyn]], Clastres's first article, "Exchange and Power", "exhibited a vestigial structuralism" that he would abandon on subsequent essays.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=62}} On "Marxists and Their Anthropology"&lt;!-- yeah, it seems strange; but there's a critic of structuralism in an essay about Marxists --&gt; Clastres criticised structuralist perspective on myth and kinship because it ignores their place of production—the society.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=54}} He said that, for structuralism, kinship only has the function to prohibit [[incest]]. "This function of kinship explains that men are not animals, [but] does not explain how primitive man is a particular man." It neglects that "kinship ties fulfill a determined function, inherent in primitive society as such, that is, an undivided society made up of equals: kinship, society, equality, even combat."{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=223}} On myths, Clastres said, "The rite is the religious mediation between myth and society: but, for structuralist analysis, the difficulty stems from the fact that rites do not reflect upon each other. It is impossible to reflect upon them. Thus, exit the rite, and with it, society."{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=224}}

With Structuralism's crisis in the later 1960s, Marxist anthropology became an alternative to it.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=63}} Clastres, however, was critical of it because Marxism was developed on the context of capitalist societies and anthropologists were using it to analyse non-capitalist societies.{{sfn|Abensour|2007|p=54–56}} On Clastres's perspective, according to Viveiros de Castro, "[[historical materialism]] was ethnocentric: it considered production the truth of society and labor the essence of the human condition."{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=12}} However, it is not true for primitive societies since they live in a [[subsistence economy]], in which not only they do not have to produce an economic excess but they refuse to do it.{{sfn|Clastres|1989|p=195}} In opposition to Marxist's [[economic determinism]], for Clastres, politics was not [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]]; instead it was ''[[sui generis]]'', which enabled Amerindian societies to refuse power and statehood.{{sfn|Parkin|2010|p=237}} Clastres wrote,

{{quote|When, in primitive society, the economic dynamic lends itself to definition as a distinct and autonomous domain, when the activity of production becomes [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]], accountable labor, levied by men who will enjoy the fruits of that labor, what has come to pass is that society has been divided into rulers and ruled ... Society's major division ... is the new vertical ordering of things between a base and a summit; it is the great political cleavage between those who hold the force ... and those subject to that force. The political relation of power precedes and founds the economic relation of exploitation. Alienation is political before it is economic; power precedes labor; the economic derives from the political; the emergence of the State determines the advent of classes.|Clastres, "Society Against the State"{{sfn|Clastres|1989|p=198}}}}

In refusing both Structuralism and Marxism, Clastres, in Moyn's words, "presented his own '[[political anthropology]]' as the more plausible sequel or complement to structuralist analysis."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=63}} Because of his analysis of power and the State, several commentators say Clastres posites an "anthropological anarchism"{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=15}} or exhibits anarchist influences.{{sfn|Parkin|2010|p=236}}{{sfn|Graham|2009|p=372}}

===On power and coercion===
In his 1969 article "Copernicus and the Savages", Clastres reviewed J. W. Lapierre's ''Essai sur le fondement du pouvoir politique'', in which he said primitive societies were societies without [[power (sociology)|power]] based on [[Max Weber]]'s "[[Monopoly on violence|conception of power as monopoly of State]]".{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=64}} Clastres, however, argued that power does not imply either coercion or violence, and proposed a "Copernican revolution"{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=64}} in political anthropology: "In order to escape the attraction of its native earth and attain real freedom of thought, in order to pull itself away from the facts of natural history in which it continues to flounder, reflection on power must effect a '[[heliocentric]]' conversion."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=65}}

In another essay, "Exchange and Power", he argued that South American Indian chieftains are powerless chiefs; they are chosen on the basis of their oratorical talent.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=59}} And while they have the exclusive right to be [[polygyny|polygamous]], they have to be generous and offer gifts to their people.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=59}} However, it was not an exchange: they give and receive each independently; Clastres wrote, "this relationship, by denying these elements an exchange value at the group level, institutes the political sphere not only as external to the structure of the group, but further still, as negating that structure: power is contrary to the group, and the rejection of reciprocity, as the ontological dimension of society, is the rejection of society itself."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=60}} Clastres then concluded that "the advent of power, such as it is, presents itself to these societies as the very means for nullifying that power."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=60}} In ''Le Grand Parler'', he argued that "the society itself, not its leader, is the real site of power" and then they can avoid the concentration of power.{{sfn|Gaillard|2004|p=311}}

===On torture and war===
On their struggle against the State, on keeping their society an egalitarian one, however, they use violent methods: torture and war.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=66–67}} Moyn said that Clastres "reinterpret[ed] the violence in primitive society as internal and essential to its selfimmunization against the rise of the state" and "compare[d] it favorably to the grandiose horrors of the statist, modern world."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=67}} To the first topic, he dedicated "Of Torture in Primitive Societies"; Clastres did not think on it as cruel practice and using Soviet Union penal tattoos on [[Anatoly Marchenko]] as example, Clastres affirmed: "It is proof of their admirable depth of mind that the Savages knew all that ''ahead of time'', and took care, at the cost of a terrible cruelty, to prevent the advent of a more terrifying cruelty."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=68}} Instead he argued torture in [[rites of passage]] had the function of prohibiting inequality:

{{Quote|The law they come to know in pain is the law of primitive society, which says to everyone: ''You are worth no more than anyone else; you are worth no less than anyone else''. The law, inscribed on bodies, expresses primitive society's refusal to run the risk of division, the risk of a power separate from society itself, ''a power that would escape its control''. Primitive law, cruelly taught, is a prohibition of inequality that each person will remember. | Clastres, "Of Torture in Primitive Societies"{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=67}}}}

{{double image|right|Thomas Hobbes by John Michael Wright.jpg|150|Engels 1856.jpg|148|For its perspective on war, ''Archeology of Violence'' was said to be "an anti-Hobbes book" (''left'').{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=13}} However, it also criticized Engels's perspective on the origin of the State,{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=77}} and his idea of State as the ultimate destiny of society.{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=167–168}} It would lead it to be described as "more anti-Engels, a manifesto against the forced continuism of World History".{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=13}}}}

On a similar fashion, Clastres argued that war could not be seen as problem but that it had a political reason.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=69-70}} He pointed it was not [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|a constant state of war]] like the [[Hobbes]]ian proposition but that it occurred only between different groups.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=70}} He argued that internal war was purposeful and kept the group segmented, non-hierarchized;{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=70}} according to Viveiros de Castro: "perpetual war was a mode of controlling both the temptation to control and the risk of being controlled. War keeps opposing the State, but the crucial difference for Clastres is that sociality is on the side of war, not of the sovereign."{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=13}} Clastres stated:

{{Quote|For [Hobbes], the social link institutes itself between men due to "a common Power to keep them all in awe:" the State is against the war. What does primitive society as a sociological space of permanent war tell us in counter-point? It repeats Hobbes's discourse by reversing it; it proclaims that the machine of dispersion functions against the machine of unification; it tells us that war is against the State.| Clastres, "Archeology of Violence: War in Primitive Societies"{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=277}}}}

===On the State===
For Clastres, primitive societies possessed a "sense of democracy and taste for equality," and thus intentionally discourage the rise of a State.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=60}} That is why these societies are not merely characterized as societies without a State, but societies against the State.{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=60}} Viveiros de Castro explained the meaning of "Society against the State" as "a modality of collective life based on the symbolic neutralization of political authority and the structural inhibition of ever-present tendencies to convert power, wealth and prestige into coercion, inequality and exploitation."{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=12}} By affirming it, Clastres criticised both the [[Evolutionism|evolutionist]] and Marxist ("especially [[Engels]]ian") notion that the State would be a necessity and the ultimate destiny in all societies.{{sfn|Parkin|2010|p=237}}{{sfn|Clastres|2010|p=167–168}} For him, the State does not emerge because of the complexification of productive or political forces but it rises when a community reaches a certain number of members.{{sfn|Dosse|2010|p=261}} 

On the other hand, his vision of primitive societies without conflict was deemed "romantic" by critics such as Marcus Colchester and Moyn.{{sfn|Parkin|2010|p=237}}{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=78}} Moyn wrote, "Many took Clastres's own words"—as in the affirmation that Amerindian societies "could predict the future" and avoid State—"to convict him of primitivism."{{sfn|Plot|2013|p=56}}

==Legacy==
In Moyn's opinion "Clastres's romanticized vision of society against the state not only failed to fulfill the primary need of his (but not only his) time—a theory of democratization in which society and state are complementary—but imposed an obstacle to its fulfillment."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=78}} First, his arguments implied in "a kind of paralyzed mourning" because his "primitivist nostalgia" made people distant from reforms in the present. "In this way, Clastres's anti- but not yet genuinely post-Marxist perception that the state in all its forms is corrupted by a 'neo-theology of history with its fanatic continuism' prevented him from presenting a viable stance for those who are unable to escape the circumstances of Western modernity—which is to say, in a globalized world, everyone."{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=78}}

For Moyn another consequence was that it provided a base for neo-liberal thinkers like Marcel Gauchet, who openly do homages to Clastres's work. His view that totalitarianism was a constant danger in the modern societies "makes the security of freedoms against the state the only realistic achievement in a politics without illusions." On the other hand, his effect on left thinkers was that it gave rise to the belief that democracy is primarily a matter of civil society and thus prompted a dichotomy between society and the state, overshadowing the role of the state in the development of an active civil society. While Moyn considered Clastres had "an important role in the rise in contemporary theory of the importance of civil society", his theory "not only forced an excessive burden onto civil society alone as the locus of freedom; it also neutralized a theory of the state, condemned and feared in all its forms".{{sfn|Moyn|2004|p=79}} Differently, Warren Breckman concluded Clastres's view on State helped the antitotalitarian current of 1970s French thought.{{sfn|Breckman|2013|p=168}}

He was a major influence for [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''.{{sfn|Viveiros de Castro|2010|p=34}}{{sfn|Bogue|2007|p=149}}

[[James C. Scott]]'s ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed]]'' proposes that [[Zomia (geography)|Zomia]] inhabitants were intentionally "using their culture, farming practices, egalitarian political structures, prophet-led rebellions, and even their lack of writing systems to put distance between themselves and the states that wished to engulf them".{{sfn|Hammond|2011}} His thesis sparked some controversy and although he affirmed he made "bold claims" none of them were totally original, attributing some of them to Clastres.{{sfn|Hammond|2011}} Scott commented on how Clastres influenced him: "The reason it was useful for me... is that he was the first person to understand that modes of subsistence are not just grades on some evolutionary scale--from hunting and gathering to swiddening, foraging, agriculture, and so on--but rather that the choice of a mode of subsistence is in part a political choice about how you want to relate to existing state systems".{{sfn|Gilman|Guilhot|2014|p=111}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48420">'''Protestant views on [[contraception]]''' are markedly more pluralistic than the views expressed by the [[Magisterium]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], due to historical divergences of theological thought that began during the [[Protestant Reformation]], including the rejection of an infallible doctrinal authority other than Scripture. The doctrine of Protestantism from the Reformation until 1930 strongly condemned contraception. Since the 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion, major Protestant denominations shifted their doctrine to accepting contraception. 
In general, most liberal Protestants and Anglicans hold relatively settled views that accept use of contraception, while debate is ongoing among conservative Evangelicals, especially as to which types are and are not acceptable. Others, such as [[Laestadian Lutheran|Laestadian Lutheran Church]]es do not permit the use of birth control.&lt;ref name="Kivisto2014"/&gt;

==Denominational positions==

===Anglicanism===
[[The Church of England]] has stated in the 1958 Lambeth Conference that the responsibility for deciding upon the number and frequency of children was laid by God upon the consciences of parents 'in such ways as are acceptable to husband and wife'.&lt;ref name="anglican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception|title=Statements on Science, Medicine, Technology &amp; Environment|accessdate=2006-10-01|publisher=The Church of England|year=2005|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810021928/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism===
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] allows for contraception in the event the potential parents do not intend to care for a child.&lt;ref&gt;''When a woman and man join their bodies sexually, both should be prepared to provide for a child, should conception occur. When that is not their intention, the responsible use of safe, effective contraceptives is expected of the male and the female.''{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Journey Together Faithfully: ELCA Studies on Sexuality, Part One |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929001942/http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lutheran churches or synods take other positions, or do not take any position at all. For example, in 1990 the [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]] passed a resolution titled "Procreation" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although they "allow for exegetical differences and exceptional cases (casuistry)", for example, when the woman's life is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;See http://lutheransandcontraception.blogspot.com/2006/01/gods-word-and-procreation.html .

The LCR also notes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Such was the united teaching of [[Martin Luther|Dr. Martin Luther]] and the "Old [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri]]" fathers ([[C. F. W. Walther|C.F.W. Walther]], [[Franz Pieper|F. Pieper]], A.L. Graebner, C.M. Zorn, W.H.T. Dau, J.T. Mueller, W. Dallman, F. Bente, E.W.A. Koehler, L. Fuerbringer, T. Engelder, Th. Laetsch, G. Luecke, [[Walter A. Maier|W.A. Maier]], M.J. Naumann, et al.) and LCR leaders such as P.E. Kretzmann and W.H. McLaughlin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Likewise, the Hausvater Project (not an LCR organization) states,&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore find ourselves sympathetic to the long-standing consensus of Lutheran church fathers from the Reformation through the mid twentieth century that neither abortion, abortifacient birth control, nor barrier contraception should be practiced. See http://www.hausvater.org/faqs.php&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laestadian Lutheran|Laestadian Lutheran Church]]es do not permit the use of birth control.&lt;ref name="Kivisto2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kivisto|first=Peter|title=Religion and Immigration: Migrant Faiths in North America and Western Europe|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Wiley|language=English |isbn=9780745686660|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) nor the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) have an official position on contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031226232737/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2122 What is the LCMS stance on voluntary contraception?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102121628/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=27&amp;cuItem_itemID=490 WELS Topical Q&amp;A: Birth Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=meIpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;vq ''Birth Control a Curse''], a Lutheran Witness (LCMS) reprint of a Northwestern Lutheran (WELS) article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Concordia Cyclopedia, an LCMS reference book, condemns contraception, Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Christian News, a weekly paper edited by a pastor of an LCMS congregation, opposes contraception.&lt;ref&gt;"Christian News is one of the few religious publications which still defends the position most of Christendom took opposing birth control until the resolution of the Anglican’s Lambeth Conference in 1930." &lt;cite&gt;Otten, Herman, Larry Marquardt: Founder—Christian Life Resources. Christian News Vol. 46., No.47. p.5 (December 8, 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===
The [[United Methodist Church]], holds that "each couple has the right and the duty prayerfully and responsibly to control conception according to their circumstances."  Its Resolution on Responsible Parenthood states that in order to "support the sacred dimensions of personhood, all possible efforts should be made by parents and the community to ensure that each child enters the world with a healthy body, and is born into an environment conducive to realization of his or her potential." To this end, the United Methodist Church supports "adequate public funding and increased participation in family planning services by public and private agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc-gbcs.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fsJNK0PKJrH&amp;b=848309&amp;content_id=%7BD78C069C-1151-4E3C-8840-B707FC4B96EF%7D&amp;notoc=1|title=Responsible Parenthood |publisher=The United Methodist General Board of Church and Society|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |title=Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health |publisher=Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007160017/http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] also supports responsible use of birth control, welcoming its use as a means "towards fulfilment in marriage, the spacing of children, and the need to avoid pregnancy altogether, for example for medical reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Views of the Church: Abortion and Contraception|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/who-we-are/views-of-the-church/abortion-and-contraception|publisher=The Methodist Church in Britain|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterianism===
[[Presbyterian Church (USA)|The Presbyterian Church (USA)]] supports “full and equal access to contraceptive methods.” In a recent resolution endorsing insurance coverage for contraceptives, the church affirmed that “contraceptive services are part of basic health care” and cautioned that “unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant mortality, low birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and threaten the economic viability of families.”&lt;ref name="Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health."&gt;Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. 2006. ''Religious Support For Family Planning'' (retrieved 16 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mennonites===
The [[Mennonite Church USA]], the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]], and the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference]] have adopted statements indicating approval of modern methods of contraception. For example, while also teaching and encouraging love and acceptance of children, the Conservative Mennonite Conference maintains, "The prevention of pregnancy when feasible by birth control with pre-fertilization methods is acceptable."&lt;ref name="mennobeliefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |title=What We Believe |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Conservative Mennonite Conference |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033751/http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1975 found that only 11% of Mennonites believed use of birth control was "always wrong".&lt;ref name="mennonite" /&gt;  Old Colony Mennonites, like the [[Amish]], do not officially allow birth control practices.

===Amish===
All types of birth control, including forms of [[natural family planning]] such as [[calendar-based methods]], are forbidden in Old Order [[Amish]] communities.&lt;!--

==History==
Before the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] viewed [[procreation]] as the primary purpose of [[sexual intercourse]] and unity of spouses.  As part of the Reformation, Reformers began to more strongly emphasize the unitive pleasures of marriage.&lt;ref name="rich_vincent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |title=Responsible Family Planning: The Legitimacy of Contraceptive Use for Christian Couples |accessdate=2006-10-01 |year=2005 |author=Rich Vincent |work=TheoCenTric |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200513/http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all major early [[Protestant Reformers]], and indeed Protestants in general until the twentieth century, condemned birth control as a contravention of God's procreative purpose for marriage.&lt;ref name="flann"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Campbell, Flann| title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches| journal=Population Studies| date=Nov 1960| volume= 14| issue= 2| pages=131–147| doi=10.2307/2172010 | publisher=Population Investigation Committee | jstor=2172010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carlson, Allan| title=Children of the Reformation| journal=Touchstone|date=May 2007| volume= 20| issue= 4| url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-04-020-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As scientists advanced birth control methods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Protestants continued to reject them, while other [[Nonconformists]] welcomed these advances. ([[Moncure Conway]] preached on the subject at [[South Place Chapel]] in London.)&lt;ref name="flann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malthusian"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Untitled| journal=The Malthusian|date=June 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway"&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberty and Morality: A Discourse given at the [[South Place Chapel]], Finsbury| last=Conway| first=Moncure D.| year=1878| publisher=Freethought Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the dissent, the editor of a Nonconformist weekly journal in the United States wrote in 1893,&lt;blockquote&gt;''There was a time when any idea of voluntary limitation was regarded by pious people as interfering with Providence. We are beyond that now and have become capable of recognizing that Providence works through the commonsense of individual brains. We limit population just as much by deferring marriage for prudential reasons as by any action that may be taken after it.''&lt;ref name="flann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonconform"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Editorial entitled 'A Marriage Problem'| journal=The Christian World Weekly| year=1893| volume=June 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian denomination|Non-Catholic denominations]] were slow to officially go along with such a view, although followers were not as reluctant.

===1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference shift===

Then in 1930, at the [[Lambeth Conference#Seventh Conference (1930)|Seventh Lambeth Conference]], the [[Anglican Communion]], after years of considerable internal debate, issued the first statement permitting birth control "when there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noroomforcontraception.com/Resources/Contraception-Lambeth.htm No Room For Contraception] ''Lambeth Conferences of the Anglican Church''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allan Carlson recounts how this affected the other Protestants:

:There was an immediate American Protestant echo. In 1931, the Committee on Home and Marriage of the Federal Council of Churches (an ecumenical body that embraced Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Church of the Brethren denominations) issued a statement defending family limitation and urging the repeal of laws prohibiting contraceptive education and sales...In the late 1940′s, a leading LCMS [Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ] professor of theology, Alfred Rehwinckel, said that Luther had simply been wrong: the Genesis phrase, “Be fruitful and multiply,” was merely a blessing, not a command. Such views spread at a still more rapid pace among the Protestant “mainline” churches. Held near the end of the post World War II “baby boom,” when American family life for a brief period again seemed somewhat healthy, the 1961 North American Conference on Church and Family of the National Council of Churches (successor to the FCC) can only be called extraordinary....Not a single speaker spoke in the spirit of the old Protestant pronatalist ethic. Indeed, this ethic now stood as the chief enemy. The conference endorsed development of a new evangelical sexual ethic, one “relevant to our culture,” sensitive to the overpopulation crisis, and grounded in modern science. Member denominations soon complied. In a 1970 Report, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected the old “taboos and prohibitions” and gave its blessing to “mass contraceptive techniques,” homosexuality, and low-cost abortion on demand. The same year, the Lutheran Church in America fully embraced contraception and abortion as responsible choices. And in 1977, the United Church of Christ celebrated the terms “freedom,” “sensuousness,” and “androgyny,” and declared free access to contraception and abortion as matters of justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://bound4life.com/history-of-contraception-in-the-protestant-church/&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005 acceptance had increased such that a [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] poll conducted online among 2,242 U.S. adults found that 88% of non-Catholic Christians who identified as either "very religious" or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] supported the use of birth control/contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Harris_poll&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants Reformers’ views vs. modern Protestant views===
Highly conservative Protestants such as [[Mary Pride]], [[Charles D. Provan]], Hess and Hess, and Rachel Scott, argue that Protestants should not have moved away from traditional Protestant views of contraception such as given by [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]. Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, and point to primarily [[feminist]], [[secular]], or [[Satan]]ic influences as causative to the change.&lt;ref name="mary_pride"/&gt;&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles D. Provan.jpg|thumb|100px|left| '''[[Charles D. Provan]]''''s ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is frequently cited by [[Quiverfull]] adherents, who eschew all forms of birth control.]] --&gt;
Provan in his ''The Bible and Birth Control'' extensively quotes early Protestant views of birth control, which Provan uses to conclude,&lt;blockquote&gt;''If Martin Luther were alive today, would he not disapprove of many Christians who view children as a bad thing, and so practice birth control to prevent God from sending more blessings to them? ... Truly Scriptural principles do not change at all: therefore Christians should willingly receive the blessings which God has for us, and not try to prevent them.''&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reformed scholars such as [[James B. Jordan]], however, maintain that Provan's view has the effect of adding a law to the Bible it does not contain. Jordan states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Jesus repeatedly denounced the Pharisees for their additions to the Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated to have as many children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jordan argues also that the views of early Protestant Reformers on contraception are unreliable because they were heavily influenced by not just the Bible but [[Neo-Platonic]] [[mysticism]] ([[Asceticism|otherworldliness]]) and [[Aristotle|Aristolean]] [[teleologism]] (measuring all things only by their result), philosophies they inherited from their Catholic predecessors such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Bart Garrett describes it, "They operated in a time and context that unhealthily looked at sex as a base, physical pleasure that carried with it spiritual detriments."&lt;ref name="IIIM"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bart Garrett| title=Christians and Contraception: Convenience or Kingdom Thinking?| journal=IIIM Magazine| year=2001| volume=3| issue=25| url=http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/bar_garrett/PT.Garrett.Contraception.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan further points to the Reformers' unreliability based upon their rejection of [[Song of Solomon]] as a description of passionate sexual expression within marriage. He also cites [[technophobia]] among Protestants, as evident by their rejection of things ranging from buttons to airplanes ("if God meant for man to fly he would have given him wings"). As well, Jordan points to what he describes as the Reformers' own mantra, "reformed and always reforming" (''ecclesia reformata est semper reformanda''), as evidence that Protestants should not crystallize their position on the matter at some point in the past, and says that rejecting contraceptives based upon their correlative rise alongside feminism exhibits the [[genetic fallacy]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

==Ongoing debates==
There are numerous ongoing debates at core of Protestant differences concerning contraceptives. These include whether contraceptive use or non-use is a matter of individual conscience or binding Biblical commands, what types of birth control are permissible if any, and the amount of weight modern Protestants should give early Protestant Reformers' views on contraception.

===Individual conscience or commandment?===
The [[majority]] of Protestants, irrespective of [[Christian denomination|denomination]], maintain that use or non-use of birth control in its various methods is a matter of [[conscience]] for individual Christians before God, and that individual couples should be convinced in their own minds of what is and is not permissible for them particularly (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2014;&amp;version=49; Romans 14]). In this view, God has a [[Priesthood of all believers|personal relationship]] with individual Christians and, because he has given no [[Argument from silence|explicit Biblical commandment]] against birth control and uses [[Common grace|and has even caused and overseen]] modern [[Technology|technological advancements]] (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012:4;&amp;version=49; Daniel 12:4]), he guides particular couples' birth control practices in accordance with his particular will for their lives. Conservative evangelical leader [[John F. MacArthur]] states the view,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Nothing in Scripture prohibits married couples from practicing birth control, either for a limited time to delay childbearing, or permanently when they have borne children and determine that their family is complete ... In our viewpoint, birth control is biblically permissible. At the same time, couples should not practice birth control if it violates their consciences (Romans 14:23)—not because birth control is inherently sinful, but because it is always wrong to violate the conscience. The answer to a wrongly informed conscience is not to violate it, but rather to correct and rightly inform one's conscience with biblical truth.''&lt;ref name="macarthur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources.php?section=issues&amp;aid=176403|title=What does the Bible teach about birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-12|publisher=Grace to You|year=2005|author=John F.

[[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], the ninth president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Evangelical couples may, at times, choose to use contraceptives in order to plan their families and enjoy the pleasures of the marital bed. The couple must consider all these issues with care, and must be truly open to the gift of children. The moral justification for using contraceptives must be clear in the couple's mind, and fully consistent with the couple's Christian commitments.''&lt;ref name="mohler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2004-03-30|title=Can Christians Use Birth Control?|accessdate=2006-10-01|year=2004|author=Mohler, R. Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional adherents of this view include Rainey, [[James Dobson]],&lt;ref name="fofposstament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.org/corrpdfs/Miscellaneous/Position_Statement-Birth_Control_Pills_and_Other_Hormonal_Contraception.pdf|title=Position Statement: Birth Control Pills and Other Hormonal Contraception|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2005|author=Focus on the Family|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical [[ethicists]] Franklin E. Payne&lt;ref name="payne1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblical/Medical Ethics: The Christian and the Practice of Medicine| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1985| publisher=Mott Media| location=Milford, MI| isbn=0-8010-7099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="payne2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Biblical Decisions: Birth Control, Artificial Reproduction and Genetic Engineering| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1989| publisher=Hosanna House| location=Escondido, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Feinberg|John]] and [[Paul Feinberg]].&lt;ref name="feinberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics for a Brave New World| last=Feinberg| first=John and Paul| publisher=Crossway| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn=0-89107-736-7|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Protestants adhere to this view, some such as Rainey may nonetheless advocate for one of the categories he describes, depending upon which [[Christian values]] they deem most important.

Some Protestants, however, reject the position that contraceptive use is a matter of conscience. Although some [[Quiverfull]] adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of ''Unless The Lord Magazine'', states, "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal in the sense that it is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century."&lt;ref name="QF-Digest-#3380"&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Crank | title=Quiverfull: universal or specific? | journal=Quiverfull Digest | year=2006| issue= #3380|url=http://www.quiverfull.com|pages=#20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles D. Provan]] additionally argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.''&lt;ref name="provan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bible and Birth Control| last=Provan| first=Charles D.| year=1989| publisher=Zimmer Printing| location=Monongahela, PA| isbn=99917-998-3-4}}. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quiverfull authors such as Hess and Hess disagree and say the matter is simply one of clear obedience or disobedience to God's words in the Bible.&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord" (Psa. 127:3). Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?''&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan point out that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also maintains that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among a wide range of blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt; [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry further explains,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, "it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities."''&lt;ref name="piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|title=Does the Bible permit birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-27|publisher=Desiring God|year=2006|author=Desiring God Staff|work=Questions and Answers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====“Be fruitful and multiply”—command or blessing?====
Protestants, including Quiverfull adherents, also disagree over whether the Biblical statement "be fruitful and multiply" in Genesis 1:28 and 9:7 is a [[Cultural mandate|command]] or simply a [[blessing]] God spoke over its recipients. [[Mary Pride]] and [[Charles D. Provan]] see it as a binding command upon married Christians, while Dobson, MacArthur, Jordan, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen do not see the statement as prohibiting family planning by contraceptive use.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/november12/4.58.html|title="Be Fruitful and Multiply": Is this a Command, or a Blessing?|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Christianity Today|year=2005|author=Raymond C. Van Leeuwen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Sin of Onan—condemnation of contraceptive use?====
{{Main article|Onan}}
As part of this debate, Protestants (as well as some Catholics) disagree over [[Onan|the Sin of Onan]] as found in the Bible verses of Genesis 38:1-10. Protestants within the "children in abundance" group (see discussion of below)  often see Onan's act of ''[[coitus interruptus]]'' as condemning contraceptive use, while most see Onan's real sin as ongoing rebellion against God, with his failure to fulfill the terms of his [[Yibbum|Levirate marriage (Yibbum)]] being his final rebellious act.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

===Which methods are permissible?===
:''Also see: [[Natural Family Planning]], [[Barrier contraception]] and [[Hormonal contraception]]''

Protestants who accept that birth control is permissible may disagree over which methods are impermissible.

====Natural Family Planning only or "artificial" methods too?====
In Sam and Bethany Torode's 2002 book, ''Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception'', the young couple argued that only [[Natural Family Planning]] was permissible, citing their views borrowed from Catholicism including the [[Theology of the Body]].&lt;ref name="open_embrace"&gt;{{cite book | title=Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception| last=Torode| first=Sam and Bethany| year=2002| publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-3973-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple later accepted barrier methods and stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Strict NFP reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than good. We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry." How is it that spouses are saying "yes" to the gift of each other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ... We also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying "no" to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying "no" to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.''&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry states of [[Natural family planning|NFP]],''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Some conclude that "natural family planning" is acceptable but "artificial" means are not. But this seems to overlook something significant: in both cases, you are still seeking to regulate when you have children. And so if one concludes that it is wrong to seek to regulate the timing and size of a family, then it would have to be concluded that natural family planning is just as wrong as "artificial" means. But if one concludes that it is appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes "artificial" means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not because God is "more free" to overrule our plans with natural family planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing years. There is no reason to conclude that natural family planning is appropriate but that "artificial" means are not.''&lt;ref name="piper"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her book, ''Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices'', Jenell Williams Paris, who is associate professor of anthropology at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews the benefits and uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), which is similar to NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching.  Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible.&lt;ref name="JWP"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices| last=Paris| first=Jenell Williams| year=2003| publisher=Baker Books| location=Grand Rapids| isbn=978-0-8010-6437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hormonal contraceptives====
Based upon a view that [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|life begins at conception]], Protestant author [[Randy Alcorn]] rejects all forms of [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]], while [[James Dobson]] and [[obstetrician]] and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view [[Progestogen only pill|progesterone-only birth control pills]] as potentially problematic, since they may be [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|potentially abortive contraceptive]]s because of the theoretical possibility that they may have a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized [[embryo]] from implanting within the [[uterus|uterine wall]], while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards.&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cutrer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contraception Guidebook: Options, Risks, and Answers for Christian Couples| url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorId=CutrerW&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan| last=Cutrer| first=William R.|author2=Glahn, Sandra L. | year=2005| publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI| isbn=0-310-25407-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?| url=http://www.epm.org/media-files/pdf/bcpill.pdf| last=Alcorn| first=Randy| year=2007| publisher=Eternal Perspective Ministries| location=Sandy, OR| isbn=0-9700016-0-6|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's [[Focus on the Family]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC has not been able to reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect [with the progesterine-only pill], however remote, to warrant informing women about it.''&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]], however, argues that it is inappropriate to implicate certain hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient based upon theory only, and points out that no empirical evidence exists to prove any abortifacient action. The organization states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Is it appropriate to implicate a medication as an abortive agent without the data to support such a claim? To do so creates needless hostility and division among physicians and patients who genuinely respect life from the moment of conception. Where do we draw the line in informed consent for responsible disclosure of known medical risks vs. a theoretical risk which is not substantiated by current scientific knowledge? Is it accurate to implicate all hormonal contraceptive methods as one regarding their method of action, rather than evaluating each one individually?''&lt;ref name="aaplog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm|title=Hormone Contraceptives Controversies and Clarifications|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=[[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]]|year=1999|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022215/http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current views==
Author and [[Campus Crusade for Christ#Campus Crusade for Christ, Major Ministry Divisions in the U.S.|FamilyLife Today]] radio host Dennis Rainey suggests four categories as useful in understanding current Protestant views concerning birth control.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |title=The Value of Children (11 July 2002 FamilyLife Today Radio Broadcast) |accessdate=2006-09-30 |publisher=FamilyLife Today |year=2002 |author=Dennis Rainey |format=Transcript of radio broadcast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001144025/http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |archivedate=1 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson use very similar categories in their 1997 study of Protestant seminarians' attitudes on the matter.&lt;ref name="consvprots"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson| title=Conservative Protestantism and Attitudes toward Family Planning in a Sample of Seminarians| journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion| year=1997| volume=36| issue=4| pages=512–529| doi=10.2307/1387687 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | jstor=1387687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in abundance" group===
{{Main article|Quiverfull}}
The first is the "children in abundance" group. Protestants within this group believe that birth control is a contravention of God’s purpose for marriage and that all children conceived during routine [[sexual intercourse]] (without regard to time of the month during the [[ovulation]] cycle or other matters) should be welcomed as blessings.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; The [[Quiverfull|Quiverfull movement]] and its authors such as [[Mary Pride]], Rick and Jan Hess, [[Charles D. Provan]], [[Nancy Leigh DeMoss]], Rachel Giove Scott, and others, predominate this group. Based upon [[Bible verses]] that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&amp;version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&amp;version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&amp;version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&amp;version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&amp;version=49; Isaiah 66:9]), Quiverfull adherents believe that [[Divine Providence]] alone should control how many and how often children are conceived and born.&lt;ref name="thenation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061127/joyce|title='Arrows for the War'|accessdate=2006-11-09|publisher=The Nation|date=9 November 2006|author=Kathryn Joyce|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants in this group often connect birth control use with modern [[feminism]], an "anti-child mentality", "worldliness",&lt;ref name="mary_pride"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality| last=Pride| first=Mary| year=1985| publisher=Good News Publishers| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="provan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ| last=Hess| first=Rick and Jan| year=1990| publisher=Hyatt Publishers| location=Brentwood, TN|isbn=0-943497-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birthing God's Mighty Warriors| last=Scott| first=Rachel| year=2004| publisher=Xulon Press| location=Longwood, FL|isbn=1-59467-465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion because birth control is used for "the same reasons why a woman aborts her child".&lt;ref name="nikki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/birth_control/my_contraceptive_convictions.html|title=My contraceptive convictions|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=Quiverfull.com|author=Nikki Keith|work=Quiverfull Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in managed abundance" group===
The second is the "children in managed abundance" group. According to Rainey, Protestants within this group are open to however many children they may conceive during their fertile years yet believe that only [[Natural Family Planning]] is acceptable and may use it.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; A young couple Sam and Bethany Torode advocated for this view in their 2002 book,&lt;ref name="open_embrace" /&gt; although they later accepted [[barrier contraception]] such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] and [[condoms]].&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openembrace.com/ |title=Udates |accessdate=2006-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026170034/http://www.openembrace.com/ |archivedate=2006-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denny Kenaston]] of Charity Christian Fellowship also advocates for this position,&lt;ref name="Kenaston_menno"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Godly Seed| last=Kenaston| first=Denny| year=2003| publisher=Home Fires Publishers|isbn=0-9742751-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Presbyterian]] seminary professor Daniel Doriani.&lt;ref name="doriani"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Doriani, Daniel| title=Birth Dearth or Bring on the Babies?: Biblical Perspectives on Family Planning| journal=Journal of Biblical Counseling| year=1993| volume=12| issue=1| pages=24–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in moderation" group===
The third is the "children in moderation" group. In Rainey’s view, these Protestants are very pro-child but feel free to use artificial birth control to prudently plan their families. Those within this group see Divine Providence and [[Free will in theology|Biblically required responsibility]] acting via man's free will as working complementarily. They thus may feel freedom to use non-"natural" birth control in making personal choices in [[prayer|consultation with God]] about the number and spacing of children.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt;

==="No children" group===
{{See also|Childfree}}
The fourth group is the [[Childfree|"no children"]] group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around [[natalism|non-natal]] concerns.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; While not their main emphasis on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and [[James B. Jordan]] support this as an acceptable option, but only when a [[Hierarchy#Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity|higher ethical principle]] intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve [[orphan]]s or as [[missionary|missionaries]] in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, so that he could devote his life to telling the Good News."&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eilertech.com/cyberchurch/cyberchurch.htm|title=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree|accessdate=2006-12-08|publisher=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative.&lt;ref name="JBJ"&gt;{{cite journal|author=James B. Jordan |title=The Bible and Family Planning: An Answer to Charles Provan's "The Bible and Birth Control" |journal=Contra Mundum |year=1993 |issue=Fall 1993, no. 9 |url=http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1070-9495 |pages=2–14 (Article begins on PDF page 4 of source) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052122/http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mohler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Letting God Plan Your Family| last=Owen, Jr.| first=Samuel A.| year=1990| publisher=Crossway Books| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-585-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|Sterilized]] couples may as well. According to [[Southern Baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], "Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation".&lt;ref name="mohler-child"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/167/story_16748.html|title=Deliberate Childlessness: Moral Rebellion With a New Face|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=www.albertmohler.com|year=2006|author=Albert Mohler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterilization reversals===
{{Main article|Sterilization reversal}}

Stemming from ideas from the [[Quiverfull]] movement, some Protestants such as [[Bill Gothard]] advocate for couples to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] reversal surgery, while Brad and Dawn Irons of ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry'' advocate for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo reversal surgery.&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedarrows.org/|title=Blessed Arrows: A Sterilization Reversal Ministry|accessdate=2006-10-14|publisher=Brad and Dawn Irons|author=Brad and Dawn Irons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pulpwood Queens''' is a meet-and-greet [[Book discussion club|book club]] founded in early 2000 in [[Jefferson, Texas]], by [[Kathy Patrick|Kathy L. Patrick]] in a combined beauty salon and bookstore, Beauty and the Book. In a joint effort with Random House, the club spawned an Internet book club show that began in January 2011, "Beauty and the Book: Where reading is always in style."&lt;ref&gt;"Beauty and the Book Show," hosted by Kathy Patrick, airs on the Internet, on [http://www.BeautyAndTheBookShow.com www.BeautyAndTheBookShow.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211102936/http://beautyandthebookshow.com/ |date=2011-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dedicated to promoting [[literacy]] and good [[literature]], Pulpwood Queens has grown from an initial six members to, a decade later, more than 2,000 members and 400 chapters, including 10 in foreign countries and one in a women's prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondact.com/2010/04/pulpwood-queens-book-club-goes-global/ ''SecondAct'', "Pulpwood Queens Book Club Goes Global," April 14, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105045429/http://www.secondact.com/2010/04/pulpwood-queens-book-club-goes-global/ |date=January 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texashighways.com/index.php/component/content/article/102-web-extra-archive/5812-web-extra-ghosts-books-and-more-from-jefferson ''Texas Highways'' magazine, "Ghosts, books and more from Jefferson," October 2010 edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The club selects a "book of the month," which ''Variety'' reporter Jonathan Bing said "has an unusual amount of clout."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&amp;articleid=VR1117885324&amp;categoryid=1007&amp;query=chabon&amp;display=chabon&amp;cs=1 ''Variety'' (subscription required),"Jonathan Bing: The Write Stuff," April 20, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, members of the book club appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America" with the introduction, "These Southern ladies are devotees of cocktails, good food, and high hair."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AoOQgyrl7OcJ_oZDFP_xrr2bvZx4?p=%22pulpwood+queens%22+%22Recipes+From+Pulpwood+Queens+Book+Club%22&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-701 ABCNews, "Recipes From Pulpwood Queens Book Club," June 13, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Girlfriend Weekend==
Its annual convention, Girlfriend Weekend, is held each January. [[Pat Conroy]], author of ''[[Prince of Tides]]'' and ''South of Broad'', was a keynote speaker at the 2010 conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/10/pat-conroy-to-meet-pulpwood-qu.html ''Dallas News'', "Pat Conroy to Meet Pulpwood Queens in Jefferson, Texas," October 22, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222232/http://booksblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/10/pat-conroy-to-meet-pulpwood-qu.html |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conroy returned in 2011 and was joined by 40 other authors, including ''[[New York Times]]'' bestsellers [[Fannie Flagg]], author of ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe]]'', Jamie Ford, who penned ''Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet'', and [[Jeannette Walls]], whose first book, ''[[The Glass Castle]]'', stayed on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for 100 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/01/a-sneak-peek-at-the-pulpwood-q.html ''Dallas News'', "A Sneak Peek at the Pulpwood Queens Reading List," January 12, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222237/http://booksblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/01/a-sneak-peek-at-the-pulpwood-q.html |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the 2011 event sold out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshallnewsmessenger.com/news/article_d38d5ef0-2057-11e0-9745-001cc4c03286.html ''Marshall News Messenger'', "Girlfriends Weekend kicks off with flair in Jefferson," January 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final night of Girlfriend Weekend is The Great Big Ball of Hair Ball, where club members and authors wear costumes based on a theme. In 2010, the party celebrated [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]. In 2011, the costumes were based on the event's theme: "It's all about the story."&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/06/what-novels-would-you-like-to-see-adapted-to-film/ ''Publishing Perspectives'', "What Novels Would You Like to See Adapted to Film?" June 11, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees dressed as characters out of their favorite books.

In a February 2010 article, the ''[[Texas Observer]]'' described the weekend as "fast becoming one of the most important literary events in America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texasobserver.org/texinthecity/fake-fur-big-hair-and-la-vie-litteraire ''Texas Observer'', "Fake Fur, Big Hair and La Vie Littéraire," by Robert Leleux, February 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; And the ''Marshall News  Messenger'', in Marshall, Texas, wrote that the event is for men too, with members known as the Timber Guys.

==The book club==
Pulpwood Queens was included in a ''Newsweek'' article about book clubs. In it, ''Newsweek'' reported that when Patrick, chosen by "Good Morning America" to select the first book on the morning show's televised book club, announced that the Pulpwood Queens had picked Ann Packer's debut novel, ''The Dive From Clausen's Pier'', it sent the book "straight up the best-seller list."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2002/07/29/reading-all-about-it.html# ''Newsweek'' (page 2), "Reading All About It," July 29, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' in 2007 called the club "a major publishing force."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-158219320.html ''The Dallas Morning News'', "Pulpwood Queens a major publishing force," January 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Inga Wiehl and Ellie Heffernan, in their book ''When Professional Women Retire: Food for Thought and Palate'', wrote about Pulpwood Queens, saying, "This group is not just any old book club.  It carries some freight." Then they cited the club's reading choice of ''The Dive From Clausen's Pier'' that "sent sales skyrocketing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=itBbM-TvLQEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=kathy+patrick+%22pulpwood+queens%22&amp;ots=ZzsvBppF7d&amp;sig=WHcRekhZvACrm3pPAOQFSuTp1Gk#v=onepage&amp;q=kathy%20patrick&amp;f=false ''When Professional Women Retire'', by Inga Wiehl and Ellie Heffernan, quotes Kathy Patrick on page 87]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome Writing''''', also called '''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' or simply '''''Saint Jerome''''', is an [[oil painting]] by [[Italians|Italian]] painter [[Caravaggio]]. Generally dated to 1605-1606, the painting is located in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in [[Rome]].

==Composition==
The painting depicts [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] in [[Roman Catholicism]] and a popular subject for painting, even for Caravaggio, who produced other paintings of Jerome [[Saint Jerome in Meditation (Caravaggio)|in Meditation]] and [[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|engaged in writing]]. In this image, Jerome is reading intently, an outstretched arm resting with quill.

The painting is generally dated to 1605-1606, largely on the statements of 17th-century art historical biographer [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], though [[Denis Mahon]] suggests 1602-1604.&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton|title=Caravaggio and His Two Cardinals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WSH4BabKuUC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=1995|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-01312-1|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAvz9G4DhdkC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=28 June 2010|date=5 March 1985|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-06-430128-2|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorenoStefani2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Paolo|author2=Chiara Stefani|title=The Borghese Gallery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce2Fg7FIvFgC&amp;pg=PA192|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2000|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-1946-0|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bellori, Caravaggio produced the piece at the behest of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Scipione Borghese]],&lt;ref name="BelloriWohl2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|authorlink1=Giovanni Pietro Bellori|translator=Hellmut Wohl|title=The lives of the modern painters, sculptors and architects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78187-9|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a cardinal in 1605, but it is possible that Borghese acquired it later as it is not mentioned in a 1613 poem by [[Scipione Francucci]] that described the [[Borghese Collection|Borghese Caravaggio collection]].&lt;ref name="GilbertCaravaggio1995"/&gt; Whether or not the dating is accurate, the work is believed to have originated from Caravaggio's late Roman period,&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomella|first=Andrea|title=Caravaggio: An Artist through Images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDH4lOa8qRgC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=ATS Italia Editrice|isbn=978-88-88536-62-0|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended with the painter's exile to [[Malta]] in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''Saint Jerome Writing'' is the work of Caravaggio is sometimes brought into question, as it was attributed to [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]] in the Borghese inventories from 1700 until 1893.&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"/&gt;

'''''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives''''' is a book on the [[relationship between religion and science]] by [[John Hedley Brooke]].

The book identifies three traditional views of the relationship between science and religion found in historical analyses: conflict, complementarity, and commonality.  The book portrays all three as oversimplifications. It offers up the alternative notion of complexity, which bases the relationship between science and religion on changing circumstances where it is defined upon each particular historical situation and the actual beliefs and ideas of the scientific and religious figures involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Temperley|first=HNV|title=Science and salvation|journal=Nature|volume=359|pages=685–686|doi=10.1038/359685a0|year=1992|issue=6397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''The Empty Cradle: How Falling Birthrates Threaten World Prosperity (And What To Do About It)''''' is a 2004 book by [[Phillip Longman]] of the [[New America Foundation]] about declining birthrates around the world, the challenges that Longman believes will accompany it, and strategies to overcome those challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Empty Cradle: How Falling Birthrates Threaten World Prosperity (And What To Do About It)|last = Longman|first = Phillip|authorlink = Phillip Longman|date = April 2004|accessdate = February 18, 2014|isbn = 0465050506|url = http://newamerica.net/publications/books/the_empty_cradle|publisher = [[Basic Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Media appearances and interviews===

Longman appeared in a [[National Public Radio]] program ''Talk of the Nation'' debating [[Peter Kostmayer]] about the thesis of his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1918221|title = 'The Empty Cradle' and Shrinking Birth Rates|last = Conan|first = Neal|date = June 1, 2004|accessdate = February 18, 2014|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===

[[Richard N. Cooper]] reviewed the book briefly for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', writing that Longman's concern about falling birthrates is at odds with many people's concerns about overpopulation, and also noting that Longman believed that specific government policies were responsible for the lower birthrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/60143/richard-n-cooper/the-empty-cradle-how-falling-birthrates-threaten-world-prosperit|title = The Empty Cradle: How Falling Birthrates Threaten World Prosperity and What to Do About It by Philip Longman|last = Cooper|first = Richard N.|authorlink = Richard N. Cooper|date = November–December 2004|accessdate = February 18, 2014|publisher = ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spengler reviewed the book for [[Asia Times]], concluding "The reader must fall back on his argument that faith, not pecuniary calculation, will motivate today's prospective parents. The reproductive power of an increasingly Christian United States will enhance the strategic position of the US over the next two generations, leaving infertile Western Europe to sink slowly into insignificance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FI08Aa01.html|title = Faith, fertility and American dominance: ''The Empty Cradle'' by Phillip Longman|author = Spengler|date = September 8, 2004|accessdate = February 18, 2014|publisher = [[Asia Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], reviewed the book on his personal website. He concluded: "His research is certain to spark fierce debate and spirited discussion. In the final analysis, doesn’t it make sense that those who see children as gifts from God would have more children than those who see children as economic cost units? How could anyone be surprised?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/2004/05/25/the-empty-cradle-falling-birth-rates-and-the-human-future/|title = The Empty Cradle–Falling Birth Rates and the Human Future|date = May 25, 2004|accessdate = February 18, 2014|last = Mohler|first = Albert|authorlink = Albert Mohler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Entry''''' is a 1789 cartoon that depicted [[George Washington]] riding a donkey into New York.  It was first distributed during the time of Washington's inauguration as the first president of the United States.  Many accounts say it was "hawked on the streets of the capitol".  No copies of this work have been found since at least 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Birth of the Nation: The First Federal Congress, 1789-1791 | author = Charlene Bangs Bickford, Kenneth R.

== Background ==
On April 14, 1789 Washington received official notification that he had been unanimously selected by the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] to be the first president of the United States.  Washington set off from [[Mount Vernon]] to the U.S. capital in New York City on the morning of April 16.  Washington passed through [[Alexandria, Virginia]]; [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Maryland]] (in present-day Washington D.C.); [[Baltimore]]; [[Grays Ferry, Philadelphia]]; and [[Trenton, New Jersey]], before arriving in New York on April 23.

The [[first inauguration of George Washington]] took place on April 30, 1789 on the balcony of [[Federal Hall]] in New York City.

On the seventh of April, [[John Armstrong, Sr.]] wrote to [[Horatio Gates]] regarding the lavish preparations in New York City, saying&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The republican court; or, American society in the days of Washington | author = Rufus Wilmot Griswold | authorlink = Rufus Wilmot Griswold | page = 123 | year = 1856 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AAN8036.0001.001/149?sid=95e3f6e828e116b80d4cccd93c806bc1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The home of Washington; or, Mount Vernon and its associations, historical, biographical, and pictorial | author = Benson J.

{{quote|Yet in the midst of this admiration, there are skeptics who doubt its propriety, and wits who amuse themselves at its extravagance. The first will grumble and the last will laugh, and the President should be prepared to meet the attacks of both with firmness and good nature. A caricature has already appeared called 'The Entry,' full of very disloyal and profane allusions. It represents the General mounted on an ass, and in the arms of his man Billy — Humphreys leading the Jack, and chanting hosannas and birthday odes. The following couplet proceeds from the mouth of the devil:

{{poemquote|The glorious time has come to pass 
When David shall conduct an ass.}} }}

Referring to the same letter, James Parton in ''Caricature and other comic art in all times and many lands'' (1877) refers to the couplet above as "one couplet of which was legible", and remarks that "This effort was more ill-natured than brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/caotherc00part#page/308/mode/2up | title=Caricature and other comic art in all times and many lands | publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]] | author=Parton, James | year=1877 | page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Our Country'', also published in 1877, Benson J. Lossing provided the following graphic description of the known couplet within the cartoon: 

{{quote|The Devil appeared prominent, and from his mouth issued the words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/Our_Country_vol_2/georgewas_bfb.html | title=Our Country: A Household History of the United States | publisher=Johnson &amp; Bailey | author=Lossing, Benson J. | year=1877 | location=New York | authorlink=Benson John Lossing}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 8 March 1896, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = New York Times | date = 8 March 1896 | title = Some Early American Caricatures | page = 32 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20380104/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It represented the President riding on an ass which his aid, Col. David Humphrey, was leading. Out of the latter's mouth this hosanna was issuing: "The glorious time has come to pass / When David shall conduct an ass".}}

Another record of ''The Entry'' is found in the two-volume work ''A history of American graphic humor, 1747-1938'' (1933), by English-born American art historian [[William Murrell]] and published by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/murrellw.htm | title = Murrell, William | publisher = Dictionary of Art Historians }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A history of American graphic humor, 1747-1938 | year = 1933 | page = 34 | url = https://archive.org/stream/histamer01murr#page/34/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the index, he records it as "satire, published in 1789"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/homeofwashington03loss#page/444/mode/2up |title=The home of Washington; or, Mount Vernon and its associations, historical, biographical, and pictorial |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides this description:

David Humphreys, singing doggerel verses. A fair sample of the derisive nature of the whole may be gathered from the couplet which has been preserved:

{{poemquote|The glorious time has come to pass

'''''The Geographer''''' is a painting created by Dutch artist [[Johannes Vermeer]] in 1668–1669, and is now in the collection of the [[Städelsches Kunstinstitut]] museum in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. It is closely related to Vermeer's ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'', for instance using the same model in the same dress, and has sometimes been considered a [[pendant painting]] to it. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson, C.

==Description==
[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The Astronomer'' has been considered a pendant to ''The Geographer'']]

This is one of only three paintings Vermeer signed and dated (the other two are ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'').

The geographer, dressed in a Japanese-style robe then popular among scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelock (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; is shown to be "someone excited by intellectual inquiry", with his active stance, the presence of maps, charts, a globe and books, as well as the dividers he holds in his right hand, according to Arthur Wheelock Jr. "The energy in this painting [...] is conveyed most notably through the figure's pose, the massing of objects on the left side of the composition, and the sequence of diagonal shadows on the wall to the right."&lt;ref name=awjvtcw&gt;Wheelock (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vermeer made several changes in the painting that enhance the feeling of energy in the picture: the man's head was originally in a different position to the left of where the viewer now sees it, indicating the man perhaps was looking down, rather than peering out the window; the dividers he holds in his hand were originally vertical, not horizontal; a sheet of paper was originally on the small stool at the lower right, and removing it probably made that area darker.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

Details of the man's face are slightly blurred, suggesting movement (also a feature of Vermeer's ''[[Mistress and Maid]]''), according to Serena Carr. His eyes are narrowed, perhaps squinting in the sunlight or an indication of intense thinking. Carr asserts that the painting depicts a "flash of inspiration" or even "revelation". The drawn curtain on the left and the position of the oriental carpet on the table&amp;mdash;pushed back&amp;mdash;are both symbols of revelation. "He grips a book as if he's about to snatch it up to corroborate his ideas."&lt;ref name=scvahw&gt;Cant (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt, Faust.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Faust depicted in an etching by [[Rembrandt]] (c. 1650). Faust, also a scholar, is depicted in the same pose as ''The Geographer'', although facing in roughly the opposite direction.]]

The globe was published in Amsterdam in 1618 by [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; Terrestrial and celestial globes were commonly sold together, and the celestial globe in ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' "was also a Hondius (Hendrick rather than Judocus)", another indication that the two paintings were created as pendant pieces, according to Cant. The globe is turned toward the Indian Ocean, where the [[Dutch East India Company]] was then active. Vermeer used an impasto technique to apply [[pointillé]] dots, not to indicate light reflected more strongly on certain points but to emphasize the dull ochre cartouche "frame" printed on the globe. Since the globe can be identified, we know the decorative cartouche includes a plea for information for future editions&amp;mdash;reflecting the theme of revelation in the painting.&lt;ref name=scvahw/&gt;

[[File:Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723). Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|150px|thumb|left|Vermeer's possible model, [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]], painted two decades later by [[Jan Verkolje]]]]

The cartographic objects surrounding the man are some of the actual items a geographer would have: the globe, the dividers the man holds, a cross-staff (hung on the center post of the window), used to measure the angle of celestial objects like the sun or stars, and the chart the man is using, which (according to one scholar, James A. Welu) appears to be a nautical chart on vellum. The sea chart on the wall of "all the Sea coasts of Europe" has been identified as one published by [[Willem Jansz Blaeu]]. This accuracy indicates Vermeer had a source familiar with the profession. ''The Astronomer'', which seems to form a pendant with this painting, shows a similar, sophisticated knowledge of cartographic instruments and books, and the same young man modeled for both. That man himself may have been the source of Vermeer's correct display of surveying and geographical instruments, and possibly of his knowledge of perspective.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Wheelock and others assert the model/source was probably [[Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632-1723), a contemporary of Vermeer who was also born in Delft. The families of both men were in the textile business, and both families had a strong interest in science and optics. A "microscopist", van Leeuwenhoek was described after his death as being so skilled in "navigation, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and natural science ... that one can certainly place him with the most distinguished masteres of the art." Another image of van Leeuwenhoek (by the Delft artist [[Jan Verkolje]]) about 20 years later shows a broad face and straight nose, similar to Vermeer's model. At the time Vermeer painted the two works, the scientist would have been about 36 years old. He would have been actively studying for his examination for surveyor, which he passed on February 4, 1669. There is no documentary evidence for any kind of relationship between the two men during Vermeer's lifetime, although in 1676, van Leeuwenhoek was appointed a trustee for Vermeer's estate.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The pose of the figure in Vermeer's painting "takes up precisely the position of [[Faust]] in [[Rembrandt]]'s famous etching" (although facing the opposite direction), according to [[Lawrence Gowing]]. Similar arrangements can be found in drawings by [[Nicolaes Maes]].&lt;ref&gt;Gowing (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and exhibitions==
[[File:The Geographer.jpg|thumb|150px|A less-detailed image of the painting, with more accurate coloring]]
[[File:Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelven pryzen p 242.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1720 catalog listing the work.]]
For much of the painting's early history (until 1797), it was owned together with ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'', which it strongly resembles, and the two have long been considered pendants, although their measurements are not identical. The paintings were not among the works in the Dissius sale of 1696, a collection apparently originally owned by the artist's supposed patron, [[Pieter van Ruijven]], and the earliest record of the painting is from 1713. Up until the late 18th century, they were referred to as "Astrologers". The pair were sold by an anonymous owner together in Rotterdam on April 27, 1713 (No. 10 or 11), for 300 florins (a "considerable sum", according to Wheelock). [[Hendrik Sorgh]], an art broker, may have bought the paintings at that point. They were among his effects when he died in 1720, and both were sold on March 28 of that year in Amsterdam (No. 3 or 4 in the sale; for 160 florins; described as "An Astrologer" and "a repeat"). Govert Looten, a neighbor of Sorgh at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam bought the paintings, which were sold from his estate on March 31, 1729 (this painting was No. 6 and went for 104 florins, both were described in the catalog as "sublimely and artfully painted"). Jacob Crammer Simmonsz of Amsterdam (1725-1778) owned the pair before 1778, hanging them in his home on the Prinsengracht (Simonsz also owned ''[[The Lacemaker (Vermeer)|The Lacemaker]]'' and another Vermeer, now unknown, depicting a lady pouring wine). He sold ''The Astronomer'' and ''The Geographer'' together on November 25 of that year to a Huguenot banker, Jean Etiènne Fizeaux of Amsterdam, who owned ''The Geographer'' until his death in 1780. His widow owned the work until perhaps 1785. As of 1794 it was owned by Jan Danser Nijman of Amsterdam, who sold it on August 16, 1797 to Christiaan Josi, a publisher of prints, for 133 guilders. It later was bought by Arnoud de Lange of Amsterdam. This transaction separated the two paintings. De Lange sold it on December 12, 1803 for 360 florins.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt; 

Sometime before 1821, the painting was owned by Johann Goll van Franckenstein Jr. of Velzen and Amsterdam. Pieter Hendrick Goll van Franckenstein of Amsterdam owned it before 1832, and he sold it on July 1, 1833 for 195 florins to a Nieuwenhuys. It was owned by Alexandre Dumont of Cambrai before 1860, who sold it through Thoré-Bũrger to Isaac Pereire of Paris, who owned it by 1866. It was sold on March 6, 1872. Max Kann of Paris owned the painting, perhaps that year, and it passed into the hands of Prince Demidoff of [[Demidov Collection|San Donato]], near Florence, sometime before 1877, and stayed in his hands until he sold it on March 15, 1880. A.J. Bosch sold the painting in Vienna on April 28, 1885 (for Õs 8,000) to a Kohlbacher, who sold it to the Stãdelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

The work was exhibited in the ''Exposition rétrospective, Tableaux anciens empruntés aux galeries particulières'' held at the Palais des Champs-Elysées, Paris, 1866 ; at the exhibition of ''Ouvrages de peinture exposés au profit de la colonisation de l'Algérie par les Alsaciens-Lorrains'', Palais de la Présidence du Corps législatif, Paris, 1874 ; and in the ''Vermeer, oorsprong en involved. Fabritius, de Hooch, de Witte'' exhibition at the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam, 1935.&lt;ref name=awjvtcw/&gt;

[[File:The_Making_of_the_English_Landscape_Hoskins_Penguin.jpg|thumb|upright|From 1970 onwards, [[Penguin Books]] released versions of ''The Making of the English Landscape'' in numerous reprints, alongside hardback editions from [[Hodder and Stoughton]] and other publishers.&lt;ref name="WorldCatPenguin"/&gt;]]

'''''The Making of the English Landscape''''' is a 1955 book by the English local historian [[William George Hoskins]]. It is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates, mostly photographs by Hoskins himself, and 17 maps or plans. It has appeared in at least 35 editions and reprints in English and other languages.

The book is a [[landscape history]] of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in [[local history]]. The brief history of some one thousand years is widely used in local and [[environmental history]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/environmental_history.html | title=Making History: British environmental history | publisher=History.ac.uk | year=2008 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Cooper, Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoskins defines the theme of the book in the first chapter, arguing that a landscape historian needs to use [[botany]], [[physical geography]] and [[natural history]] as well as [[history|historical]] knowledge to interpret any given scene fully. The remaining chapters describe how the English landscape was formed from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period onwards, starting c. 450 AD, and looking in detail at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape, the depopulation following the [[Black Death]], the [[Tudor period]] through to the splendour of the [[Georgian period]], the parliamentary [[enclosure]]s that affected much of the English midlands, the [[industrial revolution]], the development of road, canal, and railway transport networks, and finally the growth of towns from Norman times onwards. There is little mention of cities. The concluding chapter however laments the damage done to the English countryside by "the villainous requirements of the new age"&lt;ref name=Hoskins231/&gt; such as military airfields and arterial roads, describes the new England as barbaric, and invites the reader to contemplate the past.

The work has been widely admired, but also described as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised the book for helping them understand and interpret the landscape in which they lived.

==Book==

===Overview===

The introduction sets out Hoskins' stall with "No book exists to describe the manner in which the various landscapes of this country came to assume the shape and appearance they now have",&lt;ref name=Intro&gt;''The Making of the English Landscape'', 1955. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning geology ("only one aspect of the subject"),&lt;ref name=Intro/&gt; the clearing of woodlands, the reclaiming of moor and marsh, the creation of fields, roads, towns, country houses, mines, canals and railways: "in short, with everything that has altered the natural landscape."&lt;ref name=Intro/&gt;

===Editions and translations===

A 7th century Saxon estate boundary between the royal estate of Silverton (left) and the Exeter Abbey estate (right) was marked by a "double ditch", creating [[Devon hedge|high earth hedgebanks]] on both sides.]]

The first edition was published by [[Hodder and Stoughton]] in 1955. They reprinted the book in 1956, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1974, 1977. They issued a new edition in 1988, a revised edition in 1992, &lt;!--more here? - couldn't find any--&gt; and a new edition in 2005, reissued in 2006. They published Korean and Japanese editions in 2008.&lt;ref name="WorldCatEditions"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of the English Landscape|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/making-of-english-landscape/oclc/914889796/editions?cookie=&amp;start_edition=1&amp;sd=desc&amp;se=yr&amp;referer=br&amp;qt=show_more_yr%3A&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq=&amp;fc=yr%3A_25|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, [[Penguin Books]] published a paperback Pelican edition in England and a Penguin edition in the United States. Penguin reprinted in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1991, &lt;!--more here? - couldn't find any--&gt; and 2005.&lt;ref name="WorldCatPenguin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoskins The Making of the English Landscape Penguin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=hoskins+The+making+of+the+English+landscape+Penguin&amp;qt=owc_search|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Book Club Associates]] published an edition in England.

In 1988, [[Coronet Books]] and Guild Publishers published editions in England.

In 1992, [[Teach Yourself Books]] published a paperback edition in England.

In 2005, the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in England.

In 2013, Little Toller books published a paperback edition in England.

===Illustrations===

The book is illustrated with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited except for some use of [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 is accompanied by a pair of diagrams showing how a [[sunken lane|holloway]] ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the middle distance.

The book covers its subject in 10 chapters:

[[File:The Malvern Hills - geograph.org.uk - 1456678.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The [[Malvern Hills]] above the [[Severn]] plain of the English West Midlands]]

Hoskins uses the first few pages of this chapter as an introduction, beginning with praise for [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[A Guide through the District of the Lakes]]'' (1810), and from which he quotes a passage in which the reader is asked to envisage "an image of the tides visiting and revisiting the friths, the main sea dashing against the bolder shore".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p17&lt;/ref&gt; Hoskins writes that on a desolate moor one can feel oneself imaginatively back in time to the [[Bronze Age]], but that there are now few such unaltered places left. He argues that the landscape historian "needs to be a [[botanist]], a [[physical geography|physical geographer]], and a [[naturalist]], as well as an historian"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p19&lt;/ref&gt; to understand a scene in full:

{{quote|For what a many-sided pleasure there is in looking at a wide view anywhere in England, not simply as a sun-drenched whole, fading into unknown blue distances, like the view of the West Midland plain from the top of the [[Malvern Hills]], or at a pleasant rural miniature like the crumpled [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] ridge in homely [[Bedfordshire]]; but in recognizing every one of its details name by name, in knowing how and when each came to be there, why it is just that colour, shape, or size, and not otherwise, and in seeing how the various [[patterns in nature|patterns]] and parts fit together to make the whole scene.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. pp19–20&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rest of the chapter covers [[Prehistoric Britain|Pre-Roman]], Western (i.e. [[Celts|Celtic]]) and [[Roman Britain]]. He estimates very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as arable or grassland in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914.

===2. The English Settlement===
[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The method of ploughing the fields created a distinctive [[ridge and furrow]] pattern in [[open field system]] farming. The outlines of the [[mediaeval]] strips of cultivation, called selions, are still clearly visible in these now enclosed fields at [[Wood Stanway]], Gloucestershire.]]

Hoskins describes how England was settled with [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making the country a land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The [[Viking Britain|Scandinavian]] conquest of much of England from the late 9th century added more villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.

Many English villages were given their shape in this period, and almost all are described in some detail in the eleventh century [[Domesday Book]]. Hoskins identifies three major types of village: those around a green or central square, as at [[Finchingfield]] in Essex; those along a single street, like [[Henley in Arden]] in Warwickshire; and those consisting of apparently haphazardly scattered dwellings, like [[Barton, Oxfordshire|Middle Barton]] near Hoskins's home in Oxfordshire.

===3. The Colonization of Mediaeval England===

This chapter looks at the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] landscape from the [[Domesday Book]] onwards, with the section 'The Landscape in 1086'. The country had almost every village that exists today; a typical one, Hoskins writes, had a small [[watermill]] and a church without a spire.

In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins argues that before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, but most of the woods were cleared for arable or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.

Hoskins begins the section on 'Marsh, Fen, and Moor' with the words "There are certain sheets of the one-inch Ordnance Survey maps which one can sit down and read like a book for an hour on end, with growing pleasure and imaginative excitement".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p95&lt;/ref&gt; One such section is of [[The Wash]], rich in mediaeval detail. Marshes such as those in [[Lincolnshire]], Norfolk and the [[Pevensey Levels]] were reclaimed at this time, whole communities working together, often under the [[Danelaw]].

[[File:South Middleton deserted village - geograph.org.uk - 388966.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|South Middleton, a [[deserted village]] in Northumberland]]

'Buildings in the landscape' briefly describes abbeys, churches, mills, bridges and castles built to serve the growing population, which just before the Black Death had tripled since Domesday.

===4. The Black Death and after===

Hoskins describes the [[abandoned village|abandonment of villages]] from the [[bubonic plague]] of 1348, the [[Black Death]], which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the [[Breckland]] of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as [[Leicestershire]] were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in [[Gloucestershire]] can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.

Between 1350 and 1500, many new buildings appeared, especially churches with towers like [[Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay|Fotheringhay]] in Northamptonshire. Some fine bridges as at [[Wadebridge]] in Cornwall are from this period.

===5. Tudor to Georgian England===
[[File:Front of Burghley House 2009.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The façade of [[Burghley House]], built between 1558 and 1587]]

Hoskins starts this chapter by observing that in 1500 in [[Tudor period|Tudor times]] there were roughly three sheep for every human being in England, perhaps 8 million sheep to two and a half million people. There were four million acres of hardwood forest, remembered now as [[Epping Forest]], the [[Forest of Arden]], [[Sherwood Forest]], the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Wychwood]] and many others. A village might be surrounded by a single enormous thousand acre field, shared amongst all the village's farmers. There were extensive heaths and wild places, largely uninhabited, with "no industrial smoke, nothing faster on the roads than a horse, no incessant noises from the sky".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p139&lt;/ref&gt; The first enclosures and the flowering of rural England, country houses and parks such as the magnificent [[Burghley House]] and [[Knole]] date from this period up to [[Georgian period|Georgian times]].

===6. Parliamentary Enclosure and the Landscape===
[[File:Canterbury Orchards 1945 OS Map 171 detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Orchards]] around [[Canterbury, Kent]] in the 'Garden of England' on 1945 one-inch [[Ordnance Survey]] map. Some fields and orchards appear to have been enclosed directly from the woods to the west of the town in [[mediaeval]] times. The network of [[Roman road]]s to the town had been joined by a network of five railway lines.]]

In this chapter Hoskins describes the effects of enclosure on the landscape and on fields, hedgerows and trees, roads and farmhouses. He begins by quoting the rural poet [[John Clare]]: "Inclosure, thou'rt a curse upon the land, and tasteless was the wretch who thy existence plann'd".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p177&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary enclosures accounted for about 4.5 million acres of what had been open fields, not counting the enclosure of [[common land]] and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; by the end of the enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as [[Derbyshire]], straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick [[Victorian era|Victorian]] ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.

===7. The Industrial Revolution and the Landscape===

Hoskins begins his chapter on [[Industrial revolution|industrialisation]] with the remark "England was still a peaceful agricultural country at the beginning of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p211&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the early industrial landscape, water power and early mills, steam power and slums. He names transformative inventions such as Kay's [[flying shuttle]] of 1733 and Hargreaves's [[spinning jenny]] of 1767, and comments that Matthew Boulton opened his [[steam engine]] factory "in the still unravished country"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p215&lt;/ref&gt; outside Birmingham in 1765. He quotes a poem by [[Anna Seward]] lamenting the ravishing of [[Coalbrookdale]], c. 1785, and one by Wordsworth from ''The Excursion''. He is critical of the industrial slums and the smoke and dirt of the [[Staffordshire Potteries]]. He emphasises the rapid growth of industrial towns like [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], and of new towns like [[Middlesbrough]], which went from a single farm in 1830 to over 50,000 inhabitants in 1880. However he appreciates the mining landscapes of [[Cornwall]], including the gleaming white [[china clay]] pits of [[St Austell]] and the abandoned tin mines of [[St Cleer]], commenting that "there is a point, as [[Arthur Young (agriculturist)|Arthur Young]] saw, when industrial ugliness becomes [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p232&lt;/ref&gt;

===8. Roads, Canals, and Railways===
[[Image:Canal boats at Stourport Basin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The canal basin at [[Stourport]], the only town in England to be created by [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canals]], according to Hoskins]]

Hoskins describes roads and trackways from the Iron Age (like the [[Jurassic Way]] across the midlands, near his Oxfordshire home) and Roman times (like [[Akeman Street]] in the same area). He notes that the [[Fosse Way]] runs for miles in Gloucestershire away from any village, as the Anglo-Saxons built villages away from large roads for safety. Still in his home area, he records that "the wide green track now called Dornford Lane"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p240&lt;/ref&gt; was built in the 10th century for supplies to be carted from the Anglo-Saxon kings' own estate at &lt;!--Westcott, Middle and Steeple--&gt;Barton. He goes on to describe the building of the [[Canals in the United Kingdom|canal network]] between roughly 1760 and 1825, noting that just one town was created by the canals, [[Stourport]]. Soon afterwards, a much more widespread transport network transformed the English landscape: the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railways]]. Hoskins devotes over a page to each of two quotations from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', describing the construction in 1836 of a railway in [[Camden Town]]. He mentions, too, that Wordsworth campaigned against the railway from [[Kendal]] to [[Windermere]], bringing trains into the heart of the Lake District, and that conservatives like Wordsworth "lost all along the line".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p263&lt;/ref&gt;

===9. The Landscape of Towns===
[[File:Marlborough Centre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The main street in the former [[market town]] of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire]] is exceptionally wide, probably made, argues Hoskins, to hold the once regular sheep market.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p291&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the houses were rebuilt in brick or refronted with tiles in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66528 | title=The Borough of Marlborough | publisher=British History Online | year=1983 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Crowley, D. A. (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The last chapter of the body of the book – if Chapter 10 is considered more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding [[town]]s brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the [[market town]]. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, [[Abbot Baldwin]] planning [[Bury St Edmunds]] between 1066 and 1086; [[Stratford-on-Avon]] was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the [[spa town]]s in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and [[Barrow-in-Furness]] in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]] grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1970. p280&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the [[market town]]s like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number of shapes.

===10. The Landscape Today===
Hoskins concludes with a brief chapter, with one image, Plate 82, "The completed English landscape" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at [[Steeple Barton]].

==Reception==

===Contemporary===

The geographer [[E. G. R. Taylor]], reviewing the book for the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1955, wrote that Hoskins made the case for getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to [[Dudley Stamp]]'s ''Man and the Land'', published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of [[urban geography]]. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past",&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; where, she wrote, he "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'"&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1791761 | title=The English Scene: Review | author=Taylor, E. G. R. | journal=The Geographical Journal |date=December 1955  | volume=121 | issue=4 | pages=511–513 | doi=10.2307/1791761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===

[[Penelope Lively]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the book as

{{quote|a marvellous, robust, opinionated account of the landscape as narrative, whether rural or urban, the visible record of what has gone before, once you know how to read it – or once he has told you how. You were to put on your walking boots and understand the country in which you lived. Plenty did, or tried to; I did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/hero-wg-hoskins-penelope-lively | title=My Hero: WG Hoskins by Penelope Lively | work=The Guardian | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Lively, Penelope}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], also in ''The Guardian'', described the book as "an absolute trailblazer, a revolution."&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/rereading-making-english-landscape | title=William Boyd: rereading The Making of the English Landscape by WG Hoskins | work=The Guardian | date=11 May 2013 | accessdate=26 May 2014 | author=Boyd, William}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that [[W. H. Auden]] "revered" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to 'read' a landscape as a "historical [[palimpsest]]":&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;

{{quote|The familiar English countryside, in whatever regional variation, became a form of historical palimpsest – its evolving history there to be decoded and discerned for those who could look at it through the innovative lens that Hoskins provided. It was as if the landscape was all of a sudden an archaeological dig – hills and dales, woods and copses, fields and rivers, villages and roads ceased to be simple features of a view. Instead the whole history of English humankind and husbandry was on display, from the Holocene age to the latest horrors of agribusiness. And the book in which that history was written was the very land itself.&lt;ref name=Boyd/&gt;}}

Local historian Graeme White, in ''The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540'', calls Hoskins' book "brilliantly-crafted" and observes that "Although this famously railed against the 'England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil' – along with much else belonging to the mid-twentieth century – the fact that national car ownership more than doubled during the 1950s made this a subject whose time had come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmnwVXGZNC8C | title=The Medieval English Landscape, 1400–1540 | publisher=A&amp;C Black | author=White, Graeme J. | year=2012 | pages=Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'', said that the book "was for me an eye-opener, as it was for many people. It told us of the extent to which our landscape had been made by man, not God, and taught us to look much more observantly at it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/6050223/not-every-aspect-pleases/ | title=Not every aspect pleases | work=The Spectator | date=2 June 2010 | accessdate=27 May 2014 | author=Johnson, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===An assessment===

Matthew H. Johnson, writing a chapter on English culture and landscape in the edited book ''The Public Value of the Humanities'', identifies "six key points" established by Hoskins:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.bloomsburycollections.com/book/the-public-value-of-the-humanities/ch9-making-a-home | title=Chapter 9.

:1. The landscape is of great antiquity ("everything is much older than we think"&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, 1955. p 12&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:2. Landscapes often changed suddenly, as in the 18th century enclosures.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:3. Hoskins, following [[O. G. S. Crawford]]'s 1953 ''Archaeology in the Field'', stressed we had to read the landscape using research to reveal its cultural value.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:4. Hoskins thus told a "grand and emotive story about that landscape."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Johnson compares this to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s account in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when the [[hobbit]]s return to a "despoiled and industrialized landscape of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]]".&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:5. The narrative is [[populism|populist]], to be disseminated "to anyone who would listen."&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; The result was that it became part of English post-war culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:6. It was "openly anti-[[modernist]]". In evidence, Johnson cites Hoskins's "most famous passage" from the concluding chapter:&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

:{{quote|What else has happened in the immemorial landscape of the English countryside? Airfields have flayed it bare … Poor devastated Lincolnshire and Suffolk! And those long gentle lines of the dip-slope of the Cotswolds, those misty uplands of the sheep-grey oolite, how they have lent themselves to the villainous requirements of the new age! Over them drones, day after day, the obscene shape of the atom-bomber, laying a trail like a filthy slug upon Constable's and Gainsborough's sky. England of the [[Nissen hut|Nissen-hut]], the "[[Prefabs in the UK|pre-fab]]", and the electric fence, of the high barbed wire around some unmentionable devilment; England of the arterial by-pass, treeless and stinking of diesel oil, murderous with lorries; England of the bombing-range wherever there was once silence … Barbaric England of the scientists, the military men, and the politicians; let us turn away and contemplate the past before all is lost to the vandals.|W.G. Hoskins, ''The Making of the English Landscape'', Chapter 10.&lt;ref name=Hoskins231&gt;Hoskins, 1955. pp231–2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Television==
In 1972 the BBC broadcast an episode of the television programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' on ''The Making of the English Landscape'' produced by Peter Jones, and featuring Hoskins as presenter.&lt;ref name="Hoskins, W.

'''''Veritas: The Quest''''' is a [[television]] program that aired in 2003. It follows a rebellious but intelligent teenager, Nikko Zond, discovering that his father Solomon's profession is much more mystical and adventurous than he previously thought.  Solomon and his team (dubbed "Veritas," Latin for "truth") search for the answers to some of the world's mysteries, a quest began because of the mysterious disappearance of Nikko's mother during an archaeological dig. Thus begins Nikko's fantastical journey into an [[Indiana Jones]]-style adventure with his father and his colleagues in trying to follow in his mother's footsteps to discover what strange secrets she was uncovering.  The series was cancelled in the [[United States]] by ABC with only four episodes being aired. All thirteen produced episodes aired on [[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Sci Fi Channel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], on Rai 2 and Rai 4 in Italy, and [[Canal Sony]] (formerly known as Sony Entertainment Television).

This was the first program where [[Cobie Smulders]] had a series regular role, and notable guest stars included [[Liz Vassey]], [[Carlo Rota]], [[Roger Rees]], and [[Eli Wallach]].

==Plot==
{{Original research|date=May 2008}}
The main protagonist of the series is Nikko Zond, a young teen, whose father is involved in many different archaeological expeditions ranging from Antarctica to harsh deserts. Nikko is at first reluctant to participate in many of the adventures, but throughout the series, it would appear that there is a hidden destiny for Nikko.

In the episode "Skulls," a mysterious figure ([[Conrad Dunn]]) appears out of nowhere, whom only Nikko can see, and guides Nikko. The episode ends with a crystal skull that is central to the plot of the episode modelled to reveal what someone would look like with skin and muscle added to that skull. The image formed matches the mysterious man who helped Nikko.

In the episode "Eternal," Nikko is poisoned and the only cure is for him to drink water that heals, and assures eternal life. While it is unknown if he gained eternal life or not, he did heal.

In the final episode, he suffered from hallucinations that led him to find a fragment of an artifact called the "Ring of Truth". Before the episode ends, he has another hallucination that reveals that the fragment of the "Ring" also joins together with another fragment that his father had acquired earlier in the series. The episode ends with Nikko displaying telekinetic powers:  when he reaches for his soda, it slides across the table into his hand.

[[File:Theosophist01.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Cover of a magazine ''[[The Theosophist]],'' Bombay.&lt;/center&gt;]]
"'''What Are The Theosophists?'''" is an editorial published in October 1879 in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' It was compiled by [[Helena Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|''The Theosophist,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 5–7.{{sfn|Index}}}} and it was included the 2nd volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1967}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Accusations and accusers ===
Arnold Kalnitsky wrote in his thesis{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003a}} that in this article "we find a rather expansive statement of... [Blavatsky's] thoughts at that moment about the status of the movement, the [[Theosophical Society]], its objectives, and the issues it was confronting." He wrote that the article begins with a question whether the Theosophists "are they what they claim to be": researchers of the laws of nature, ancient and modern [[philosophy]], and [[science]].{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=65}} Blavatsky asks: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Are they [[Deism|Deists]], [[Atheism|Atheists]], [[Scientific socialism|Socialists]], [[Materialism|Materialists]], or [[Idealism|Idealists]]; or are they but a schism of modern [[Spiritualism]],—mere visionaries?"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thesis author has written that author of the article lists some of the allegations brought against the Theosophical movement, and calls several accusers of the Theosophists. This is the "miracle-working;" and a work as "spies of an autocratic Czar;" and propaganda of socialist and nihilistic doctrines; and collusion "with the French Jesuits" to discredit modern Spiritualism for money. The American [[Positivism|Positivists]] call the Theosophists with dreamers, the New York journalists call them [[Fetishism|fetishists]], the Spiritualists say they are revivers of superstitions, the servants of the Christian Church call them unbelieving messengers of Satan, professor [[William Benjamin Carpenter|Carpenter]] argues that they are silly and gullible persons, and some of their Hindu opponents have accused them "with the employment of ''demons'' to perform certain [[Paranormal|phenomena]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}} Kalnitsky has quoted her assessment of all this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One fact stands conspicuous—the [[Theosophical Society|Society]], its members, and their views, are deemed of enough importance to be discussed and denounced: ''Men slander only those whom they hate—or fear''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Support of friends ===
[[File:Helena Blavatsky in India.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row]], Bawaji, and [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]].{{refn|group=note|A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] stated: "Blavatsky suddenly found around herself people with ardent hearts, who were sufficiently educated, honest and unselfish. Their indifference to material benefits, the lack of claims to working conditions, and patriotic aspirations remarkably corresponded to hers demands for new activists of the Theosophical movement from the Indians."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=349}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Kalnitsky wrote that Blavatsky, having characterized the opponents of the movement at first, then notes that Theosophy, to a certain extent, relies on "public support and respect." In his opinion, she tries to create the impression that there is an equal ratio between the supporters and opponents of Theosophists: "But, if the Society has had its enemies and traducers, it has also had its friends and advocates. For every word of censure, there has been a word of praise."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|Alexander Senkevich wrote, "Already in the first months of her stay in India, Blavatsky received an unusually warm greeting from [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], editor of [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']], an influential daily English newspaper, the mouthpiece of the British government in India."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=335}} According to [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]], Sinnett is the "main authority for the events of the Indian period in Madame Blavatsky's life."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=80}}}} Kalnitsky wrote to show the presence of a positive attitude towards the Theosophists, Blavatsky refers to the "exponential growth of membership" in the Theosophical Society and to the expansion of its geography. As examples of the recognition of Theosophy as a serious undertaking, she speaks of an alliance, albeit "short-lived", with the Indian Society of [[Arya Samaj]],{{refn|group=note|The leader of this Society [[Swami]] [[Dayananda Saraswati|Dayananda]] supported "the idea of [[Henry Olcott]] to establish branches of the Theosophical Society throughout India."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=344}}}} and of the fraternal connection with the Ceylon [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].{{refn|group=note|Olcott and Blavatsky, who received the US citizenship previously, were the first Americans who were converted in 1880 to [[Buddhism]] in the traditional sense.{{sfn|Prebish, Tanaka|1998|p=198}}}} Accordung to this thesis, partial acceptance of the Theosophical doctrine by [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] organizations was an important factor in the propaganda of the movement demonstrated that it really is "something tangible and legitimate", which is embodying the beliefs represented in the eastern traditions of ancient India.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=66}}{{refn|group=note|Peter Washington wrote: "Perhaps Blavatsky knew that scandal is as good a way as any to make a mark on the public mind. It certainly seems to have worked in her case, in so far as the Theosophical Society prospered, despite the disillusionment of individuals such as [[A. O. Hume|Hume]]."{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=65}} Alexander Senkevich stated: "By the summer of 1879, many wealthy Indians had joined the Theosophical Society. For example, Shishir Babu, publisher and editor of the Calcutta newspaper ''Amrita Bazar Patrika'', as well as the rajah of the principality Bhavnagar."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=354}}}} Kalnitsky has quoted the article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"None is older than she in esoteric wisdom and civilization, however fallen may be her poor shadow—modern India. Holding this country, as we do, for the fruitful hot-bed whence proceeded all subsequent philosophical systems, to this source of all psychology and philosophy a portion of our Society has come to learn its ancient wisdom and ask for the impartation of its weird secrets."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=66–7}}{{refn|group=note|John Driscoll wrote: "India is the home of all theosophic speculation. Oltramere says that the directive idea of Hindu civilization is theosophic. Its development covers a great many ages, each represented in Indian religious literature. There are formed the basic principles of theosophy."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=626}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Free researchers ===
{{See also|Theosophy and science#Theosophists-scientists}}
In his thesis Kalnitsky cited a passage where Blavatsky explains that the Theosophical Society is completely free from personal preferences and "sectarian" interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Having no accepted [[creed]], our Society is very ready to give and take, to learn and teach, by practical experimentation, as opposed to mere passive and credulous acceptance of enforced dogma. It is willing to accept every result claimed by any of the foregoing schools or systems that can be logically and experimentally demonstrated. Conversely, it can take nothing on mere faith, no matter by whom the demand may be made."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thesis author commented that this idealized position of Blavatsky should "lead the reader" to the conclusion that the Theosophical Society is an "equivalent" of a scientific research organization, where the main criterion is "logic and experimental verification", not dogma and blind faith. There is here no definite desire to uncompromisingly replace the purely intellectual and rationalist approach with an orientation only to something "[[spirit]]ual and [[paranormal]]". It is assumed that the [[Mysticism|mystical]] and [[occult]] positions of Theosophy can "ultimately be verified and confirmed" by methods acceptable to "the foregoing schools or systems". Kalnitsky noted that the article author seeks to destroy the authority of the "dogmatic, rationalistic and materialistic" worldviews. She believes that the "contents of knowledge" obtained through esoteric methods are "fully capable" of satisfying the empirical and logical "standards of verifiability." Author of the article reminds the reader that many members of the Society belong to different races and nationalities, have different education and faith, but interest in "magic, spiritualism, mesmerism, occultism" is the basis for bringing together people who are sympathetic to Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar Tim Rudbøg wrote that in this article Blavatsky "briefly mentioned the study of occult phenomena".{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=127}}}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] stated that the Theosophical Society is not a church or religious institution in the usual sense: "Many theosophists, including myself, are also members of a church or other religious organizations. Theosophists include [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and others."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=205}}}} Thesis author wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, even some supporters of the theoretical materialism can be accepted as members of the Society if they are sufficiently objective to recognize that "spiritual principles" can actually abolish the "limited conceptions of orthodox science." Nevertheless, in the Society there can be no place for atheists or fanatical sectarians of any religion.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=69}} An Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the genuine Theosophists should have faith in the intangible, omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible Cause, which "is '''All''', and '''Nothing'''; ubiquitous yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}

Blavatsky believes that "the very fact of a man's joining it proves that he is in search of the final truth as to the ultimate essence of things" and that the very character of the idea of the Theosophical Society consists in the "free and fearless investigation."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=70}}{{refn|group=note|Professor Shabanova has quoted from the article the description of Theosophy, "Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself—the very essence of philosophical and theistic enquiry."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}}} Kalnitsky and Shabanova have quoted the article as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will, we think, be seen now, that whether classed as [[Theism|Theists]], [[Pantheism|Pantheists]] or Atheists, such men are near kinsmen to the rest. Be what he may, once that a student abandons the old and trodden highway of routine, and enters upon the solitary path of independent thought—Godward—he is a Theosophist; an original thinker, a seeker after the eternal truth with 'an inspiration of his own' to solve the universal problems."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=70|Шабанова|2016|3p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The article author explains that charter of the Theosophical Society was written in the image and likeness of the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], the country where it was born. She writes that "the Society, modelled upon this Constitution, may fairly be termed a 'Republic of Conscience'."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=72|Rudbøg|2012|3p=440}}

Kalnitsky wrote that Blavatsky assigns to Theosophy a special supreme status, which does not depend on any misconduct committed by "individual members of the organization." She believes that the Theosophical Society is "potentially a more effective institution" than any scientific or religious organization. "Unlike sectarian religions," Theosophy is not obsessed with differences, because it is based on the "principle of universal brotherhood." Ultimately, the Theosophical ideals and goals surpass any "existing ideologies and social movements." Therefore, Theosophy stands for a voluntarily accepted and approved "spiritual orientation." Thus, according to the Theosophical view, universal brotherhood must become the "logical and inevitable result" of life. Kalnitsky noted that, according to the article author, all modern social positions are unsatisfactory and limited, based "on partial and incomplete" ideas and beliefs that do not have genuine "spiritual legitimacy."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=73}} He quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unconcerned about politics; hostile to the insane dreams of [[Socialism]] and of [[Communism]], which it abhors—as both are but disguised conspiracies of brutal force and sluggishness against honest labour; the Society cares but little about the outward human management of the material world. The whole of its aspirations are directed towards the occult truths of the visible and [[Plane (esotericism)|invisible worlds]]. Whether the physical man be under the rule of an empire or a republic, concerns only the man of matter. His body may be enslaved; as to his [[Soul]], he has the right to give to his rulers the proud answer of [[Socrates]] to his judges. They have no sway over the ''inner'' man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=73}}{{refn|group=note|Also Tim Rudbøg wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "The Theosophical Society is not concerned with any political conviction, such as socialism or communism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Rudbøg|2012|2pp=122, 434–5}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theoretically, Theosophy was allegedly apolitical, as Kalnitsky noted, and did not concern external human control in "the material world." This was the official course, "motivated by the ideal of spiritual priorities" that went beyond the worldly worries. Although in fact, the persons involved in the Theosophical movement often had different opinions on specific problems. For example, the English and the German Theosophists occupied completely "different positions on the  occult significance" of the events of the [[World War I|First World War]]. However, Blavatsky believed that the true Theosophist should be separated "from the mainstream" of social activity and related ambitions.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=74}}{{refn|group=note|Tim Rudbøg stated, "Several Theosophists did however become greatly involved in politics."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=122}}}} Kalnitsky cited hers words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The true student has ever been a recluse, a man of silence and [[meditation]]. With the busy world his habits and tastes are so little in common that, while he is studying, his enemies and slanderers have undisturbed opportunities. But time cures all and lies are but ephemera. Truth alone is eternal."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky believes that a true researcher is a recluse who does not pay attention to "his enemies and slanderers" who belonging to the busy world. Nevertheless, not all researchers need to be represented this way. She mentions the contribution of some members of the Society to science, in particular to "biology and psychology", and the fact that there must be a "diversity in opinion" in science. In an attempt to explain the contradictory public statements made by the Theosophists, "she notes that even great Theosophical thinkers" can sometimes make mistakes and make unsuccessful comments. Such misses "may tarnish their reputations," but this do not detract from their efforts. The desire to change the usual ways of thinking requires the collective action of those who are ready to challenge the current situation and promote a more attractive and "believable alternative system of truth."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=74–5}} In conclusion, the article author writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attainment of these objects, all agree, can best be secured by convincing the reason and warming the enthusiasm of the generation of fresh young minds, that are just ripening into maturity, and making ready to take the place of their prejudiced and conservative fathers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophists as criticism object ==
Peter Washington stated that ideas of the Theosophical Society had often attracted all sorts of neurotics, hysterics and even madmen:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All organisations which depend on enthusiasm and opposition to conventional opinion suffer from this problem to some degree; Theosophy appears to have been especially prone to it. The permanent residents at Adyar during the 1880s and '90s were typical. A quarrelsome collection of minor English aristocrats, rich American widows, German professors, Indian mystics and hangerson of every description, they were all eager to have their say, especially during [[Henry Olcott|Olcott's]] prolonged absences, and all ready to quarrel with one another."{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|Alexander Senkevich wrote, "Blavatsky was constantly surrounded by all kinds of riff-raff."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=392}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''What The--?!''''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] series self-parodying the [[Marvel Universe]], similar in vein to the 1960s series ''[[Not Brand Echh]]''. It was billed as "The Marvel mag of mirth and mayhem!" The series ran for 26 issues from August 1988 through Winter 1993, with issue #26 being a "Fall Special". It typically contained a series of short stories with comedic takes on Marvel heroes and villains, such as having [[Spider-Ham]] substitute for [[Spider-Man]].

==Concept==
''What The--?!'' spotlighted some of the top artists and writers at the time. Many, such as [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], contributed works that spoof some of their all-time greatest successes. For example, in issue #2, Byrne creates a tale pitting his work on the [[Fantastic Four]] franchise against his work with [[Superman]]. The issue goes so far as to have the [[Lex Luthor]] character complain about the changes Byrne made to the Superman legend after [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

Though it carried the Marvel Comics label on the front left corner, ''What The--?!'' touted itself as being published by "Marble Comics". ''What The--?!'' parodied Marvel institutions such as the legendary Marvel Comics fan mail page, with staged articles called "The Marble Mailbag" and the "What The... Mail". The title also did not contain any "true" advertisements. Instead, ''What The--?!'' hosted a number of fake advertisements that made fun of classic comic book advertisements such as [[Charles Atlas]], novelty by-mail companies, and the [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]] snack food ads of the 1970s and 1980s.

==History==
''What The--?!'' was originally published as a four-issue limited series. The last issue closed with an appeal from [[Fred Hembeck]] for readers to write to Marvel if they wanted to see more of the comic. Several months later, ''What The--?!'' returned, resuming its numbering at issue #5. Marvel.com has a web series called "[[Marvel Superheroes: What the--?!]]", mainly featuring [[MODOK]] and [[Deadpool]].

'''Xochicalco''' ({{IPA-nah|ʃot͡ʃiˈkaɬko|-|Xochikalko.ogg}}) is a [[pre-Columbian]] archaeological site in [[Miacatlán Municipality]] in the western part of the [[Mexican state]] of [[Morelos]]. The name ''Xochicalco'' may be translated from [[Nahuatl]] as "in the house of Flowers". The site is located 38&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Cuernavaca]], about 76 miles by road from [[Mexico City]]. The site is open to visitors all week, from 10&amp;nbsp;am to 5&amp;nbsp;pm, although access to the observatory is only allowed after noon. The apogee of Xochicalco came after the fall of [[Teotihuacan]] and it has been speculated that Xochicalco may have played a part in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.

The [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]] and [[iconography]] of Xochicalco show affinities with Teotihuacan, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area, and the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] culture of the [[Toluca Valley]]. Today the residents of the nearby village of [[Cuentepec]] speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]].

The main ceremonial center is atop an artificially leveled hill, with remains of residential structures, mostly unexcavated, on long terraces covering the slopes. The site was first occupied by 200 BC, but did not develop into an urban center until the Epiclassic period (AD 700 – 900). Nearly all the standing architecture at the site was built at this time. At its peak, the city may have had a population of up to 20,000 people.

==Monuments==
[[Image:Mexico xochicalco ballgame.JPG|thumb|left|The primary ballcourt at Xochicalco.]]
Of special interest are sculptured reliefs on the sides of some buildings. The Temple of the [[Feathered Serpent]] has fine stylized depictions of that deity in a style which includes apparent influences of [[Teotihuacan]] and Maya art.  The high taluds of the pyramid bear relief carvings that depict towns that paid tribute to Xochicalco as well as several seated figures that look Mayan.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Dean R. "Archaeology of Native North America." Prentice Hall, New York: 2010. p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Xochicalco may have had a community of artists from other parts of [[Mesoamerica]].

Other monuments at the site include several other step-pyramid temples, palaces, three [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]], sweat-baths, an unusual row of circular altars, and a cave with steps carved down into it. The site also has some free-standing sculptured stelae; others were removed from their original location and are now on display in the [[National Institute of Anthropology and History|INAH]] museum in Mexico City and at the site museum.

==History and Exploration==
Xochicalco was founded in about 650 AD by the Olmeca-Xicallanca, which are a Mayan group of traders from Campeche, at a site that gave them an excellent position along several of the major Mesoamerican trade routes. The city-state had a population of 10,000 to 15,000 people, many of whom were engaged in craft production and long-distance trade. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean|title=Archaeology of Native North America|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River|pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an important fortressed commercial and religious center following the decline of the great Meso-American city states. The poor farming conditions in the area show that it was likely built for defense purposes and trading. The ruins were first described by explorer Antonio Alzate in 1777. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] published illustrations and a description of Xochicalco in 1810. Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico]] visited the ruins. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent was restored by Mexican archaeologist [[Leopoldo Batres]] in 1910. Major archaeological excavations and further restorations were done in a project from the 1940s through the 1960s by Eduardo Noguera and César Saenz. Jaime Litvak King also worked at the site. In 1976 archaeologist Kenneth Hirth of Pennsylvania State University began a multi-season fieldwork project in which he mapped the entire site and conducted excavations of houses and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] workshops. In 1988 a large-scale program of excavation of monumental architecture was initiated by Norberto González Crespo and Silvia Garza of the INAH. A new museum was built to house the spectacular finds of this project.

==Destruction of the city==
[[File:Xochicalcotempleofinscriptions.jpg|thumb|300px|Temple of the Feather Serpent]]
At some point around AD 900 the city of Xochicalco was burned and destroyed. Many of the excavated houses and temples have layers of burning and destruction that cover the deposits from the main Epiclassic occupation. Underneath destruction layers, numerous objects were left in place in the houses, indicating that the site was destroyed and abandoned quickly. A small remnant population lived on, however, on the lower slopes of the hill. Later, around 1200, the site was recolonized by the Nahuatl-speaking Tlahuica peoples, ancestors to the Nahuatl-speaking populations of the modern state of [[Morelos]].

Xochicalco is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] and a tourist destination. The site also has a well-stocked museum.

==Astronomical observatory==
The observatory is a cave modified to allow study of the movement of the sun. The cave was covered with stucco and painted black, yellow and red with a chimney that measured from the base to the surface 8.7 meters, and which is hexagonal in the top. The chimney has a slight slope allowing the sun's rays to be to projected on the floor of the cave.

In the 105 days running from 30 April to 15 August, the sun shines into the cave. In the sun's movement towards the Tropic of Cancer and upon their return, respectively, on 14/15 May and 28/29 July, the sun is at its zenith and the astronomical noon, the beam of light falls directly through the chimney showing the image of the sun on the floor of the cave. Surely, taking advantage of the solar phenomenon, the site was also used for religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/xochicalco/indice.htm |title=INAH National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico |accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=INAH |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080525095707/http://www.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/xochicalco/indice.htm |archivedate = 25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
